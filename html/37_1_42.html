bill.  It is very simple.  It is directed to Industry Canada so I 
am pleased that the minister is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes that we move toward a national standard for 
dates, all-numeric dates, to avoid confusion, particularly in 
this computer age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system that I suggest, and the one supported by the 
International Organization for Standardization, is that the order 
be year, month and day.  Today, for example, is 01/04/03.  If we 
all kept to this standard there would be no confusion in our 
hydro bills, natural gas bills, or on our driver's licence.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL INQUIRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call for the 
establishment of an independent judicial inquiry to 
determine if the Prime Minister is in breach of conflict of 
interest rules regarding his involvement with the Grand- 
Mère Golf Club and the Grand-Mère Inn; and that the inquiry 
should have broad terms of reference with the power to 
subpoena all relevant documents and witnesses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate that I will be 
splitting my time with the member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on this supply day motion that the House call for 
an independent judicial inquiry into the various business 
dealings of the Prime Minister that unfortunately have come to be 
known, in a negative light, as Shawinigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, we want the inquiry to examine whether the Prime 
Minister was in a direct conflict of interest when he lobbied 
crown agencies for money on the hotel he once co-owned and 
located next door to a golf course in which he had a financial 
interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several weeks the Liberal government has been saying in this 
House that we need to move on from Shawinigate and to start 
debating real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the motion of the official opposition offers the 
government and the Prime Minister the opportunity to get out of 
the mess they are in and to take Shawinigate out of the hands of 
the politicians and put it into the hands of an independent 
judicial inquiry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We offer the opportunity to get this out of the hands of 
politicians and move it into the hands of an independent inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has no one but himself to blame for the issue 
dragging on for the last two years.  Had there been full 
disclosure from the beginning, we would not be here today over 
two years later calling for a judicial inquiry to finally and 
fully determine all the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two years the Shawinigate scandal has been the background 
noise of Canadian politics.  For two years we have been 
faithfully holding the government to account on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government has continued to go on as if it is business 
as usual, in its usual “Don't worry, be happy” fashion, every 
once in a while Shawinigate has popped up like a toothache that 
has never been treated.  It just gets worse and worse.  We are 
proposing a root canal.  We want this to go to an independent 
public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more Canadians are focusing on this issue every day. At 
first, with all the stories of numbered companies, financial 
transactions and secret shareholders, it seemed complicated. 
However, it really comes down to a simple principle:  The Prime 
Minister pressured a crown corporation to give hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, $615,000 to be exact, to the hotel next to 
the golf course in which he had a financial interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are very clear.  The Prime Minister appears to have 
used his office to secure his own financial position and that is 
wrong. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, the Prime Minister has attempted to cover up the 
whole affair.  The official opposition has been asking questions 
for two years without any satisfactory answers.  His staff and 
even his cabinet seem to have tried to mislead us in order to 
cover up for their boss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself has made certain statements that 
proved later to be false.  Shawinigate is all this; not just a 
bank president, a numbered company, or a legal agreement.  It is 
above all a Prime Minister who appears to be abusing of the 
powers of his position and then wants to see us put an end to 
the whole affair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable.  I have been saddened, the people in the 
Chamber have been saddened and I believe the people of Canada 
have been saddened to see the highest elected office in the land 
treated with such disrespect and misused in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we consider some of the many contradictions 
we have heard from the Prime Minister and his defenders on this 
file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Prime Minister said that all of his assets were 
placed in a blind trust.  He said that very clearly.  In his 
public declaration of declarable assets dated March 1, 1994 the 
Prime Minister declared: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I declare that I hold a third of the shares of J&AC Consultants 
Inc., a private company managed by a third party who is not 
dependent on me and without a right of regard on my part. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the legal words for a blind trust.  The only regard of 
which he does not have any is his disregard to the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was J&AC Consultants that owned the shares in the Grand-Mère 
golf club.  J&AC Consultants was still owed $300,000 from Mr. 
Jonas Prince after the supposed sale of the shares in November 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said in the House on March 23, 1999 “I put 
all my assets in the trust. It is a blind trust.  I did exactly 
that so I would not have to reply to that type of question”.  He 
did not want to reply to the question, that is for sure.  We know 
now that his blind trust had peripheral vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the ethics counsellor that the Prime Minister and 
his lawyer acting as an agent were actively involved in trying to 
find new buyers for his shares, shares which the Prime Minister 
supposedly did not own after November 1, 1993.  That is what he 
tried to tell us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the Prime Minister was lobbying for money from 
the Business Development Bank of Canada and meeting with 
immigrant investors, some of whom were being investigated for 
criminal reasons, while the Prime Minister's staff was pushing 
for HRDC grants, all to help the neighbouring Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have the contradictions over the ownership of the 
shares themselves.  The Prime Minister claimed repeatedly that he 
sold the shares in the golf club on November 1, 1993.  Now we 
know that the supposed buyer of those shares, Mr. Jonas Prince, 
in his own words, never considered himself or considered the 
flimsy back of a napkin note on which the supposed sale was 
written to be a purchase.  It was simply in the mind of Mr. Jonas 
Prince, an option to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that Mr. Prince paid the Prime Minister's company 
$40,000 in November  1997 to settle this botched agreement.  In 
the words of Mr. Prince, it was to extricate himself from that 
deal and make it be known that he had nothing more to do with it. 
Only the Prime Minister had a lot to do with it.  In his own 
words, Mr. Prince indicated this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that the corporate records of the golf club were 
never changed to show that Mr. Prince was the owner of the 
shares.  As far as we know, J&AC Consultants may have been listed 
as the owner of these shares until some time last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Melissa Marcotte, the lifelong friend of the Prime Minister and 
the daughter of one of the co-owners of the golf club, admitted 
to the <I>National Post</I> two weeks ago that “he never sold 
them”.  Then after some pressure, we do not know exactly what it 
was, the story changed and maybe he did own them.  The pressure 
from the Prime Minister's office was significant and severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been walking through this charade, we have been walking 
through this dance of seven veils and we continue to get no 
answers.  We think the people of Canada deserve the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the Prime Minister's disciples and followers, the few 
who are sitting in the ranks opposite, have said that the Prime 
Minister could not be capable of such a thing, that he could not 
be capable of anything less than full disclosure and full honesty 
and that it would be impossible.  It is important to note that we 
are talking about the Prime Minister who, in a situation related 
to a vote on the ethics counsellor, ordered men and women to vote 
against their own word. 
We are talking about a Prime Minister who ordered them to break 
their word.  Would he be capable of contradiction on this file? 
Absolutely he would and he has proven it.  This needs to go to an 
independent inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other contradictions over the Prime Minister and his 
role in lobbying for the auberge.  The Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Industry and the Prime Minister's spokesman, Mr. 
Donolo, all said that the Prime Minister had not interfered with 
the BDC, which acted independently and according to normal 
procedures.  They were all on record saying this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Donolo said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not get directly involved in the lending 
decisions of the BDC.  Decisions for that are made entirely by 
appropriate officials within the BDC. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know, after pressure from us and others, that internal 
BDC members said the loan in fact did not follow normal policies 
and that the Prime Minister met with the bank president 
personally at 24 Sussex Drive to discuss it, and called him about 
it on the phone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the majority of Canadians in every poll which has been 
taken are asking that this be moved to an independent inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a few of the contradictions we face.  Canadians 
need to know the truth.  It is too late now for the Prime 
Minister to restore his promise about bringing accountability to 
the House of Commons.  That day has passed.  It now needs to move 
to the hands of an independent inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think what the Leader of the Opposition 
has done is laid out for Canadians a series of dots, but they are 
lacking the lines between the dots.  They have a lot of 
statements such as apparently and allegedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out something.  I want to quote the hon. Leader 
of the Opposition's phrase when he said the “flimsy back of a 
napkin” and how that was not an agreement of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring his memory back to a company called Multicorp. 
Five years ago in Alberta there was a company that was being 
promoted by the premier of Alberta.  The shares in that company 
were given to the wife of the premier and the wife of a Mr. Rod 
Love.  After the shares skyrocketed and it became apparent that 
this may be an illegal gift, the Leader of the Opposition was 
confronted with the information and asked if perhaps this 
violated a conflict of interest.  At the time he stood firmly and 
said no, it was a verbal sale that was acceptable to him.  He 
also said it had no business in front of a judicial inquiry as it 
was simply the regular business of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I want to know how he reconciles the fact that in 
Alberta, with certain political motivations and interest at 
stake, verbal sales are fine.  However, when presented with a 
legal purchase agreement here, when his political motivations are 
different, all of a sudden we get the crocodile tears.  Could he 
speak to that for a second? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the research is worse 
than shabby.  He talked about linking up all the dots.  There are 
so many dots across the way that are not linked up, it looks like 
some kind of a maze that nobody can figure out, but a public 
inquiry could figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the particular case he referred to, there was an ethics 
commissioner in place who reported to the legislature, not a 
personal ethics trainer who reports to the Prime Minister.  Also, 
that ethics commissioner cleared the premier.  However do the 
members know what the premier did?  The premier went even further 
and said that because there was an appearance, he gave those 
shares back, something this Prime Minister has never done nor 
referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister do?  The Prime Minister told his 
members to vote against their own promise.  Every one of these 
members voted against their own word.  They promised an ethics 
commissioner but voted against their word.  They broke their word 
in public, and they need to be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used the example of a man who took accountability against one 
who refuses to take accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I would ask all my 
colleagues to remain somewhat calm.  We all know that this debate 
can incite many emotions, so please take it upon yourself to do 
it calmly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Leader of the Opposition spoke of a loan for which the MP 
lobbied.  Is he aware of and could he advise the House how much 
the original loan application of the Auberge Grand-Mère was from 
the BDC, how much the actual loan turned out to be and what was 
the interest rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is one of a number 
of questions that has to go to an independent inquiry.  We asked 
a number of questions over the last two years where we would get 
one answer then find out another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked a very basic question.  We asked the Prime Minister if 
he had ever been involved with the BDC.  He and his disciples 
said there was no involvement, then we found out there was.  We 
then asked was there a blind trust.  We were told absolutely that 
there was a blind trust, but we then found out that it was not 
blind at all.  As a matter of fact, he could fully see what was 
happening, and he had his lawyer trying to flog those shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked question after question to which we got no direct 
answers.  That is why I appreciate that question.  It is one of a 
number that we need to see go to an independent inquiry because 
when we asked that question we did not get a direct response.  An 
independent inquiry will give us that direct response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a shame for Canada that we have 
to be debating this in the House of Commons.  It is a shame that 
there is not parliamentary reform that takes this issue out of 
the hands of the Prime Minister, where it is not legislated that 
the House can deal with the issue and that a private inquiry 
would be automatic in a situation like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really unfortunate that the members of the government 
cannot see that Canadians want this issue to be resolved by 
independent inquiry.  They are doing everything that they 
possibly can to stop this from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are dealing with in the House of Commons is whether 
or not there was a conflict of interest by the Prime Minister of 
Canada.  That is the issue we must concern ourselves with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is very clear that the Auberge Grand-Mère Hotel 
received funding from the Business Development Bank of Canada 
because of the interference of the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère is adjacent to the Grand-Mère golf 
course in which the ownership of the shares was suspect at the 
time the Prime Minister was lobbying the BDC for a loan.  The 
loan had been refused prior to the Prime Minister's lobbying. 
The Prime Minister told the House that he sold his shares in 
November 1993, three days before becoming the Prime Minister of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about the supposed agreement of sale 
with Jonas Prince, the owner of the Delta Hotel chain.  It is 
unbelievable that two corporate lawyers would sign a handwritten 
agreement with no witnesses, with no place of signature and with 
no corporate seal, and Canadians do not expect that it is real. 
There was no down payment.  There was no deposit even.  In any 
kind of sale, even transferring the ownership of a car, there has 
to be some exchange of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Prince did not make a $75,000 loan payment on November 1, 
1994, as was called for in the agreement.  He did not make 
another similar payment in November of 1995, two years later.  It 
was on January 27, 1996 when the Prime Minister first contacted 
the ethics counsellor to inform him that he had not been paid. 
If it was in a blind trust, how in heaven's name did he know he 
had not been paid?  He was not to be informed of what was going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the ethics counsellor, the Prime Minister and his 
lawyer were to look for a way for him to get paid.  If that is 
not involvement in a blind trust, I do not know what is.  If the 
contract was truly valid, why did the lawyer, who was supposedly 
handling the affairs, not take the issue to court?  That did not 
happen.  Three and a half years later these shares eventually 
were passed on, sold, transferred to one of the original partners 
in the golf course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask oneself why there was an accompanying document in 
1999 signed by the Prime Minister in regard to his company J&AC 
Consultants.  Why was there even that document in 1999 if he had 
no interest?  It is quite clear to Canadians watching this unfold 
that there was a financial interest of the Prime Minister in what 
was happening not only with the golf course but the hotel next 
door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members may believe in incredible coincidences, but 
within a month of informing the ethics counsellor that he still 
was owed money, the Prime Minister held a private meeting with 
immigrant investors to discuss investing in a hotel.  Funnily 
enough, one of the coincidences was that the Grand-Mère hotel 
eventually received $2.5 million in investor funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of months later, and this is another coincidence, the 
Prime Minister called the BDC on behalf of the hotel.  After the 
BDC rejected the loan, the Prime Minister continued to lobby on 
behalf of the hotel, and gee, what happened?  BDC changed its 
mind and loaned some money to the hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not happen without the interference of or influence by 
the Prime Minister of Canada.  He is not an ordinary member of 
parliament but the Prime Minister of Canada and he actually met 
on occasion with the president of the bank at 24 Sussex Drive.  I 
cannot invite somebody to 24 Sussex Drive to lobby him.  The 
Prime Minister went to extreme lengths to ensure that the Auberge 
hotel stayed afloat.  The question is why.  Gee, I wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any of us here to try to pretend that what happens next door 
with regard to property we may own has nothing to do with our 
financial well-being is fooling ourselves.  Before coming to this 
place, I spent years as a realtor and I was also in municipal 
government.  Let me tell the House that a municipal government 
informs adjoining property owners of any changes to properties 
next door because there is an interest.  As a realtor, there is 
no way that I would ever have sold a house on a handwritten 
document that had no witness, no place of location and no 
corporate seal.  There are reasons why realtors would not do that 
when selling someone's property:  because it would not be upheld 
in a court of law and would not be made binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about interest because that is where the conflict of 
interest comes in.  There is absolutely no doubt in the minds of 
Canadians that there was a financial interest to the Prime 
Minister and his associates with the golf course and with the 
hotel.  If that hotel had gone bankrupt, the Prime Minister would 
have lost a whole lot more money than he did with the value of 
his shares.  If— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  If, if, maybe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  The Liberals are trying to pretend that 
these coincidences are just normal, common events. 
Unfortunately, there is a whole pattern here and this does not 
stand out as being unusual.  There is a whole pattern in the 
Prime Minister's riding of this kind of exchange of money and 
exchange of influence, and people who are friends and colleagues 
end up with great sums of investors' money, bank money and HRDC 
money.  This happens all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a pattern here, but this one concerns Canadians because 
there is a conflict of interest.  There was a financial gain to 
the Prime Minister of Canada with his interference with the BDC 
and getting that loan.  There was a financial interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, what we have here are a lot of unanswered 
questions and a lot of things that have to be cleared up.  They 
will not be cleared up with this government.  The government has 
refused to allow the principals to come before the industry 
committee to answer some of these questions and clear up this 
issue.  The government has refused to co-operate and has left the 
opposition no other recourse than to call for an independent 
judicial inquiry to get the answers that are needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that it has come to this point.  It is a shame 
that there was not full disclosure earlier, that this thing could 
not have been cleared up earlier so that the House of Commons 
could move on to other important issues.  However, Canadians are 
concerned that the high office of the Prime Minister shall not be 
tainted by a scandal, by all these questions left unanswered. 
Canadians want the issue cleared.  Canadians want full disclosure 
and they want it sooner rather than later.  They want it done by 
an independent inquiry that is not controlled by the Prime 
Minister, not controlled by the Prime Minister's Office and not 
controlled by the House leader of the government.  Canadians want 
to know whether or not the Prime Minister was in a direct 
conflict of interest by lobbying for a loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to tell Canadians that we are hopeful 
the government will support this motion and see that inquiry 
happen.

move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition took the liberty to say in his statement 
that he speaks on behalf of Canadians.  Through you, Mr. Speaker, 
to the hon. Leader of the Opposition, there are some comments 
from individuals— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to tell the

Rock—Langley who was the main speaker, therefore comments should 
go through me to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to either one of them I 
want to pass on some comments from individuals in my riding who 
are saying that the opposition should stop, that enough is 
enough.  Another constituent is saying “Enough is enough and the 
opposition should stop attacking Chrétien.  Chrétien does not 
deserve this.  It is stupid and ridiculous”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments made by the previous speaker were an insult to me.  The 
comments were that I was forced to vote with the government.  My 
record will show and prove to them that I voted freely in the 
last two and a half terms, more often than any opposition member 
who was with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I would just remind the 
hon. member that members do not address each other by name.  The 
hon. member should know that.  He has been here for seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the issue here is 
that Canadians do want this matter cleared up.  If there is 
nothing to hide, if there is no reason that this should not be 
brought to the table, then why are the government members and the 
Prime Minister so opposed to having an independent inquiry?  If 
there is nothing to hide, what is wrong with having an 
independent inquiry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a question for the hon. member who just spoke.  With 
respect to the alleged bill of sale, were there witnesses to that 
bill of sale?  Do we know the town, city, village or province in 
which it was signed?  Is there any evidence of corporate records 
indicating that the sale in fact occurred?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. 
member's question, I do not even know if the two parties were 
together in the same room when this bill of sale was drafted. 
There is no recognition of witnesses to verify that those 
signatures are in fact the people who they purport to be.  There 
is no witness or corporate seal to justify that the two 
individuals were in the same room at the same time or in what 
province it was and therefore in what jurisdiction it could be 
challenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need this judicial inquiry:  so that the 
background information that may or may not support it is brought 
to the table.  Like I said, in real estate and in municipal

that.

issue, I think, having both come out on the wrong end of libel 
suits; the opposition has sent its pros to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to ask a question of this speaker, who stood 
in the House of Commons yesterday and made a very serious 
allegation against the Prime Minister.  She said that the owner 
of the Grand-Mère hotel had sworn on the Bible that there was a 
business relationship between his facility and the Grand-Mère 
golf course.  I have the disposition here.  Will she say that 
outside? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

by the Leader of the Official Opposition calling for what he

of interest, as he calls it, in connection with the Grand-Mère 
Golf Club and the Grand-Mère inn. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

have been sued, both successfully and both for saying wrong 
things about Canadians.  Of course, both of them have had to 
issue public apologies, including some of them on the floor of 
the House.  We remember them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear about what this motion being brought 
forward wants to do.  Despite the fact that the Prime Minister 
has been cleared by the ethics counsellor, despite the fact that 
the Prime Minister has answered countless questions in the House, 
despite the fact that the RCMP has determined that there are no 
grounds for a criminal investigation into this so-called fishing 
expedition by the guy who initiated this, and despite the fact 
that the Prime Minister has taken the unprecedented step of 
having many personal documents tabled in the House, the 
opposition goes on.  It keeps moving the target.  Every time it 
gets what it asks for, it asks for something else. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only conclusion one can reach is that what the Leader of the

reality of the situation in line with what he imagines it to be, 
and wants it to be. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state the facts that the Prime Minister and the 
government have been stating for two years.  The family of the 
Prime Minister, prior to the 1993 election, owned shares in a 
golf club.  There is a neighbouring Auberge Grand-Mère that has 
nothing to do with the golf course at all, other than the fact 
that along with five other golf courses it is in the 
neighbourhood.

the Prime Minister with a debt owing but not equity in a

imagination.  The legal debt owed the Prime Minister was 
unaffected by the value of the golf course and we know that.

the member for Calgary Centre who alleged that the golf course 
was benefiting from the presence of the hotel when it was proven 
to him that it was the reverse.  The golf course in question, and 
I have been there, has a bar that competes with the hotel next 
door.  That was a fabrication again that we heard a few weeks 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that when the Prime Minister was informed in 
1996 that the debt owing to him was outstanding, he displayed 
what I would consider very high moral principles in regard to the 
issue and he informed the ethics counsellor.  Are those the 
actions of an individual who seeks to disrespect a code of 
ethics?   No, they are not.  Did he try at that time to somehow 
increase profit?  Obviously it did not happen. It did not take 
place and everybody knows that.

Does she know the difference?  No.  She pretends to be an expert

all the documents. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want all the documents.  They cannot get away with just 
tabling one thing written on the back of a table napkin and 
suggesting that it will suffice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Prime Minister saying that all the documents have 
been tabled.  The day following that the ethics counsellor, the 
Prime Minister's private ethics counsellor, said that all the 
documents had not been tabled.  Notably there is a very key 
document, the one that would show the names on the registry.  We 
have asked very specifically for that document and I have asked 
for it in a written letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor said that on receiving that letter and 
calling the registry to see about the names, the response that he 
received was that he could not see the document and the names 
that were there until a few little changes were made.  That is 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member, who has just made a half-hearted attempt to 
protect a line of contradictions and conflict of interest, aware

and changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. government House leader has to do 
with realistic transactions.  The government House leader has 
suggested that there is no link whatsoever between this 
struggling hotel and the golf course.  Does the hon. member 
actually expect Canadians to believe this?  Does he actually 
expect Canadians to accept that this hotel, which was the 
recipient of over $600,000 of taxpayer money, would have no 
bearing on the financial success of the golf course owned by the 
Prime Minister?  Does he actually expect Canadians to believe 
that if the hotel had gone bankrupt, the golf course would 
not have been affected?  Is that what he is asking Canadians to 
swallow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question is erroneous. 
He says that the Prime Minister owned a hotel.  That is factually 
incorrect and the hon. member knows it.  It was sold in 1993.  I 
have just read from the September 29, 1999 transfer agreement in 
which Akimbo is recognized as the owner and as having sold its 
shares.  Akimbo would have great difficulty in selling something 
it did not own.  The hon. member, as I have been told, is one of 
our learned colleagues in law.  One would think that he would 
know that we cannot sell something that we do not own. It is not 
a very hard concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Order, please.  I would 
like to say that given the delicate nature of the debate the 
Chair needs to hear what hon. members are saying.  There are high 
emotions here today.  I would like to hear what hon. members are 
saying, so I ask for all members to co-operate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
the debate on the motion brought forward by the Leader of the 
Opposition calling for a public inquiry into the issues 
surrounding the Shawinigan file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is already very clear in the debate that not much will be 
said on one side of the House or the other which will change the 
minds of members opposite.  Members of the opposition, with the 
exception, it appears, of the NDP, have come together in a 
single-minded attempt, to smear and damage the reputation of the 
Prime Minister.  Members on this side are of the opinion that is 
occurring.  We expect it to continue for some period of time, but 
eventually we expect that the people of Canada will insist that 
members of parliament on both sides get back to the business of 
Canada.  Canadians are not impressed by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now speaking to the people of Canada.  Canadians should 
look at the source of the allegations in this Chamber today.  It 
is worth reminding ourselves that the gentleman who has tabled 
the motion, the Leader of the Opposition, and the individual who 
has seconded the motion, also from the opposition, have, within the 
space of a handful of years, found themselves before a 
court of law, or at least in the case of one, the threat of a 
court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  You are on a high road now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  No, these are the facts.  The Leader of 
the Opposition cost the taxpayers of Alberta $800,000 because of 
allegations that were found to be false.  A settlement was 
required and the taxpayers of Alberta were left with an $800,000 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman making the case for an inquiry on behalf of the 
official opposition is the same gentleman who cost the taxpayers 
of Alberta $800,000 because of other false accusations issued in 
another place by a member of another chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However he has learned something.  In this case he does not 
repeat the phony and false allegations outside the House.  The 
privileges of the House and the immunity of the House are being 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition has left because I served notice 
that he just made a statement.  He said the books were being 
cooked by Industry Canada even as we spoke.  I shouted across the 
floor that I would like him to walk outside the House and repeat 
what he had said inside the House.  I challenged the member 
opposite to do that and he got up and left the Chamber.  With his 
usual degree of courage and integrity he has run before the 
battle for truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe the rules of the House are that there are to be 
no comments on the presence or absence of other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The message has been 
made.  The member is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the member 
who seconded the motion, Canadians will recall a few years ago 
the allegation by a member of the House, the same member, that a 
long established public servant working with the security 
services of Canada was “a Russian spy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said she had found out that there was a mole within the 
security services of Canada.  She went outside the House.  She 
released the document and smeared the reputation of a long 
serving public servant by saying there was a spy within the 
security services of Canada.  The member who just seconded this 
serious motion apologized under threat of being sued.  The 
allegation was withdrawn because the member was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear a serious allegation the first thing we ought to do 
is consider the source.  The sources are two members.  Both 
members issued false statements, one while a member of the 
Alberta legislature and the other while a member of this place. 
Both settled before the threat of court action.  Both have been 
found libellous with their comments and both are now standing as 
the chief accusers of the Prime Minister.  We should consider the 
source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another right hon. gentleman who has joined in this 
little charade, the right hon. leader of the Conservative Party 
whom I have seen across the floor of this place over the last 20 
years.  He says that he is interested in truth, justice and 
proper form.  He says that he is not interested in battling the 
weak, dissipating and disappearing Leader of the Opposition for 
the title of leader of the new united right, whenever the right, 
fractious as it is, gets united.  He says that is not what is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this is about his undying, unyielding, overwhelming and 
powerful pursuit of truth.  How unyielding and attracted to truth 
is the right hon. member?  The CBC program <I>The Fifth Estate</I> 
did a documentary pointing out that German money associated with 
the Airbus affair was used to fly delegates and their wives and 
families into a Conservative Party convention, and that the money 
was passed out for spending sprees and shopping trips in order to 
take delegates away from the then leader of the Conservative 
Party.  When the right hon. member was asked if he thought that 
was true and if he was concerned that Canadian national parties 
were tainted by foreign money, his answer was that he would 
respond in his memoirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone is to take seriously the self-described spectacle of 
the leader of the Conservative Party as a gentleman who wakes up 
in the morning oozing the stuff of the pursuit of truth, then 
perhaps he ought to start the pursuit in his own backyard. 
Perhaps he should demand that proper investigations be done to 
determine what happened that day so long ago when, according to 
the CBC's <I>The Fifth Estate</I> and Mr. Karlheinz Schreiber 
himself, his party leadership was stolen away from him by forces 
outside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not credible that the gentleman opposite is seriously 
pursuing the proper conduct and practice of parliament, Canadian 
parliamentary institutions and parties.  It is not credible when 
he turns a blind eye to this story of which he was a victim 
within his own party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple facts are these, and I will conclude with this.  The 
Prime Minister sold his interest prior to becoming Prime Minister 
or at the time he became Prime Minister in 1993.  That is a fact. 
The RCMP has investigated the matter at the request of the leader 
of the Conservative Party.  The RCMP took a look and closed the 
file.  It said publicly that there was no need for further 
investigation and no basis for an investigation.  That was the 
independent inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor is a long serving public servant.  He is a 
former trade commissioner and negotiator who has spent nearly 30 
years of his life in the Public Service of Canada.  He too has 
repeatedly looked into the matter and closed the file.  A 
majority of Canadians, 82%, say it is time to turn the page. Some 
75%, more than voted for the Prime Minister in the last election, 
say the Prime Minister should not resign. Canadians are telling 
members of parliament to get on with the business of Canada and 
bring this spectacle to an end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting to listen to 
the former member of the rat pack on the other side who took 
personal attacks in the House to a new low when he was in 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about the leader of my party and a libel suit 
in Alberta.  I suggest to him that the leader of my party put up 
some of his own money to cover those costs.  He will also pay it 
back, which is something I have never seen from that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wrote a phony letter to a foreign government 
about a former prime minister.  It was a phony letter.  The 
government knew what it was doing: the smear and slander of a 
former prime minister.  It then had to pay that prime minister's 
lawyers $2 million and spent about $3 million or $4 million in 
government legal fees.  No one ever apologized on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to my question, but we have a right to point out the 
facts.  This is the same government that spent tens of millions 
of dollars on Pearson airport, the same government that spent 
tens of millions of dollars on helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister stop using smear tactics on all members 
on this side of the House and start answering serious questions? 
A number of questions have been asked by this side of the House 
that have never been answered.  Smear tactics are not the answer. 
No one is trying to smear individuals in the House. We are 
trying to get answers to very simple questions.  That is what we 
want in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the whip on the 
other side has risen in this place and spoken to this file.  It 
should be noted by members who do not know, and in particular by 
Canadians who are watching the debate, that the member did not 
always sit as an Alliance member.  He sat in the House as a 
member of the Conservative Party under the leadership of former 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is now saying, and Canadians just heard it for 
themselves so I do not have to interpret it, is that this is 
about payback.  It is about anger over the debates in this place 
during the last Conservative administration, of which the current 
leader of the Conservative Party was a member and a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has just spoken from his Alliance seat but he too is 
a former Conservative member.  He has just given us the 
motivation for this debate in the House.  He has outlined a good 
part of the motivation of his own party, many of whom are former 
Conservative members, as well as the motivation of the current 
leader of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about payback.  It is about trying to get even.  It is 
about trying to target the current Prime Minister of Canada out 
of some misguided sense, I would suggest, of getting even on 
behalf of the leadership of the former Conservative government. 
That is not what parliament should be about.  That should not be 
the basis of false allegations.  Quite frankly, it will not wash 
with Canadians.

said we should be moving on to other issues, and I certainly 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll on the weekend said that most people want us to move on 
to other issues.  However the same poll said that 60% of the 
Canadian people want a public inquiry or an independent inquiry. 
I wonder if the minister would agree.  That would be one way of 
taking the issue off the floor of the House of Commons and 
getting back to other issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My other question is that in every province the ethics 
counsellor or the equivalent thereof is responsible to the 
legislature and not to the premier.  Would the hon. member agree 
that we should be implementing what was a policy of the Liberal 
Party and making sure the ethics counsellor is responsible to the 
Parliament of Canada and not to the Prime Minister?  Those are 
two questions to which I expect brief and concise answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
questions.  The questions are valid and I think they seek a 
genuine answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member comes from the great province of Saskatchewan.  One 
of Saskatchewan's great contributions to the country is the 
training, professionalism and integrity of the RCMP.  The RCMP is 
one of the icons of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the shouting across the floor in this debate we have 
forgotten that it was the leader of the Conservative Party who 
wrote to the RCMP and said he would like it to investigate the 
matter independently of parliament or politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP complied with that request and concluded there was no 
basis for further inquiries.  As soon as he heard that the leader 
of the Conservative Party, because of his own police training, I 
suppose, questioned whether the investigation had been properly 
carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people in the country accept that the RCMP is above 
reproach and that it defines the meaning of integrity and 
professionalism.  When the RCMP speaks most people accept what it 
says.  That is why Canadians say they are not buying the 
allegation and that it is time to turn the page and get back to 
the real business of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  During the minister's answer to my question he stated 
that I sat in the House with former Prime Minister Brian

Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes more than just that. Again, the Prime Minister failed 
to meet that requirement, and I continue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On appointment to office, and thereafter, they shall arrange 
their private affairs in a manner that will prevent real, 
potential or apparent conflicts of interest from arising, but if 
such a conflict does arise between the private interests of a 
public office holder and the official duties and 
responsibilities of that public office holder, the conflict 
shall be resolved in favour of the public interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also failed on that count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to the first conflict of interest. The Prime 
Minister made representations to the Business Development Bank 
of Canada in favour of the Auberge Grand-Mère. That was wrong, 
since he was well aware that there were financial connections 
between the auberge and the golf club. One can imagine what 
would have happened had the auberge shut down, considering that 
the Prime Minister, as he admitted in the House, had been trying for 
six years to get paid. Money was owed to him. He had an interest 
in getting paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said so, and I can see why. But what does he do?  We are not 
talking about an ordinary citizen here, but the Prime Minister. 
Would the Prime Minister have a good chance of finding a buyer 
after six years of trying if the auberge went bankrupt and was 
closed?  That is the first conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's personal interests are in conflict with his 
role.  He should have refrained from approaching the president 
of the Business Development Bank of Canada directly. 
Nothing obliged him to do so.  Right from the beginning, 
regional management of the Business Development Bank of Canada 
advised against it.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is not just another MP.  He ignored the 
advice of regional management and personally called the director 
of the bank, whom he himself appointed.  He met three times with 
him at his home in order to tell him, among other things, that 
it would perhaps be a good idea for him to invest in the 
auberge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a conflict of interest to ensure that the auberge will 
survive and not go bankrupt, particularly when one is seeking a 
buyer for one's shares, for which one has been trying to get 
paid for six years. 
These are undeniable facts.  It is appalling to see the 
opposition to this inquiry, opposition which comes from the 
government, which is denying these facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met a Liberal member earlier and asked him if he had seen the 
1999 contract.  “No”, he replied, “I have faith in the Prime 
Minister”.  Faith, he says.  Now there is a responsible 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister placed himself in conflict of interest twice, 
once in 1996-97 and once in 1998, when he asked the Department of 
Human Resources Development to do everything legally possible to 
ensure that Placeteco received a $1.2 million grant. 
Let us keep in mind that one of the requirements of the code is 
to not only to comply with the law but also to not have any 
conflict of interest, even the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who owns Placeteco?  It belongs to Claude Gauthier, 
whose lawyer is also a shareholder in that company, which was 
bankrupt at the time, and who was to be appointed, contrary to all 
trusteeship rules of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, and therefore something that ought not to have 
happened, to negotiate for Placeteco.  Thus he was negotiating on 
both sides, negotiating with himself, to obtain a $1.2 million 
loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, when the Prime Minister was looking for someone to pay for 
the shares for which he had not been paid, the same Mr. 
Gauthier, the owner of Placeteco, injected the modest sum of 
$525,000 into the Grand-Mère golf club. 
This took place at the very moment that the Prime Minister was 
trying to find a buyer for his shares in the golf club, which 
could not go broke without taking the inn along with it.  Mr. 
Gauthier turned up with his $525,000, and then turned around and 
got $1.2 million from the Department of Human Resources 
Development.  Hon. members will agree that this was mere 
happenstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interests of the Prime Minister are in direct conflict with 
his position as Prime Minister.  Not only ought he not have 
approached the bank, he ought not have intervened in the 
Placeteco case in order to obtain a grant, which was obtained 
through an irregular procedure, as even the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has had to admit in this House.  That is 
the second conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third conflict of interest was when these documents were 
tabled, and not all of them were, because between 1993 and 
1999, and this was even the opinion of the so-called ethics 
counsellor, the senior official who is more of a cover-up 
counsellor, a political adviser to the Prime Minister, who said 
that the Prime Minister had been saying for six years that the shares 
did not belong to him and that Mr. Prince, the alleged buyer, had 
been saying the same thing, the shares were in limbo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I imagine that the Prime Minister thought he 
was in heaven, surrounded by Liberals who could not ask him any 
questions.  He intervened directly because he was looking for 
someone to pay him for his shares.  Mr. Prince had not done so, 
as the Prime Minister admitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in 1999, the Prime Minister signed this contract a most 
extraordinary contract in article 2.1 of which he waived all 
ownership rights.  Where I come from, if someone waives his 
ownership rights, it is because he has some. 
In law they say that parties do not put something in 
writing without a reason.  If it was written that he waived 
ownership rights, he must still have had some.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this same agreement, the Prime Minister provided a seller's 
guarantee.  If one provides a seller's guarantee, it is because 
one has something to sell.  The most marvellous thing of all 
is that he found a charitable soul, one Mr. Michaud, a 
longstanding friend who in the end supposedly bought 
Mr. Prince's shares.  Ultimately, Mr. Prince was an intermediary 
in the golf club saga.  He was the Prime Minister's caddy.  That 
was pretty much what Mr. Prince's role in the whole business 
amounted to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money went from Mr. Prince's right pocket to Mr. Prince's left 
pocket, and ended up with Mr. Michaud. 
It is so obvious that, in article 3.6 of the contract, the Prime 
Minister tells Mr. Michaud “Listen, should there be an inquiry 
or damages, do not worry, my company, J&AC Consultants, will 
pay you, it will pay your lawyer's fees if there is an inquiry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there many people who are not involved in a case, but who 
say “If there is a problem, I will pay for you”? I do not know 
any person so charitable as to walk around, asking people “Do 
you have a problem? If so, even though I am not involved in 
this, I will pay”. Who are they trying to fool? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still is that they are saying there will not be an 
inquiry. 
First, the Prime Minister helped the shareholder, who happened 
to be himself. That shareholder, by signing the contract, because 
he is a party to the contract signed on September 29, 
1999, prevents the Prime Minister from taking action, because it 
is very clear. If the Prime Minister launches an inquiry, he is 
the only one who can do so, which is also an aberration, he will 
be the target of that inquiry. Moreover, should that occur, he 
will pay for Mr. Michaud. This is what we call a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private interests of the Prime Minister prevent him from 
acting like a responsible and honest prime minister. That is the 
problem and the third conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why must there be this fundamental respect for the code of 
ethics? The Prime Minister happens to hold the most important 
office in the country. Things have reached the point where 
Canadians want a public inquiry, because they do not believe the 
Prime Minister. 
Naturally the public has said “Could we move on to something 
else?”  The public is right.  How do we go about moving on to 
something else?  The Liberals read half the contracts, they way 
they read half the polls and the way they do half their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that say?  It says that it will take an inquiry to put 
an end to this debate, that all the documents should be made 
public.  The public is saying “We want out of the auberge, and 
the Prime Minister has the key”.  It is time he opened the door 
and ordered an inquiry.  Then we can move on to something else. 
Besides, when we ask them, they will not be answering any of the 
questions they say are so important today.  They will fall back 
on their old habits of saying we are always wrong.  But not 
everyone is misled all the time, and the Prime Minister can no 
longer mislead us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message he is sending by not meeting ethical standards, is 
that he is denying everything that, according to him, his career 
is built on integrity.  In 1993, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will bring honesty back to politics; politicians are not 
elected to serve themselves, but to serve. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he has forgotten the words.  He does that.  He must have 
got the terms mixed and he has understood that politicians were 
there to serve themselves, because this is what he has done.  He 
served himself in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fine Prime Minister added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked a lot of integrity and honesty in the campaign. 
I have made my career in politics knowing the dangers of 
political life, and I think that, when a person is well 
informed, they do not succumb to temptation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he was ill-advised, because if he trusts his ethics 
counsellor, he will not go far.  This man had not even read the 
documents he said he had read during last fall's election 
campaign. He had said “I read everything”.  He saw everything 
people wanted to show him.  That is the problem.  He did not see 
much, this so-called ethics counsellor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is thumbing his nose at the basic rules of 
ethics.  He has been elected twice on the basis of those rules. 
I have always said that he called the election last fall because 
he did not want this business to get out.  There is a total of 
twenty investigations involving this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if now we were a few weeks away from the election.  Do 
hon. members not think that things would be really hopping in 
the auberge affair?  Do they not think that there would be at 
least two candidates to replace the Prime Minister who would 
doing everything possible to see that a convention was held 
because they would be feeling “We are not going to win with this 
guy who has fiddled with the rules”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the election was called last fall. 
Liberals wanted to act while the public was in the dark about the 
situation, which was corroborated by an accomplice, the ethics 
counsellor.  That is why the public has had enough of all this. 
It is fed up with the Prime Minister's contradictions, telling 
us there is no connection between the auberge and the golf 
course.  Of course not.  Do hon. members think that it would be 
good for a golf course to be located next to a hotel with a 
“Closed on account of bankruptcy” notice on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Duhaime told us under oath on November 2, 2000 “Of course, 
we share customers with the auberge, because golfers eat there”. 
The auberge serves as an intermediary.  There is, of course, no 
legal connection.  What we are talking of is financial 
connections, apparent and potential links, which have an 
interest in existing over and above any legal links. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal veil must come off.  It is time to look at what is 
happening in real life, and that the owner of the auberge has 
told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, who attended the opening of the auberge, 
intervened twice with the Department of Human Resources 
Development and the Business Development Bank.  The Prime 
Minister's riding assistant intervened in the negotiations 
between Mr. Duhaime and the bank.  He himself oversaw the 
transactions for the new purchaser.  Guess who the new purchaser 
is?  One of the operators of the golf club, a friend of the 
Prime Minister.  Coincidence, once again.  This business is full 
of coincidences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says there was no more financial link with 
the golf club.  When I asked the so-called ethics counsellor, Mr. 
Wilson, if the Prime Minister had a financial interest in the 
golf club, he said “Oh, yes”.  It came out very quickly, quite 
naturally.  He had not thought to try to hide that. 
Yes, there is an interest. 
There is a big interest, and everyone understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was confirmed subsequently by Mr. Corriveau, the 
spokesperson for the Michaud family, by Melissa Marcotte, who 
began to speak out.  Then, when she began to speak out and 
people saw she was making sense, she was asked “Could you not 
keep quiet, my dear”.  That is exactly what she did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is denying all this evidence.  He is refusing 
to make his documents public.  I said at the outset that his 
attitude was very annoying.  It is so annoying that, when he 
says, as he has for some forty years, that his career is built 
on integrity, does he realize that he is in the process of 
destroying it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ran the last election campaign, which was probably his last 
one, precisely to make sure this would not come out during that 
campaign. He should rise to the level of his position and have 
enough dignity to say “We will hold an inquiry. We will table 
all the documents, not just the documents that are appropriate 
for us, not just the documents selected by a so called ethics 
counsellor, who is a political adviser, but all the documents. 
This commission of inquiry will do its job and, in the meantime, 
we will move on to other issues”. This is how the Prime Minister 
should fulfil his duties responsibly and in the respect of his 
office, instead of behaving like he has been since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember the GST. The Prime Minister was seen and heard 
on television saying, with a rather unique choice of words, “We 
will scrap the GST”. Once in office, he never said that again. 
Everyone saw him, on the news. There are videos to 
confirm it. The fellow that we saw looked a lot like him, if it 
was not him. 
Everyone was convinced it was him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the Prime Minister did like the Canadian Alliance member 
who was replaced by his assistant, and the assistant looked a 
lot like him. Maybe that was it. It was someone who said that 
the Liberals would scrap the GST. 
The Canadian Alliance member did apologize. He assumed his 
responsibilities, but the Prime Minister continues to deny the 
obvious. He thinks that by continually denying, people will 
eventually forget.

Bloc Quebecois is linking the Grand-Mère golf club to the Auberge 
Grand-Mère for purely political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some questions for him.  The auberge obtained loans from 
the caisse populaire and from the Fonds de solidarité des 
travailleurs du Québec.  I ask him what the total of those loans 
was.  Was it not $2 million?  What was the amount of the loan 
from the Business Development Bank of Canada?  Was it not 
$615,000?  What was the rate of interest?  Was it not 25%, 
while today's interest rates are around 7%, 8% or 9%?  What was 
the favour to the auberge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of golf clubs in Quebec.  They do not need an 
adjacent hotel.  Very few golf clubs do not have their own 
clubhouse. 
As for the Prime Minister, he was a co-owner, not the owner, of 
the Grand-Mère golf club.  He owned perhaps 25% of the shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the leader of the opposition what percentage of shares the 
Prime Minister owned and when he sold them, not when he might 
have sold the entire golf club, which did not belong to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the hon. member's last 
comment interesting. He was asking on what date the Prime 
Minister sold the entire golf club that did not belong to him. 
I am still trying to unearth the intrinsic logic in all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what share did he hold in the golf club?  That is a good 
question, indeed.  We do not know, because one document says 25% 
and another 22%.  This is a contradiction, one I had forgotten. 
I thank the hon. member for reminding me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, he says there are a lot of golf clubs in Quebec.  How 
many have had the Prime Minister intervene directly in order to 
help in their sale?  How many besides the one in Grand-Mère? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that the Fonds de solidarité and the caisse populaire 
put money into the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
So what?  One thing I do know, however is the president of the 
Fonds de solidarité, Mr. Bachand, held no interests in the golf 
club because this would have placed him in a conflict of 
interest.  Neither, probably, did the president of the caisse 
populaire.  Therein lies the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, who is the head of something called Canada, no 
trifling matter, and holds the most important position in the 
land, has intervened directly while he had a financial interest 
in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, what is this link?  I would ask the hon. member whether 
he things that an auberge adjacent to a golf club— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> With the same address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Never mind the address.  So somebody is 
looking for a buyer of his shares, whether 22% or 25%, we do not 
know, but if the hon. member were to ask the Prime Minister 
perhaps an answer would be forthcoming. Maybe he could ask in 
caucus tomorrow morning. Anyway, does he think it would be 
good news for that person on the way to the cottage to see a 
notice posted on the hotel, saying “Closed on account of 
bankruptcy”?

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors approved, on November 1, 1993, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the leader of the Bloc Quebecois not accept this letter

things in good faith, I take the time to verify and do not just 
swallow things that hide reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things on this paper, the lawyers talked of February 
29, 1999.  There is no such date.  They could always consult a 
calendar.  This is part of a serious document.

article 2.1 of September 29, 1999, in which the Prime Minister 
says he gives up all his rights of ownership in 1999.  How can 
someone give up rights that the person has had since 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, why did the Prime Minister, in all goodness I imagine, 
say “If a problem ever arises for the person who supposedly 
bought the shares of the person to whom I sold them, but who 
never paid me, if there is ever trouble for this person, out of 
my great goodness, I will pay his legal costs”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that make sense to you?  Do you think it works that way in

ethics commissioner by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, had 
been properly dealt with in the first instance.  I say that with 
regret because my colleagues and I have tried to give the benefit 
of the doubt to an ethics commissioner whose mandate is 
unnecessarily restricted, whose independence has been curbed by 
the Prime Minister's refusal to set up the ethics commissioner 
office on a proper basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle, a full two years and two 
weeks ago, on March 19, 1999, wrote to the ethics commissioner to 
raise concerns about the Prime Minister's conduct.  Let me quote 
briefly from the letter the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle 
directed to Howard Wilson, the ethics commissioner at that time. 
He raised concerns about whether the Prime Minister had 
contravened certain sections of the conflict of interest code, 
specifically part I, section 2, which states that the object of 
the code is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to enhance public confidence in the integrity of public office 
holders and the decision-making process in government. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From day one it was absolutely apparent that the Prime Minister 
had showed colossally poor judgment in his conduct in relation to 
the Grand-Mère affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns were deeper than that from the beginning and my 
colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle wrote further in the same 
letter to the ethics commissioner that the situation in question 
in his view was not in compliance with part II, section 23(1) of 
the code, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public office holder shall take care to avoid being placed or 
the appearance of being placed under an obligation to any person 
or organization, or the representative of a person or 
organization, that might profit from special consideration on the 
part of the office holder. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was disturbing, to say the least, when the response that came 
back from the ethics counsellor at that time was that there was 
no problem.  I do not think that one needed a law degree or a lot 
of political experience.  I think one needed just to have a bit 
of common sense to understand that at the very least it placed 
the Prime Minister in a place that was questionable in terms of 
his conduct because of the financial interest that could be 
effected, the financial interest from which he so clearly stood 
to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable we have reached this point in the whole matter 
because the Prime Minister and his government are as we speak 
busy selling off important aspects of Canada's future, selling 
off through flawed trade deals and selling off through the 
erosion of important public services, public programs and 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we embroiled in?  We are in a never ending debate not 
capable of coming to a resolution on the question about the 
sell-off, the failure to sell off, or the financial interests 
associated with the sell-off of shares of the Prime Minister in a 
golf course, for heaven's sake.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have made it clear that they do want this matter 
resolved, but they also want parliament to get on with dealing 
with the real issues that affect the real lives of real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been able to agree with very few words that have come out 
of the mouth of the Minister of Industry over the last many 
months on this whole sordid affair.  However, I do agree with him 
when he says that this spectacle must end.  What the industry 
minister fails to say, and he knows it to be the truth as does 
every single member of the House, is that the only way this 
spectacle can end is if the Prime Minister, the one person with 
the power, the authority and, unquestionably, the responsibility 
to put an end to this, takes the action that must be taken.  He 
must call for an independent inquiry to get to the truth of this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Prime Minister's steadfast, stubborn refusal to bring 
this thing to public light that is causing a great deal of 
consternation among Canadians.  This is not a time that we as 
parliamentarians, not on the government side nor on the 
opposition side, can afford to ignore the erosion of public 
confidence in politicians and in politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that every member of the opposition in 
the House is onside on this issue.  This is one of the few times, 
perhaps in the life of this parliament, where we are of one view, 
which is that the Prime Minister has a responsibility to clear 
the paralysis in parliament and begin the process of trying to 
restore public confidence in officeholders and in the conduct of 
their elected officials.  He must call that independent inquiry 
so we can get back to business on the concerns of real people 
around real issues.

of the Prime Minister to deal with a very serious issue of public 
confidence in his conduct and in his government.   While the 
Liberals try to push ahead with the free trade of the Americas 
deal with no significant input from citizens and no transparency 
about what it is they are negotiating, there is a further erosion 
of the rights of government to act on behalf of its citizens and 
be responsible to its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to describe peaceful, meaningful, legitimate

I have a quick comment.  The hon. member talks about democracy. 
Democracy is ruled by rules.  I was appalled because for one

engage in this McCarthyistic inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote what the member of the NDP said the other day when 
she was being recruited by the leader of the Conservative Party. 
She said that she chose not to engage.  She wanted the House to 
get on to running the affairs of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and the ethics counsellor have cleared the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I worked really hard to 
hear a question but I did not hear one.   However, let me take 
the opportunity to say that I have been asked, again and again, 
and as recently as this morning, by many reporters whether I 
actually think members on the backbench are comfortable with the 
Prime Minister's refusal to clear the air here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two dominant issues at the moment that Canadians are 
looking at and watching with some horror.  Do I think that all 
backbenchers are in agreement with the decision of the government 
to try to demonize dissent in what is happening at the FTAA 
proceedings?  I cannot answer that question for backbench 
members, but I do know that if they seriously represented the 
interests of citizens and had any courage whatsoever, they would 
not be acting like trained seals for the government on the FTAA 
or on Shawinigate.  They would be standing up and representing 
the concerns of their constituents about the paralysis of 
parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased and honoured to share in the debate today with my 
leader, the member for Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with care but also with disgust to a lot of the 
things that have been said on the government side, not just today 
but on other occasions, in defence of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded, probably because of my previous training, of a 
number of biblical insights in which people talk about ears that 
cannot hear and eyes that cannot see.  Of course the more common 
version of this is “there are none so blind as those who will 
not see”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we have this kind of wilful blindness on the 
part of government backbenchers and on the part of everyone on 
the government side who refuse to see that there is a genuine 
problem here with respect to how the Prime Minister behaved in 
relation to his shares in the Grand-Mère golf course and in 
relation to the various things that he did in respect of the 
future of the Grand-Mère inn, in particular, calling and lobbying 
the president of the Business Development Bank with respect to a 
loan for the inn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also reminded of the teaching which condemns people who are 
so busy pointing out the sliver in the eye of someone else that they 
cannot see the beam in their own eye.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen time and time again in the House is a form of 
ad hominem argument that I think degrades this place over and 
over again, which is responsible in part for the low opinion 
people have of politics and politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again we have heard from the government side, when 
members get up, comments made about the Leader of the Opposition 
and the troubles he had with respect to a libel suit in Alberta. 
We have had the fate of the hon. member to my left here in law 
school mentioned.  We have had all kinds of things mentioned that 
have absolutely nothing to do with the legitimacy or illegitimacy 
of the call for an inquiry, or the allegations that have been 
made which lead to the call for an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does no one any good to have the Minister of Industry talk 
about people who are making these allegations and calling for the 
inquiry.  We saw it recently when a Liberal member got up and 
instead of asking my leader a question about her speech, he made 
some allegation about the NDP being in training for the civil 
disobedience at the Quebec City summit, which was false to begin 
with because what people are training for is how to handle the 
police when they come after them, not how to go about committing 
civil disobedience and getting arrested.  Even if that were true, 
what would that have to do with the quality or the legitimacy of 
the call for an inquiry? It is like playing in a sandbox here. 
Somebody makes a legitimate request and people get up and say 
that our mother did this, our father did that or our grandfather 
did this yesterday.  It is no wonder people do not have a high 
opinion of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the Liberals are so accustomed to patronage 
and to feathering their own nests and the nests of their friends 
that at a certain point they cannot tell any more when patronage, 
which is questionable in itself, particularly when it is to the 
extent that the Liberals practise it, moves over on the gauge 
into conflict of interest. Frankly, I think this is what happened 
to the Prime Minister.  At a certain point patronage crossed over 
into conflict of interest and he hardly noticed because there is 
so much arrogance there. There is a feeling that it is a one 
party political state and a one party political culture and 
basically the Liberals can do whatever they like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that kind of attitude that permeates everything that has 
to do with the disbursal of government money.  We see it not just 
in respect of the Prime Minister's actions, but we see it in the 
actions of the Business Development Bank in general.  We see it 
with respect to the Export Development Corporation.  We see it 
with respect to the Canadian International Development Agency. We 
saw it in spades last year when we talked about the way money was 
disbursed through HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything is turned to political ends, either political in a 
collective sense or political in a sense of rewarding Liberal 
friends for support.  In this case, the money was sought for a 
hotel, a situation in which the Prime Minister stood to gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more curious arguments that has been made. again by 
the Minister of Industry, is that because the Prime Minister lost 
money, this clears up the matter.  Did it not occur to the 
Minister of Industry that those shares stood to go up or down, 
contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister said at one point in 
the House when he tried to tell the House that the price of the 
shares was fixed so it did not matter what the Prime Minister 
did?

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have found out that is not true, like a lot of other things 
that have been said over the last several months.  The price of 
the shares could change.  The price of the shares in the end was 
less than what the Prime Minister originally sought to sell them 
for.  This is supposed to be argument enough for us to drop it; 
but if the value of the shares was in flux, then yes, the Prime 
Minister lost.  However he could have lost more or he could have 
lost less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Industry think that the Canadian people, 
the media and members of parliament were born yesterday?  If the 
price of the shares could change then they could go up or down. 
That is precisely a question of the Prime Minister's behaviour 
between the period of 1993 and 1999, between the initial bill of 
sale and when the sale was finalized.  We want to know what 
happened in between.  Is that so unreasonable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being on my feet in the House calling for the Prime 
Minister to release all relevant documents.  The problem is he 
has not released all the relevant documents and it looks like he 
does not intend to.  We need to have an inquiry in order to 
determine what happened in that space of time.  Why do we need 
that?  It is for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I would like to see the inquiry clear the Prime 
Minister.  I do not want to live in a country where the Prime 
Minister is found to be engaging in a conflict of interest.  I do 
not want to live in a country where it is never cleared up as to 
whether the Prime Minister was in a conflict of interest.  I 
would much rather live in a country where an inquiry is held when 
there is a serious allegation of conflict of interest and the 
matter is resolved and cleared for the benefit of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason is so that parliament can get on with doing more 
of what we should be doing.  Government members have been very 
cute in this regard.  They ask why the opposition did not ask 
about this and ask about that.  When we do, we do not get decent 
answers anyway.  They sure showed that last week.  It has been 
suitably reported and they have had to answer for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call the attention of the House to an earlier time in another 
place when an allegation of conflict of interest was made in May 
1986 against a cabinet minister in Manitoba, a good friend of 
mine, former energy minister Wildon Parasiuk.  What did he do? He 
immediately resigned.  Former chief justice of Manitoba, Samuel 
Freedman, was asked to conduct an inquiry.  By August he was back 
in the cabinet because he had been cleared and the allegations 
were found to be false.  Is that not a much better scenario for 
the Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the Prime Minister resign, but 
certainly an inquiry could be set up.  At some point we could 
have a ruling on just what went on.  That would be a much better 
way to deal with this matter than the way the Prime Minister has 
dealt with it so far. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
was with some amusement that I listened to the NDP and its 
position in this regard.  The hon. member just mentioned that it 
was a question of there are none so blind as those who would not 
see, but I think it is more a case over there with the unholy 
alliance between all the opposition parties of monkey see, monkey 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Tories, the Progressive Conservatives, has 
made this a personal inquisition he is conducting against the 
Prime Minister and all opposition parties are trying not to be 
outdone in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the government being cute on the issue. 
I think the NDP is being particularly cute in trying to suck and 
blow at the same time.  It is trying to be part of the attack but 
it recognizes the necessity of dealing with the important issues 
in the country.  It is trying to have a foot in both camps, so to 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the leader of the Bloc Quebecois why he does not accept 
the letter of March 20 from Pouliot, Mercure, solicitors for the 
company that owns the Grand-Mère golf course.  The letter 
confirms that the resolution was passed confirming the sale in 
1993.  Why does that not put an end to the matter?

he asked the Bloc.  I did not think I had become a separatist in 
the course of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the position of the NDP in this respect. 
Our position is quite a defensible one.  As the member knows we 
have raised the Shawinigate affair in the House.  We have asked 
the Prime Minister to table documents.  We have asked for the 
inquiry.  We have done this on a number of occasions.  Have we 
done this to the exclusion of everything else?  No.  We agree 
there are other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked questions about water, the Kyoto accord, the 
summit of the Americas in Quebec, health care and infrastructure. 
We have asked a number of questions.  I do not think that is 
trying to have a foot in both camps.  I think that is doing our 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things that are called for in terms of what 
should be discussed on the floor of the House of Commons.  We 
have contributed to the debate around Shawinigate in the House, 
as we have contributed to other issues.  That is appropriate 
behaviour on our part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document the member refers to is one of the things we should 
have an inquiry to look into, to see whether that document jibes 
with a whole lot of other documents on the table and to see 
whether that document is as sufficient as the member claims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to comment a bit on what the hon. member has been 
saying.  He talked about the level of debate in the House.  I was 
hoping to come to the House today and that the opposition might 
be able to put new information on the table that would cause me 
to think my constituents were wrong by not calling me a lot on 
this issue and feeling there is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about comments coming across the floor. 
On the one hand he says the government is saying nasty things 
about their doing that.  On the other hand he talks about 
feathering our nests on this side and other comments like that. 
That does not add to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It be useful if the hon. member would come forward with some new 
information that is not already out there.  The Prime Minister 
has laid on the table all the relevant information.  The RCMP has 
investigated.  The conflict officer has looked at it.  The 
disparaging remarks these hon. gentlemen have been making about 
the conflict officer are wrong.  He is a very well respected, 
long term member of the public service.  They should withdraw 
their scurrilous allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What new does the hon. member have to put on the table that 
would make my constituents believe we should actually take this 
issue to any further level of investigation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is precisely the 
dispute, is it not?  There is lots of information on the table. 
Obviously it is not enough to make one side or the other drop its 
particular perception of what is said by what is already on the 
table.  That is why we need an inquiry.  We cannot come to any 
resolution here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the hon. member's constituents are as 
disinterested in this matter as he says they are.  I do not think 
there is any information we could bring forward that would bring 
the Liberal backbench around on this, at least in a public way, 
because they are so cowed by the power of the Prime Minister.  I 
will finish on this.  The fact is if the Prime Minister does 
not—

issue that, as the leader of the New Democratic Party has just 
said, could have been resolved months ago, years ago, by the 
Prime Minister simply declaring the truth, not part of the truth 
but the whole truth.  This may well have started as a simple 
error in judgment by the Prime Minister.  If so, he should have 
had the courage to stand at the time and tell the truth to the 
people of Canada and to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has become so offensive since then has been the consistent 
attempt at cover up, the lack of information given to the House, 
the partial information that has been given to the House, and the 
attempt to try to stifle democracy on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is conflict of interest.  Did the Prime Minister have 
a continuing financial interest in the Grand-Mère Golf Club at 
the same time as he was lobbying the Business Development Bank 
for the adjacent Auberge Grand-Mère, a hotel that has 
inextricably close linked interests with the golf course?

very certain that the auberge and the golf club are 
interdependent. Last November, when Yvon Duhaime appeared before 
the Régie des alcools du Québec to defend his case, he said that 
he needed a liquor licence because many golfers dined at the 
auberge following their golf tournaments and that most of the 
auberge's revenue came from clients who had purchased the golf 
package and from clients who were tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press also published Mr. Duhaime's comments to the effect 
that there had been “agreements, deposits and contracts” between 
the auberge and its clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in 1999, Mr. Duhaime said:  “We send people over to 
them to play golf, and they send people over to us for supper. 
What is there to explain?  If it were not profitable, would we 
keep on doing it”? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister claims to have sold his shares in the golf 
club in 1993.  By 1996 he was not paid for those shares.  No 
payment, no sale.  At that time he started to lobby the Business 
Development Bank for loans for the adjoining auberge while his 
lawyer acting as his agent was trying actively to sell the shares 
of the golf club at the very same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of the golf club shares depended on the successful 
business of the adjoining auberge.  The debt owed to the Prime 
Minister constituted a continuing financial interest in the golf 
club.  The lobbying of the president of the Business Development 
Bank was a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's statement of disclosure to the ethics 
counsellor was made under the 1985 code of conflict.  Section 24 
of the 1985 code states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public office holder shall make a confidential report to the 
ADRG (Assistant Deputy Registrar General) of all assets that are 
not exempt assets as described in section 19. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt or the shares, whichever the Prime Minister claims he 
had at the time, should have been declared to the ethics 
counsellor.  It was a declarable asset.  The definition of assets 
in the new code brought in by the Prime Minister states clearly 
assets that are not exempt assets are either declarable assets or 
controlled assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under either code the Prime Minister should have declared the 
golf club shares or the debt arising from their sale.  He did 
neither.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has stated that he has released all the 
relevant documents.  Yet the more documents that are released, 
the more questions are raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The handwritten bill of sale is not witnessed.  The repayment 
schedule is not set out.  We do not know what province it was 
signed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the note was signed is critical if the Prime Minister 
chose to sue for non-payment of the contract, because the law is 
different in different provinces.  In Quebec one has three years 
from the date of signature, while in Ontario one has six years. 
However, the government refuses to answer this, as it refuses to 
answer most questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of the shares has fluctuated.  We know from the 
documents released that the Prime Minister received less in 1999 
than what he agreed to with Jonas Prince in 1993.  A question: 
when did the Prime Minister declare the disposition of the shares 
on his income tax?  Was it in 1993 or was it in 1999?  This is a 
very germane issue.  Was the Prime Minister informed of Mr. 
Claude Gauthier's purchase of land from the golf club?  Was he, 
or his lawyer, consulted as to how the $525,000 paid by Mr. 
Gauthier, who became a serial recipient of government contracts, 
would be distributed to shareholders or used by the company? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and many other questions remain unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public inquiry, under the auspices of the Inquiries Act, would 
be able to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence, including 
financial and income tax records.  A public inquiry would be able 
to determine in an independent fashion if the Prime Minister was 
in a real or apparent conflict of interest when he lobbied the 
president of the Business Development Bank on behalf of the 
Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Sinclair Stevens commission of inquiry, Justice Parker 
defined conflict of interest as the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A real conflict of interest denotes a situation in which a 
Minister of the Crown has knowledge of a private economic 
interest that is sufficient to influence the exercise of his or 
her public duties and responsibilities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the judicial finding when that issue went to inquiry, 
as this one should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister had knowledge of his private economic 
circumstances.  His lawyer openly discussed the sale of the golf 
club shares with him.  He knew in January 1996 that he would not 
be paid for the 1993 sale, yet not 90 days later he was lobbying 
the president of the Business Development Bank on behalf of the 
Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the examination by Mr. Justice Ted Hughes of the sale of 
Premier Vander Zalm's Fantasy Garden World, the premier was held 
to be in conflict of interest, in part because:

of Asiaworld.

but in its backbenchers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may quote from the judgment of Mr. Justice Ted Hughes, he 
also went on to find the premier in conflict because: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Premier, the highest ranking elected official in British 
Columbia, telephoned the highest ranking executive of 
Petro-Canada on August 20, 1990 to discuss the sale of a vacant

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's situation is similar.  The Prime Minister 
holds the highest office in the land, yet he telephoned the 
president of the Business Development Bank, a person who holds 
his position at the pleasure of the Prime Minister, to lobby on 
behalf of a hotel that is located adjacent to and does business 
with the golf course.  At the time of the lobbying, the Prime 
Minister continued to hold a financial interest in the course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other jurisdictions have established independent ethics 
commissioners.  That has been done in British Columbia.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dominic LeBlanc (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, this is a rather sad spectacle.  The leader of the 
fifth party talk about ethics.  Let us do that.  Let us talk 
about his $85,000 pension and $10 million party debt.  Then he 
demanded another $200,000 to be leader of his party.  Last year 
he got the lowest popular vote in history.  He decreased his 
seats from 20 to 12 but he demanded $160,000 to top up his 
$130,000 salary.  With all his money, perhaps he could retain his 
wife to advise him on conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right hon. member's wife has some rather clear views on 
conflict of interest.  She has said that the Progressive 
Conservative Party's new conflict of interest guidelines were “a 
massive intrusion” on her private life.  Ms. McTeer, the wife of 
the right hon. member for Calgary Centre, went on to say when she 
was a candidate for the Conservative nomination in 
Carleton—Gloucester that the then proposed legislation causes a 
substantial loss of independence.  The most shocking thing is 
that she said by requiring members of parliament and their 
spouses to declare their assets and their income, the legislation 
“somehow assumes we are dishonest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not know the relevance of these particular comments 
coming from this member to the motion.  If I may refer to the 
motion, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls for the establishment of an independent 
judicial inquiry to determine if the Prime Minister is in breach 
of conflict of interest rules regarding his involvement with the 
Grand-Mère Golf Club and the Grand-Mère Inn; and that the inquiry 
should have broad terms of reference with the power to subpoena 
all relevant documents— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I want to remind hon. 
members that in terms of questions and comments the Chair has 
always shown a lot of leeway.  Obviously I want to ask the hon. 
member to put his question to the leader of the fifth party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dominic LeBlanc:</B>  Madam Speaker, the right hon. member 
for Calgary Centre talked about tax returns.  I think he used the 
phrase serial recipients of government contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about serial recipients of government contracts. Let 
me talk about the right hon. member's brother.  Did the right 
hon. member for Calgary Centre in fact arrange to have his 
brother appointed as a legal agent for Canada Mortgage and 
Housing?  Once the party had been reduced to two seats and he no 
longer was the minister, did he call— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt.  The hon. member for St. Albert on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My hon. colleague from Calgary Northeast pointed out that 
the question today is on the Prime Minister and his ethics or 
lack thereof.  In fact, we consider this issue so serious that we 
are asking for a judicial inquiry on the Prime Minister.  We can 
deal with other issues another day, but the issue is the Prime 
Minister and his lack of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Since we only have 
five minutes for questions and comments, I would like to permit 
the hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to answer 
the question that was put to him.  It is up to him what he wants 
to say in terms of answering the question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be very 
brief. 
First, I am quite prepared not only to stand on my record but to 
have it very closely examined by members of the House.  I have 
lived in this political life for four decades now and I am quite 
open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I find it quite astounding that the hon. member would 
sink so low in this debate to attack my wife and to attack my 
brother.  He does not know my dog.  Perhaps he would like to 
attack my dog.  I want to say to the hon. member that even his 
dad would not sink so low in the House of Commons.  I would hope 
that he would follow higher standards than he has exhibited here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the point is the following.  We have been asking 
serious questions.  I invite the House and the public to take a 
look at the questions that I have asked day after day in the 
House.  The kinds of answers that we have received quite 
consistently, whatever party posed the question, have not been an 
attempt to address the real question but have instead been an 
attempt to insult, to slur, to change the subject.  That is the 
reaction of a government that is in panic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reaction of a government whose contempt for the 
House of Commons leaves the House of Commons with no 
parliamentary option.  That makes this absolutely essential. 
This issue goes to the heart of the moral authority of the Prime 
Minister.  It raises the question as to whether or not he is able 
to take such simple responsibilities as firing a minister of his 
own when she behaves so badly.  It goes to the heart of the moral 
authority of the Prime Minister of Canada.  If it is not possible 
for us to resolve it here in the House of Commons, then that is 
simply another compelling argument for an independent public 
inquiry, which all the parties on this side of the House, despite 
our differences, have joined together in seeking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this request is based on 
credibility.  I will provide two quotes quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the hon. member said on February 7.  The leader of 
the Conservative Party admitted to the press that he had 
absolutely no proof of wrongdoing, telling the journalists 
“Let's leave it that I am fishing at this stage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then at the end of February after the RCMP inquiry, he went on 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP appears to have decided that (there was no criminal 
wrongdoing) and I accept their decision on the basis of the facts 
that are known now. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he saying that the RCMP has no credibility and did he lobby 
for his brother? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Of course not, Madam Speaker.  I 
suppose that kind of excess simply shows the desperation of the 
government's defenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is a conflict of interest 
question.  Is there proof?  Yes, there is growing proof, not 
quite enough.  The government has published some documents.  It 
left a six year gap in documents.  What they say raises new 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any sense of conscience, if there is any sense of 
decency, on the part of backbench members of the Liberal Party, 
they would vote to clear up this matter.  They would vote for an 
inquiry so parliament could get on with other business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very honoured to have the opportunity to 
speak to this motion and in particular to share my time with the 
former prime minister, whose career, whose service to Canada and 
whose reputation are impeccable in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated already, it is quite a sad attempt, and I 
would go so far as to say a pathetic attempt, by the government 
to deflect attention from the issue when we see the desperate 
references, even to go so far as to try to insult a person's 
family.  I am surprised, frankly, that Liberal members on the 
opposite side of the House would, in their own conscience, sit by 
and cheer in their churlish, childish way those attempts to 
distract attention from the real issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the real issue is.  It is here and it has been 
defined in this motion as one calling for an independent, 
judicial, public inquiry into the affairs surrounding the Prime 
Minister's business transactions in his riding of Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts now on the public record are such that there is a 
mounting case, whether it be public opinion or whether it be 
evidence if it were before a criminal court, that would suggest 
there are irrefutable facts that the Prime Minister put himself 
deliberately in a conflict of interest by his business dealings 
and by his direct interventions with the Business Development 
Bank of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years it has been a longstanding accepted tradition 
that government would not deal directly with arm's length 
corporations that were set up to serve the public.  This is what 
has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister directly called the president of the Business 
Development Bank with the full knowledge that he had an interest 
in a golf course that was adjoining the hotel.  He lobbied on 
behalf of that same hotel, in which he once held an interest, to 
give it public money, and this is the key.  Public money in the 
amount of $615,000 was put into the hotel that was directly 
adjacent to the golf course while the Prime Minister still had a 
financial interest in that golf course.  It is not rocket 
science.  It is not any sort of a legal leap of faith to suggest 
that the Prime Minister had a stake in the approval of the loan 
to the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence surrounding this and the attempts by the Liberal 
government to obscure, to cloud, to somehow make murky the clear 
evidence that the Prime Minister made this intervention from 
direct denials in the House, from letters and media manipulation 
on the part of the Prime Minister and some of his poisoned 
partisans like Warren Kinsella is very much something that should 
concern the Canadian people.  People should be concerned about 
the efforts and the lengths at which the government has gone to 
obscure the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attempts to penetrate what has taken place through clear 
questions in the House, very straightforward penetrating 
questions, have been brushed aside.  There has been continual 
public slurs of individuals' names, their records and their 
families.  This again heightens the frustration and I would 
suggest the animosity of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are clear indications now that the Prime Minister 
obviously did not have his shares in a blind trust, even though 
that was misstated on the floor of the House by himself and his 
trained protector, the Minister of Industry.  There have been 
clear contradictions on the public record about the actions of 
Mr. Jean Carle, who lived in the Prime Minister's basement and 
who was his anointed son.  He is the same individual who was 
dispatched to the Business Development Bank as a courier of PMO 
speaking points for the Business Development Bank president.  The 
Prime Minister stood here and said there was no involvement of 
Mr. Carle on that file, which was completely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clear evidence that even Jean Pelletier, the Prime 
Minister's personal Rasputin, involved himself in this matter. 
He indicated that Mr. Carle was not introduced to the president 
of the Business Development Bank by him at a hockey game in 
Montreal.  That in fact was a fallacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many occasions where the Prime Minister could 
have been forthcoming.  He could have come before the Canadian 
people and used the House as his forum to set the record 
straight. Instead he has done the opposite.  He has taken every 
occasion to run from the truth and add further fuel to the fire 
by selectively releasing documents that try to exonerate him.  It 
is now clear that this was very much an after the fact attempt to 
corroborate or somehow exonerate the Prime Minister.  We know 
that this was not full disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As required by law, in a legal sense, in a criminal court full 
disclosure is necessary.  The crown cannot decide whether to give 
little dribs and drabs of evidence to the defence to make its 
case.  It has to give full disclosure.  That obviously has not 
happened here.  What we have seen are documents resembling, in 
the case of the supposed bill of sale, something that a couple of 
kids would write with a crayon on the back of a napkin at a 
Kool-Aid stand.  This is not the type of documents or 
documentation we would expect from two millionaires with legal 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us debunk the myth about the little guy from Shawinigan. 
This is the big enchilada from Ottawa with whom we are dealing. 
This is a multimillionaire who just wanted to get paid.  He 
stated quite clearly in the House that he just wanted to get 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that denote?  A financial interest, even though he 
maintained repeatedly and still maintains that he sold his shares 
in 1993.  There is a very clear question here.  Why is the name 
of the Prime Minister's company still appearing on documents in 
1999, six years later?  Obviously, a financial interest remained.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more mounting contradictions.  The more we delve into 
it, it is like an onion.  The more we peel away, more questions 
emerge.  The government has gone to great lengths to try to 
obfuscate what has taken place.  This plethora of contradictions 
remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we are supposed to put all assets in a blind trust when 
one enters the office.  If a person is in cabinet, all the assets 
go into a blind trust.  That obviously did not happen. There was 
a $300,000 debt owing and it was not declared.  The incredible 
efforts that are being made here should be cause for alarm. 
Canadians deserve better, particularly from the Prime Minister. 
They have suffered now for several years this sad spectacle of 
the Prime Minister twisting and turning in the wind over the 
auberge affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very complicated tale but at the very root of it is a 
simple matter.  It is one of conflict of interest.  It is one of 
a Prime Minister retaining a financial interest in a property 
while trying to enhance a nearby property.  The government even 
tried to deny the connection between the golf course and the 
hotel, as did the industry minister and the very partial and 
involved ethics counsellor.  It is absolutely false to suggest 
somehow that the hotel would not benefit from having the golf 
course or the golf course would not benefit from the hotel. 
Canadians are not that naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one needs a business or real estate background to understand. 
The hotel includes in its literature the presence of the golf 
course nearby.  The comments now on the public record from the 
owner, the good friend of the Prime Minister, Mr. Duhaime who 
bought the hotel from the Prime Minister stated under oath that 
he in fact relied on the golf course for business.  To try to 
deny the obvious is really a sad spectacle on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's credibility is very much at stake, as is 
the credibility of other individuals involved in the issue.  The 
ethics counsellor, not to attack him personally, cannot have a 
shred of objectivity or credibility in this.  He reports to the 
Prime Minister.  His livelihood depends on the Prime Minister. It 
is unfair to even suggest that somehow he could fairly judge the 
circumstances.  Even if he could, he could not report to 
parliament because the Prime Minister has set it up in such a 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is out there.  We simply have to have a forum to get 
at the truth.  A full judicial public inquiry would provide us 
with that opportunity.  We have to submit the facts before that 
objective trier and that would very much satisfy the opposition. 
The Canadian public are calling for a public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would have happened in the cases of Milgaard, Morin and 
Marshall if there had been no opportunity to go back and revisit 
the facts and if they had not been given an opportunity to bring 
forward new evidence, put the matter behind them and shed light 
on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old legal maxim that says guilt always hides from 
the light.  The attempts that have been made on behalf of the 
government to keep the Canadian people in the dark clearly 
indicate there is more to this issue.  The public deserves 
better.  A full judicial inquiry would allow the public to put 
the issue behind them.  It would allow the Prime Minister to put 
this behind him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member who just gave a presentation I know has 
a legal background.  He is a lawyer and was possibly a prosecutor 
at one time, I am not sure.  On the Liberal side there have been 
numerous references made to this so-called investigation by the 
RCMP and that the RCMP closed the books on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a section in the criminal code dealing with conflict of 
interest specifically where the RCMP would be involved in a major 
investigation or is it outside its jurisdiction?  I am sure the 
member could distinguish between the two given that if it is 
outside the RCMP's jurisdiction, then who should be investigating 
a matter such as what is before the House for debate today?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague from Calgary who I also understand has a background in 
criminal law as a police officer.  He served the Canadian public 
in that capacity.  He asked a very relevant question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the RCMP did not conduct an investigation. 
No relevant witnesses were interviewed.  It did not go far 
afield.  It did not interview anyone, as far as I am aware, who 
could have shed light on this particular investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More directly to his point, the conflict of interest that is 
alleged here is not one of criminal jurisdiction.  It is an issue 
that arises because of a code of conduct entered into by the 
Prime Minister.  More importantly, it is a code of conduct that 
the Prime Minister enters into with the Canadian public.  He owes 
a duty to the Canadian public not to put himself in an apparent 
or real conflict, which is what has happened here.  Even if he 
had no interest whatsoever in that golf course, his actions in 
enhancing the businesses of a former partner, his partners in the 
golf course and his close association with all of this property 
should in and of itself have barred his intervention with the 
Business Development Bank, and he would not have sullied his name 
or his office if he had followed that simple maxim. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and his 
leader both quite sanctimoniously chastised the government side 
for referring to other people.  Then in the middle of his speech 
he referred to the Prime Minister's chief of staff.  He also 
referred to former staff and used terms such as Rasputin.  I have 
to admit that that is a little inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a specific question on his speech when he said 
that the issue has been confused or was not clear.  What we have 
is a very clear bill of sale.  There are many questions that the 
opposition is trying to raise but we have a written bill of sale. 
The corporate solicitors have confirmed that the board of 
directors in a resolution accepted the transfer of the shares 
from the Prime Minister's company to Akimbo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those two facts, obviously what we have is an unsecured 
debt.  How can the collection of an unsecured debt be a financial 
interest in the operations of the golf course?  That is the 
question I would like to hear a clear answer to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to first 
address the issue of bringing in other people's families or 
personal attacks.  Obviously, Mr. Carle, Mr. Pelletier and others 
in the PMO palace guard have a direct involvement in this.  This 
is not somehow a superfluous attack on individuals.  These 
individuals were acting on behalf of the Prime Minister.  They 
were making interventions directly to his benefit.  So to suggest 
somehow that I have gone far afield in chastising or spreading 
slurs against anyone outside of the Prime Minister's immediate 
circle is complete rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the point itself, the hon. member also has legal training. 
He knows that document is very suspect.  There are no witnesses 
to the document.  We do not know where it was signed.  There were 
no resolutions attached to it.  It referred inaccurately to 22% 
of the shares when we know it was actually 25%.  There are 
numerous inconsistencies in the document.  The hon. member, as 
someone with legal background, knows that this type of very 
speculative document may or may not stand up in a court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Before we resume, I 
know most of you do not have Marleau and Montpetit beside you, 
but because there were a certain number of questions around 
reference to naming members of the public who are not members of 
parliament, I would like to read one sentence.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are discouraged from referring by name to persons who are 
not Members of Parliament and who do not enjoy parliamentary 
immunity, except in extraordinary circumstances when the national 
interest calls for the naming of individuals.  The Speaker has 
ruled that Members have a responsibility to protect the innocent, 
not only from outright slander but from any slur directly or 
indirectly implied, and has stressed that Members should avoid as 
much as possible mentioning by name people from outside the House 
who are unable to reply and defend themselves against innuendo.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members of this point.  I know many of them have 
been in the House longer than I have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill.  I am happy to take part in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance brought forward a motion to establish a 
judicial inquiry to determine whether the Prime Minister is in a 
conflict of interest.  It is a serious and important issue for 
Canadians.  They want to know what is happening and that is why 
we are calling for a judicial inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming more and more evident that the Prime Minister is 
in a conflict of interest on the Grand-Mère issue.  Canadians 
should be concerned that the Prime Minister lobbied for grants 
and loans for a failing hotel beside a golf course in his riding 
in which he held a $300,000 interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Canadians should be even more concerned that time after 
time the Prime Minister has directly contradicted himself on the 
facts.  One of the latest examples was published by the 
<I>Canadian Press</I> on April 2, 2001.  After denying there were 
links between the golf course and the hotel, the owner of the 
Auberge Grand-Mère said under oath on November 2, 2000: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreements, accounts and contracts were made between the Auberge 
and (the golf course's) clients.  You can understand that this 
represents a major part of the (Auberge's) receipts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned.  A Compass poll released March 30 
showed that 63% of Canadians think the Prime Minister was wrong 
in lobbying, 60% of Canadians want an independent public inquiry, 
and 85% feel it is necessary to get to the bottom of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did this develop?  The Prime Minister himself set the 
standard in 1993 but he has not met his own standards.  The 
following are quotations from the 1993 red book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence today of considerable dissatisfaction with 
government and a steady erosion of confidence in the people and 
institutions of the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have 
to do with the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others 
with an arrogant style of political leadership. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the Liberals were talking about Mulroney, but I 
think it pertains even more to the present administration.  It 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are irritated with governments that do not consult 
them, or that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key 
parts of the public business behind closed doors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did this happen?  What is the history of this development? 
We must go back a little to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the member for St. Maurice quit politics to build his 
private holdings.  In May 1988, along with two business partners, 
his company J&AC Consultants Inc. bought the Grand-Mère golf 
course for $625,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1993 the money losing Auberge Grand-Mère next to the 
golf course was sold to an old friend of the Prime Minister's, 
Yvon Duhaime.  The deal was completed just before the Prime 
Minister was sworn into office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says he sold his one-quarter share in the 
Grand-Mère golf course on November 1, 1993, to a wealthy Toronto 
real estate developer, Jonas Prince, for $300,000 plus interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sales agreement with Jonas Prince is dated November 1, 1993. 
It is a handwritten note scrawled on a blank piece of paper. It 
is not witnessed or notarized.  It is without independent 
confirmation of date.  We do not even know what province it was 
signed in or what law governs it, yet it was drafted by two 
corporate lawyers.  It is quite a note and quite a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in two letters to the <I>National Post</I> dated 
December 1998, Jonas Prince denied buying the share and said it 
was merely an option to purchase.  He sent back the corporate 
records of the golf course unsigned, took no part in its 
management, paid $40,000 in compensation in 1997 and thought that 
was the end of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not.  When the Prime Minister needed money he phoned his 
lawyer and found the debt was unpaid. 
He then phoned the ethics counsellor at home on a Saturday, 
January 27, 1996.  It must have been pretty important for him to 
call on a Saturday.  The ethics counsellor advised the Prime 
Minister he could sell the shares or declare publicly that he 
owned them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister did neither for three years until a newspaper 
broke the story in January 1999.  Instead he began lobbying for 
grants and loans for the Auberge Grand-Mère next to the golf 
club.  He had a meeting with immigrant investors on February 28, 
1996, made repeated phone calls to the Business Development Bank, 
and lobbied HRDC for job creation grants in 1996 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven months after the Prime Minister learned he was still owed 
money for the shares, a wealthy friend of the Prime Minister's, 
Claude Gauthier, bought a piece of land from the Grand-Mère Golf 
Club for $525,000.  That was in September 1996, days after 
Gauthier won a $6 million CIDA contract for which he was not even 
qualified to bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gauthier's company, Transelec, then donated $10,000 to the Prime 
Minister's personal election campaign in 1997.  The Prime 
Minister won that campaign, I might remind the House, by just 
1,600 votes.  During the campaign things were pretty hot and 
furious in Grand-Mère and Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later in 1998 HRDC created an illegal trust fund to hold $1.2 
million in grant money so that Mr. Gauthier could purchase a 
company in the throes of bankruptcy.  He declared bankruptcy six 
months later anyway and started the company again with fewer 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A friend of the Prime Minister recently said the golf club was 
still in the Prime Minister's hands and that he was still a 
registered shareholder.  Melissa Marcotte is quoted in the 
<I>National Post</I> on March 23, 2001, as saying that the minutes 
of the share registry book had not been signed since 1994.  I 
guess the minutes have been corrected at Industry Canada now.  I 
would like to see them but we do not have the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout all this the Prime Minister knew he was owed $300,000 
for his shares.  He had not been paid for his shares in the golf 
course.  He knew that Jonas Prince thought he did not own the 
shares.  He was kept abreast of the efforts to sell them by both 
the ethics counsellor and his lawyer Debbie Weinstein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's claims are simply not credible.  Jonas 
Prince sold his hotel chain for $90 million.  He could have paid 
for the Grand-Mère Golf Club shares out of pocket change.  Why 
did he not?  It is because he never believed he owned the shares. 
Six years went by and he never paid for the shares.  He did not 
pay for them because he did not believe he owned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time heavy pressure has been put on Mr. Prince and he 
has changed his tune.  He obviously believed he did not own the 
shares.  Otherwise he would have paid for them.  Why would a 
successful businessman like Mr. Prince risk the wrath of the 
Prime Minister of Canada by not honouring what was supposed to be 
a bill of sale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense.  It does not pass the smell test.  In 
other words, as the old saying goes, there is something rotten in 
the state of Denmark.  That describes the situation perfectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on.  Let us talk about the blind trust issue which 
is very interesting as well.  On March 1, 1994, the Prime 
Minister put all the business affairs of his holding company, 
J&AC Consultants Inc., in a blind trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's declaration on the ethics counsellor's 
website says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I declare that I hold a third of the shares of J&AC Consultants 
Inc., a private company managed by a third party who is not 
dependent on me and without a right of regard on my part. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However on January 27, 1996, the Prime Minister violated the 
blind trust and called his lawyer and the ethics counsellor 
regarding the sale of the shares.  That is some blind trust.  It 
is a little like the reason Sinclair Stevens had to leave the 
House, I would add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister had distanced himself the controversy may 
well have been over.  If it was a blind trust, the obvious 
question for Canadians is how he knew the shares had come back to 
him.  It is a pretty obvious question yet it has not been 
answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor said the debt did not need to be declared 
because of a “deficient form” that did not require him to 
declare debts.  However the Prime Minister voluntarily put his 
company into a blind trust.  He was not ordered to do so.  He 
voluntarily did so.  He broke his own promise to have no right of 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 23, 1999, The Prime Minister stated in the House that 
he had voluntarily put his debt in a blind trust: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put all my assets in the trust.  It is a blind trust.  I was 
not forced to give her the management.  I did exactly that so I 
would not have to reply to that type of question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor confirmed that the Prime Minister had 
broken that trust.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us discuss the Business Development Bank loan.  The Prime 
Minister phoned the president of the Business Development Bank 
twice and once lobbied him at 24 Sussex Drive.  That needs to be 
explained and that is why we need a judicial inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is simply not credible on the issue.  Many 
questions need to answered.  It is not normal to phone the 
president of the Business Development Bank.  Members of 
parliament do not have such access.  The Prime Minister did so 
and he put pressure on him.  The net result was that the loan was 
given.  When the loan was pulled two years later because no 
payments had been made, the president of the Business Development 
Bank was fired.  What a strange coincidence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
wonder if the member could advise the House if he is aware of 
whether the receivable that was created on the sale of the shares 
is a registerable item under the rules guiding blind trust?  Has 
he checked that out?  Does he know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do know that the 
Prime Minister was never paid for the shares.  Even though they 
were said to be sold on November 1, 1993, he never received 
payment.  The Prime Minister therefore had a clear interest in 
the shares.  Mr. Jonas Prince never paid for them during that 
period, whether he owned them or not.  When the Prime Minister 
lobbied the president of the Business Development Bank in 1996 
and 1997 he was clearly in a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the blind trust issue, it is pretty clear that the Prime 
Minister should not meddle in a blind trust.  He did not need to 
put his shares there.  He did so voluntarily, which makes it all 
the worse that he did not deal with the issue properly.  He 
violated the spirit of the blind trust. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, to the member for Peace River, several business 
people have come into my office to determine what kinds of loans 
are available for business ventures, investments or perhaps grant 
type loans to help their businesses expand or get over a hump.  I 
have met perhaps a dozen such people during the years I have been 
in parliament, and I have advised them to go to the Business 
Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives from the Business Development Bank have advised 
me on the services they provide.  At no time have I ever had an 
opportunity, if I should put it that way, to force, strong arm or 
cajole BDC representatives into giving loans to the people who 
come to my office for assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the sequence of events surrounding the Business 
Development Corporation loan.  The first occurred when the Prime 
Minister contacted the president of the Business Development 
Bank, first by telephone and later by lobbying him at 24 Sussex 
Drive, to get a loan for the golf course and hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member see as abnormal about that compared 
to, say, what might happen in any member's office when loan 
applications go through indirectly to the Business Development 
Corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for the question.  It is a very good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a normal situation, as the Prime Minister would have 
us believe.  It is far from it.  The president of the Business 
Development Bank is indirectly an employee of parliament.  BDC is 
a crown corporation, a government owned bank.  The Prime Minister 
phoned the president of that bank and put pressure on him to give 
a loan to a friend who happens to own a hotel next to the Prime 
Minister's golf course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hotel failed and he did not get the loan, the value of 
the golf course would obviously have diminished.  This is far 
from a normal operation.  I do not know of any members of the 
House who have that kind of clout, the opportunity to phone the 
president of the Business Development Bank and ask for those 
kinds of favours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the BDC, Mr. Beaudoin, did not like it either. 
It took two calls plus heavy lobbying at the Prime Minister's 
residence to make it happen.  Even then the interest rates were 
put at 25% because he considered it a very high risk loan, and 
well he should have.  Two and a half years after getting the loan 
no payments had been made.  That is why the BDC president advised 
that there should be foreclosure.  As soon as that happened the 
bank manager lost his job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, we should take a few minutes in the 
debate for Canadians to consider why they should care whether the 
Prime Minister breached the code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians care?  Members opposite, especially on the 
front benches, have said that we should be talking about other 
things in the House and that Canadians care about other things. 
It is important that we consider why Canadians should care about 
whether their Prime Minister breached the code of ethics. Today's

the House of Commons is so important to Canadians.

desperate members opposite are to stop the debate and interrupt 
it in any way.  I say shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Yugoslavia are saying today that they are a civilized 
people.  Why do they need to say that?  It is because of the very 
uncivilized actions that have taken place in that country 
recently.  A Balkan expert has replied to the question of why Mr. 
Milosevic did what he did.  He said it was power, money and 
greed.  It was that simple.  He was motivated completely by a 
desire to stay in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States diplomat Richard Holbrooke's memoirs of the

absolute sense of shame that the member would somehow try to link 
this place or our Prime Minister to Milosevic who has been 
arrested and will be charged with crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no relevance whatsoever to using that as a comparative. 
I ask the member to withdraw those remarks and to apologize to 
the House and to Canadians for trying to make such a despicable— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Earlier, and the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I suggest that if it 
was not entirely relevant there would not be such desperation on 
the other side to put a stop to the allusion. 
The quote continues:

seen in Yugoslavia, but the principles are precisely the same. 
That is why the debate is so terribly important to Canadians, 
their families and their future, and to our country.  Without 
truth what do we have?  We have only manipulation.  We have only

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Order, please.  We 
will call a time out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I suggest to 
Canadians that over the last two years questions have been raised 
about whether the Prime Minister failed to exercise his unique 
and tremendous position of power in a fair and impartial way 
because he had something to gain or lose personally from certain 
actions that he took in ensuring that the public's money was 
allocated to friends and businesses in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also a troubling and appalling number of instances 
where the Prime Minister's statements in the House on the matter 
proved not to square with the facts as they came out later. 
Canadians have a direct stake in the outcome of this matter 
First, truth telling is the glue that holds a civilized society 
together.  Second, only ethics and honesty can serve to protect 
the relationship between the governors and the governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this has been a very important convention in our 
parliamentary tradition.  It is fair to say that our 
parliamentary traditions hold that to mislead or make a false 
statement to the House is about the most serious sin a minister 
could commit.  To do so would be a complete rejection of 
parliamentary values.  How can a government be held responsible 
if it will not be honest in statements to the House?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been considered a fundamental principle in the 
parliamentary system that the government would always be honest 
in the House of Commons.  This has always been considered 
essential and absolutely fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an example of this during the Pearson administration. 
Prime minister Pearson took a very serious view of an occasion 
where he inadvertently and innocently misled the House.  This was 
documented in Gordon Robertson's book <I>Memoirs of a Very Civil 
Servant</I> which recounts the facts surrounding the Rivard case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pearson was asked in the House of Commons as to when he was 
advised of the situation.  He made a response, but in effect it 
was incorrect.  He had been advised of the situation by his 
justice minister two weeks earlier.  His mind was busy with other 
things and he had forgotten the conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one knew that he had been advised earlier than what he told 
the House.  Nobody knew except him and his minister.  Yet the 
prime minister took this so seriously and was so concerned that 
he had misinformed the House, even though it was innocent, that 
he set up the Dorion commission to inquire into the affair. When 
all the facts came out the commission cleared the prime minister 
of any wrongdoing in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a situation where misleading the House had been 
innocent.  It had been inadvertent, unintentional, and no one 
knew about it.  It was not a matter of public record.  Prime 
minister Pearson took his ethical responsibilities so seriously 
that he set up a public commission to look into his own innocent 
and inadvertent statement in the House.  Members should contrast 
that with what we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has repeatedly on record in the House of 
Commons made statements that clearly do not square with the facts 
that have come out later.  We are asking for the kind of 
commission that Pearson set up under far less serious 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Liberal government do?  Does it uphold 
parliamentary conventions?  Does it uphold the ethical standards 
of the Pearson administration?  No, it has sunk so low that the 
truth will be hidden.  It is important that Canadians get the 
truth because without truth there is no safety, no accountability 
and no democracy.

landmines still remaining in Croatia, a small part of the former 
Yugoslavia.

Some may even be listening to the speech the hon. member has just

feels it is appropriate to make fun of the misery that they 
endured in order to make a cheap political point?  How could she 
make an accusation, and a ridiculous one at that, against the 
Prime Minister of the greatest country in the world that greeted 
and welcomed those refugees of the misery perpetrated according 
to the international tribunal in The Hague and possibly inflicted 
by Milosevic?  We are not making those accusations.  A worldwide

whether she has ever had the opportunity of seeing what life over

She may or may not have a point to debate with other members, but 
that is no excuse for the kind of statement she just made.  It

intelligence of the many people on earth who have suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the 
House leader for the government got the point that I was making 
because it is a very important one.  I again quote from Richard 
Holbrooke's memoirs.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Analysts agree that southern Europe might today be a much 
different place had Mr. Milosevic's talents been tempered by 
morality.  But if nothing else, Mr. Milosevic's fall sends a 
message to politicians that ultimate power does not eliminate 
accountability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there is morality, ethics and honesty in 
government because truth telling is the glue that holds a 
civilized society together.  It is also the glue that holds a 
democracy together.  Only ethics and honesty can serve to protect 
the governed from those who govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope and pray that the government will care enough about 
honesty and ethics that it will give the Canadian people the gift 
of knowing that their Prime Minister is wholly, completely and 
irrefutably honest.  Only an independent inquiry, after all the 
lies, misrepresentations and things that do not add up come out—

Canadian when I hear the member compare our current Prime 
Minister to the likes of Milosevic.  She owes Canadians an 
apology.  She should stand in her place now and apologize to her 
constituents and to Canadians for such a ridiculous level that 
she has stooped to in this affair.  It shows the complete lack of 
facts that members opposite are basing this accusation on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, truth is important in 
Yugoslavia and truth is important in Canada.  If the government 
does not care about the truth at least it can care enough about

compare someone accused of crimes against humanity, of fraud, of 
theft and who may be tried in The Hague by an international court

she has tried to compare a right hon. member of this place to 
that person by using terminology such as “the answers have to

How many ways does one person in this place call another one a 
liar?  That is what I heard, but I do not see anyone over there 
with the courage to stand and say it.  Instead the opposition 
hides behind phraseology, trickery and debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing I can say is that unlike many of my colleagues in 
this place I am not a lawyer.  As a result it gives me a unique 
perspective in looking through all the nonsense that is being 
hurled around here that is nothing more than legal bafflegab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are clear.  The opposition demanded that the ethics 
counsellor look into the matter after having accused the Prime 
Minister of having a conflict of interest.  That is what it asked 
for, and he did it.  The opposition did not like the answer, so 
the only weapon it had left was to attack the integrity of the 
ethics counsellor, a man whose integrity is beyond reproach. 
That is all it could do.  It does not like the answer, so it 
tries to shoot the messenger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the fifth party, a man who is the only other 
person in this place to share the title right honourable, 
requested that the RCMP investigate and look into criminal 
activity.  When the RCMP replies that there is no criminal 
activity, what does he do? He cloaks himself around the guise of 
being a bit holier than thou by suggesting that he was not saying 
the Prime Minister was dishonest, but on the other hand he did 
not believe the Prime Minister was telling the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say that the Prime Minister is not a liar but 
on the other hand truth has to win out.  They say truth will win 
out, but he is not lying.  What kinds of games are these? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can see through this nonsense.  This is nothing more 
than a witch hunt like no other I have ever witnessed in my 23 
years in public office.  It is an attempt by the opposition to 
destroy one man.  Why?  It is because they cannot win any other 
way.  They have tried by walking through the front door of 
parliament, but the closest they get is a sniff of sitting across 
in the opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot get in the front door through the electoral process, 
so they find another strategy.  They tear down the institution. 
They tell Canadians that parliament is dysfunctional and that 
nothing works.  They prove it by harassing and continually 
bringing forward motions that make this place extremely difficult 
to work in.  They destroy themselves and then they become reborn. 
It is an amazing strategy to behold.  How does one tear down the 
institute of parliament?  It is done by attacking the top member 
of the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members wanted to see the bill of sale.  Members on all sides 
said that if the bill of sale were shown it would solve this in a 
heartbeat.  Those are not our words.  They said that this could 
be solved in a heartbeat.  The Prime Minister talked to the 
ethics counsellor and decided to release the documents.  He 
released not only the bill of sale but 10 supporting documents 
that go with the bill of sale that explain every question members 
opposite have asked.  Was that acceptable?  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is being denigrated as being written on a napkin at a 
kool-aid stand.  Canadians see through that.  It is a handwritten 
document.  That is not unusual.  I have entered into agreements 
myself that have been handwritten on stationery and signed.  It 
is the intent that matters, and members know that.  The Prime 
Minister sold the shares in 1993.  What could be more clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member opposite said that the Prime Minister voluntarily put 
his shares into a blind trust.  That is absolutely not the truth. 
It is a fallacious statement that is not based on the historical 
record.  He did not have shares to put into a blind trust.  They 
did not exist in his possession.  He was owed money and it is 
ironic that at the end of the day the man lost money.  It has to 
be one of the worst business deals he has ever done.  He lost 
something in the neighbourhood of $50,000 on the sale of those 
shares.  Why did Mr. Prince not pay him?  How would we know?  How 
would he know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister turned the matter, the collection of a debt 
and that is all it was, over to his trustee.  The trustee worked 
co-operatively with the commissioner to try to collect the moneys 
that were properly and duly owed to the Prime Minister and his 
family.  Should he be penalized because he is the Prime Minister 
or a member of parliament?  Should he say to forget the debt, 
that he would wash his hands of it, and that he would not try to 
collect it because he is in public office?  Should he not be able 
to do his job as a member of parliament on behalf of his 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one talks about the fact that the first loan application for 
the hotel was for $2 million.  That was turned down by the bank. 
How much did they actually get when they got the loan approved? 
After some assistance from their MP, how much did they actually 
get?  It was $615,000, a far cry from $2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it unusual for a loan to be turned down and for the applicant 
to be told to go back to redo the business plan, to set out the 
issues in priority and to return with an alternative proposal for 
a lesser amount?  It is about as normal as any other kind of 
business transaction that I can imagine.  Loans were received 
from the caisse populaire.  Is there something wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why people want to destroy businesses in the 
Prime Minister's riding.  I understand the political motivation 
for trying to destroy him.  It is the only way that they can take 
over this place.  The damage that is being done to innocent 
people at the ground level who are not in the blood sport called 
politics, who do not have an axe to grind in any of this, is most 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition wants an inquiry, I have one.  The Leader of 
the Opposition when he was a member in Alberta falsely made an 
accusation against a local lawyer.  He made derogatory remarks 
for which he was sued and for which he subsequently settled upon 
fear of being found guilty.  He settled and the taxpayers were 
left with a bill of almost $800,000.  Of that, $400,000 went to 
the law firm that defended the Leader of the Opposition.  Is it 
not somewhat puzzling when it came out that there was an election 
contribution of $70,000 by that same law firm to the Canadian 
Alliance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon revealing the information that the $70,000 contribution had 
been made to the Canadian Alliance, the same law firm recanted. 
It said that it was not the firm, that it was one of its 
partners.  It got the receipt back and asked that another receipt 
be issued in the name of an individual.  It was one person, one 
man, one lawyer who worked as a partner in the same law firm that 
represented the Leader of the Opposition in a defamation law 
suit, who donated $70,000.  Members should think about that. That 
man needs help:  $70,000 as a donation to one political party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it an astounding coincidence that the $70,000 donation to 
one political party is the same amount that was made by the legal 
firm.  It is the same amount for which the law firm requested 
that the receipt be withdrawn and a new one issued to the 
individual.  Is there something wrong with that?  Maybe we need 
an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say and reiterate that this is clearly one 
of the most despicable attempts by an opposition, granted a 
united opposition, that has only one goal, and that is to destroy 
the Prime Minister of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member opposite was in municipal politics as he said 
during his intervention.  I would like to ask him a question 
about his time in municipal politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also spent a little time on my town council.  Whenever there 
was an issue that arose in which I had any influence at all, such 
as property I had owned, or an interest in a roadway or possibly 
a company that I had some interest in, I always stepped aside and 
did not vote on or discuss issues like that in the municipal 
arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the hon. member ever have the same opportunity to step aside 
and not vote on an issue in municipal government?  Does he see, 
and I would honestly like to know, a difference between the 
municipal level and the federal level?  I think there is a 
difference.  I do not see nor hear that same approach here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the member have the opportunity to not vote on an issue that 
he might have had an interest in?  Does he think that the same 
ethical standards should apply in the federal parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, my record in municipal 
government is quite open to the public.  I want to share 
something that is relevant to the hon. gentleman's question.  It 
is from the Standing Orders of the House of Commons.  Regarding 
what one should not do, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offer of any money or other advantage to any Member of the 
House, for the promoting of any manner whatsoever depending or to 
be transacted in Parliament, is a high crime and misdemeanour, 
and tends to the subversion of the Constitution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the hon. member that there is someone in 
this place who in my view has contravened this section.  It is 
the leader of the fifth party.  He accepted money from his party, 
money that was raised by public or private contributions to the 
party, and accepted it as an extra emolument to his salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want another inquiry?  Why do we not look into that 
conflict of interest and find out just exactly where the member 
is getting his money from, how much he is getting, who is 
contributing and how he can justify taking extra money to perform 
his duties in this place? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know 
whether the hon. member across the way has managed to convince 
himself, but he has certainly not convinced me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in transactions for twenty years, and I 
have sold shares like this.  When there is a sale of shares that 
involves an unpaid balance of $300,000, normally guarantees are 
set out.  Normally, such a contract would be a minimum of 20 
pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the member opposite claims to know the whole truth of the 
Prime Minister's saga, perhaps he could explain how the Prime 
Minister's company, a numbered company, bought from Consolidated 
Bathurst, at one point, nearly half the riding of Shawinigan for 
one dollar and other fair and reasonable considerations?  Could 
he explain what these considerations were, he who claims to know 
every aspect of the Prime Minister's personal transactions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put this question to him, he who alleges difficulties in the 
case of certain members of other parties.  This involves a 
contract worth $300,000 with a $300,000 balance of the selling 
price.  It is true that the parties' intent is capital.  It is 
true that it could be written on the corner of a napkin, as he 
says, except that generally there are guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member's logic holds, how is it that the Prime 
Minister intervened in the second sale in 1999, this time to 
support burdens more onerous than those contained in the first 
agreement of sale, which was an absolute sale, apparently in 1993?

response. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will give the hon. 
gentleman at least credit for dealing with the issues, unlike 
much of the debate I have heard opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that I have heard in business and in legal 
circles, and that is that the contract is only as good as the two 
people who enter into it.  I think people accept that as a fact. 
The member can laugh but it is the factual way of doing business 
right across this country.  Many times it is done, I might add, 
on a handshake.  However, I am not sure members opposite would 
understand that level of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contract was clearly signed by both people.  They were seen 
to be people of faith.  I think the Prime Minister would have 
good reason to trust Mr. Prince and there is no question that Mr. 
Prince would have good reason to trust the Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, last 
Thursday the House had a vote on an adjournment motion.  After 
that vote was taken, I remember standing out in the lobby.  I saw 
a member of parliament in the midst of other members of 
parliament having a little fun about what had just happened in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting that when some reporters with cameras 
came into the area, the lights went on and the whole thing 
changed.  All of a sudden there was a substantial amount of 
animation.  Quite frankly what happened was people started to 
perform and this probably did not show this place in its best 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens in question period every day.  The press 
are up in the gallery and looking down for the news clip.  It 
is looking for the quotable quote and members are jockeying for 
that position.  It does not show us in a good light and that is 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to the debate and heard some things which 
concerned me.  The leader of the Bloc Quebecois said 
unequivocally “I do not accept things on faith”.  There is just 
nothing in this place that he will believe.  He will not accept 
the facts and he wants to continue to go on so there is no trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP leader talked about a number of things.  In particular, 
she referred to someone she called the ethics commissioner.  She 
referred to the ethics commissioner at least three times and 
attributed a number of points to this person.

correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the leader of the Conservatives and its House 
leader. They talked about the bill of sale and said that it 
looked like it was done with crayon on a napkin, that it was not 
witnessed, that the province was not there and that there were no 
witnesses.  The bill of sale is a document which represents an 
agreement between two people.  What they did not do was to 
comment on whether or not it was a legal agreement.  All of the 
other information corroborates that that was the deal and that 
the agreement was signed by two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our system of law even oral contracts, simply the undertaking 
by two people to each other, is enforceable in law.  We do not 
have a witness.  We do not have signatures.  We do not even have 
a piece of paper.  It is the word of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives will not even accept the fact that there was a 
sale, notwithstanding the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Alliance spoke this morning and reviewed a 
number of the facts.  I asked if could he confirm certain facts 
about the amount of the loan to the application of the Auberge 
Grand-Mère request to the BDC.  He absolutely refused to answer 
the question.  He refused to acknowledge even basic facts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House is basically to set up an inquiry 
with the broadest possible terms so that we can continue to go in 
all different directions.  However, the opposition has 
demonstrated very clearly to the House that it is not prepared to 
accept the word or any fact that is presented in this place or is 
stated by a member.  That is what the crux of this issue.  To me 
the crux is whether or not, as the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
stated in her speech, trust is what makes parliamentary 
institutions work.  We have to have trust and we expect trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament it struck me that we were 
always referred to as all hon. members.  The Speaker often 
reminds members that we take members at their word.  When they 
say things that they believe to be true we accept that.  That is 
part of the point the member for Calgary—Nose Hill was trying to 
make, and I agree with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this place work if we do not have trust?  If the Prime 
Minister of Canada rises in this place, which he has done many 
times, and says he sold his shares November 1, 1993, will we 
believe him or are we going to by suggestion, innuendo, smearing 
or condemnation not trust what was said?  It is certainly an easy 
way to continue the dialogue, but when do we trust what someone 
says? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that if a member stands in this place and makes a 
representation I, as a member of parliament, accept that person 
at his or her word.  I am not going to take the tact, which is 
been taken now, that somehow we can say people are guilty until 
they prove they are innocent.  Let us table all the documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press has a lot to do with this.  The hypothesis was that 
the opposition was not doing its job so the press had to stand in 
and do the job for it.  Opposition members find that difficult to 
accept, but the fact is the media tend to spur on some of the 
debate.  We could see the questioning by some of the Alliance 
coming directly from quotes in the newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came to Ottawa this week to see the headline that the first 
priority for members of parliament was another week's vacation. 
Is that in fact a fair representation of the facts?  Of course 
not.  Members said they would like to spend a week with their 
family during the March break and asked if there was some way to 
rejig the schedule to come back a week earlier so they could take 
off the week during March break to spend some time with their 
families.  How did the press report it?  Members' first priority 
was another week's vacation.  The representative of the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation was smearing us because we wanted another 
week of vacation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the press gets away with this nonsense?  Maybe to 
quote the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, how does it get away 
with this crap?  That is exactly what it is.  It is not a fair 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we get drawn into this matter then we will be drawn into 
other things like the representation with regard to Mr. Duhaime's 
comments in a Quebec proceeding with regard to a liquor licence. 
The media described it as newly revealed testimony by the owner 
of the Auberge Grand-Mère.  Was it newly revealed?  Of course it 
was not.  It was from last November.  Was it private?  No, it was 
a public proceeding.  There were transcripts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Was it contrary to what the Prime 
Minister said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  The member asked was it contradictory, of 
course it was.  Mr. Duhaime said that he had a hotel that 
depended on the golf course in which the Prime Minister was a 
part owner.  Last November the Prime Minister was not a part 
owner of a golf course.  He sold his shares in 1993.  There is a 
contradiction by Mr. Duhaime, and members are arguing whether Mr. 
Prince or Mr. Duhaime are saying things.  If they have a problem 
with the facts that are represented by others not in this place, 
maybe they should go to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close on what I think is happening.  I believe 
that in this matter the opposition has repeatedly used the House 
of Commons as a shelter to make baseless allegations, spread 
outrageous innuendo and smear the reputations of, not only the 
Prime Minister but his family and anyone else who happens to 
disagree with their opinion.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what is happening here.  As for the press, who 
have no ethical standards themselves, no ethics commissioner or 
counsellor and no rules of the game except to sell as many papers 
as they want, let them report on the facts and let us judge the 
media on how they report the baseless allegations of the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has asked in the motion today to establish a 
judicial inquiry with the broadest possible terms.  It has asked 
for a licence to go wherever it wants, when in fact the issue 
here clearly is whether there was a conflict of interest during 
the tenure of the Prime Minister.  The facts are clear that the 
shares were sold on November 1, 1993.  The only interest at all 
that the Prime Minister carried after that time was the fact that 
moneys were owed to him by Mr. Jonas Prince. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Jonas Prince and the Prime Minister's consulting firm, his 
company, were the only two parties to this.  There was nothing 
that could happen subsequent to that, no loan amount, no effort, 
nothing else, that could change the amount that he was owed. 
There was nothing he could do and nothing he could say. 
Therefore, there is no ongoing financial interest with regard to 
the golf course or the hotel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I found the last set of comments rather interesting.  I 
have known the hon. member for quite some time and I am very 
surprised at the nature of his comments, because it seems to me 
that the Prime Minister at one time made the statement here in 
the House that he was just an ordinary MP doing what an ordinary 
MP would do to help his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, an MP is to look after the interests of his constituents 
and to make representations, but the Prime Minister claimed that 
he was just an ordinary MP.  The Prime Minister is anything but 
an ordinary MP.  The Prime Minister is the chief official of the 
country and of the government, who has power and authority over 
the hon. member and can tell the hon. member whether he can stay 
in caucus or not.  He can tell the hon. member whether he is 
going to continue to be a member of the Liberal Party.  He can 
tell the hon. member how to vote in the House.  Yet the Prime 
Minister himself says that he is just an ordinary MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is an ordinary MP but not the Prime Minister, so 
I ask the hon. member, how big does a lie have to be to be a lie? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Excuse me.  Before 
the hon. member answers, the word lie has been used quite 
frequently in the last few minutes.  I would ask the hon. members 
to be very careful in their choice of words, please.  I will 
permit the hon. member to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, what just transpired here 
is a classic example of exactly what has been going on.  I do not 
think it merits a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does, I believe, merit some further comment is the 
fundamental issue.  The Prime Minister represented to this place 
and to all Canadians that he sold his shares on November 1, 1993. 
The amount owing to him, the party, the date, et cetera, were 
specified and are known to members.  As a result of that 
transaction prior to the Prime Minister in fact becoming a prime 
minister, that meant the investment in those shares no longer 
existed and therefore was not reportable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another fact that has to do with the receivable of the 
Prime Minister with regard to the proceeds on the sale.  Members 
have said that this represents the ongoing financial interest. 
First, the receivable for the shares is from a Mr. Jonas Prince, 
through his company.  It is his company.  There is an agreement 
of purchase and sale between those two parties for $300,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing will change the amount that the Prime Minister 
ultimately could recover.  He is entitled to only $300,000. 
Nothing could happen in terms of the operations of the hotel or 
golf course that will change whether or not he will get more or 
less than $300,000.  The only thing that affects how much the 
Prime Minister recovers on that receivable is the transaction he 
has with the third party, Mr. Jonas Prince. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How come he lost $50,000 then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member asks how come 
he lost $50,000.  The member should know that the amount the 
Prime Minister lost is not relative to the $300,000.  It is 
relative to how much he paid initially for the shares, and I do 
not think the member knows how much was paid.  When we file a tax 
return and declare our gain or loss on shares, it is not how much 
was the selling price but how much our proceeds are relative to 
our initial cost plus the cost of disposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough continues to make 
the point, which I wish he would clarify, that there is a 
financial relationship between Jonas Prince and the Prime 
Minister that is clear in terms of its amount and that there is 
nothing that can affect it which has anything to do with the golf 
course or with the hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, if he gets less than $300,000 in proceeds, 
could sue Mr. Prince for the balance.  It is a legal contract. 
The member knows that.  If Mr. Prince honours the whole deal 
there is interest as well.  They may later come to an agreement 
which will change that subsequently, as the member well knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we as a parliament to get involved in the financial dealings 
of two persons unrelated to the activities or operations of the 
Grand-Mère hotel or the golf course?  I suggest that it is none 
of our business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to say that I am pleased to rise on 
debate today, but it is not a very pretty topic, is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something I think Canadians are concerned about.  We hear 
people on the street asking why we should be consumed with this. 
They ask why this is important enough to take up the time of the 
House.  Some people even say that we need to get on to the 
nation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the answer to those questions is the issue of the 
integrity of the Prime Minister's Office.  If that ain't the 
nation's business, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that around $160 billion comes funnelling into this 
place and then gets distributed and dispersed across the country 
over any fiscal year.  It is an unbelievable pile of cash.  I 
think Canadians on the street are saying that if there is any 
cloud of doubt about the Shawinigate deal, then how big is the 
cloud of doubt about the guy at the top who dishes out the money 
and disperses it through the finance minister and cabinet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of things that make this issue one of utter 
importance to every Canadian.  Surely if this is the place and 
the seat of government, the fellow who sits in the top seat must 
not only be seen to be clean.  At the very appearance of any 
Shawinigate scandal, it seems to me, he should be the first one 
saying he needs to make sure that this is right out in the open 
and before all Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a number of contradictions in the facts.  The Prime 
Minister directly contradicted himself.  He said there were no 
links between the golf course and the hotel.  I guess it is a 
cute pun and I suppose he is good at humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 2 the owner of the Auberge Grand-Mère, Yvon Duhaime, 
said under oath, as said the member who was just speaking about 
it a few minutes ago, that agreements, accounts and contracts 
were made between the auberge and the golf course's clients.  We 
can understand that this represents a major part of the auberge's 
receipts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just think this is unbelievable, because the Prime Minister 
said there was no connection whatsoever.  I am sure you have 
seen, Madam Speaker, if you have not driven there yourself, that 
the signs are one and the same.  The sign says to go this way for 
the Auberge Grand-Mère and that way for the golf course.  I was on 
the show <I>counterSpin</I>, when Peter Blaikie said he was not a 
great golfer but he could hit a golf ball from the golf course 
right into the bar at the Auberge Grand-Mère.  They were linked 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Prime Minister to brush it off and say that there was 
absolutely no connection whatsoever simply is not true.  I think 
parliament needs to get to the bottom of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very pleased as a member of the official opposition 
to suggest we get this out of the hands of politicians.  We 
should get it right out of parliament.  This should be taken to 
an independent judicial inquiry where someone will take a little 
heftier look at this than the ethics counsellor, the guy who gets 
paid by the Prime Minister, remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the red book, which was campaigned on in 1993, as I recall, 
there was to be an ethics commissioner reporting to parliament, 
not just to the Prime Minister.  Yet here we are this many years 
later.  In fact the ethics counsellor has contradicted himself 
any number of times.  I may get to some his contradictory 
statements in a moment.  However he then had coffee with the 
Prime Minister and said everything was okay.  There is no 
credibility in that whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make sure that we get an ethics counsellor who becomes an 
ethics commissioner, who has real teeth and will be able to say 
that something smells and we had better do something about it. As 
we know it has taken up an unbelievable amount of time in the 
House.  As well it taints every decision the government makes 
because people want to make sure that there is integrity in 
government.  When people come here, I am sure not just for my 
speech but for question period, they want to be able to trust the 
people in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Toronto asked a couple of minutes ago before my 
speech how this place works if we do not have trust.  That is a 
really excellent question.  The real question is:  How will this 
place ever work if we do not earn trust?  Trust needs to be 
earned.  It is not having someone show up and say “Trust me”. 
We have had that happen before any number of times in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the Canadian public to see that elected officials earn 
the trust of the Canadian public.  Frankly the Prime Minister has 
done himself a lot of damage because there really is no trust. He 
has not earned it.  This affair has gone on for so long that it 
seems to me it is getting a little out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see more contradictions.  The Prime Minister said he sold his 
one-quarter share.  In fact we are not sure whether it is 25% or 
22%, but it is roughly a one-quarter share in the Grand-Mère golf 
course.  The Prime Minister swears up and down, and the troops 
parrot the line, that he sold those shares on November 1, 1993, 
to wealthy Toronto real estate developer Jonas Prince for 
$300,000 plus interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order and my question is actually for you.  I wonder if it is 
possible for the Speaker to rule on having an inquiry, which is 
requested by me, regarding the opposition party leader's deal 
with the then member of parliament, Jim Hart, to pay him $50,000 
to resign his seat so he could run in that riding.  I wonder if 
this is a subject for inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Resuming debate with 
the hon. member for Edmonton North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess we could say 
nice try.  Being a member of the government, surely he could 
bring that in as a bill himself one day.  He does not need a 
supply day for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was mentioning before I was interrupted, certainly pleasantly 
and not rudely, that the Prime Minister said he sold his shares 
on November 1— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do regret to interrupt the hon. member for 
Edmonton North, but as she knows at this time of day we have to 
move to statements by members.  We are about to do that, but I 
want to assure her that she will have three and a half minutes 
remaining in the time allotted for her remarks when the debate 
resumes at the conclusion of question period later this day.  I 
know we all look forward to hearing from the hon. member for 
Edmonton North.

infect Canadian herds, yet no plan of action has been presented 
by the government.  It is time now for the government to make 
public a comprehensive plan for minimizing the damage so that all

that is what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the fact that there has been no public inquiry not because 
the Prime Minister advised Mr. Michaud in a contract in 1999 
that, if there were one, his, the Prime Minister's, company, 
would pay legal costs?  Is he generous—

said, on March 15 of this year: 
“Does he not understand that the only way to settle this matter

I would draw to the member's attention the fact that, in 1993, 
just before we signed the agreement with the Americans 
definitively, we delayed signing the agreement with the Americans 
and the Mexicans, because we demanded of both countries that 
water be excluded from NAFTA.  That was done in 1993, and it 
establishes very clearly the government's position on water in 
international negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of those people should know that she has never lost a 
lawsuit. She has never gone to court nor settled a lawsuit in 
court.  Both members should withdraw the allegation immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know which hon. members the House 
leader is referring to, except that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  The industry minister and the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This sounds to me like a matter of debate 
rather than a point of order.  Disagreements about facts in 
speeches are commonplace in the House.  All of us have seen this 
from time to time.  Indeed, there are constant allegations 
throughout our question periods that statements made by hon. 
members on both sides seem to be incorrect.  Sometimes the word 
false is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members sometimes feel that the facts are 
misrepresented.  That is just a matter of debate.  I am sorry but 
I do not think it is a case where the Chair ought to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley have 
something to add on this point? 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  I would like to say that it was 
a false accusation that was placed on me.  I would like to give 
notice of a future point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I guess we will hear about it as a question 
of privilege later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly respect your ruling that this is a matter of 
debate rather than a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say, for greater certainty, to the member opposite that I 
stand by the statement that the member made an allegation about a 
public servant and had to publicly apologize for that allegation 
under threat of a lawsuit.  That being said, whether or not it 
finally ever went to court I do not know.  I do know she withdrew 
her allegation and apologized for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Perhaps that clarifies the matter.  I do not 
know.  I do know that it appears to be a matter of debate.  My 
original views on this are confirmed and perhaps we can move on.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is funny, but I just got the minister's last point. 
He did use the word slander pretty clearly.  They toss it around 
fairly freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period the Prime Minister got up and gave a good 
rant.  He said that we should get back to the real problems of 
the country.  Do members know the real problems of the country? 
One problem is the lack of integrity in the very Prime Minister's 
office.  That is exactly what we are paying attention to today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister can huff and puff and say that the golf 
course had no financial relations with the inn, but there are in 
fact a number of contradictions.  The bill of sale, I think, is 
the most important one.  I find it quite hard to believe that a 
couple of lawyers actually signed that bill of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just a humble English teacher reading this handwriting, but 
it is hard to imagine that a couple of lawyers tossed this 
together.  With regard to the Prime Minister's name, which 
appears here, although of course I cannot read it, he has signed 
his whole name and at the bottom he has signed his initials.  The 
J and the C are completely different from the J and the C at the 
top of the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could ask my questions from question period again because they 
did not get answered.  Who was at the signing of this document 
and in what province was it actually signed?  In other words, 
where were the signatories?  The Prime Minister did say Ottawa. 
We will certainly be checking that out.  Dear knows where Jonas 
was on that day.  We will track him too.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the bill of sale there is no letterhead, witness, 
authorization, notarization or corporate seal.  There is 
absolutely nothing about any sort of deposit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you sold any golf course shares you might happen 
to have, I doubt if you would put the following on the bill of 
sale:  payment schedule B as follows, principal payments in four 
equal annual instalments with interest at the institutional first 
mortgage rates.  That was in 1993, as the Prime Minister 
continues to swear up and down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, Mr. Speaker, because I am sure you have read these 
files, that there was no payment in November 1994, no payment in 
November 1995 and it went on and on.  Absolutely nothing was paid 
for.  In fact we know Jonas Prince wanted to make sure he got out 
of the deal and someone else bought it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill of sale looks most suspicious when we look at the fact 
that it is even handwritten.  I would guess that one of those 
paper napkins is kind of hard to get through the typewriter or 
computer printer.  I know that certainly somebody somewhere, if 
this was actually official in November 1993, would have been able 
to put it together better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this whole thing ramping up, as the press has mentioned. 
I will end my remarks by talking about Warren Kinsella, who was 
the operative for the Prime Minister during the campaign.  He was 
writing a document and a message went around about it just last 
weekend.  When the report from Warren Kinsella came out there was 
a directive that said the article “Must appear in all CanWest 
papers.”  If there was ever anyone who was just getting into the 
fray and thinking that he was going to defend the Prime Minister, 
it only thickens the plot and puts the Prime Minister deeper into 
the glue.  There is only one way out of this and that is an 
independent inquiry so the Prime Minister can prove once and for 
all, if he is clean, that he is clean. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
certainly not defending anybody.  What I am doing is simply 
clarifying the record.  Sadly enough we have come to a situation 
today where we have aspersions being cast by that side of the 
House that are completely unfounded and inaccurate.  It really 
bothers me that the level of debate in the House has sunk to the 
level that it has today with the opposition Alliance bringing 
forth these heinous accusations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat and listened to the member for Edmonton North, who made a 
couple of disturbing statements in the House today.  It was 
something along the lines—I tried to write it down but she was 
speaking very quickly out of both sides of her mouth so it was 
difficult to get it down verbatim—of “they have no trust in 
what he says”.  I assume she was referring to Canadians when she 
said they. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the record.  We have a man who has dedicated 38 
years of his life to Canada, to federalism and to raising the 
quality of life for all Canadians.  On three separate occasions 
Canadians have shown their support and confidence in this 
individual and this party by electing three successive majority 
governments.  We have to extrapolate on that and keep in mind 
that as a result of those three successive majorities, we have 
three successive defeats on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we can get to the point.  They are personalizing, nothing 
more, based on the losses they have experienced three elections 
in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point for the member for Edmonton North is simply to remind 
her of and ask her to comment on the following.  In 1996 she 
attended in my riding and made a very clear statement that she 
felt it was a disgrace and absolutely ridiculous that Liberal 
members of parliament would accept a parliamentary pension from 
the House.  She said that and said she would never do it.  She 
said her party would never do it.  Here we stand when she has in 
fact done the complete opposite.  Who can Canadians trust?  Can 
they trust somebody who went on television and on air and made a 
commitment and backtracked on it, or a government that has 
offered good governance to the country for the last seven years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member started 
his remarks by saying he is not defending anybody.  I can 
understand why he would not want to defend anyone:  the Prime 
Minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned in my remarks that people have no trust in what he 
says.  I think the member was right when he said that Canadians 
are frustrated with this.  I am sure he would be stunned and 
surprised to learn that recent polls show that 54% of people who 
support the Liberal Party want an absolute and objective inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he has been exorcised, but let me address the pension 
issue.  I was in the member's riding in 1996, and have been to 
lots of places across the country, to address the fact that when 
I opted out of the MP pension plan I was perfectly happy to 
continue contributing to RRSPs for the rest of my life.  However 
the member knows, as all hon. members know, that as a result of 
negotiations last spring the Liberal Party put every member of 
parliament back into the pension plan, including myself.  Because 
I now must pay premiums into the MP pension plan I can no longer 
contribute to my RRSPs.  He could perhaps mention that to the 
people back home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a brief question to bring some focus back to the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we have seen these personal jibes going 
on here for the past number of hours.  However to get to the 
point of the motion, the evidence is mounting.  There is 
sufficient reason to take it out of the bear pit that is the 
House of Commons and put it into the hands of an impartial and 
objective forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly suggest that the only way to bring closure to the 
issue is to remove the partisanship and give the issue to a 
judicial or public inquiry.  Would the hon. member not agree that 
would be ample opportunity for the Prime Minister to exonerate 
himself?  If there is compelling evidence to suggest there was no 
conflict, such a non-partisan forum would be an ideal way to 
establish the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is probably the best 
thing.  There is bitter partisanship on the other side of the 
House and on this side too.  The best way to deal with the issue 
is to take it out of this place, because this is where politics 
reign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was attacked about the pension.  I find it strange when 
someone talks about going back on their word.  There was a little 
promise about scrapping, killing and abolishing the GST.  There 
was a little something about the Airbus affair.  It was a messy 
thing, was it not?  It seems very strange that the member here is 
not even in his seat but is wandering all over the Chamber 
hurling insults.  If the shoe fits he should wear it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is somewhat of a pleasure to speak to the motion put 
forward by my party today, although it is not a pleasure to speak 
about its content.  We need to set the record straight. We were 
forced into this debate by the actions of the Liberals and the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unfortunate because the personal ethics of most people 
would have ensured that the issue was answered in an open and 
transparent manner two years ago.  The official opposition has 
been following the issue for two years.  Many are appalled by 
that delay and the cover-up it has produced.  I say appalled 
because the issue could have been a simple acknowledgement and 
resolution by the Prime Minister when it first became public 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side of the House have gone on at great 
length today to argue that this is nothing but a smoke and 
mirrors show.  They say that there is nothing of substance 
involved and that the Prime Minister's reputation has been 
needlessly sullied.  I agree that it is a smoke and mirrors show, 
with a little fog thrown in for good measure.  Unfortunately the 
smoke, mirrors and fog have all emanated from the seats opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have cried out that a non-issue has hijacked 
the business of the House of Commons.  What utter nonsense.  If 
there is no business in the House the government must bear full 
responsibility.  Indeed, when there is business in the House it 
is often hard to get the Liberals to attend.  Witness the fiasco 
of last Thursday.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a sad day when the House of Commons must debate an 
issue that calls into question not only the person of the Prime 
Minister but the reputation of the office itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many Canadians from all walks of life, all regions of this 
great country and all political stripes, question the ability of 
the government and the Prime Minister to govern in an open and 
accountable manner.  The truth must be found and it must be 
spoken.  It has been lacking in this matter for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite can bluster all they want.  They can cite old 
polls and make widespread pronouncements, but the facts are 
undeniable.  According to the latest Compas poll 85% of Canadians 
feel it is important to get to the bottom of the issue. 
Sixty-three per cent of those polled believe the Prime Minister's 
conduct was wrong when he sought money for a business in 
Shawinigan in which he is accused of having a financial interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are an intelligent and reasoned electorate.  They know 
the issues and they want clarity.  Perhaps most telling are the 
91% of people who feel it is important for the Prime Minister to 
behave in ways that appear fair.  Therein lies the nub of the 
problem.  There is not the appearance of fairness.  There is in 
fact the appearance of unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts clearly indicate that there is at least the appearance 
of a serious conflict of interest and that in all likelihood the 
House has been misled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These allegations must be cleared before the government regains 
the moral right to govern the people.  Based on the actions of 
junior and senior ministers in the past weeks and months, I 
believe I have the right to say this in the House today.  When 
deliberate misrepresentations are made in the House and remain 
unpunished by the Prime Minister, I am reminded of the adage that 
leaders must lead by example.  Canadians and members of 
parliament are being offered an unfortunate example of 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the foregoing has happened today because of certain factors: 
a complete lack of accountability on the part of the government; 
the unprecedented use of closure; the dictatorial running of the 
House and its members by the Prime Minister and his unelected, 
unaccountable advisers; and the untenable centralization of power 
in the Prime Minister's Office that began over 30 years ago under 
Prime Minister Trudeau when the current Prime Minister was 
cutting his teeth in federal politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk of parliamentary reform.  Frankly talk is 
cheap.  It is time for all members of the House, and indeed all 
Canadians, to reclaim their government.  The government of this 
great country should not be controlled by a handful of people who 
surround the Prime Minister.  That is not what the Fathers of 
Confederation intended the government of the country to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform of the House of Commons must begin, and it must begin 
with us.  We desperately need an ethics counsellor who is a true 
watchdog and not a lapdog for the Prime Minister.  What person in 
his or her right and free thinking mind would accept that a 
person who is appointed by and reports to the Prime Minister 
would be able to give a full and complete disclosure of the Prime 
Minister's actions?  Members here can reclaim the integrity of 
the House, but only if they shake off their leashes and muzzles 
and relearn the ability to think for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform of the House must also extend to the committee level 
where MPs are supposed to be masters of their own destiny. 
Instead we regularly see the chair and the parliamentary 
secretary act on behalf of the minister's office.  Why?  Simply 
put, there is an insatiable desire for power and control at every 
level.  The Prime Minister has taken it upon himself to absorb 
every last control lever into the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of this exorbitant power grab is a government 
that acts as if it is above the rules, regulations and laws of 
the country.  What an appalling disgrace.  We have seen a pattern 
develop over the years.  We have seen the flimsy excuses used in 
the Human Resources Development Canada debacle.  We have found 
that HRDC had secret slush funds used by and for ministerial 
special requests.  Canadians are greatly concerned about the 
government's lack of forthrightness and clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a recommendation for government members.  They should 
stop paying lip service to parliamentary reform and make it a 
reality before it is too late for the country.  They should start 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the House and Canadians across the country want 
only to know the truth behind Shawinigate.  If the Prime Minister 
has nothing to hide or be ashamed of then let us set the record 
straight.  If there is substance behind the facts then corrective 
actions must be taken.  We simply want to know the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethics and accountability must start somewhere.  Frankly it must 
start at the top.  We as a nation need accountability in our 
government and Prime Minister.  Sadly, at this time millions of 
Canadians do not see accountability at our highest levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister is under a shroud of discrepancy and 
double talk, what are we as parliamentarians and Canadians to 
expect from those around us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big questions remain:  Where do we go from here?  How do we 
get there?  I think all hon. members of the House would agree 
that we need to put an end to the issue.  No one, including 
opposition members, wants to carry this further than necessary. 
However the issue is before us and we must find a plan to bring 
closure to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing we must put the office of the Prime Minister ahead 
of the man who currently occupies it.  The office has been here 
longer than any of us and will continue longer than any of us. 
The reputation of the office has been sullied and we must 
collectively renew it.  It goes far beyond partisan values and 
attacks.  The office depends on the goodwill of the public for 
its preservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to today's motion calling for an independent judicial 
inquiry.  Sadly the question is not only before the House but on 
the minds of the majority of Canadians.  In order to fully answer 
the question of impropriety we must have someone in charge who is 
viewed by all Canadians as honourable, above reproach and 
impartial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty per cent of Canadians believe parliament should create an 
independent judicial inquiry to get to the facts behind 
Shawinigate.  To deny today's motion would raise further 
questions about the Prime Minister's dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is nothing to hide, why have the past two years 
continued to bring additional facts forward?  Why has the Prime 
Minister not been able to provide clear and concise evidence to 
clear his reputation?  If the government and Prime Minister have 
nothing to hide they will not object to a public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions must be taken that will resolve the issue once and for 
all.  If the Prime Minister is innocent of wrongdoing then I call 
upon him to endorse today's motion.  If there is independence 
among government backbenchers then I call upon them to move 
beyond partisanship and deal with the bigger question of the 
integrity of the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all members of parliament to seek an answer to the 
question:  What is in the best interests of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members believe like I do that it is in the best interests of 
Canadians to find a clear and concise end to the issue then I 
urge them to vote in favour of today's motion.  Let us get this 
thing cleared up.  Let us have an independent judicial inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot believe what I am hearing from my colleague.  The House of 
Commons is the highest court in the land.  We have debated this 
issue day in and day out, month in and month out, on a regular 
basis.  Today in the House we are listening to my colleagues on 
the opposition side try to put on record any kind of evidence 
that would suggest the Prime Minister has done anything other 
than serve his constituents in the Grand-Mère affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day we as members of parliament stop calling and writing on 
our constituents' behalf to the administration in the Government 
of Canada, the private sector, banks, crown corporations or 
whomever, none of us will get elected.  Would my colleague not 
agree with that?  Our job as members of parliament is to stand up 
for our constituents and act on their behalf.  The day I stop 
doing that is the day I should stop serving as a member of 
parliament.  That is exactly what the Prime Minister has done to 
create jobs in his constituency and defend the interests of his 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not interested in seeing another public inquiry waste 
millions of dollars and at the end of the day hear nothing new 
other than what we have read in the <I>National Post</I> and heard 
from some of my colleagues.  It has added nothing to the debate 
and has only wasted the time of the House of Commons and of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-one per cent of Canadians are telling us to move on and 
talk about issues that are important to them such as softwood 
lumber, farming, fisheries and the economy. 
Those are the issues that are important to Canadians and the 
issues they want us to talk about.  For the public interest, we 
should move on.  We should have the debate today, vote on it and 
then kill the issue.  We can then begin to talk about the issues 
that are important to Canadians.  That is what they elected us 
for.  We had an election on this issue.  The people have voted and 
they told the Prime Minister that they trust him.  Does he not 
agree?

I am glad to see the hon. member continue his passion inside the 
House of Commons as he certainly does outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the member's comments very strange.  I agree with him 
that this is the highest court of the land.  However, he has been 
a member of a government that has been in power since 1993 and, over 
that period of time, the measures that his government has or has 
not taken in the House has led to a continual decline in the 
power of parliament to be the lawmakers of the land.  How many 
times have we seen this government fail to take a stand on an 
issue that concerns the Canadian public and, instead of 
bringing in legislation, it sends it to the courts?  The courts 
have now become the highest law of the land.  That is an absolute 
disgrace.  It denigrates the kind of influence that we as 
members of parliament have in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been responsible for that decline and it is 
only the Canadian Alliance, along with other opposition parties, 
that have brought some power back into parliament in order to 
take action against this kind of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These last few months, Canadians have witnessed a most degrading 
spectacle in the House of Commons, the spectacle of a bitter 
opposition that has no ideas or constructive solutions to offer 
and that has totally dropped public policy issues to engage in a 
relentless smear campaign against one person in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canadians want to hear about the state of the 
economy, the opposition is obsessed with the Prime Minister's 
personal finances. 
At a time when Canadians want to know the position of their 
federal parties on the future of health care services, on 
support for families and children, on the status of the 
environment and on the impact of globalization and of the new 
economy, the opposition is obsessed with inventing allegations, 
which are becoming sillier and sillier, about a most ordinary 
commercial transaction which was conducted, from beginning to 
end, in full compliance with the spirit and the letter of the 
ministers' conflict of interest code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hiding behind the immunity allowing MPs to speak freely in the 
House of Commons, members of the opposition have made countless 
unjustified allegations, cast silly innuendoes and tarnished the 
reputation not only of the Prime Minister and his family, but of 
all the people who reviewed the facts and cleared him of any 
wrongdoing. They even questioned the integrity of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. Why? 
They did it because, as the member for Saint-Maurice, the Prime 
Minister made representations to the Business Development Bank 
of Canada to secure a loan for a hotel that created jobs for 20 
of his constituents, the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This hotel is located beside the Grand-Mère golf club, which has 
new owners and in which the Prime Minister ceased to have any 
financial interest before taking on his current 
responsibilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>His trustee and lawyer, in close consultation with the federal 
ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, worked on the recovery of a debt 
resulting from the sale of his shares in the golf club. Let me 
repeat that this sale occurred before he became Prime Minister 
and that it was exempt of all debt and charges, as the documents 
show. His shares never came back in his ownership or control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promoting economic development and job creation for one's 
constituents is the first priority of all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working tirelessly so that my constituents in Laval East 
will have good jobs in the future, and I make sure we get our 
fair share of any federal help for this. The Prime Minister did 
the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the Saint-Maurice riding have had high unemployment 
for a long time. The Prime Minister, in his capacity as member 
for Saint-Maurice, local municipalities, businesses, and the 
Quebec government consulted together and decided to give this 
region a key promotional tool, tourism, to build a better 
economic future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister made sure that his constituency would get 
federal assistance to support many legitimate tourist projects, 
and that is perfectly appropriate. 
The same thing occurs in every riding in Canada faced with a 
similar economic situation. This was his only concern when he 
supported the expansion project for the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, has repeatedly reviewed the 
sale of the golf club and the Prime Minister's contacts with the 
Business Development Bank of Canada. He concluded there was no 
conflict of interest, but that is not what the opposition wanted 
to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it launched a spiteful and bitter attack 
against the Prime Minister and against the integrity of Mr. 
Wilson, an outstanding civil servant and a world renowned expert 
in public ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition asked the RCMP to conduct an investigation. 
Again, it cleared the Prime Minister of any wrongdoing. The 
results of the investigation were also rejected by the 
opposition, which irresponsibly questioned the integrity of the 
RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in an extraordinary and unprecedented move, the Prime 
Minister allowed the ethics counsellor to release private 
documents to prove, without any reasonable doubt, that there was 
no conflict of interest, the opposition asked for even more 
documents. As usual, it attacked the integrity of the Prime 
Minister's trustee and of the person who bought the Prime 
Minister's shares in the golf club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been sitting in this parliament for 38 
years. Throughout the years, he has upheld strict personal 
integrity standards. During most of his years here in Ottawa, he 
held key positions of trust in cabinet. Never has there been a 
whiff of scandal while he carried out his duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our government and our Prime Minister want, first and 
foremost, is to preserve the confidence of the Canadian public. 
As far as we are concerned, integrity is more than a nice 
principle, it is our ideal. It is a way of life. It is the basis 
of our whole action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that trust in institutions is as vital for democracy 
as the air we breath is for us. Once trust is destroyed, it 
becomes difficult and sometimes impossible to rebuild. Once trust 
is lost, the system can no longer function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Mulroney administration, Canadians came to believe 
that public officials placed their personal financial interest 
before the public interest. It was precisely to put an end to 
that perception that the Prime Minister established the office of 
ethics counsellor in 1994.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister often told us that, very early in his life, 
his father taught him that a good reputation was more precious 
than wealth, social position, glory or celebrity. In the end, it 
is the only thing we really own. It cannot be sold nor exchanged 
and, once it is lost, it is lost for good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made that the creed of his political life. He made it a 
standard and an example for the members of his government. This 
is why not a single minister of his cabinet has ever had to 
resign because of a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the high office to which he was elected and the 
irreproachable uprightness of his personal conduct, the Prime 
Minister deserves better than being the target of a deluge of 
unfounded allegations and slander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, Canadians deserve better than that. They have a 
government which is determined to deal with real needs, needs and 
challenges of interest to Canadians, and they deserve to have an 
opposition which is prepared to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of her speech, I 
believe my colleague went a little overboard when she said that 
the opposition did not address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She forgets, for example, that the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development unanimously passed a motion, to which the 
Liberals contributed, calling for more changes to be made to the 
employment insurance plan and that they would be proposed by June 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also mention the very positive remarks made by the hon. 
member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie concerning international child 
abduction, and those by the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm on 
young offenders. So, when they say that all the opposition is 
talking about is the inquiry, I think we are quite capable of 
doing two things at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where I totally disagree is when they say that Canadians are 
fed up with this issue. According to polls, more that 50% of 
Canadians want an inquiry, as requested by the opposition, so 
that all the light be shed on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have more questions not been raised this week, since the 
documents were made public, than before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government say that there was no conflict of 
interest when, in the documents made public, we learn that if 
there is ever an inquiry, it will be J&AC Consultants Inc., the 
PM's main company, that will bear the costs of this inquiry? 
Is this not a cut and dry instance of conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the hon. member not admit that the integrity of the Prime 
Minister is being called into question, but that he himself 
fuelling arguments against him on a daily basis by refusing to go 
to the bottom of the issue and to put in place what Canadians are 
asking for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow, when we vote on the motion, those who will represent 
the will of the majority of Canadians will not be the Liberal 
majority, which will vote against the motion, but those who have 
the support of more than 50% of Canadians calling for a public 
inquiry to take this issue out of this House and let the light be 
made on the whole issue outside oral question period, where 
questions are a mere 30 or 35 seconds long and answers just as 
short. The integrity of the Prime Minister is at stake, and so is 
that of the entire political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, when the hon. member reads a testimony like that 
of Yvon Duhaime, which has been published in <I>Le Soleil</I> last 
week end, where he said that there was a direct link between the 
economic activity of the Auberge Grand-Mère and the golf club, 
and when we see that the Prime Minister would have to pay legal 
fees if there was an inquiry, would she not agree that the motion 
is very appropriate and that it would shed light on a situation 
that has been kept in the dark by the Prime Minister for much too 
long?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, as well as the minister of agriculture, just 
what happened.  Where was the integrity?  Why were members not 
standing up for farmers when I brought forward, along with my

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer by saying 
that the assistance provided to Canadian farmers was the result 
of pressure from the Liberal caucus, not from the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the November 27 election, at every caucus meeting I have 
attended, members on this side of the House, of the Liberal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Simcoe North. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are again on an opposition day motion.  We are talking about an 
issue that has been around for two years.  It has been through 
the scrutiny of the ethics counsellor, through an election 
campaign and  through an RCMP review.  Through all that time no 
one was able to make a case to justify that the Prime Minister 
was in a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has tabled personal documents in the House. 
That is a precedent which to my knowledge has never been done in 
the history of parliament.  We have been through all that and yet 
when the Canadian Alliance has an opportunity to choose the topic 
of debate in the House, to have a meaningful debate on issues 
that are important and relevant to Canadians, we talk about 
Shawinigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a headline from the editorial of the April 12 Orillia 
<I>Packet & Times</I> which reads “Shawinigate obsession is 
getting tired”.  It goes on to say to the opposition that it is 
time to move on.  There is nothing there.  Why does it keep tying 
up the business of the nation dealing with an issue when there is 
no case to be made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know why.  It is really a contest between the Progressive 
Conservative Party and its leader who has championed this 
obsession and has carried it forward.  The Canadian Alliance 
leader was a little distracted for a while with some of his own 
personal problems, but now he is into the contest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is very clear.  The media has widely reported that Bay 
Street has said to the right and the righter party that it would 
cut off their financing if they do not get together.  There is a 
contest between the right and the righter party to try to get 
themselves together, so they are trying to outdo one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has expanded into an unholy alliance with the Bloc 
Quebecois and to a certain degree the NDP.  The NDP is trying to 
play both sides because if there is any mileage to be made, it 
wants to be seen to be part of the coalition.  If it backfires, 
as I am sure it will, then it wants to keep its distance.  The 
NDP is playing it particularly cozy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the facts and they are very clear. Opposition 
members said that if they were told who the fourth shareholder 
was they would drop the matter.  We know who the fourth 
shareholder is and it is not the Prime Minister.  However they 
did not drop the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members said that if they had the documents and the 
bill of sale they would drop the matter.  The bill of sale was 
tabled and still the matter has not been dropped.  They do not 
want to drop the matter because they want to play politics with 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition wants to sully the reputation of the Prime 
Minister, a man who has been in public service for 38 years 
without any hint of a scandal.  It wants to sully his reputation 
for purely crass and political purposes.  That is a disgrace to 
the whole House.  That is something Canadians recognize and they 
know full well that it is not what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition then said that it would look at the documents and 
the bill of sale.  However it criticized the bill of sale.  It 
said that there was no date, location or seal on it, et cetera. 
By law it is not needed.  Shares can be sold on a verbal 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All discussion on the bill of sale becomes irrelevant because we 
have the letter from the corporate solicitors for 161341 Canada 
Inc., the company that owns the golf course.  The letter was 
tabled in the industry committee on March 20 and it states: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 1, 1993, the board approved the transfer to Akimbo 
Development Corporation of all the company shares held by J&AC 
Consultants Inc. Since that time, J&AC Consultants Inc. 
no longer appears in resolutions by the company shareholders, 
and— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's name appears here. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—no longer appears in resolutions by the company directors; 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is corroboration that the shares were transferred and that 
they were acknowledged by the corporation in a resolution.  That 
letter comes from the corporate solicitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition will now take the position that those solicitors 
are either incompetent, dishonest, in the pocket of the Prime 
Minister, or smoking dope.  Opposition members will find some way 
of discrediting the corporate solicitors because they have not 
told the opposition what it wants to hear.  It is clear that 
nothing will satisfy the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the opposition today calls for an 
independent inquiry.  Even if it got an independent inquiry, I am 
sure those members would say that it was not done properly and 
whoever was appointed was not the right person and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our legal system there is the onus of proof.  There is no 
onus to prove oneself innocent.  The onus is on the person making 
the allegation of a conflict of interest to show some evidence. 
In this case we have been through the process for two full years 
and no one has been able to make the case that there is any 
evidence whatsoever of a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a debt.  The Prime Minister sold his shares.  It 
was an unsecured debt.  Mr. Prince owed the Prime Minister some 
money.  The Prime Minister or his company retained no interest in 
those shares.  They had no right to retake the shares regardless 
of what happened to the value of the shares in the golf course. 
If the golf course went bankrupt or if the shares tripled in 
value, the Prime Minister was only entitled to collect his 
original debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that the Prime Minister's trustee was involved in trying 
to collect on the debt.  As part of the settlement on the debt 
there was a repurchase of the shares by someone else from Akimbo. 
We have evidence that shows that Mr. Prince was mistaken in law 
in thinking he had an option.  He acknowledged in one of the 
subsequent agreements that he obtained a legal opinion that 
convinced him.  I do not know why that would not satisfy the 
opposition, but it convinced Mr. Prince that he was mistaken in 
law and that he did retain the shares, so he resold them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members quibble about the wording of the release 
clauses in the agreement or the indemnification clauses.  They 
say there is a double conflict of interest because the Prime 
Minister's company said that if they dragged it into court it 
would be indemnified for its legal costs through the whole 
process.  That is a standard legal agreement on any settlement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a solicitor I have signed many releases on behalf of clients 
or prepared them for clients.  There is always an indemnification 
clause in any settlement agreement.  It is a normal legal 
practice, yet the opposition continues to ask questions, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question comes down to what would be gained by having an 
independent inquiry that the opposition is requesting by the 
motion.  I submit that nothing would be gained.  A lot of public 
money would be spent when we should be dealing with more 
important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members throughout the debate have mentioned the question of the 
vote last Thursday when the opposition moved adjournment of the 
House.  The government was responsible for not maintaining quorum 
and the House adjourned.  Opposition members have not only been 
wasting the House's time in question period by dominating this 
one issue but they have also been wasting the time of the House 
by bringing in mischievous motions of adjournment when we should 
be dealing with the business of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to my constituents that as part of the government I 
assume responsibility for not being there to protect Canadians 
from the mischief of the opposition.  I assume that 
responsibility, but I assure the House I will not permit the 
mischief of the opposition to carry the day on this motion.  I am 
sure this side will vote against the motion so that we can get on 
with the business of the nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member does not fully 
understand what is at the root of the motion and what Canadians 
are asking us to do in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have made far too many connections between government 
grants and moneys on the one hand going to parties and then those 
parties giving money back to either the Liberal Party or to an 
individual member.  There is a definite connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada accepted a donation from a trade 
group in Shawinigan, Quebec, which happens to be near the Prime 
Minister's riding and was living off a $2.5 million grant from 
the federal government.  Then the group made a donation to the 
Liberal Party for whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians see a connection with this type of activity where 
taxpayer money goes to someone and then flows back to the 
government.  That is the point I want to make and I would like 
the member to answer this question.  Does he not see something 
wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, people make donations to 
all political parties, but the issue is not who made a donation 
to the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegation is that the Prime Minister had a financial 
interest in the golf course when a loan was made to an abutting 
business.  That is a stretch anyway.  If the Prime Minister had 
an interest in the golf course, which he legally did not, the 
whole premise of the allegation of a conflict of interest would 
be a major stretch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The golf course had its own 19th hole, bar and dining room.  The 
dining room and the bar at the auberge were in competition with 
the golf course.  If the Prime Minister had an interest, the case 
is far from made as the auberge was a competitor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises the question of political donations.  We could 
get into that.  We could talk about $70,000 given to the Canadian 
Alliance from a law firm in Calgary, but I do not really want to 
talk about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to get back to the point the member spoke about: 
the mischievous and frivolous motions our party brings forward to 
the House.  He was making specific reference to the adjournment 
motion last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 95 of the 172 Liberals who were elected to the House were 
here to vote on that motion.  There was a photograph in the 
newspaper that showed cabs receiving instructions to turn around 
to bring Liberal members back to the House instead of heading for 
the airport.  They were disappearing right after question period 
on Thursday afternoon.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those members think that leaving here at 3:30 on a Thursday 
afternoon is not frivolous, then why are they complaining about 
the vote we called in the House and they could not even show up. 
Their responsibility was to be here but they were heading to the 
airport to go home for the long weekend.  He thinks that this is 
a frivolous motion.  Why does the member think that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that it is 
a frivolous motion and it is mischievous.  Why would anyone bring 
a motion to adjourn and then take great delight in the fact that 
it was not thwarted?  This comes from a party where one of the 
first acts of its new leader was to say that the House should sit 
four days a week not five.  Maybe some folks do not disagree with 
that.  However, why be so mischievous as to bring a motion and 
then blame the other side for not voting it down.  The Canadian 
people do not go for that kind of nonsense.  They can see through 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that member, as well as others before him, continually 
use the term ethics commissioner, which, as we know, has much 
greater power than an ethics counsellor.  The person we have at 
the present is an ethics counsellor.  Why do they deliberately 
use the other term which is not the correct one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the ethics counsellor 
was someone who was appointed with approval of the opposition 
parties at the time.  It was the ethics counsellor's idea that he 
remain a counsellor and not a commissioner because of the 
principle of the independent, accountable government.  If we were 
to have a commissioner telling the Prime Minister what to do, 
then why not just vote for the commissioner?  Why would we have 
an election every four years and vote for a prime minister?

concerned about, ethics, truth and basic standards of governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Liberal members opposite just do not want to look 
down into the abyss and contemplate what their leader has done 
and what they have done along with him.  Recoil, deflect and 
excuse as they may, and uncomfortable as it is, we must go there, 
for the good of the country, to defend the credibility of 
parliament and preserve the basic idea of what Canada as a nation 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us says:

Grand-Mère Golf Club and the Grand-Mère Inn:  and that the 
inquiry should have broad terms of reference with the power to 
subpoena all relevant documents and witnesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, for parliamentary leaders and even previous prime 
ministers, the problem was often money, combined with 
opportunity, greed and apparent need which was their eventual 
undoing.  By the Prime Minister's own statements in the House, it 
appears he had all those elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was thought that we as a nation had to overcome the old style 
behaviour of arm twisting for one's own riding, using favouritism 
and personal clout rather than rational program criteria at arm's 
length from officeholders, but not for the old style Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister do to get money into his riding? 
The experience seems to suggest that the first thing for getting 
hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in federal 
money is to be under criminal investigation.  Followers of 
Shawinigate may disagree and say that having a questionable 
business record worked better.  Others might insist that making 
the right political contribution is the key.  However, in 
reviewing those who got the money, it looks like having a 
criminal record, moving to Shawinigan and offering to buy any of 
the Prime Minister's assets made a lot of tax dollars just 
appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of the Grand-Mère hotel owner Yvon Duhaime.  He 
has a number of criminal convictions, ranging from drunk driving 
to threatening fellow constituents.  His previously failed 
venture with the L'Hotel des Chutes, for which at one point left 
him owing $150,000 in unpaid taxes as well as other bills, had to 
be a help to get him the Business Development Bank loan. plus 
another $189,000 in transitional job fund grants from the federal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Thibault, a recent immigrant from Belgium, who received 
$700,000 in TJF grants and another $925,000 in federal loan 
guarantees for Shawinigan's Auberge des Gouverneurs, could have 
secured federal funding for sure when he made an admission in 
writing to fiddling away nearly $1 million from his former 
business partners in Belgium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we wanted a ticket to ride on the Liberal gravy train perhaps 
it was example set by Paul Lemire and Mario Pépin, two Prime 
Minister supporters in Shawinigan who ran Groupe Force, a federal 
business development agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lemire's credentials included being convicted for tax dealings 
and cheques, but then he and his partner were charged with theft 
and fraud for systematically diverting millions of dollars in 
federal development money into their own pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the Prime Minister's political friend, René 
Fugère, would find it more difficult to get federal funds when 
the police investigation into his affairs yielded no actual 
charges.  However, maybe it is the fact that on some occasions he 
is the representative of the Prime Minister, which allowed him to 
get a stipend of 5% to 10% off the top of federal grants, of 
those it looked like he was able to secure for his business 
buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should follow the lead of Claude Gauthier who was 
fortunate enough in 1996 to buy some land from the Grand-Mère 
Golf Club, of which the Prime Minister may or may not have been 
an owner, but in which he admitted he had a financial interest. 
Mr. Gauthier paid $525,000 for the land, which help the golf 
course retire a $300,000 debt. In 1997 he was also the largest 
single contributor to the Prime Minister's re-election fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following year, one of Gauthier's companies, Placeteco Inc., 
received $1.2 million in transitional job funds, although it 
apparently did not create a single lasting job but instead 
skipped the federal guidelines and just paid off an existing 
loan.  However, in this case the pattern was broken and the Prime 
Minister's office worked for Gauthier to get his tax money, 
despite the fact that he had no known criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is old style political parties that just have no shame.  What 
values are the Liberals showing?  During the last election the 
Prime Minister declared that the Liberal Party of Canada 
represented Canadian values.  What Liberal values was the Prime 
Minister demonstrating when he refused to tell about being 
involved in securing a loan from the Business Development Bank 
for the man who bought the Grand-Mère hotel for him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shawinigan affair also has a basic economic aspect.  Even if 
we take the Prime Minister at his word, what was the rationale 
for giving $615,000 of our tax dollars to a perennial losing 
venture?  The Prime Minister and his defenders declared that it 
was for economic development, but even if we allowed that charade 
to go unchallenged, did the Grand-Mère hotel have the greatest 
potential for long term economic benefit for the region? The 
Business Development Bank had already turned down the loan for 
good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone be surprised that a hotel, which consistently had 
financial problems and could not pay its bills, would be unable 
to meet new debt obligations?  We must remember that the 
Grand-Mère never made a single interest payment on the Business 
Development Bank loan that the Prime Minister lobbied so hard to 
get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How little financial sense would one need to go to bat for such 
a program?  Is this really what passes for economic development? 
I am afraid of the answer, in far too many cases for the 
government, has been yes. I am afraid that this whole episode 
gets us to the heart of Liberal values.  When one peels back the 
layers of the white onion, we discover that it is rotten black in 
the core. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an isolated incident.  The auditor general made it 
clear in October that there is a secret group of unelected 
Liberal insiders who vet and determine every grant in Quebec. 
There are four other RCMP investigations into federal grants in 
this riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past decade billions of dollars have been handed out 
solely for political purposes under the guise of economic 
development.  It is crude vote buying with public funds and it 
does not even cross the Prime Minister's mind that all this is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is old time Liberal political values in action.  The more 
important question is how closely these values reflect the values 
of average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reasonable person looking at the facts would conclude that a 
conflict of interest is not in doubt at all and basically is no 
longer even denied.  The Prime Minister boasted of what he did 
and admitted that he had a great personal motive in that he 
wanted to get paid and that he needed the money as he did not get 
a top up salary like the Conservative leader does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outstanding debt for his shares meant that the Prime 
Minister had a financial interest in the golf club, yet he was 
pouring public funds into the adjoining inn.  After a halfhearted 
attempt to explain away the conflict by claiming that the inn had 
no business ties with the golf club, shown to be utterly false by 
the way, the Prime Minister and his defenders have reverted to 
simply reciting balderdash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond Shawinigan there stretches the great, uncharted wasteland 
of the Human Resources Development Department and its programs, a 
billion dollar money pot whose disbursal was overseen not just by 
Liberal MPs but by unelected party hacks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it could be said that the Grand-Mère Golf Club is ground 
zero for a much larger phenomenon of the government:  the 
politicization of public spending and of public institutions, 
such as the Business Development Bank and other crown 
corporations whose boards are packed with Liberal Party friends 
to the corruption of their legal purpose and to the detriment of 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What cannot be denied is the historical pattern over the years 
of sleaze from both the Liberal and Conservative governments in 
the past, and this one does not disappoint us at all; it is just 
business as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, by his conduct, sets the tone, just as 
Mulroney did.  No one is accusing the Prime Minister of a crime, 
yet.  Nevertheless, rather than compare the Prime Minister's 
behaviour to that of a criminal, a better yardstick to measure 
is:  What would an ethical leader have done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Duhaime approached the Prime Minister, he should have 
kicked him out of his office and told him that he could not 
intervene as their business interests were intertwined.  An 
ethical person, indeed a lawyer, would have gone out of his way 
to even avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, 
especially when he was the Prime Minister and had an extra duty 
to lead by example.  Indeed, public office holders are obliged to 
do so by the conflict of interest code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an educated person would not need such instructions or 
rules.  In a position of public trust, they would know that it is 
not another person's role to maintain standards and values.  It 
is his job alone to keep himself above suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister may claim, trying to cover his tracks, that 
his conduct did not technically violate the code, that the 
issue involves many grey areas and that maybe he was sloppy as a 
lawyer and as leader of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an ethical person does not need to seek refuge in grey 
areas and fuzziness.  A real leader insists that there should be 
no clouds over his integrity by behaving properly.  A worthy 
Prime Minister takes the steps that are needed to be sure of 
standing in the light so he could never be called a crook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister, for the sake of the country, to 
accept today's motion before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in 
this debate.  I have been puzzled by some of the remarks earlier, 
and I will come back to it with a question for the hon. member 
opposite because I know he is from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the fifth party earlier talked about the former 
premier of British Columbia, Mr. Bill Vander Zalm, and he talked 
about a report that had been done by Mr. Ted Hughes.  I think he 
said that in his report Mr. Hughes had stated that the premier 
was the highest elected position in the province and that he had 
a duty with respect to conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was living in British Columbia at that time and what I think 
the right hon. member forgot to mention was the fact that there 
was a small matter of $15,000 or thereabouts in bank notes that 
were in the safe of the premier's fantasyland gardens, or 
whatever it was called, just outside of Vancouver, and it 
happened to be from a land developer, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, it is fairly clear that the Prime 
Minister had no personal interest.  He had a debt owing to him 
but the shares had clearly been sold even though the share 
register was not updated.  As a chartered accountant, I have 
dealt with many companies with registered shares that had not 
been updated for years on end.  I had to tell them to update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shares were clearly sold.  The Prime Minister tabled the 
bill of sale.  He had a receivable from someone who was an 
executive of some means so that the loan could be recovered 
through the courts.  It had nothing to do with the 
interdependence of the golf course and the hotel.  It had 
everything to do with a receivable from a person who had the 
means to pay the receivable.  It was a fixed sum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the debate is really out of hand.  I know the hon. member 
is from British Columbia so perhaps he will remember the incident 
involving the former premier, Bill Vander Zalm.  I think to draw 
that analogy is absolutely scurrilous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I was trying to point 
out was that what appears to be surrounding the Prime Minister's 
riding is just the tip of the iceberg, a part of a longstanding 
pattern of Liberal governments going back many years.  It is just 
the old style of politics.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also obvious, I think, that the average Canadian 
understands that if all the government money from various 
departments and programs did not come into the riding by various 
means, the Prime Minister would not get paid.  He stood in the 
House, put his hand over his chest and admitted how much of a 
desire and a motivation he had to get paid.  Certainly he moved 
all of government to make sure he did get paid.  That is what the 
appearance is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the context of British Columbia, I would also say 
that if this whole scenario were being played out in the 
legislature of British Columbia we would not be debating this 
today.  This would have been dealt with, because the standards in 
British Columbia for apparent conflict of interest are much 
higher than those of the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to get to my hon. colleague's 
remarks, but I just want to say that I have lived at least 21 
years of my professional career under some pretty severe rules of 
conduct and professional behaviour.  As a young man I was a 
principal.  I could have put my wife on staff, but I did not 
because I could see that and we had a code of ethics as board 
members.  I had a code of ethics before me, all written out, as a 
member of the legislative assembly.  If anyone on the board had 
phoned a bank to guarantee that a contractor would get a job, 
bingo, he would have been off the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister admittedly phoned the Business Development 
Bank.  It was a total conflict of interest.  That fact cannot be 
successfully denied by anybody in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member this:  cannot your 
constituents see that it is a total conflict of interest and the 
Prime Minister should admit that guilt now and come clean on 
defending what is supposed to be a code of ethics for all members 
of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am in a bit of a dilemma because 
time has lapsed.  I will take it as a way of comment to the 
House, respectfully to the colleague who had the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this 
motion.  I am somewhat disappointed that it has actually come to 
this, that the House has not been able to deal with more 
constructive issues.  However, we, as an opposition party, and 
other colleagues on this side of the House are obligated to try 
to get to the truth of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the government says, the public does want 
answers.  Eight out of ten people want this issue to end.  They 
want it to be over and done with so that we can get to the real 
issues affecting Canadians.  However, eight out of ten Canadians 
also want there to be full disclosure of the Prime Minister's 
papers.  They have said to the Prime Minister very clearly that 
they want to have answers to the questions that are there in 
front of him, that they want full disclosure and they want the 
truth, and that then they can move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the Prime Minister, after 38 years of service in 
the House and in the winter of his political career does not want 
to have the stench of Shawinigate hanging around his shoulders as 
he leaves office.  It would do a huge disservice to him and the 
years of service that he has put into the House and into this 
country for him to not answer the questions that have been posed, 
not only by my colleagues here in the House but also by members 
in his own caucus and of course by the public.  The public wants 
to move on, but it wants answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's tactic of relying on public fatigue, on 
opposition fatigue, will simply not wash.  It will not end this 
issue.  There has been ample evidence presented by my colleagues 
as to why he should make full disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole issue reflects a more disturbing trend in politics in 
Canada today.  In fact, it reveals the unrivalled power that our 
Prime Minister has in our so-called democracy.  Indeed, no leader 
of any other western democracy has the power the Prime Minister 
of Canada has.  The president of the United States, I think the 
public would be interested to know, would do cartwheels down the 
White House lawn if he had the same powers our Prime Minister 
has.  That must change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this whole issue reflects the unbridled and 
unaccountable power that the person in that office holds today in 
our country.  When Mr. Trudeau said that MPs were nobodies 50 
feet off the Hill, he was merely reflecting the power that he 
himself was beginning to amass around him.  Indeed, it has become 
more centralized as time has passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many individuals in the House and, indeed, members across the 
way in the government have spoken quite eloquently on the 
unbridled and unaccountable power that the Prime Minister and the 
Prime Minister's Office hold today.  It is not something to be 
proud of.  It is not something constructive for the members of 
the House or, more important, for the Canadian public, the reason 
being that it muzzles and compromises the innovation and 
abilities of every single person in the House, including those in 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet members unfortunately are unable to exercise their 
abilities and their rights to the checks and balances that have 
occurred.  I think the public would be very interested to know 
that the right hand person of a minister of the crown is a deputy 
minister not appointed or approved by the minister but by the 
Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office.  That is an 
intriguing check and balance on the ability of any minister of 
the crown to be able to exercise foresight, responsibility and 
leadership in the area of their chosen field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also reflects a lack of responsibility and accountability to 
the public and a lack of respect for the public.  We have, as my 
colleague mentioned, an ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime 
Minister and responsible to the Prime Minister, as opposed to 
having an independent person in that position.  We see money 
spent without accountability or public scrutiny.  In fact, the 
auditor general has repeatedly warned the House and the public of 
the dangers of that.  Year in and year out, he has put forth 
constructive solutions as to how we can deal with it.  Is he ever 
listened to?  No.  Are those solutions ever implemented?  No, 
they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tragedy for a good man, Mr. Denis Desautels, who is now 
leaving his position after 10 years.  He has worked hard for the 
public good and has given direction to every member in the House 
as to how we can improve the use of the public purse.  The 
tragedy that I think the public should know about is that those 
solutions are rarely, if ever, adhered to and implemented. How 
disheartening for a good team of people trying to engage in the 
public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen, as my colleague mentioned, where public moneys are 
used—the Export Development Corporation, the Business 
Development Bank, crown corporations, the new fund for innovation 
and $1.25 billion—without accountability, without public 
scrutiny.  We have seen contracts for CIDA that have often been 
disbursed not on the basis of what is useful or what would be 
wise but on who the friends of the government are or for 
political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is reflected in the fact that we now see fewer people 
engaging in the public process and fewer people voting.  We saw 
it in our last federal election, where only three-fifths of the 
Canadian public actually came out to vote.  Why is there this 
declining number?  Because the public sees this institution as 
increasingly irrelevant to their lives and, indeed, as unable to 
tackle the big issues that face all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen ministers talk about fictional burning crosses.  We 
have seen ministers call a member in my caucus a pig.  Why?  I 
think it is because the members on the other side are bored. They 
are bored, they do not have direction and they do not have 
vision, because the Prime Minister is predicating his actions on 
trying to keep the opposition fractured rather than articulating 
a vision to deal with the big issues that face our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Rome burns, the following is not happening.  We are not 
seeing action to save a health care system in a critical state of 
disrepair.  We have a medical manpower crisis where the average 
specialist is in his or her mid-forties to mid-fifties, including 
general surgeons, urologists, obstetricians and gynecologists who 
are all toward the end of their careers.  There is a severe lack 
of individuals in these critical specialties.  We have to act now 
to train those who will replace them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing an unsustainable system of pensions in the country 
that will not provide for members of the Canadian public when 
they retire.  The expectation is that there will be pensions that 
they will be able to live on.  As we know, the people who 
constructed our pension scheme knew it was a Ponzi scheme and 
knew it would not be there to provide the moneys that would be 
needed for our people to retire on.

the elderly poor, individuals who will live from hand to mouth 
every single day for the remainder of their lives.

the lowest it has ever been.  Are we seeing this crisis dealt 
with by the government?  No.

polluters around for an OECD nation.  Our government is partially 
responsible for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a parliamentary system that is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an education system where the cost is so high that 
education is becoming the purview of only the rich and the 
connected.  We see a dearth of professors and teachers.  We have 
to deal with that now so our children will have people to teach 
them and so we will develop the excellence necessary to move the 
country forward in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our defence system, our soldiers have been given a raise, but 
the public may want to know that the money is being taken away 
from them in raises to the rents for private married quarters and 
in further costs imposed upon our soldiers.  These people are 
worn out and tired and their numbers are insufficient to meet the 
demands the foreign affairs department places upon them. These 
men and women who put their lives on the line for our country are 
worn out and tired and many are suffering from post-traumatic 
stress disorders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Rome burns, this House behaves like a group of people in a 
sandbox.  It is the responsibility of all of us to change that. 
All I can say is that the Prime Minister has in his hands the 
ability to answer questions about Shawinigate.  He and only he 
has the ability to put this all out on the table so that he can 
close this chapter in Canadian politics and move on to the big 
issues I have articulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say on behalf of all Canadians, Mr. Prime Minister, 
open the books, answer the questions and let us move on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman seems to be a reasonable member of parliament.  I want 
to read for him three quotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is from the Leader of the Opposition when he was 
in Alberta in 1996 and an issue affecting some sort of situation 
in the House came up.  He said  “It would be an abdication of 
our role as legislators if we depart from dealing with the 
internal proceedings of this House and hand it over to some other 
adjudicating body”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quote is from the member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  The 
member on January 2 in the <I>National Post</I> in an interview 
commented on this whole situation.  She said “I don't think that 
warrants a criminal investigation.  To be a credible person, 
especially in public life, you have to go to the facts...I don't 
think it would be responsible to make these kinds of 
suggestions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and final quote I want to ask my colleague to comment 
on is from the member for Edmonton North in <I>Hansard</I> on 
March 15 when she indicated that “The Prime Minister could get 
over this in a heartbeat by just tabling his bill of sale for 
those shares in 1993”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleagues to frankly put all of the 
partisanship aside.  With respect to all those statements, the 
Prime Minister has dealt with each one of them in a very 
effective and efficient way.  He has answered each one of them 
openly in the House, outside the House and during an election 
campaign.  At the same time, on the issue of the investigation 
and potential criminal offence the RCMP has looked at these 
issues and one of our colleagues has said there is no problem 
there.  With regard to the third point on tabling the bill of 
sale, the Prime Minister has tabled the bill of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the House to debate the issue in and we have been doing 
so for a long time.  With regard to the second point, there is no 
criminal action by anyone.  On the third point, the Prime 
Minister has tabled all of the necessary documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard all of that, does the member really believe that 
the House should vote for a public inquiry and spend millions of 
dollars unnecessarily? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the 
Opposition was quite correct in saying that things ought to be 
dealt with internally. 
The problem with the issue is that the internal mechanisms in the 
House are inadequate to deal with this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to make the ethics counsellor an independent officer of 
the House and the government decided not to.  This was against 
its red book promise.  If the internal mechanisms functioned in 
the House, as the Leader of the Opposition wanted when he was the 
treasurer of Alberta, we would not be debating this today because 
these questions would be answered.  The problem is that the 
internal mechanisms do not work and the questions still need to 
be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is merely echoing the statements made by the 
Prime Minister's own colleagues from Oshawa, Guelph—Wellington 
and Vaudreuil—Soulanges who want to see an independent public 
inquiry into this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inquiry does not require millions of dollars.  In fact, it 
does not require one red cent.  The Prime Minister only has to 
put the papers on the table, answer the questions and we will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the things that bothers me about 
this debate is that there has been evidence presented by the 
Prime Minister, and I think it is very full and complete 
evidence. However the accusations remain.  I always thought there 
was a presumption of innocence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not feel that what is actually going on here 
with this call for an inquiry is the Prime Minister is being 
asked to prove his innocence?  Is that not what is being asked? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. 
People are innocent until proven guilty.  In all accusations and 
in a court of law people have to put forth their side of the 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is the Prime Minister is not an ordinary 
MP.  Things have taken place of a private nature but public funds 
were used.  Maybe nothing did take place.  However questions have 
to be answered.  These questions refer to public funds being 
used.  Many people have asked these questions, including the 
Prime Minister's own colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are all in agreement that questions need to be 
answered, the member should either get his Prime Minister to 
answer the questions or have the public inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to point out that I 
will be sharing my time with the very capable member for 
Elgin—Middlesex—London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak in opposition to the motion before us here today 
which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls for the establishment of an independent 
judicial inquiry to determine if the Prime Minister is in breach 
of conflict of interest rules regarding his involvement with the 
Grand-Mère Golf Club and the Grand-Mère Inn— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of this motion is the assertion by the opposition 
that the Prime Minister had some personal financial association 
with the hotel he helped in his capacity as a member of 
parliament for Saint-Maurice and supported its application for 
funds to expand for a tourism operation in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the opposition into some unfamiliar territory and 
examine the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to becoming the Prime Minister of this country, the Prime 
Minister sold his shares in a company that owned a golf course 
near a hotel.  The shares never returned to his ownership and the 
opposition, although it tried, has never presented any credible 
evidence to suggest otherwise.  Its fall back position seems to 
be that if it says something loud enough and long enough it 
becomes fact.  The opposition is welcome to its opinion but 
Canadians deserve the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the facts that I alluded to were first introduced in 
the House over two years ago, they resurfaced in earnest during 
the campaign last November as part of the opposition's strategy 
to discredit the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that campaign, at the request of the opposition parties, 
the ethics counsellor examined the situation.  At the time the 
Leader of the Official Opposition and the leader of the 
Conservative Party took great stock, no pun intended, in the fact 
that the ethics counsellor was looking into this matter.  For 
about three days during that campaign the reference to this 
investigation was used as part of the opposition's campaign to 
discredit the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not pull the ethics counsellor off the street.  He was 
the assistant deputy registrar, a career civil servant with an 
impeccable record.  At the time of his appointment we consulted, 
in conjunction with our red book promise, Mr. Lucien Bouchard who 
was the leader of the opposition at the time. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear right away that we fully support the 
appointment of Mr. Howard Wilson as Ethics Counsellor.  We are 
aware that Mr. Wilson has had a praiseworthy career in the 
federal Public Service and that we can have every confidence in 
his ability to take the helm in this matter at a critical time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island said at the time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person in the position right now is an honourable person...He 
is a man of integrity.  He is a man that can be trusted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the heat of an election campaign, after touting the fact 
that this man was looking into it, when he came back with a 
decision the opposition members did not like, they said “he's a 
lap dog”.  All of a sudden this man, a career civil servant, is 
a lap dog.  In my riding the candidate who ran against me held up 
pictures of dogs as a big joke.  It is not a joke.  The only 
person laughing at that is the late Senator Joe McCarthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace that they would use this ends justifies the 
means logic. They do not care who gets in their way.  They have 
one motive in mind and that is to discredit one of the most 
popular prime ministers in the history of this country.  They 
cannot beat him in the ballot box so they are trying to drag him 
down in the gutter and have their way.  We are not going to put 
up with it. We are not going to stand by and let it happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Conservative Party, not happy with the ethics 
counsellor's investigation, called in the RCMP, the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police.  Again he said that they were looking 
into this and that the Prime Minister was under investigation. 
He said it was a great public relations war that they were 
winning. The RCMP came back and said that there was no criminal 
activity. True to form the opposition members moved the goal 
posts.  That is their strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member for Edmonton North said that the bill of sale 
should be said.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister could get over this in a heartbeat by just 
tabling the bill of sale for those shares in 1993. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Conservatives on this issue said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Prime Minister can settle this is to lay upon the 
table of the House of Commons the agreement for the sale between 
himself and Jonas Prince. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Roberval put it this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not understand that the only way to settle this matter, 
to exonerate himself—the only way, there are not 50 of them, 
only one—is to provide us with the record of sale, as we have 
demanded so many times already?  Let him provide that, and the 
problem will be over. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister provided them with the bill of sale and other 
relevant documents.  In the absence of a human to attack, the 
opposition members started attacking the document itself by saying 
“It's a flimsy piece of napkin written in crayon.  It wouldn't 
fit in a typewriter”.  They are not saying that it is not a 
legal document because they know it is a legal document.  If they 
had any guts they would step outside that door and make that 
accusation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want a judicial inquiry they will get it in an awful 
hurry.  That is a legal document.  It transferred the shares. The 
ethics commissioner upheld that ruling and they have had no 
evidence today or in the last two weeks to change that fact. That 
is the foundation that every subsequent allegation they are 
making is built on and it is built on sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca spoke very eloquently. He 
is a member for whom I have great respect.  I listened to the 
entire debate today and the line he was working on was let us err 
on the side of safety.  Let us just have the inquiry anyway just 
to clear the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinguished and respected late Mr. Justice Sopinka of the 
Supreme Court of Canada criticized such action.  He criticized 
action that was aimed directly at the alleged wrongdoing of 
specific individuals which needed to operate within the confines 
of a criminal trial.  Mr. Justice Sopinka said that this kind of 
inquiry based on allegations alone was repugnant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to imagine the repugnance because I have witnessed 
it today.  I witnessed it when a member of the Conservative Party 
compared the Prime Minister's chief of staff to Rasputin.  I ask 
the members if they are sorry for that.  I realize now that they 
are all nodding that they are.  I accept that apology from them. 
It speaks well to them and I appreciate that.  I think they just 
got a little carried away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the member for Calgary—Nose Hill stand up and 
compare the Prime Minister of Canada to Slobodan Milosevic.  This 
is the kind of nonsense that these witch hunts, these 
inquisitions and these fishing expeditions are going to result 
in.  At the end of the day they have no case.  The RCMP told them 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a partisan smear job and it is pay back.  The NDP 
members are upset because we criticized their role in the summit 
of the Americas.  The Tories are upset because they have not 
quite recovered from the number that Canadians did on Mulroney. 
If I understood the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca properly, 
he said we should do this because we are bored.  We should launch 
a judicial inquiry into the Prime Minister of the country out of 
boredom.  It is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has done nothing more than be a good MP for 
the people of his riding.  The motion before the House is an 
insult to his good name and an insult to his long standing 
reputation for the highest ethical behaviour.  The member for 
Leeds—Grenville is not going to be drawn into this nonsense. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
did not get into this debate yet and I did that for a specific 
reason.  Frankly, sometimes I think I have terrible luck because 
I got stuck being on duty today of all days, and I have had to 
listen to this debate ad nauseam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly believe that all the points were made were in the 
first two speeches.  That was much earlier today, and I have had 
to sit here.  I think the public is probably tired of hearing 
about all of this.  I honestly do not know if there is any 
substance to these allegations or not, neither does the public 
nor does anyone in this room.  This is all the more reason why 
more and more people are asking parliament to be done with this 
issue and move on to some issues of substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the reason the House of Commons could be seized by such 
a petty issue is that the legislative agenda of the Liberal 
government is such thin gruel that there is very little else to 
debate.  Nature hates a vacuum and when there is one all kinds of 
things rush in to fill that space.  That is what we are seeing 
with the precious time we have in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister not 
agree that there are far more issues of substance that we should 
be dealing with?  We should be dealing with the recent articles 
we saw from groups like the anti-poverty activists on the growing 
gap between the rich and the poor, which is expanding to an 
embarrassing degree.  Would the parliamentary secretary not be 
willing to admit that his government is partly at fault for not 
having any issues of substance for the country to really get 
seized on, therefore leaving a vacuum that can be filled by the 
waste of time we are witnessing today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the 
member who I have a great deal of respect for, if we are guilty 
of that, let us be guilty of that.  However the frustrations that 
many of us feel with the disconnect that we are having with 
voters should not manifest itself in some kind of judicial 
inquiry based on revenge.  I do not think that is the way the 
system works.  We have to keep these issues separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my original point.  The critical piece that is 
missing from the glass house that has been built by the 
opposition is the fact that the shares were sold in 1993. 
Without that link, without the potential for financial gain, they 
have nothing.  To walk down the road of a judicial inquiry to the 
highest office in the land based on no facts, I have to share 
Justice Sopinka's view, would be a repugnant act and a disservice 
to our constituents and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues that member raises are valid.  I think Canadians want 
this place to start addressing the issues of the day.  I had to 
laugh today when the Leader of the Opposition stood up and said 
they had been talking about softwood lumber for months.  He must 
be referring to the pine trees on the golf course because that is 
the only lumber that they have been talking about for four 
months.  They have been absolutely obsessed with this thing, like 
a dog with a bone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Conservative Party is on a self-confessed 
fishing expedition.  I hope he is outside because it is getting 
warm, the ice is melting and I know he is not a good swimmer.  He 
is going to go down into a very deep hole if he is not careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to move on.  In the absence of any facts or 
proof, when we are standing here with a document from the ethics 
counsellor and a document from the RCMP saying there is no 
criminal wrongdoing, then there is no basis to go any further 
than this.  It is just cheap partisan tactics and it ends here.

the member for Elk Island in a similar situation, I will give him 
the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured that the Liberal member would quote from 
one of my speeches back in 1994 when the ethics counsellor was 
first appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably said what he quoted.  I do not have a total 
recollection of what I said that many years ago.  I can hardly 
believe that he quoted everything I said because I would almost 
certainly have said “too bad that he is not independent”. I 
trust the ethics counsellor as a person but he is not independent 
as promised in the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on the fact that the 
ethics counsellor was hired by and is answerable only to the 
Prime Minister and not to parliament directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, was the member referring to 
me?   I was elected by the people of Leeds—Grenville to 
represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted the member accurately.  For the love of God, I will not 
go back into the archives and read any more of his speeches to 
correct it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the previous speaker and I congratulate him on 
the fine job he did.  I also want to pick up on a theme of my 
hon. opponent from the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is repetitive because the facts in the matter are not very 
complicated.  The whole issue turns on very simple facts.  We 
debated those facts during the election campaign.  Why in heavens 
name would the opposition want to bring up an issue that was 
discussed very thoroughly?  It did what opposition parties do in 
a campaign, which is to try to make the Liberals and its leader 
look bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians heard that the Prime Minister called a bank manager 
about getting a loan for a business in his own riding.  The Prime 
Minister explained that was a normal function of what a member of 
parliament does.  They intervene with businesses like the 
Business Development Bank.  I have called the Business 
Development Bank on behalf of constituents in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canadians may have felt some unease about the power of the 
Prime Minister's office, they acknowledged that he is a member of 
parliament, that he sits as an ordinary MP and that he plays by 
the rules.  They knew he had constituents to represent the same 
way all of us do.  They made a judgment and re-elected the Prime 
Minister with a bigger majority than he had in the previous 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the opposition feel that there is some tiny nugget or 
some huge scandal.  Talking to the people in my riding, Canadians 
are sick of this issue and sick of the opposition tactics.  They 
do not understand why we are not discussing issues of significant 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members remember the debate we had on free trade years ago 
and how that was a huge issue for parliamentarians?  There was a 
big debate across the country.  We will have an extension of that 
in a few weeks time with the negotiations in Quebec City. Do we 
hear about that from the opposition?  I agree that we hear about 
it from the fourth party.  The New Democrats are making an issue 
of it but the remaining parliamentarians are relatively silent on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like the rest of my Liberal colleagues, will not support the 
motion.  We see it as cheap political theatrics.  It is not doing 
parliament nor the opposition any good, and the polling numbers 
will show that.  If we were to have an election today I think we 
would come back with even a stronger majority, but I agree that 
is speculative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I oppose the motion because we have all the relevant documents. 
The ethics counsellor has confirmed that there is no conflict of 
interest.  Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong?  Most 
certainly not.  He had no personal interest in the hotel.  The 
opposition has tried to string together the business of the hotel 
with the business of the golf course to say that he did but that 
just does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Prime Minister sold his shares in 1993 he had an 
outstanding debt owed to him.  Any changes in the value of the 
golf course had no effect on the value of the debt.  That is 
basic to any contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition members wanted to they could probably make an 
argument that the Prime Minister had an interest in all Mr. 
Prince's affairs.  What do we want to do?  Do we want to look at 
everything that Mr. Prince owned and see if the Prime Minister 
was involved in trying to make Mr. Prince more able to pay back 
the debt?  That would be a huge fishing expedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton North said that the Prime Minister could 
get over this in a heartbeat by just tabling the bill of sale for 
those shares in 1993. 
The Prime Minister tabled the bill of sale though he did not have 
to do so.  When he tabled it the opposition then said that it did 
not mean anything.  That has been typical of the whole scenario.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to have a judicial inquiry and it cleared the Prime 
Minister or said that he did not do anything wrong, that he acted 
as a normal parliamentarian, I am sure the opposition would then 
slam the judicial inquiry.  It would then ask who the judges were 
and say that they were appointed by the Prime Minister and that 
they were biased.  It would go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite made a lot of fuss about the bill of sale.  The 
members for Roberval, Edmonton North, 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, and Calgary Centre said that all 
the Prime Minister had to do was present the bill of sale to the 
House and the matter would be over.  It is now two weeks since he 
presented the bill of sale in the House.  Is the matter over? No, 
because the opposition wants to keep grinding at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the analogy of beating a dead horse.  The opposition 
got the bill of sale and it is not happy because it shows that 
the Prime Minister did not have a personal interest in the whole 
affair.  His interest was for a constituent and he did what any 
of us would do as members of parliament.  He intervened on behalf 
of his riding.  That is what members of parliament do.  That is 
what the opposition does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong?  I ask members in the 
House who have made representations on behalf of their 
constituents if they have done anything wrong.  This issue of 
calling the bank came up at all candidates debates during the 
election.  It probably came up in the campaigns of my colleagues. 
It was an issue that needed some explaining during the campaign 
and Canadians have spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back with a bigger majority and a greater margin of 
victory than in the last election.  Canadians understand it even 
if the opposition does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the opposition will be honest enough to say that in our 
constitutional system one of the most important responsibilities 
of members of parliament is to represent the interests of their 
constituents.  It is a fundamental part of our form of democracy. 
We are elected out of communities and we are supposed to 
represent those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong?  We can ask the ethics 
counsellor who has already told both the official and the 
unofficial opposition leaders: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Prime Minister had no personal financial interest in play. 
He was dealing as an MP on behalf of a constituent. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his statement on March 1 he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal debt owed the Prime Minister was unaffected by the 
value of the golf course.  If the value increased, the Prime 
Minister had no claims for a higher payment.  If the value of the 
course were to decrease, the debt owed to the Prime Minister 
remained the same. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition tried to discredit the ethics counsellor, a 
respected public servant who has only done his job.  I wish to 
say that I believe what he told us when he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it would be unfair and inappropriate to the interest of a 
minister's constituents to extend to crown corporations the rules 
which apply in the case of a quasi-judicial tribunal and which 
limit the capacity of a minister to represent his or her 
constituents. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, do we want to put constituents of the Minister 
of National Defence, the Minister of Justice or the Prime 
Minister at a disadvantage because they elected people who are 
qualified and honoured to serve in cabinet?  I do not believe so. 
Does the opposition actually think that the constituents of 
Saint-Maurice have less a right to the service of their MP than 
the constituents of another MP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère received a loan from the BDC, the caisse 
populaire and the Fonds de solidarité.  The BDC was not the only 
group to consider the Auberge Grand-Mère a worthwhile investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister influence those other organizations?  Was 
there something untoward in that?  Of course not.  To suggest it 
would be ridiculous.  Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong? 
We can ask the people for whom the expansion of the hotel created 
some 20 new jobs.  We can ask the people in the region of 
relatively high unemployment who have a source of work today 
because the hotel has been able to stay open for business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong?  We can ask the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police who looked into the matter at the request

</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP found that there were no grounds to launch a criminal 
investigation.  Therefore on what grounds should we have an 
inquiry?  Judicial inquiries should not be created to satisfy the 
political interests of the opposition.  There was no hard 
evidence of criminal activity.  There was none and the RCMP has 
told us as much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be the point of such an inquiry?  The opposition 
referred the issue to the ethics counsellor and it did not like 
what he said.  It referred it to the RCMP that found no grounds 
for investigation, but it did not want to hear that either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been subjected to unthinkable scrutiny 
and questioning and has taken the unprecedented step of tabling 
in the House the private documents the opposition asked to see. 
It is still not satisfied.  The opposition wants us to spend 
thousands and millions of taxpayer dollars so that maybe it can 
dig up something on which to attack the Prime Minister.  There is 
nothing, absolutely nothing, to be found.  The opposition still 
would not be satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was not elected to waste time and money on this 
kind of nonsense.  The government and all members of parliament 
were elected to devote time, energy and resources to what matters 
to Canadians: the environment, health care, international trade, 
and the well-being of the agricultural sector.  Canadians are 
more interested in having their time and money spent on those 
kinds of public inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are ready to get on with the business of Canada whenever the 
opposition gets over this and turns to what matters to Canadians. 
I ask all hon. members to oppose the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, every professional organization I 
know of in Canada formulates its own code of ethics.  Lawyers, 
doctors, teachers and every local government board that I served 
on formulate their own code of ethics.  They have a living 
document in their possession.  We in the House do not have a 
living document as to what constitutes a code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member who has just spoken not agree that the 
House and the most senior government in Canada should have a 
living document that spells out a code of ethics?  Should we not 
have a part in what formulates it so it can be shown to all 
Canadians that we adhere to one policy on both sides of the House 
and not the way it is right now?  Should we as a parliamentary 
group not select, much as we do the Speaker, the ethics 
counsellor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is asking if we 
need a code of conduct.  I appreciate that and perhaps there is a 
good argument that we should have a code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was not an MP between 1993 and 1997, but there was a 
committee that studied the issue of a joint parliamentary code of 
conduct for private members and members of the Senate.  It dealt 
with issues like accepting money for travelling and a variety of 
other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are debating today is not a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians.  It is a code of conduct for the Prime Minister 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that the Prime Minister, in order to 
remain as Prime Minister, must enjoy the confidence of the House. 
He is the one who is ultimately responsible for making sure that 
his government maintains an ethical standard.  As first minister 
he is the one responsible for that.  He is not one of my equals. 
He is the Prime Minister, and as such he is the one responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does not live up to the standards expected of him then 
presumably he would lose the confidence of the House, and there 
would be consequences that would flow from that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  there are a number of questions that 
leave the issue wide open.  When people look at an issue and see 
that questions are half answered, that questions are evaded or 
that answers do not match the questions, they keep coming back to 
ask them.  These questions will not go away until they are 
clearly answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, why was there a bill of sale when no money was ever 
exchanged?  It seems like the bill of sale was a meaningless 
document.  Why did a banker who was either fired or demoted take 
his problems to the courts?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did Madam Marcotte say in the <I>National Post</I> recorded 
interview that this father figure wanted the property for his 
retirement?  These are all questions that Canadians want to have 
answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are saying that we should get beyond this. 
However there is a problem:  we need the answers or nothing can 
happen.  Would the member comment on the necessity of having 
questions clearly answered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not disagree more. 
The questions have all been asked and in fact have been answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raises the issue of the bill of sale.  It is normal routine 
that cash does not always transfer or payment does not always 
transfer at the time something is bought.  I go to the store 
every day and sometimes I make purchases on credit.  There is a 
wonderful thing called credit.  Do I still have a bill of sale 
when I walk out of the store even though I have not paid for it? 
I may have bought it on credit but I have not paid my MasterCard 
yet or whatever.  That is a normal part of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the bank manager being fired and raising it in 
the courts.  I will remind the hon. member that this fellow 
obviously thinks he has a grievance.  He was a Mulroney 
appointment.  He was not our appointment.  The gentleman thinks 
he has a grievance in terms of wrongful dismissal, so of course 
he will whip up as many problems as he possibly can to try to 
paint himself as a victim of something negative that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he was fired for perfectly legitimate reasons.  I do not 
know, but that still does not affect the basic issue.  The 
details of this fellow being fired do not go to the heart of the 
matter.  The heart of the matter has been fully discussed.  It 
has been fully answered.  It was fully discussed in the midst of 
a campaign and Canadians have indicated that they are satisfied 
with the answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I beg your indulgence as I am having trouble with my voice today. 
I guess I will not be able to do what some other members have 
done, which is to yell louder when the argument is weak.  Since I 
will not be able to do that today, I had better make sure my 
arguments are solid.  I will be sharing my time with my colleague 
from St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very difficult chore today.  Actually I am asking for a 
miracle.  My chore is to persuade enough Liberal members to vote 
for the motion.  I think that all or most opposition members will 
vote in favour of the motion.  My chore is to persuade enough 
Liberal members that the motion has sufficient merit to vote for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason my chore is so difficult is that the Prime Minister, 
who is actually the subject of the motion today, has the 
authority by the traditions of the House to tell those members 
how to vote.  I have an idea.  I do not have any evidence for it, 
but I have a strong suspicion that all Liberals on command will 
vote against the motion.  I am aware that the vote has been 
deferred and will be held tomorrow night.  We will see what 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should begin by looking directly at what the amended motion 
says.  It would state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls for the immediate establishment of an 
independent judicial inquiry to determine if the Prime Minister 
is in breach of conflict of interest rules regarding his 
involvement with the Grand-Mère Golf Club and the Grand-Mère Inn; 
and that the inquiry should have broad terms of reference with 
the power to subpoena all relevant documents and witnesses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now argue in favour of the motion.  Many of the speeches 
today on both sides of the House have been arguing the various 
aspects of the case, which I believe should be argued in front of 
an independent judicial committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened so far is that accusations have been made from 
this side that the opposite side vehemently denies or refuses to 
answer.  As a matter of fact, from my point of view it adds 
credence to the suggestion that there is guilt on the other side. 
When one evades the answer it is because the answer is 
self-indicting. 
I should not use quite that strong a term, but that is what 
happens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask questions of members on the other side, whether it 
is the Minister of Industry or the Prime Minister himself, they 
do not answer the questions at all.  They talk about something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It actually reminded me of when I was a youngster decades ago. I 
remember one in vogue joke that was going around.  It was a 
little riddle that asked how many flapjacks it took to shingle 
the roof of a doghouse.  The answer was 24 because a cow does not 
have feathers.  If you can make sense of that, Mr. Speaker, I 
will give you the highest mark.  It was just the weird sense of 
humour we had in Saskatchewan when we were youngsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the House can see my analogy is that the answer had no 
relevance at all to the question.  Even the question did not make 
any sense.  Who knows anything about using flapjacks to shingle 
the roof of a doghouse?  Both the question and the answer were 
nonsensical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members say our questions are nonsensical and so they 
give nonsensical answers.  On the other hand we think our 
questions have great merit.  We ask our questions, but the 
perception on the other side is that they are nonsensical 
questions and therefore deserve nonsensical answers.  Then we 
hear the nonsensical answers and we say they totally evade the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to about 50 Liberals today.  I know I will not get them 
all.  They say they trust the Prime Minister.  They believe he is 
clean in this matter.  They are tired of this mess.  Therefore 
they feel it is high time to put this matter to rest and to make 
sure it is put to rest they need somebody who is independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved in the joint House of Commons-Senate committee in 
the 35th parliament where we talked about producing a code of 
ethics for parliamentarians, for MPs and senators.  I had quite a 
bit of experience at that time.  We were talking even then about 
the necessity of having an independent ethics commissioner, which 
is vastly different from the ethics counsellor we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that in the 1993 election campaign the 
Liberals campaigned on having an independent ethics counsellor, 
one who would report to parliament as the auditor general reports 
to parliament.  Instead we got a non-independent ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister actually 
quoted me when I said that we trusted Howard Wilson.  He is a 
good man.  I probably said that.  I know that was my thinking at 
the time.  I presumed he quoted accurately that part of my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at that time I was adamant that person should be 
independent of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister has shown 
over and over again an almost unseemly level of loyalty to his 
ministers.  I do not know whether it is at the Prime Minister's 
instigation or whether they did it by themselves, but I think of 
the minister of immigration who during the election campaign said 
things that were totally untrue.  She laid accusations at the 
feet of members of our party that were just not accurate.  Did he 
hold her accountable for that?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same could be said for the junior minister responsible 
women's issues and whatever else.  I do not remember all of her 
title.  She also has made statements lately that categorize 
people in a most unseemly way.  The Prime Minister stands and 
defends that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that his ministers can pretty well do 
anything they want and that his job is to defend them because the 
Liberal Party can never make mistakes.  That weakens the position 
of the counsellor.  Even if the ethics counsellor says things 
which are accurate, they are not believed because of the 
relationship the counsellor has with the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people believe that part of the role of the ethics 
counsellor is to be on the damage control team.  That is very 
unfortunate and neutralizes a lot of the benefit that we could 
have if we had a true, independent ethics commissioner with the 
right to look up documents and to ask people to give accurate 
information.  Instead, we have an ethics counsellor who 
occasionally conducts media interviews but other than that 
answers only to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the ethics counsellor questions his role. 
I was intrigued to read in some notes that were prepared for us 
that he gave a speech in Australia a little over a year ago.  It 
is interesting that when asked about his role he basically said 
that he had no legal status and no powers of investigation.  He 
answers only to the Prime Minister and sees himself as his 
defender.  He said in his speech in Australia in February 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has evolved so that I would be expected to publicly 
defend the decisions of ministers.  I have had to do so to 
explain the Prime Minister's interests in a golf course. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically he was saying that because of his relationship with 
the Prime Minister he was expected to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to Liberal members that we do not have an independent 
ethics commissioner.  We have an ethics counsellor.  We basically 
have a spitting match between opposite sides of the story, even 
between the different media.  The <I>Globe and Mail</I> says one 
thing.  The Toronto <I>Star</I> joins in and then the <I>National 
Post</I> says just the opposite.  We are all talking to one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we have an independent judicial inquiry as 
proposed in the motion so that it is able to get at the truth by 
having the ability to subpoena witnesses and documents and that 
when it gives its report it will be believable because it is 
truly independent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of the member opposite, I 
would like to read a precis of what his leader said at the 
opening of this debate in justification of an inquiry.  He said 
that some of the Prime Minister's disciples have said that the 
Prime Minister could not be capable of anything less than full 
disclosure and full honesty.  “It is important to note that we 
are talking about the Prime Minister who ordered men and women to 
vote against their word.  We are talking about a Prime Minister 
who ordered them to break their word.  Would he be capable of 
contradiction on this file?  Absolutely”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody asked me to break my word.  When I speak in the House it 
is my word that is my guide and my conscience.  What the leader 
did in impugning the honesty of the Prime Minister was that he 
impugned the honesty of every member in the House.  This is what 
the debate is really about.  It is about a leader who has in fact 
broken his own eighth commandment, which I point out is not just 
about lies.  We do not say he lies.  It is about harming the 
reputation of another individual.  That is precisely what was 
said here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard not to get excited, but the majority of people on 
this side and in the House act according to their conscience. 
When one attacks the leader of this country, when one attacks his 
honesty based on his ordering people to break their word, it 
simply is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we had a chance to debate 
between the two of us, I would simply challenge the member.  In 
the 1993 election he campaigned for an independent ethics 
commissioner.  The vote that he is referring to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  No, I did not.  Read my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am allowing the hon. member to get at me 
by heckling.  I need to ignore it, so I will do that.  The hon. 
member campaigned on that.  We put forward a motion which used 
that campaign promise word for word and then he stood and 
voted against it. 
My question would be why he voted against it.

call for a vote on the motion?

appropriate question for the hon. member for Elk Island to ask. 
My response would be that normally, had the vote taken place

that the vote was deferred, the business still concludes at 5.15

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ)</B> 
moved that Bill C-222, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required 
in employment), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank my colleague 
from Sherbrooke who seconded this bill. On behalf of my 
constituents of 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans whom I am 
the privilege of representing, it gives me great pleasure to 
speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the members present and of our viewers, I 
should mention that this is a private member's bill that will be 
voted on after a three hour debate at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on 
the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business for accepting my 
arguments that this bill is so important that it should be made 
votable so that we can get clear directions from parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subcommittee is non partisan by definition. The best proof 
of that is that the government is represented by only two members 
and that all four opposition parties are represented. Therefore, 
the subcommittee makes its decisions by consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second time that I have introduced a bill on this 
issue. Members will remember that, before the election, I had 
introduced Bill C-205, but I will come back to this later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to allow mechanics to deduct the cost 
of providing tools for their employment. In the last 15 years, 
members from almost all parties have introduced private member's 
bills to ensure that mechanics could deduct the cost of their 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in the last parliament, I introduced Bill C-205, which 
was exactly the same as this one. It was not only voted on, since 
it was made a votable item, but it was supported by a majority of 
members, with 213 members voting in favour and only 11 against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see across the way the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance and member for Etobicoke North, who criticized my bill 
at second reading. But members were able to rise above 
partisanship and members from all parties ignored the directions 
coming from the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the vote on Bill C-205, where 213 members voted in 
favour of it and 11 against, demonstrated that members understood 
the hardships faced by young mechanics and came together to offer 
them a modest tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the bill died on the order paper after the 
November 27 election was called, here I am once again promoting 
my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much support for the provisions of this bill that, 
in the last parliament, even the Standing Committee on Finance 
with its Liberal majority recommended in its prebudget report 
that this tax break be granted to automotive mechanics in Canada 
and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the support given to this bill is only one aspect of 
the importance of issues involved. Several other issues deserve 
to be addressed once again in the House of Commons and drawn to 
the public's attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also talk about the lack of fairness in a tax system 
that allows some tradesmen, but not others, to write off the cost 
of their tools and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is becoming more and more necessary as time goes by. 
The amount of money mechanics had to pay to buy their tools when 
this issue was first brought before the House 15 years ago has 
increased tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that cars were far less sophisticated 10 years ago. 
Computer assisted components, which are now standard on most 
cars, are as much part of the new economy as the most recent 
Internet technologies and services provided by new high tech 
companies based in Montreal or in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the common sense of my colleagues on both sides of 
the House because, after all, the main purpose of this bill is to 
help young people who choose this trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our society, we cannot have white collar workers only, people 
who work with computers or in businesses where working conditions 
are exemplary. Our society cannot be made up of white collar 
workers and professionals only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some young people do not mind getting their hands dirty. Because 
they love auto mechanics, they are prepared to slide under cars. 
With our climate in Canada, cars often leak and oil and engine 
coolant literally drip onto the mechanics' faces. Just imagine 
what mechanics with 20, 25, 30 and 35 years of experience have 
gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, since this has traditionally been a man's job, 
the field has been dominated by men and there are very few women 
auto mechanics. There are a few but, unfortunately, not many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time auto mechanics reach the age of 50 or 55, their 
quality of life has dropped. For years on end, these people work 
hard to remove transmission parts, engine parts and tires and 
they wreck their backs or develop disc problems. They must be 
recognized for the value of the work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young mechanics, fresh out of school, often have to pay between 
$3,000 and $4,000 for the most basic toolbox. To get a job at a 
service station or a car dealership, an apprentice must have his 
own toolbox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that a personnel director, or a garage owner or 
manager is going to ask is “Do you have your own set of tools?” 
In order to get hired, he must shell out $3,000 to $4,000 for his 
own tools, not to mention what he has often spent on tuition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some young people studying automobile mechanics may have parents 
who are comfortably off, who have paid all their tuition, but 
others are graduating with huge debts at the end of a lengthy 
occupational training course, such as we have in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for specialists, they must come up with close to $40,000, and 
this is no exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my office staff and I prepared this speech, and I take this 
opportunity to thank my parliamentary intern, Jonathan Weier, who 
worked very hard doing the research for it, I must say that I 
found $40,000 a bit steep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I checked this amount out.  I went to service stations and 
car dealerships and I asked to see the toolkit of an experienced 
mechanic.  They opened all the drawers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I mention the amount of $40,000, do not think, Mr. Speaker, 
that I am exaggerating because a set 
of tools for a specialist can easily cost as much as $40,000. 
I do not wish to suggest that you would 
do such a thing because I am sure that, like the member for 
Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, you too have had occasion to 
visit car dealerships and realize that I am right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cars have hybrid propulsion systems now. In all likelihood, in 
the future, the more cars will have computerized components or 
hybrid traction systems, the more parts and the toolkit of 
mechanics used to repair these hybrid systems will have to be 
adapted accordingly.  As we will recall, last year Toyota 
introduced the <I>Prius</I>, which is part electric, part gasoline. 
This means more expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only difference between a newly hired mechanic and a young 
worker at Bombardier or somewhere else is that the Bombardier 
employee earns a fair amount more and has all the tools he needs 
supplied by his employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, in its throne speech on January 30, 2001, the 
present government made a commitment “to support training 
programs, support the new economy and encourage continuing 
education among Canadian workers”.  However, the government could 
give workers in traditional sectors some sign of its respect. 
Ongoing education and training programs seem to apply only to 
this new active population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is unfair and shortsighted to ignore those who play 
such an important role in the economy of Quebec and Canada in the 
21st century, even though they work in a more traditional sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a much more egalitarian, more fair society we must 
recognize that we need all professions.  I paid for my studies by 
doing custodial work at the Chicoutimi hospital. 
I was just a student, but I was still in a position to understand 
that while a hospital had its physicians and surgeons, it still 
need its cleaners.  Without a “mopologist”, as we called them 
at that time in Chicoutimi, to clean the ER and the OR, no great 
surgeon would operate, unless he was prepared to do so in 
conditions of minimal hygiene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we have a duty to acknowledge the 
contribution of certain categories of workers in the rather more 
traditional jobs.  We need to be open to the new economy and 
to make way for new employment sectors. I am not saying we should 
go back to horse and cart days. We need to recognize that 
there are workers who are entitled to help, even if they work in 
more traditional sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high costs associated with mechanical work will continue to 
put pressure on the automobile industry and will make it hard for 
young people to get into the trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a June 1999 publication, the Canadian Automotive Repair and 
Service Council stated that “The biggest challenge facing the 
industry as the 20th century comes to an end will be to attract 
young people to its ranks”.  This is one of the major issues in 
this sector: the serious shortage of young people wanting to join 
the trade, a shortage that does not seem likely to improve any 
time soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the factors that influence the attraction of this industry 
directly is the cost of tools for young apprentices and 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, a young person who graduates from high school 
at age 21 or 22 and wants to apprentice will have to invest 
several thousand dollars in his work. 
After paying off thousands of dollars in student debts, he will 
earn an average of $23,000, that is what apprentices make in 
Canada, while a mechanic with some experience earns $29,000. 
Whether it is $23,000 or $29,000, we are not talking about 
workers who earn $50,000 or $60,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before being elected to the House, I was a director of personnel 
in the pulp and paper industry. I know the salaries that are 
paid in the pulp and paper industry. I am not saying these 
workers do not work hard; they work conscientiously and do 
quality work. These people are not at the top of the salary 
scale, with apprentices earning $23,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most professionals in Canada are provided with the tools they 
need for their work, but not mechanics. 
For one reason or another, the automotive industry, gas 
stations, garages and other businesses employing mechanics 
decided that providing one's own tools was a condition of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is that mechanics will be more careful with their own 
tools and will maintain and adapt them to best do the work that 
they have to do. This is particularly unfair, since there are 
many other professions where workers are allowed to deduct, for 
income tax purposes, expenses incurred for their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance will say: But what about electricians? What about 
plumbers? An electrician does not have the same tool kit as an 
automobile technician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope the parliamentary secretary has changed his mind after 
seeing 213 members voting in favour of my bill, but we will see 
soon enough. During his speech, I would like him to think about 
the performers, the musicians and the chainsaw operators who are 
entitled to deduct the cost of the tools of their trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we and the auto mechanics and the automotive industry 
associations are asking for is simply justice and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has the support of members from all political 
parties. It has nothing to do with the differences of opinion 
between the right and the left, the sovereignists and the 
federalists. With this bill, and I am glad I was able to convince 
the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business, I want to rise 
above party lines. 
We have to put politics aside. Yes, I am a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois and I am the one who raised the issue. I was able to 
convince my colleagues in the House. I was fortunate to win out 
in the draw. However, I am just a messenger here trying to move 
forward a vision of fairness and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I am not a car buff. I invite members to drop by my 
place and have a look at my toolbox. It is very basic. I have a 
hard time just putting oil in my car engine. I am not good 
around cars. However the people I have met during election campaigns 
and parliamentary breaks have convinced me that something has to 
be done about this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind those who have doubts about the possibility of 
Bill C-222 being passed that the Income Tax Act is amended 
regularly throughout the year in order to bring it into line 
with new social realities.  As for authorities being able to 
prevent the use of tools for personal projects, I say that we 
must trust people.  There is no reason to question their honesty 
and goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government expressed a certain sympathy, it has 
still not taken action to resolve the problem by introducing 
this tax credit in the budgets it has brought down since the 
1997 report by the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the broad support enjoyed by this measure in the 
House of Commons, I have received many letters of support from 
organizations in the industry, private citizens, labour unions 
and almost all groups with an interest in the issue.  The 
Automotive Industries Association of Canada, for instance, 
pointed out the growing difficulty of finding qualified 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in the number of car owners in Canada and in Quebec 
is increasing our dependence on the automotive industry.  We 
must address this serious problem facing the industry.  In my 
view, the bill is a matter of common sense, justice and good 
financial planning.  Obviously, the majority of members on both 
sides of the House agree with me.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I have changed my mind, but 
this initiative has received the government's attention, and I 
congratulate the member on his tenacity with this measure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to speak to some of the shortcomings of the bill. 
First, the private member's bill proposes changes to the Income 
Tax Act to help mechanics defray the cost of providing their own 
tools when doing so is a condition of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes would allow mechanics to deduct the cost of buying, 
renting, insuring or maintaining their tools.  An income 
deduction would be available for tools that cost less than $250. 
That amount may be adjusted according to inflation.  Higher tool 
costs would be subject to some form of capital cost allowance. 
The allowances would be set by special regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian employers normally provide workers with tools and other 
resources they need to do their jobs.  Canadian workers 
nonetheless bear job related costs, whether in getting to and 
from work, buying uniforms or other work clothes, eating away 
from home or keeping up with trade journals.  All Canadians incur 
costs when they take a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill aims to recognize that employed mechanics face 
exceptional work related costs.  The Government of Canada 
understands that tool costs can be significant, particularly at 
the start of a career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will put some of these issues in perspective.  First I 
will talk about the cost of tools.  We have heard many estimates. 
Today the member opposite cited an amount of $40,000.  When we 
debated this bill previously I was struck by the wildly different 
numbers members had proposed in the Chamber.  Different members 
stood and told us a mechanic could pay $10,000 or $25,000 or even 
$75,000 for their tools. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, maybe those are possible. Let us look instead at what is 
normal.  The Canadian Automotive Repairs and Service Council 
surveyed technicians and apprentices a couple of years ago. 
They found that half of these mechanics owned some $20,000 worth 
of tools.  But this is just an average.  About a third of 
mechanics said they owned more than $30,000 worth of tools, for 
example.  Either way, whether it is $20,000 or even more, these 
tools obviously add up to quite a bit of money. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at it a different way.  Let us suppose a mechanic 
spends $20,000 on tools and uses them over a 40 year career.  It 
is not obvious whether that is a tremendous burden.  I do not 
believe either of those numbers is right.  The numbers that make 
more sense are annual expenditures.  Annual costs give us a 
better sense of affordability.  They take into account that tools 
need to be replaced or updated over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A journeyman mechanic who has a basic tool kit probably built it 
up while learning the trade.  How much would he or she need to 
spend to keep the tools intact and updated?  The same Canadian 
Automobile Repair and Service Council survey I mentioned earlier 
would suggest that the average expenditure is about $1,500 per 
year.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four in ten mechanics say that they spend less than $1,000 per 
year and 23% of mechanics say that they spend more than $2,500 
per year. However there are two key points.  The costs are not 
the same for everyone and one's ability to handle the costs 
depends on how much money one makes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this House all know that mechanics are not rich. 
They do, however, earn a better living than many other workers. 
Let us try to put it in perspective.  In 1996, the average 
automotive service technician  was making about $38,000 a year, 
not $26,000 as the Bloc Quebecois member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same year, the average university graduate was making 
just over $42,000.  And people with less than a university 
degree earned an average of $26,000.  These are real numbers, 
based on the 1996 census. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are not rich but they do all right compared to the 
national averages and compared to tradespeople, like bricklayers 
and carpenters, who make about $34,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the Canadian Automobile Repair and Service 
Council survey one more time.  It asked members to report how 
much they made.  Some 15% said they made less than $25,000 per 
year, most of them no doubt apprentices, but 13% said they made 
more than $55,000 per year.  Again, the point I make is that 
everyone's situation is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to another issue.  When we recently debated a 
similar bill I was struck by the fact that all but one of the 
speakers singled out the impact of tool costs on the number of 
apprentice mechanics entering the field.  I will take a minute to 
focus on apprentices' tool expenses and their earnings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the first question is, how much does it cost for a 
starter toolbox and tools?  Well, the CARS Council says it can 
cost between $3,000 and $4,000.  This is just the basic starter 
kit.  The apprentice would add more tools as he or she 
progressed through the apprenticeship program.  During a typical 
four year apprenticeship, it would not be unheard of to spend 
$15,000 and sometimes more.  So let us compare that to what 
they earn.  The average annual income is about $20,000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would certainly be a challenge for an apprentice mechanic to 
buy $3,000 worth of tools on an annual income of $20,000 per 
year.  We understand that.  In some cases the costs might even 
make someone think twice before signing up to be a mechanic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only want to reinforce my point.  That this bill fails to take 
into account the different circumstances faced by different 
mechanics.  At one level, we have apprentices who pay somewhere 
around $3,000 a year for tools, on an annual salary of $20,000, 
and we have journeymen spending around $1,500 a year on tools, 
while they are making $38,000 a year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At another level we have different journeymen with different 
incomes and tool expenses.  Is that what the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans wanted, to 
help a mechanic earning $60,000 a year write off $500 in tools? 
Perhaps that is his intention, but what will he tell the plumber 
or carpenter who must cover similar tool costs out of pocket?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is merit in the idea behind this private member's bill. 
The very substantial employment expenses incurred by some 
employed mechanics are certainly a concern.  I would also say 
that exceptionally high work related expenses should not prevent 
people from participating in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill fails to distinguish between those who can 
reasonably afford to cover tool costs and those who might really 
need some help.  The government intends to work with 
representatives from the automobile industry to explore better 
options to address this issue, particularly with respect to the 
challenges faced by apprentices.  In exploring other options the 
government hopes to find ways to address some of the shortcomings 
of the private member's bill.  Accordingly, I would ask members 
to think carefully about this bill before supporting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy indeed to rise to speak to this bill.  This 
probably makes half a dozen times or so in the seven years I have 
been here that I have risen to speak to it, and it is an 
important enough issue that I am pleased to speak to it every 
time I get a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance make his comments as the member for Etobicoke North. 
Last time, about two weeks ago when it was my private member's 
bill, which is essentially the same bill that the member was 
responding to, he had a whole different set of excuses.  These 
clearly are excuses and it is some of the dumbest reasoning for 
not supporting the bill that I have ever heard in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is some of the dumbest indeed.  He says mechanics do all 
right, that some make $50,000 or more a year, and for that reason 
they are not in need of a write-off. It has nothing to do with 
what they are in need of.  It has to do with what is fair under 
the tax act.  It has everything to do with what is fair compared 
to the way others are treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an issue that mechanics are making low incomes and 
therefore they are charity cases so let us throw them a few 
crumbs.  That is not what it is about.  The member should know 
that.  He should be disgusted with himself for making that kind 
of presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  I'm not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  He said he is not, but he should be.  I 
think that is an awfully sad commentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what this is all about.  We are talking about 
providing tax fairness for technicians and mechanics who as a 
condition of employment must provide their own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said the annual fees are what we 
should be looking at, that the cost of purchasing the tools, 
which may be anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000 for the total tool 
package, is not that important because it is a cost over 40 
years.  If the member knew anything at all about mechanics he 
would know that, first, tools wear out and, second, get lost. 
That is why employers make it a condition of employment for 
mechanics to buy their own tools.  If mechanics do not have their 
own tools, what shop owners have found over the years is that the 
tools disappear.  They are left on vehicles.  Maybe some walk out 
of the shop with the mechanics, although I suggest that is not 
the most common problem.  They are just not as careful with them 
as they are when the tolls are their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that it is a requirement of employment.  We already 
have others under the tax act who in fact can write off the cost 
of their tools.  The member knows that.  We are talking about tax 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, artists, chainsaw operators and musicians can 
already do that.  Besides that, any small business person, 
someone on a farm or in a small town who may even be the only 
employee working in the shop, under that situation, he or she can 
write off all the costs of providing tools, no matter what the 
value of the tools is.  Any business person can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people choose to organize in that fashion, where they have 
their own shop and are doing work for customers out of their own 
shop, they can write everything off.  They should be able to.  It 
is a cost of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics and technicians operate under a unusual set of 
circumstances where there is a high cost to tools provided.  It 
is not like plumbers and carpenters, I suggest.  I would suggest 
that the parliamentary secretary is right in one regard and that 
is that everyone who has a high cost of purchasing tools should 
be allowed to write it off.  However, I suggest there are 
extremely few tradespeople in the same position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are indeed in a very unusual position in that the cost 
of their tools is extremely high.  The $1,300 or whatever the 
annual fee was that the member talked about is only one part of 
it.  When the tool package commonly reaches $30,000 to $50,000 in 
total, it is very difficult for a mechanic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bit of a problem when I hear the member from Etobicoke, 
the parliamentary secretary, saying that mechanics are not doing 
so bad, that they earn $50,000 and therefore we should not grant 
them the same fairness that is granted to private business people 
or to chainsaw operators and the other select group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he should be thinking about his own salary.  As a member 
of parliament, the member makes about $68,000 a year, which is 
about the same as a teacher in Ontario who is at the top end of 
the salary range, but he also earns a supplement for being a 
parliamentary secretary.  That is quite substantial.  As well, he 
gets a tax free allowance, much of which is not used for what 
would be considered legitimate business expenses if he were a 
person working for a company and had an expense account.  Much of 
that tax free allowance—much more than five years ago 
certainly—is an income top-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is talking about $50,000 being a high income and 
therefore we should forget about what is fair.  It bothers me. 
Look at who is saying that:  a person collecting a very healthy 
salary.  I do have a real problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue of some mechanics making a pretty good 
income so we should give them some scraps here and there.  This 
is about tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee, which is controlled by Liberal members, 
has on different occasions said this is the right thing to do. In 
its prebudget report in December 1997, the House of Commons 
finance committee, consisting of a majority of Liberal members, 
this parliamentary secretary's colleagues, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses.  Special provisions in the Income Tax Act 
already apply to artists, chainsaw operators and musicians.  To 
deny this tax treatment to apprentices and technicians in the 
automotive industry is not only unfair, it also imposes an 
impediment to employment, especially for the young who might 
choose to work as apprentices.  Revising the tax treatment of 
such expenses would remove the impediment that exists under the 
present tax rules. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quote from the report of the finance committee from 
1997.  This member's own colleagues certainly held a majority of 
positions on that committee.  That was supported by the members 
of the Reform Party at the time, now the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that was supported in debate by all political 
parties in the House, including colleagues of the parliamentary 
secretary.  The parliamentary secretaries to the finance minister 
seem to be the only people who speak out against the bill.  As 
the Bloc member who sponsored the bill has said, we had a vote in 
the House of Commons just before the election was called.  The 
unnecessary early call of the election interfered with its 
passing.  Only 11 people in the House voted against it.  Most of 
the parliamentary secretary's colleagues, including some cabinet 
ministers, supported this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what are we doing?  There should be no resistance to the 
bill.  It has been well supported and it is time that it was 
implemented.  I speak fully in support of the bill and I know all 
of my colleagues support it.  They think it is an issue of tax 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny how tax fairness for the government only seems to be 
talked about, considered and implemented when that tax fairness 
means raising taxes to one group so that it is fair relative to 
everyone else.  Only when the government can get its mitts on 
more taxes is it an issue of tax fairness.  I say that is not the 
way the country should be going.  We should be looking for 
substantial tax reductions.  Unfortunately, that just is not 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is leading to several very serious problems.  First of all, 
people who may otherwise become technicians and keep the country 
moving with cars, trucks, airplanes and so on are looking 
elsewhere for employment.  Who is going to keep our country going 
as this shortage increases? 
The blame should be laid squarely on the shoulders of the 
government, which refused to act in this issue of tax fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage members of the House, when the bill does come 
up for vote after the third hour of debate, to once again 
unanimously support the bill.  It is a very good bill, which is 
almost identical to the bill I presented, was debated on at least 
two occasions in the House and introduced on more occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the bill.  I am very 
disappointed with the parliamentary secretary and his comments. 
He made a whole new set of excuses, as I have said.  I would be 
happy to go through the excuses from last time, but let us move 
ahead, support the bill, get it to committee and implement it so 
that technicians and mechanics across this country are treated 
fairly under the Income Tax Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, I 
wish to congratulate my colleague from 
Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans on his bill, Bill C-222. 
It is the second time he introduces such a bill in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to see that it is the second time the 
bill is made votable. There is a political will to make the 
necessary changes to allow mechanics to write off the expenses 
incurred for their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will probably recall that I tabled a motion, Motion 
No. 248, dealing with this very subject. When that motion was 
debated, the parliamentary secretary made the same speech. 
Instead of coming to the House of Commons, he could simply press 
a button and we could hear what he has already said. He could 
spend his time doing other things for his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary was saying then “It is not right 
because people who earn less money, who make $20,000, can pay 
more for their tools because they are apprentices. They will 
receive less money from the government, from Revenue Canada. 
Someone earning $35,000 may only spend $1,500 a year, and that is 
not fair”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the government applies the same standard to big 
companies making billions of dollars and those making much less 
or even losing money. Everyone within companies is entitled to 
tax deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary used these arguments in the debate 
on my Motion No. 248, when I asked that the GST on tools of all 
trades be abolished in order to eliminate discrimination. Today, 
he is saying “It is unfortunate, but it would only apply to 
mechanics”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks back, he used the same argument when I was talking 
about all the various trades. The parliamentary secretary may 
have a small problem here. In all fairness, it must be that the 
finance minister, who is the one who has the money, tells the 
parliamentary secretary “This is what I want you to say. 
Tonight, at 5.30 p.m., you will stand up in the House and tell 
everyone that there is no money left for the workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member mentioned wages earlier. I did some 
research back home. Mechanics working in the Brunswick mine spend 
$2,500 a year on tools. It may not be the end of the world, but I 
think a mechanic who leaves for work in the morning, carrying his 
lunch box, has a tough workday in front of him. He will be 
covered in grease by the end of the day. The work he does is 
important for the output of our country. He will be repairing 
equipment, whether it is in a mine or in a garage. 
As far as wages are concerned, a service station, not just in New 
Brunswick but anywhere in the country, is certainly not the place 
workers are going to get the highest pay, especially when they 
are still apprentice mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who introduced this bill is merely asking that 
the government give some recognition, out of respect, for these 
people who will be expected to produce on the job all their 
lives.  Give them a little.  Someone earning $35,000 will pay, I 
don't know, maybe $10,000 or $12,000 in income tax.  This worker 
might well say “With all the taxes I pay, I could at least get a 
little back, say $175”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says “We cannot do so because we are afraid of 
discriminating against others.  We cannot do so because we know 
some mechanics earn less than others.  We cannot do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ridiculous.  The government never has that problem, as I 
have said, when it is comes to corporations that are making money 
and ones that are not.  They amend the formula for the 
unprofitable ones, instead of them being penalized.  There is 
nothing more for them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if a mechanic has the good fortune to find a 
job with a company that supplies tools, the company has a tax 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mechanic who must buy his own tools, who earns a small 
salary, who spent four years at a community college, who learned 
his trade and who incurred debts totalling $40,000 cannot get 
this break. He cannot get an annual deduction of $175 or $200 
even though he has to buy tools. This is not right because he is 
just an ordinary worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned earlier, lumberjacks got a deduction, and I am 
glad they did. For example, a lumberjack has to spend about $750 
or $850 on buying a chainsaw. He does not work all winter, but 
come spring, he has to buy one. At least, he will get a small tax 
deduction to buy his next chainsaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, when I introduced my Motion No. 248, I said that 
all tradespeople should get a deduction for the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, the same one who is here this 
evening, said at the time that it would be too hard to manage. I 
told him that it would not be difficult if the Liberals would 
follow up on what they had in mind in 1992. When they prepared 
their platform for the 1993 election, they said they would 
eliminate the GST. It would be easy to manage such a program, 
since that tax would simply be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they did not do that. So, under the bill proposed by our 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, these workers would at least 
get this small tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member said, whether a private member's bill is 
presented by a Bloc Quebecois, NDP, Canadian Alliance, Liberal or 
Progressive Conservative member, it is a personal thing. 
It is something that each member can have a view on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals across the way refuse to pass Bill C-222 to give 
mechanics a tax break, this will mean that they are telling all 
mechanics in Ontario who work in the automotive industry that 
they do not give a damn about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the November 27, 2000, election, the Liberals must have 
received some votes from mechanics in Ontario.  We know that 
there are members from Ontario on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do mechanics in Ontario know that the Bloc Quebecois member 
introduced a bill calling for a paltry $175 tax break for them? 
I am sure that some automotive industry workers have paid taxes 
as high as $20,000.  Others have perhaps paid more because of 
overtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, this bill will bring the members from Ontario now in 
the House to their senses.  I know they do not know which way to 
look right now.  I wonder if they are embarrassed.  Usually, 
they are right in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the speeches today will shake them up a bit and that 
they will support the bill, that they will stop complaining that 
they are backbenchers and that they do not get a chance to vote 
and must do as the Prime Minister tells them. 
That is a real shame. The members are on the government side. 
They could get things through, but they whine that they are not 
allowed to take decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, I want Canadians to know that each of these 
members can make up his own mind about this private members' 
bill. 
They cannot hide behind the excuse that the parliamentary 
secretary is against Bill C-222, that the Minister of Finance 
does not wish to make changes to tax credits for mechanics. 
They cannot hide.  Each decision will be an individual one. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make sure, and I will repeat this here, that the 
decision will be an individual decision when it comes to a vote 
on Bill C-222.  It is a bill and will become the law.

encourage the members of parliament, the majority who come from 
Ontario where they have all those car plants, to stand up, have a 
strong backbone and vote for the bill to show the Minister of 
Finance that we can have some democracy in the House of Commons. 
That could be done and we could see it with this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-222, which 
would actually address what is a significant inequity in our tax 
treatment, in this case, of mechanics in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 115,000 mechanics across the country, on average 
investing between $15,000 and $40,000 each in tools and 
equipment.  The average wage for these mechanics is not as high 
as what I have heard some Liberal members opposite claim it to 
be.  In fact, the average income is $29,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard one of those members opposite, and I believe it was the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, say that the 
average mechanic's wage is $60,000 or something to that effect. I 
do not know what kind of car he is driving, but I am driving a 10 
year old Volvo station wagon and I cannot not afford to pay 
mechanics who cost that kind of money.  Obviously the 
parliamentary secretary is investing an awful lot more in cars 
than some of the members here in the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the average income is $29,000 and the 
investment just to get through the door to become a mechanic and 
have those tools required averages between $15,000 and $40,000. 
It is little wonder that we are faced with a critical shortfall 
of mechanics across the country.  This is becoming a real issue. 
This is a real issue that is going to wreak havoc in the long 
term and affect every one of us in our own situations as we need 
the services of mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that this piece of legislation is fair.  It makes a 
great deal of sense.  It would extend the same treatment to 
mechanics that we see extended to professionals who, in many 
cases, have the ability under the tax code to write off 
professional expenses that are required for participation in 
their particular job or profession.  It is very sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the House of Commons finance committee in 1996 and 1997 
made this recommendation to the Minister of Finance in its 
prebudget consultation report.  It would go a long way toward 
improving the fairness of our tax treatment, in this case, of 
mechanics.  If we improve the tax treatment or the fairness of 
our tax system for any segment or group of people within society, 
we all stand to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal represents one idea, in this case from one member 
of parliament, on things we can do with our tax system to make it 
better, to make it fairer and to make it more effective in 
creating greater opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the opportunity to segue into a related 
topic, and that is a speech given by Jack Mintz, the president of 
the C.D. Howe Institute.  In the past he chaired a report to the 
Minister of Finance on tax reform in Canada.  Recently he gave a 
speech where he, not as a parliamentarian but as an individual 
with a great deal of depth on public policy issues in Canada, 
provided a four point plan on ways in which he sees Canada 
becoming a stronger, more prosperous country in the 21st century.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same way that the hon. member presented his piece of 
legislation, this private member's legislation, on a specific 
means by which to have a better, fairer tax system, I would like 
to present some other ideas, in this case from Jack Mintz, the 
president of the C.D. Howe Institute.  What he describes is his 
four point plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That four point plan sounds like going to a mechanic or someone 
servicing a car, again in a related segue.  The first point he 
makes is to reward success, not failure, to judge public programs 
based on what they accomplish.  Successful ones are funded and 
continue to be funded.  Failing programs are not funded. Clearly 
HRDC or some of the aid programs which have fallen under the 
purview of the minister of HRDC might find it difficult to 
achieve funding under this sort of scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public sector workers need to be paid and rewarded in monetary 
and in non-pecuniary ways according to their success in meeting 
objectives.  This would include civil servants, teachers, 
professors, medical workers and anyone who is paid from public 
money.  He suggests that we need competition in providing public 
services and that in fact there has to be a greater ability for 
market forces to pervade the delivery of public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also suggests as the second point in his plan that of 
tackling the public debt in Canada.  We have a huge debt in 
Canada that has built up over the years.  The total government 
debt in Canada is $850 billion.  Unfunded liabilities for public 
pensions and public health care, if we add those in, take us to 
about the $2 trillion mark for the total public debt in Canada. 
That does not include many of the other contingent liabilities. 
If the problem is left untouched, we will have to levy taxes 
equal to eight per cent of our GDP just to service these 
liabilities by 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mintz is suggesting that we take a very aggressive approach 
to our federal debt.  To reduce tax burden in the future, he 
suggests that we tackle our federal debt and use the returns from 
tackling the federal debt and those returns coming from the 
reduced interest payments that we see as an expense every year, 
paid by the taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to take a more aggressive approach to public debt 
now, as a result we would engage in what would become a virtuous 
circle of using that reduced level of expense from paying the 
reduced level of interest on the principal of our debt to 
actually fund tax reduction, which would of course benefit 
Canadians and create greater levels of economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would reduce the debt not just in real terms but also as a 
percentage of GDP, by reducing the debt of course in real terms 
but also by increasing the GDP through aggressive tax measures 
which would fuel greater levels of economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada our governments command well over 40% of the economy. 
That is higher than Australia, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland and 
others countries, which operate on a third or less of the 
national economies.  The U.S. is at about 30%.  Clearly we have 
to reduce the percentage of government participation overall as a 
per cent of our GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address Canada's dysfunctional tax system.  We have a 
tax system that needs significant reform.  The hon. member has 
presented in this case a specific initiative that would improve 
the fairness as it relates to mechanics.  I would suggest that we 
need to move much further and actually provide a comprehensive, 
holistic approach to tax reform and in fact start using tax 
policy and tax reform measures as vehicles to create greater 
levels of economic growth and opportunity for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mintz is now president of the C.D. Howe Institute.  In a 
previous incarnation, he was the author of the Mintz report, 
commissioned by the Minister of Finance but subsequently shelved 
by the Minister of Finance because it did not contain purely 
politically palatable recommendations.  As he had the courage to 
address some of the long term competitiveness issues facing 
Canadians, he has a great deal to offer in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From a tax perspective he goes further to suggest we need to 
significantly reduce areas of taxation in Canada that are most 
out of line with those of our competitors.  They include 
corporate and capital taxes which deny business the necessary 
capital to achieve greater levels of productivity and 
competitiveness in the hypercompetitive global economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House do now adjourn. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing the opportunity to 
debate in the House this evening the issue of foot and mouth 
disease.  I thank the Speaker and his office for being flexible 
in allowing emergency debates.  It certainly speaks well of the 
Chair and your ability to make sure that members of the House are 
allowed to debate and speak freely as members of parliament.  We 
thank you for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that has been put forward today before the House is 
one of extreme seriousness.  I would say at the outset of the 
discussion that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
for New Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members of the House who speak tonight accept 
the fact that this is non-partisan.  The debate is not meant to 
be a flailing of arms, the gnashing of teeth and finger pointing 
with respect to what has not been done, what has been done or 
what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather have the members who speak to this issue try to 
be somewhat constructive in their criticism, if there is some, 
and put forward some positive suggestions as to how the issue can 
be dealt with, not only in rural communities but in urban 
communities in Canada as well as internationally.  We well know 
that the issue is perhaps coming from international communities 
such as Britain and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Brandon—Souris is totally dependent on 
agriculture.  Yes, it is an urban centre but it is surrounded by 
a rural community that boasts livestock production in pigs as 
well as cattle.  It has dairy farms and a fairly large sheep 
operation.  All those animals of which I speak are susceptible to 
the foot and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada right now has about a $15 billion livestock economy.  The 
point of the matter is we do not have foot and mouth disease 
right now.  That in itself is a credit to the government, the 
CFIA, customs and to people who are currently coming back to this 
country.  That is not to say that we cannot and should not be 
ever vigilant as to what is happening and can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease, for the information of those people who 
may not have experience with it, is a very highly contagious and 
highly communicable viral disease that affects cloven hoofed 
animals.  I mentioned the domestic animals that it could affect 
but I also suggest that it could affect wild animals such as 
deer, elk and moose.  If it ever got into the wild animal chain, 
it would be almost impossible to control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have asked me constantly what is being done, 
what is can be done and what should be done to prevent this 
terrible disease from affecting our economy. 
The public wants to be aware of what precautions should be taken.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was suggested that this debate could have come forward 
earlier and I received an e-mail that culminated in the final 
decision of bringing this issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received an e-mail from a constituent of mine who is taking 
her practicum in Wales.  She said she could not find any 
information anywhere as to how and what she should do when she 
came back to Canada.  She said she did not know what she would 
find when arriving at customs.  She did not know what she could 
bring back so she asked for my help.  I sent her the information. 
However, a section of her e-mail scared me.  She had been told 
that she could not bring back any souvenirs.  She wanted to know 
if there was any way she could get around this so she could bring 
them back.  That comment chilled my blood.  She was talking about 
souvenirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told her she could bring back souvenirs but she could not 
bring back meat, dairy products like cheese or plants.  Just the 
thought of somebody asking if there was any way to get around 
this issue as I said chilled my blood.  All it takes is one virus 
to come into this country and we lose a complete industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1952 when Canada had its last foot and mouth outbreak in 
Saskatchewan, it cost $1 billion.  Translated today that amount 
equates to about $35 billion annually in our industry as a cost 
to try to control an outbreak.  We should prevent it at the onset 
and not try to prevent it and control it after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so important to have this debate because this 
is an awareness debate.  This has nothing to do with slagging the 
government.  Many media people called me today and asked if I was 
going to pick on the government for what it had not done?  I said 
“not a chance”.  The CFIA in my opinion is doing a fine job but 
it can do more.  Let me talk about what we can do more as a 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture industry is a part of the solution.  I talked 
with members of a grain company the other day.  They told me that 
all their facilities had been closed to any tours because they 
did not know where the people were coming from.  It is a good 
precaution that should be given to other members of the 
agricultural industry and corporations so they too can take it to 
the next step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was home this weekend I talked to an individual who sells 
farm real estate.  His company has sold a lot of real estate to 
people from Scotland, Ireland and Great Britain.  The company has 
now sent letters and made telephone calls to its customers 
telling them not to come here.  It wants these people to buy land 
but not at this time.  It will take a hit for six or twelve 
months but it does not want these people to come to Canada and 
possible infect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travel agents have a responsibility when sending people 
overseas.  They have to tell people what to do when they come 
back.  If it is farm to farm and highly risky, the suggestion 
should be that they should hold back on their travel.  If it is 
urban to urban centre travel it is low risk but certain things 
should be done when they come back.  As a protective measure they 
should wash their clothes in a vinegar solution and walk through 
the disinfectant mat at the airport instead of walking over it. 
That is what the travel agent should be telling people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA has done a lot and I know it will to do more.  I 
appreciate the minister of agriculture and the minister of 
defence being here today to speak to the preventative measures 
that they have put forward in their departments.  That is very 
positive and very wise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA should and could do an ad campaign which it may well 
have planned.  It should also put out travel advisories and 
warnings in multilanguages, not just simply English and French, 
because a lot of our visitors come from contaminated countries 
and do not speak either of those languages.  It is important that 
they know what we demand of them when they come to our country in 
order to be free of this terrible foot and mouth virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travellers must recognize that they have a responsibility.  They 
can be a part of the solution, not part of the problem.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they be part of the solution?  As I said earlier, they 
should not bring in products such as foodstuffs and dairy.  Also, 
if one travels to a contaminated country, one definitely does not 
want to bring back organic materials, dirt, saliva or milk 
stains.  This is very serious stuff.  If an individual is going 
from farm to farm, that Canadian should take 14 days of 
self-quarantine before going back to one's farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an interesting call from a farmer in my area a couple of 
weeks ago.  His wife was planning to go to Britain to visit 
relatives.  He said that was fine but when she came back she 
could not return to the farm for at least 14 days.  He was 
encouraging her to visit her relatives but the message was we 
must be terribly vigilant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to keep it out of the country.  We want to keep it out 
of our communities.  We expect the rural and urban residents to 
make sure they have the same vigilance when dealing with this 
terrible potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing is that this is not meant to be fearmongering.  I 
have suggested a number of solutions and other things that can be 
done.  The sky is not falling.  This is not fearmongering at any 
level.  It simply is to educate and make people aware of what the 
serious issues are out there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to thank you for allowing this debate to 
happen.  It was a wise judgment and a very timely one.  I want to 
thank the member for Brandon—Souris for bringing the issue 
forward, as he has on many occasions in times of agricultural 
crisis.  I believe we are looking at a potential crisis in regard 
to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am throwing away thanks as liberally as I am, and I use 
that word quite freely, I want to thank the agriculture minister, 
the member of the cabinet who is here tonight to listen and take 
part in the debate.  It speaks well of him and his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has taken a leading role in this.  We have a lot of our 
scientific minds in Europe, members of the department, who are 
attempting to deal with this and help other nations deal with it. 
It is very commendable on the part of the government.  As 
Canadians we should all do our part in helping stave off this 
very contagious disease from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back a few years to 1988, and I know the minister 
will appreciate this.  In 1988 when I first came to the House 
there was a minister here by the name of John Crosbie.  Members 
and a lot of Canadians will probably remember him, some with 
fondness and some not so fondly.  I remember my first time in 
caucus as a new member of parliament.  Being new to this place, I 
was anxious to do a good job.  I thought that being on the side 
of government was such a comfortable place to be, and all the 
satisfaction that came from being on the side that made the 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Mr. Crosbie getting up in caucus and issuing a 
warning to the greenhorns and some of the older members as well. 
He said there was a missile headed at the Atlantic fishery.  He 
went on in the fashion that only Mr. Crosbie could and 
articulated what was happening.  He said we were living in a 
fantasy land believing that everything would continue as normal 
in the fishing industry.  He knew what was happening, and we 
experienced a collapse in the cod stocks.  Being on the 
government's side was not a lot of fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember what happened.  Thousands of people were 
put out of work.  There was a disruption in the workforce, not 
only in Newfoundland but in all of the Atlantic provinces.  It 
was a crisis.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We debated the issue on the floor of the House of Commons about 
a year after Mr. Crosbie made his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we arrive at that?  One of the mistakes that we made, 
and previous governments as well, because I do not think we can 
blame one government or one political party, was to ignore the 
reality of what was happening to our stocks.  We did not 
interpret scientific knowledge nor understand the situation as 
well as we could have.  We did not rely on our gut instincts or 
make the tough political decisions when they had to be made and 
Atlantic Canada paid a big price for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Brandon—Souris said, this is the time to talk 
about it so that we can avoid a crisis.  I know no more about 
foot and mouth disease than most members of the House.  It is 
something we have heard about but we have never experienced.   As 
we all know, the last outbreak in Canada occurred in 1952.  You 
were merely a baby, Mr. Speaker.  I am not even sure if the 
minister was born at that time, but certainly the member for 
Brandon—Souris was in diapers.  It was devastating to the 
economy.  It cost the economy $1 billion.  If that were measured 
in today's dollars it would approach $30 to $50 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the dairy and beef industry alone are worth $15 billion, 
without talking about the other industries that tie into them, 
such as the transportation, delivery and selling of goods.  The 
cost to the economy would truly be immeasurable.  That is why, in 
a non-partisan sense, and this is one of the few times that 
either one of us will be on our feet in a non-partisan sense, we 
have to educate the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us can do a few basic things.  If we have visitors from 
foreign countries we must let them know what they should do. For 
example, if we owned a farm we would want to make sure that we 
had our own disinfectant on the farm, in addition to what people 
might have been exposed to in the way of disinfectant at the 
airports.  Awareness, obviously, is the critical thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that this disease can be passed on by people.  If 
people even suspect that they have been exposed to it, they must 
take precautions, including precautions with food that has been 
imported which could be contaminated.  In 1952 they traced the 
start of this disease in Canada to one small piece of sausage 
that was randomly discarded, eaten by an animal and then passed 
on to the beef herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If animals are exposed to contaminated materials, such as hay, 
feed, water, semen or biological organisms, it could help spread 
the disease.  Once it does start, and this is not fearmongering 
because they are experiencing this in Britain today, it can be 
airborne and travel up to at least 100 kilometres.  It spreads 
very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today, a total of 946 cases of foot and mouth disease have 
been reported across the United Kingdom.  In order to eradicate 
this disease, they have had to dispose of a lot of innocent 
animals as a precautionary measure because there are no 
safeguards, other than slaughter, which is a horrible prospect in 
the minds of anyone who deals in cattle and the raising of any 
kind of livestock. 
The total number of animals slaughtered or identified as being up 
for slaughter is around one million in the United Kingdom alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports show that just under 630,000 have been slaughtered. 
There are almost 400,000 animals awaiting slaughter.  The numbers 
are just mind boggling.  Watching the news on television, we see 
huge excavators or backhoes digging trenches to throw cattle in 
that have them slaughtered.  It is beyond our wildest dreams.  It 
is a nightmare come true for many of those farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers are going through what can only be explained as a 
nervous breakdown.  It is awful for them to imagine that their 
life, their care of cattle and their love of his animals are all 
for naught because once this starts it is pretty well the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon all Canadians to take the very fundamental 
precautions whether travelling abroad or for visitors coming into 
the country.  We should do all we can to help the farm community 
cope with this situation by helping the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government up to now has taken all the right steps.  We want 
to make sure that it continues to take the right steps.  That is 
what the debate is all about.  We look forward to words of 
encouragement from the minister.  The House can be assured that 
we on this side, in this party, will do all we can to help the 
minister, the department and Canadians deal with this horrific 
disease. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
Minister of National Defence.  I wish to say how pleased I am to 
be able to respond to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris.  I thank him for his comments and I thank 
his colleagues for their comments on this very important 
information session we are having this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that if every member of the House does not 
deal with constituents who have livestock themselves, they 
certainly know people in their constituency who do.  This is an 
incredibly important issue that concerns all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be in the House tonight to outline to Canadians 
some of the precautionary measures that are being taken to ensure 
that we keep the dreaded foot and mouth disease out of Canada. We 
have to do all we can to keep that level of risk as low as we 
possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previous speakers have said, we have a great deal at risk.  I 
will not repeat the size of the industry involved in the clove 
and hoof animals sector of Canada, but it is a huge industry 
which affects not only producers but all upstream and downstream 
parts of our economy that would be and are involved in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very words Canadian food conjure up to Canadian consumers 
and consumers around the world an image of the highest standards 
of food safety, animal health and plant protection.  We cannot 
take that reputation for granted.  It is a reputation that we 
must nurture.  We have to protect it and we have to build upon 
it.  We have seen how the reputation for safety can disappear in 
a flash by what has happened with the foot and mouth disease in 
the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent but still important, 
in some other countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not had foot and mouth disease in Canada since 1952.  It 
was very serious but it was somewhat contained to southern 
Saskatchewan at the time.  It took a lot out of the economy.  It 
certainly injured a lot of people financially and mentally, so we 
do not want to see that happen again.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It broke out in early February in the United Kingdom and then it 
moved on to other parts of Europe.  It is in Argentina, Saudi 
Arabia and some other countries in the world.  However I must 
point out that there has never been a time when there has not 
been foot and mouth disease in some country in the world.  Our 
protection system in Canada has maintained our protection from 
the disease since 1952. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major catastrophe when it strikes, not only for 
individual farmers but for the whole economy.  The estimate so 
far of the cost in the United Kingdom is $20 billion and the 
costs are not over yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease does not significantly affect human 
health.  I can be spread by meat or animal products infected with 
the virus, raw or improperly cooked food products containing 
infected meat or animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do all that we can to protect our borders.  I will 
outline a few things but not all the things that are being done 
by the Canada Customs and Revenue people as well as the Canadian 
food inspection staff.  We have put many emergency measures in 
place and we will continue to add to those as we build on this. 
It is not something where absolutely everything can be done at 
the first hour, but we are building on that every day.  It is a 
partnership and co-operative approach among governments, 
travellers, producers, farmers and visitors to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stopped the import of products into Canada that are 
susceptible to foot and mouth disease such as live animals, 
embryos, semen, meat, unpasteurized cheese and equipment that 
would have any soil on it.  Extra inspection efforts are taking 
place at airports and seaports.  We have increased inspection 
activities in the international mail sorting plants and courier 
ports of entry sites.  There is increased surveillance of 
passengers and baggage arriving on international flights. 
Officers are questioning travellers.  There is signage informing 
travellers and instructing them to cross over disinfection mats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travellers originating outside the United States are referred to 
customs secondary inspection.  However I point out that 
travellers have a responsibility as well.  As has been pointed 
out, they seek information.  Information is being provided to the 
best of our ability to all those people as they come to Canada. 
The foot mats are there.  We are using maximum use of the CFIA 
detector dogs that can detect plant and food material.  We have 
increased investigations for the handling and disposal of 
international garbage at airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of National Defence will speak to the 
efforts that DND is taking.  This week a shipload of U.K. 
military equipment was sent back because it was not as clean as 
it needed to be for entry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media has been given opportunities to observe the 
disinfection procedures and I thank them for helping with the 
information dissemination.  Articles on this disease have been 
published in the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association journal. 
It is on the CFIA website.  There is a new brochure called “What 
can I bring into Canada?”  The CFIA has issued a notice to 
visitors and livestock owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TV commercials are being prepared.  They will go on air just as 
soon as they are completed.  Videos will be completed in the next 
day or two in English, French, Spanish and German for use on 
airplanes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a contingency plan.  People have asked me what the 
contingency plan would be.  We are a member of the North American 
foot and mouth disease vaccine bank if we have to use it. We know 
there is a debate in the U.K. now on whether it wants to use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA has sent letters to the industry across the country. 
We sent one team of veterinarians to the United Kingdom.  Once 
its members return and go through quarantine they will be 
travelling across the country talking to veterinarians, to the 
livestock industry and to the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a partnership with the Office of Critical Infrastructure 
Protection and Emergency Preparedness, which we know as Emergency 
Preparedness Canada, to use its command centres, authority and 
resources.  The Department of National Defence, the RCMP, and 
provincial and municipal police forces are included in that 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also building on the relationship with veterinarians 
across the country.  I could go on.  Early detection is essential 
and the field staff is involved in that.  There are partnership 
and co-operation by everyone across the country, including 
travellers and the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to outline some of the steps being 
taken.  I will close by saying how much I, the livestock industry 
and Canadians appreciate the fantastic work that has been done. 
It is a well worn phrase, but the people at the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency have 
been burning the midnight oil to get these procedures in place as 
quickly as possible and thereby keep the risk as low as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the object of this evening's debate is an issue that 
concerns me directly as member of the House and as Minister of 
National Defence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has already outlined 
the measures put in place by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
for all persons entering Canada.  The Department of National 
Defence shares the responsibility of preventing the introduction 
of foot and mouth disease.  That includes minimizing the risk of 
the disease being introduced through foreign military training 
which takes place in a number of locales across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, foreign military training is an important 
activity for the Canadian forces and for Canada.  Our allies 
recognize the value of training here.  Canada's vast military 
training areas and uncrowded airspace are ideally suited to that 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offering training and exercise opportunities is an important 
contribution we make as an active member of the NATO alliance. It 
also contributes to the overall readiness of our allied forces. 
Canada also benefits from the presence of foreign troops because 
training jointly with allied forces, as we do in some cases, 
directly enhances the interoperability of the Canadian forces. 
That is vital to the effectiveness of our forces when we deploy 
them with our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities across Canada benefit from the economic activity 
generated by the more than 13,000 foreign military personnel who 
train in Canada each year.  For example, in Suffield, Alberta, 
some $30 million a year go into the economy from the British 
training facilities.  The British have invested some $200 million 
in Suffield and have a lease on facilities they use year in and 
year out.  There is NATO flying training in Moose Jaw, 
Saskatchewan, and Cold Lake, Alberta.  There is low level flying 
in Goose Bay.  As the hon. member for Brandon—Souris well knows, 
the Germans used to train at the base in Shilo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present circumstances I understand and share the 
concerns of many Canadians about the possibility of bringing foot 
and mouth disease to this country.  That is why the Canadian 
forces are working closely with the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency and our allies to ensure, as best we can, that European 
military personnel do not bring foot and mouth disease into any 
part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of precautionary measures are already being taken.  All 
military personnel from the European Union and NATO countries are 
required to provide signed declarations that they have visited 
neither a farm nor a training area used for livestock nor a 
quarantine area in the NATO EU region in the 14 day period 
preceding their arrival in Canada. 
Because of the particular situation in the United Kingdom, the 
period has been extended to 28 days for British military 
personnel.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, preventive decontamination has been conducted 
before arrival in Canada by our allies, particularly the United 
Kingdom.  This means that all clothing is laundered before 
departure, that all personal items are clean and free from soil 
and that all footwear has been packed in separate and sealed 
bags.  Upon arrival here, foreign military personnel walk over a 
disinfectant mat and all footwear in bags is disinfected. That is 
a very thorough process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also receptive to the concerns of the communities located 
close to training zones. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly some areas in Canada, due to the volume and type of 
foreign military activity within them and the proximity to large 
numbers of livestock, are more sensitive to the risk of this 
disease being transmitted.  We appreciate these concerns and are 
alert to our responsibility to ensure everything possible is done 
to prevent an outbreak of this disease in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate that we are taking the issue very seriously. 
Vigilance and pro-activity are the order of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces have also taken precautions for CF personnel 
arriving or transiting from the United Kingdom by air to our 
military air bases.  Upon disembarking from CF aircraft, 
passengers must clean and thoroughly disinfect footwear.  The 
forces are also delaying the re-entry into Canada of any military 
vehicles that have been operating in the United Kingdom or any 
other areas where the disease is breaking out.  This measure will 
be in effect until the outbreak of the disease has been 
stabilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, in concert with our colleagues from the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, with whom we co-operate extensively, we are 
taking every appropriate step to manage the risk and to prevent 
an outbreak of the disease in Canada.  As we would expect, our 
European allies are being very co-operative.  They fully 
understand our concerns on the matter and we are working in full 
collaboration with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we believe the measures taken by 
the government, including the Department of National Defence, as 
well as those taken by our allies, are sufficient to prevent the 
risk of this outbreak in Canada.  I assure Canadians that we will 
continue to monitor the situation very closely and take further 
measures that may come to be warranted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here tonight to 
debate the foot and mouth outbreak in Great Britain.  As has been 
previously mentioned, the disease first occurred on February 20 
and within about 40 days it has spread to Ireland and some other 
countries in that vicinity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance fully supports the minister and the 
government on the issue.  We need to concentrate on preventing 
and keeping the virus out of Canada.  We also fully support the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration.  However, due to the seriousness of the issue, 
the efforts of these agencies must be maximized.  I am sure there 
will be some suggestions about that tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called this an emergency debate but those are just the 
rules of the House.  We are not in an emergency at this time, and 
we do not want the general public to assume something has 
happened when it has not.  We do not have foot and mouth disease 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cattlemen's Association has released information to 
the effect that the risk is minimal if proper precautions are 
observed. It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cattlemen's Association (CAA) reminded cattle 
producers that the risk of introducing Foot-and-Mouth Disease 
into Canada is minimal so long as the proper precautions are 
observed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I have been coming from on behalf of the Canadian 
Alliance over the past week or two.  I have been trying to ensure 
that the standing committee on agriculture, the minister and the 
various departments are maximizing their efforts in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of warning bells went off.  One was the auditor 
general's indication that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's 
veterinary service is understaffed and that there is inadequate 
preparation to bring in the next generation of animal inspectors. 
That is an indicator that we must ensure maximum efforts are put 
toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment of Dr. McLeod, who went to Britain, was that since 
Canada was not heavily populated with vets and training personnel 
that we needed to review contingency plans to make sure we have 
trained people and resources if they are needed.  We should do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to see happen here tonight and what I tried to 
make happen in the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food was for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's plan to 
be reviewed and analyzed in that committee by members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that I am a cattle producer.  Elected 
members like myself and the ranchers, cattlemen and hog producers 
we represent, have a lot to offer the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disease, as has been pointed out, can be carried in dirt, in 
infected food products, on clothing, on footwear and even on the 
wind.  I know that the Saskatchewan outbreak in 1952 was caused 
by a contaminated piece of sausage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another unusual statistic I have heard during the course of this 
debate is that the virus can live inside the human respiratory 
tract for up to three days.  As a precautionary measure, anyone 
who comes into contact with a diseased animal should wait at 
least three days before going near other ruminate animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of not preventing the disease in Canada is virtually 
immeasurable.  The estimated direct cost of an outbreak for the 
cattle industry and the export industry of beef, hogs and sheep 
is $20 billion to $30 billion.  In Britain the damage to the 
tourism industry is believed to be about eight times the damage 
that has been done to the livestock industry.  That damage will 
go on for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should the government do?  The minister of defence and 
minister of agriculture have spoken here.  However, I have 
pointed out that the efforts of the government must be maximized 
to keep foot and mouth disease out of Canada.  It then must 
prepare to implement an emergency containment and elimination 
plan should an outbreak occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit nervous about what the auditor general said and about 
the fact that we have not been able to examine the plan.  The 
plan may not be as foolproof as it could and should be.  It must 
be examined in the immediate future because until the threat in 
England recedes or actually stops, we face the possibility of an 
outbreak in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should do a better job of getting information out 
to travellers. 
I know this is improving as time goes along but here again it has 
to be maximized immediately.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national advertising campaign that I have been advocating to 
ensure that all Canadians are adequately informed about the risks 
of the disease and how to prevent its spread, is now being put 
into place.  I understand that material is actually being handed 
out to travellers at the airports and that frontline inspectors 
are questioning travellers, visitors and Canadians returning from 
Europe more closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has not been doing a full 
job to this point to adequately communicate the measures 
necessary to contain an outbreak.  The CFIA has prepared a 
detailed manual on how to contain an outbreak but, to my 
knowledge, being a producer and also a member of parliament, it 
has not shared the information with farmers, local communities 
and local veterinarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be well and good for the director of the CFIA to know how 
everything is supposed to work, but if I were a farmer near the 
scene of an outbreak and I all of a sudden saw government 
inspectors in blue Suburbans coming in to take action, I would 
wonder why I was not told about the outbreak nor told what to do 
should one occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through the issue with the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, which is probably the best place to 
have it examined, farmers will become more aware of what is going 
on and what their role is and the role of other participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the minister just recently received the 
manual.  While it has not been shared with members of parliament, 
I was a little concerned about the fact that the media seems to 
have had access to the whole document or a portion of it. Through 
this all-inclusive, non-partisan effort that we are trying to 
make as members of parliament, I would think that the Canadian 
Alliance and all opposition parties should know what is going on 
and be provided with all the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Canadian Food Inspection Agency should be holding 
numerous regional meetings to explain to farmers and to 
communities the possible effects the disease could have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want make in the time remaining is about the 
funding level for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  In order 
to carry out preventative measures and to carry out the 
implementation plan, it must have the resources.  Even if it were 
multi-millions of dollars, that would be nothing when we consider 
the tragedy of our country losing multi-billions of dollars if an 
actual outbreak were to occur. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue from where 
my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake left off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians purchase fire insurance for their 
homes hoping they never need it.  They cover themselves 
adequately and within reason.  We are saying that we need to use 
the same approach on this issue.  We have a $20 billion industry, 
possibly even more, that deserves protection.  A few billion 
dollars, maybe $100 million, spent to protect the industry is not 
too great a price to pay to ensure that it is adequately 
protected.  We are talking about our dairy industry, our beef and 
cattle industry and hog industry.  These are the industries that 
are directly concerned with the outbreak of foot and mouth 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a lot of phone calls in my riding on this issue. 
People are concerned about the security at our airports.  People 
are concerned about other farmers coming across to Canada and 
establishing themselves in our farming sector.  These people want 
to be sure that the government is doing all that is possible to 
protect them in this area.  That is what we refer to as a little 
bit of insurance to protect the industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also assure consumers that they do not need to be 
concerned about the quality of their food supply.  We believe 
that there is adequate protection in place so that our consumers 
of these products in Canada do not have to be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my remarks by talking about how farmers and 
ranchers feel about this issue and what message they have for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote directly from a news release put out by 
the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cattlemen's Association (CAA) today reminded cattle 
producers that the risk of introducing Foot-and-Mouth Disease 
into Canada is minimal so long as the proper precautions are 
observed. These precautions include keeping away from farms and 
ranches anyone who has been in a country with Foot-and-Mouth 
Disease within the past 14 days, and if they must come to the 
farm or ranch, ensuring that their shoes, clothing and equipment 
are disinfected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Many countries in the world have Foot-and-Mouth Disease and we 
have successfully kept it out of Canada for almost 50 years,” 
says Carl Block, Chair of the CAA animal Health Committee. 
“With the heightened awareness of this disease and the increased 
surveillance taking place at points of entry into Canada, we may 
well be less at risk now than in the past when it was next to 
impossible to get travellers to take this disease seriously”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Block points out it is neither practical nor possible to ban the 
movement of people to and from countries where Foot-and-Mouth 
Disease exists. “Let's not forget, we're not just talking about 
Europe.  Foot-and-Mouth Disease exists in many countries around 
the world including India, China, and parts of South America, 
Africa and Asia.  We cannot shut ourselves off from the rest of 
the world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Block points out that the most important precaution is for 
individuals to take the threat of this disease seriously and not 
attempt to smuggle meat or other agricultural products into 
Canada.  Those caught illegally bringing agricultural products 
into the country can be fined up to $400 on the spot, with 
further prosecution possible for more serious offences.  The 
cattle industry is supportive of fining all individuals who break 
this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CAA commends the extra precautions now being taken by the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Customs and Revenue 
Canada Agency to ensure that this disease is not introduced into 
Canada.  CCA has long advocated stricter surveillance at border 
points.  CCA is urging that these precautions be maintained after 
the current outbreak in Europe is brought under control. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I quoted that news release is that these people have 
put into words what we are trying to express.  We need some 
common sense on this.  We need to be vigilant.  Foot and mouth 
disease has been around the world forever.  We need to be 
continually vigilant against this disease.  We urge the 
government to ensure that all the resources and precautions are 
being taken and that there is a plan in place to deal with this 
if by some remote chance it would be introduced into this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that one of the reasons a debate like this 
is important is that it gives us the opportunity to raise public 
awareness on this issue and to inform them in a rational and 
sensible way on what is happening.  We need to let tourists know 
that they are one of the greatest risks to our beef, pork and 
dairy industry.  It could take carelessness on their part to 
introduce into Canada a problem that may risk the entire 
livelihood of some people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put this into context.  We have a farming sector now 
that is experiencing one of the worst possible crises that it has 
had in a long time.  If this disease were to be introduced into 
this country, it would devastate a part of farming that right now 
is profitable.  We need to ensure that this does not happen and a 
debate like this raises public awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can travellers do if they are one of the more serious risks 
that we have in this country? 
Travellers who are entering Canada should ensure that all the 
meat, dairy and animal products that they are bringing into 
Canada are declared at the border so that customs officials can 
be aware of that.  If travellers are visiting a farm abroad they 
should make sure that the clothing and footwear they wore during 
their visit are free from soil or manure.  They should also clean 
and disinfect their footwear and dry clean all their clothing. 
That is the least they can do to protect our cattle industry. 
The footwear would not just be what they are wearing when they 
cross into Canada, but anything they may be carrying in their 
luggage. They should stay away from Canadian farms for at least 
14 days after returning to Canada, as recommended by the World 
Organization for Animal Health.  We ask them to please protect 
our farmers by doing that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If one farms in Canada one should prevent farm or ranch visits 
by anyone who has been to countries with active foot and mouth 
disease in the last 14 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although humans are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease, 
they do serve as carriers and Canadians travelling abroad need to 
know that and farmers here need to protect themselves by not 
allowing someone from another country like that to come on to 
their property immediately upon their return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If visitors must visit a farm, they should take additional 
sanitary precautions, such as washing and disinfecting all 
personal effects and equipment that accompany them.  It is 
particularly important to clean and disinfect footwear, as I have 
already mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Livestock owners should increase precautionary measures to 
protect their own herds.  For example, farmers must exercise 
caution before allowing visitors on their farms and all visitors 
must be made aware of the risks of transmitting the disease and 
follow additional precautions.  Visitors must take additional 
sanitary precautions, such as washing and disinfecting all 
personal effects and equipment that have accompanied them.  It is 
particularly important to clean and disinfect footwear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All visitors, including vets and livestock buyers, should use 
footwear provided by the farm instead of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to outline what we, as the Canadian 
Alliance, have done to bring about some kind of precaution, some 
kind of safety and to ensure that the government is handling this 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We of course were the first ones to raise this foot and mouth 
issue in the House of Commons.  We have had at least eight 
questions and statements already in the House of Commons.  We 
have made repeated presentations to the minister involved, 
through letters and so on, to ensure that adequate measures are 
being put in place and universally enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 29 we issued a plan of action calling upon the 
government to improve its security measures at the ports of entry 
as well as improve its information campaign.  I hope the debate 
tonight will assist in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has pushed the CFIA to release its plan to 
the public and to members of parliament.  Because of our efforts, 
the CFIA and the Department of National Defence will be appearing 
before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has also initiated its own communications 
campaign that includes direct mailings to constituents as well as 
detailed information posted on our agricultural website. I would 
like to make the public aware that at 
www.canadianalliance.ca/agriculture, Canadians can find out more 
about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to continue to push the information out on 
this issue and to ensure that our farmers are properly protected.

Speaker, it gives me pleasure to take part in this debate. I 
will share my time with the hon. member for Champlain, who is 
our deputy critic for agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is extremely important to have this debate this 
evening to make the public aware of the seriousness of foot and 
mouth disease, but also to ask it not to push the panic button. 
While it is important to discuss this issue, the expression 
emergency debate is somewhat out of proportion with what is 
going on in Canada right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must begin by congratulating the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency.  We have met with representatives in the standing 
committee on agriculture and will be meeting them again later 
this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities' decision to send back to England the ship 
containing the British army's equipment is reassuring.  There is 
cause for some considerable concern that Great Britain has not 
taken all the measures we wanted to see taken when it sent its 
army over here.  We had clearly asked for everything to be 
cleaned but it neglected to do its cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone made the comment to me today that we could have let them 
do it here, that it was not worth turning the ship back.  But if 
they had done so, there was a risk of our facilities getting 
contaminated in the process.  It was therefore justified for us 
to turn the ship back, to do its cleanup back in the UK. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I 
would even go so far as to say that this might raise questions 
about the British army's lack of social conscience and about 
whether it might not be better to cancel the entire exercise 
altogether since it will be held in the very heart of cattle 
country, in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been reassured by the explanations given by the 
people from the agency about how Canada, Mexico and the United 
States have tested their emergency plan.  All this has been 
reassuring. 
And when we look as well at the American plan, we realize that 
our experts are in contact with each other and that every means 
must be taken to prevent the disease from reaching here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done to eradicate this disease should a case present 
itself?  I hope that will never happen, but if there were to be a 
case, a series of measures would occur, up to and including 
isolating the farm or establishing a safety perimeter or 
slaughtering herds, if necessary.  As members can see, there is a 
plan on paper that provides for a series of measures in the event 
of an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to know that, at the moment, a drama is 
unfolding in Europe, which requires extreme sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the experience of a terrible drama in my own riding 
with another type of disease known as scrapie.  Livestock at home 
was particularly affected by this disease.  I was present at 
meetings with families, parents and their children who were 
supposed to follow in their footsteps, who had to decide to allow 
the agency to come and slaughter an entire herd of sheep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no idea of the human dramas occurring at the moment. 
Having seen it up close, I know that when they have to kill an 
entire herd people have no more income and no more animals.  If 
they do get compensation to replace the animals, they do not 
necessarily get an income for the time it takes to build up their 
livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to information I obtained, people in Europe are 
experiencing real human tragedies. Some are even committing 
suicide because they just do not know what they are going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must think about that aspect of the problem. So far we have 
heard about prophylactic measures to protect health or to 
eradicate the outbreak but we have not heard much about the 
human dimension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should immediately set up a plan to help these people, to 
support them should we have to reach the same conclusion as with 
scrapie in sheep.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that the government has also taken a 
very interesting measure. The last outbreak in Canada was in 
1952. Now they have a new word, or at least a word that I did 
not know before, namely the term “epizooty”, which is more 
accurate. Chances are that those who were veterinarians in 1952 
have all retired since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an excellent idea on the part of the Canadian government 
to send young veterinarians to help their colleagues in Great 
Britain, thus allowing them to gain some experience and see 
firsthand the effects of that disease. This means they will be 
more familiar with it, better able to diagnose and identify it, 
and take the necessary measures to act more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people study the theory but never see these diseases 
firsthand, they do their best, but if they have the 
opportunity—what an unfortunate term, in this case—to be in a 
situation like the one experienced by our veterinarians in Great 
Britain, they gain some valuable experience. We hope they never 
have to use it here, but if they do they will have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does this disease come from?  It would be quite hard to 
say where it comes from.  Apparently, according to the data we 
have, it came from Japan, passing through Mongolia and Russia 
before ending up in Great Britain.  The British government took 
measures but they were not enough.  The disease passed into France, 
Holland and other countries, probably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has measures planned.  I think what 
counts is that everyone living in Canada realizes that it is a 
matter of individual responsibility to keep this disease out, by 
being reasonable, prudent, following the guidelines given, for 
instance, not bringing food back from Europe, and properly 
disinfecting things when they come back.  Each person must feel a 
part of the operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some farmers who have taken very interesting measures. 
For example, they have refused to let interns come to their farms 
this summer because they do not want to take risks.  They have 
changed their practices.  Now they meet suppliers in their 
kitchens, rather than let them come to the barn.  There are all 
sorts of very practical and very simple measures that can be 
taken in order to take a part in preventing this disease.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for sharing her time with me so that I might add my 
voice to the interesting and highly worthwhile debate we are 
having this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the hon. member who initiated this 
debate.  It is, as others have said, not an emergency debate in 
the sense that there is some panic situation. We must not panic 
but I do think we need to realize what danger we are in.  We must 
be level headed enough to be able to take the necessary 
precautions to avoid being affected in this epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1952 epidemic has already been referred to.  The disease was 
brought in by a contaminated sausage, probably brought home by a 
traveller.  It must be kept in mind that the 1952 epidemic cost 
the Canadian government $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not an economist, I do know enough to realize 
that $1 billion in 1952 would be the 
equivalent of several billions now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this would be the equivalent of between $16 
billion and $20 billion today.  Besides that, herds are different 
now than they were in 1952.  Now we have megafarms. It is not 
unusual for one swine operation to have 10,000 or more animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being an alarmist, one can easily imagine what the effects 
of an epidemic here would be.  I am thinking of Quebec in 
particular, where there are real megafarms.  Such an epidemic 
would cost a fortune and I do not dare do the calculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening's debate will make it possible to increase our 
awareness and that of the public.  I am thinking particularly of 
the travelling public. 
We are at the beginning of the tourist season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, on returning from Paris, where I had been visiting 
the forests near the Château de Versailles, I arrived in Mirabel 
with bits of sand and earth adhering to my boots.  I must be 
honest and say that I found the inspectors a bit overzealous when 
they asked me to go in the back and disinfect my boots. Today, I 
realize that these inspectors did their job well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all tourists, those coming into the country after 
visiting not necessarily just farms but anywhere in the 
countryside, should take all imaginable precautions not to 
transmit this virus, which is so easily transmissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that this is a disease of animals with cloven 
hooves, such as animals with horns. We are told that dogs and 
cats cannot catch this disease but can be carriers.  It can be 
carried in hair. It is therefore extremely easily transmitted 
and that is why the epidemic is so serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy to hear the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food say 
that he was taking all the necessary precautions, as we speak, 
to warn passengers in planes, for instance.  He mentioned videos 
and all sorts of measures that have been taken.  I hope 
these will be implemented as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone mentioned that a traveller had visited a farm last week 
without having taken the necessary precautions.  No chances must 
be taken with this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a good insurance policy—and it is a cheap one 
given the risks involved—is to take the measures the minister 
mentioned earlier.  As my colleague also pointed out earlier, 
the decision to send back the armed forces ship was the right 
decision, but it is probably also necessary to increase the 
number of inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember asking the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food this question.  It is true that the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency is doing a good job but the auditor general 
told us it was short-staffed.  It is perhaps time to increase the 
number of employees with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 
order to put all the chances on our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that an epidemic such as this one will not make it here, 
I am sure, but we must do everything we can to see that it does 
not. 
If there were such an outbreak, it would be serious for farm 
producers but also for consumers. Everyone must feel involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers told me that the price of food had begun to go up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather not think about what would happen if the disease 
made its way here. We cannot keep destroying whole herds of 
cattle, sheep or pigs without eventually creating a shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every precaution must be taken to prevent the epizooty from 
reaching America. The public must co-operate. So must tourists. 
Perhaps people should refrain from visiting farms or travelling 
to areas in Europe where the disease exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to look 
closely at the possibility of improving security measures, for 
example by increasing the number of inspectors at the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency. This is something many people, including 
us, have asked. It is important to ensure that these inspectors 
receive the best possible training and that the public is as 
informed as possible, so that everyone feels it is his or her 
duty to see that our territory remains free of this disease. 
This is for the benefit of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I thank the hon. member for raising the issue. I 
think that, for once, we are unanimous in this House. We are not 
blaming anyone. We are all saying that we must do something, 
that everyone must do what is necessary so that the disease 
does not reach us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate tonight.  I will be sharing my 
time with my colleague, the member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
From the number of my colleagues in the NDP caucus here tonight 
we can see how seriously we feel about the issue.  Some of them 
will be taking part in the debate later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good that we are having this debate because I believe many 
Canadians genuinely feel the issue is of more concern to them 
than it appears to be to us as politicians, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that is the case but from the faxes, phone 
calls, letters and e-mails some of us have been receiving 
Canadians are extremely concerned about the possibility of a foot 
and mouth outbreak in North America, and specifically in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know from the farming community that potentially billions 
of dollars are at stake.  Some of them from Saskatchewan and 
Alberta who are familiar with what we call feedlot alley in the 
Lethbridge area know of the hundreds of thousands of cattle that 
are there and of the damage that would ravage that sector if 
indeed this virus were to spread to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from whom I have heard would like more detail from the 
government.  I listened carefully to the two ministers who spoke 
this evening and welcomed the commitments they made and 
contributed to the debate.  Canadians would like reassurances. 
They would like to know when travellers are returning from 
international trips that without exception they are using the 
disinfectants supposedly at airports.  I will have a little more 
to say about that in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall they would like to know what are the rules of the game. 
What is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency doing in this regard? 
What is requested by customs and immigration of their employees? 
Canadians are saying that they will let us know from a firsthand 
basis if those instructions are being followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I received a call from a constituent in the Moose Jaw 
area who hauls a lot of cattle throughout western Canada and into 
the States.  He reported a conversation he recently had with an 
American border guard.  She asked him how he thought the 
vigilance against the potential for foot and mouth disease was 
going. 
He said that he did not think it was going all that well and she 
assured him that it was not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reassured by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and 
the Minister of National Defence, but I can tell the House that 
Canadians are very concerned about a potential outbreak.  We know 
that students in western Canada have cancelled trips to Europe, 
specifically to the U.K.  They may be out some money as a result, 
but they have done it because they do not want to be in any way 
responsible for bringing home this contagious disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an aside, we know that Air Canada is reviewing on a case 
by case basis that some individuals have initially been told they 
will not get their entire refunds back.  My office has been in 
touch with Air Canada today, which told us that it would look at 
it on a case by case basis.  In a situation like that of the 
students from the Edmonton area and from Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, 
I think they will get full reimbursement at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our office was in touch with someone else today who reported 
that he had landed in Vancouver about a week ago from Belgium and 
Holland.  He was pulled out of the line when he said that he had 
been on a farm in the past 14 days and was going to a farm 
because that was his job.  He said that he was asked a lot of 
very good questions, but he was never asked to use disinfectant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the gentleman in question had taken precautions 
before he left Holland.  He had dry cleaned his clothing, 
sanitized his footwear, showered and did all the necessary 
things.  However the fact of the matter was that he was not 
requested to walk on the disinfectant pad when he landed at 
Vancouver airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this just an isolated case or not?  I quote from a reporter 
or a writer named Morris W. Dorosh who wrote in an <I>Agriweek</I> 
article dated yesterday the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I came off an airplane from an international flight 
at the Toronto airport.  It was the end of the spring school 
break and the place was even more crowded than usual.  People 
were coming through Canada Customs four or five abreast.  An 
official of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency stood beside this 
human river meekly inquiring whether anyone had any meat products 
from abroad.  Not one passenger in five even noticed him. 
Diseases and infections of all kinds are ultimately spread by 
people.  It is now believed that foot and mouth disease was 
brought into the United Kingdom in the luggage of an airline 
traveller from China who passed through the customs inspection 
process without detection and subsequently provided the meat to a 
Chinese restaurant in northeast England.  The infection may have 
been active for 10 or 15 days before the first diagnosis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just an isolated case.  Canadians want to be assured 
that there are rules out there and that they are being adhered to 
religiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I am privileged to represent the air base in Moose 
Jaw.  Last week concerns over foot and mouth disease in Europe 
had inspectors scouring British made jets that were arriving. 
This is the NATO flight training centre that has been converted 
to a 15 wing base.  They have taken delivery of several training 
jets coming from England aboard Russian cargo planes. Precautions 
were taken to ensure that there was no soil on the crew members' 
shoes.  Their inflight garbage stayed on board and the wooden 
crates used to carry the wings of the jets were in fact burned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member for Brandon—Souris has said that this 
would be an non-partisan debate.  I certainly intend to abide by 
those Marquess of Queensberry rules, but I will refer to a call 
that the NDP caucus initially received and which my office 
returned.  It was from a veterinarian in Ontario who expressed a 
great deal of concern about the fact that the provincial 
government seemed to be shifting responsibility from 
veterinarians to what they call lay inspectors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT117"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a cost factor involved.  They are alleging that it is 
too expensive to have vets.  This is particularly prevalent at 
community auction sales during pre-sale screenings of livestock 
where they segregate the animals that appear to be less than 
sound.  They are then quarantined or set aside for a vet to 
examine at a later time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The veterinarian is extremely concerned.  He is working in this 
area himself, but he notes that there is basically no formal 
training going on for so-called lay inspectors.  There are very 
serious implications for food and animal safety in the opinion of 
this veterinarian.  He is urging that the government of Ontario 
seriously look at reassessing what is being done in terms of the 
lay inspectors who are replacing the vets at these auction sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian cattle industry and particularly the Canadian 
Animal Health Coalition have been in the forefront of 
facilitating discussions among the industry and the CFIA to plan 
in case the disease does get here.  They deserve a lot of credit 
because they have come up with a plan for a voluntary cease 
movement which has been approved by the Animal Health Coalition 
for immediate development.  They have also worked in conjunction 
with the Mexicans and the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up so I cannot go into the details on the 
Canadian Animal Health Coalition, but it deserves a lot of credit 
for the work it has done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to follow my colleague, the 
member for Palliser who is the agriculture critic for the New 
Democratic Party.  He is very informed and very concerned about 
the issue we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my introductory remarks I wish to thank the member 
for Brandon-Souris who has initiated the debate before the House 
this evening.  I also wish to comment on the decision by the 
Speaker to allow for the debate, to ensure that parliament has an 
opportunity to address a matter of very significant public 
concern and a matter of considerable urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a person in the House who would dismiss the matter 
of foot and mouth disease as unimportant.  We are dealing with a 
very critical and potentially dangerous problem for our nation. 
It is very timely for the House to address the concerns that we 
and our constituents feel right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very important role for parliament to play in 
identifying potential problems before they become serious and 
critical matters.  It is very important for the House to speak 
early to such issues.  Many times it has been suggested to us 
that we should not raise an issue out loud before it becomes a 
problem, because that does more to spread fear, concern and 
anxiety than the situation warrants.  We are all here this 
evening saying it is better to act now than to be sorry later. As 
the old cliche goes, it is better to be safe than sorry.  That is 
the message we bring to the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the government has been taking steps to 
address the possibility of foot and mouth disease entering the 
country.  We are here to show our vigilance, to give the 
government encouragement and ideas for ensuring that we are 
absolutely protected in the face of such a devastating disease 
spreading across the land.

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has a role to play in this regard, not only as the 
Alliance has mentioned in terms of public awareness, and 
certainly that is one benefit of tonight's debate, but I believe 
Parliament's role is also to inform the debate and convey the 
sense of urgency to the government about the need to take the 
most significant steps possible and the most courageous actions 
imaginable in the face of the looming crisis facing the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly colleagues in the House have mentioned the lessons we 
can learn from Britain.  We have heard tonight about just how 
serious a crisis the United Kingdom is facing as a result of foot 
and mouth disease.  That should impress upon us the need to take 
urgent action and to plan based on the worst case scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly scary to read some of the statistics around the 
incidence of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain.  Just 
yesterday we learned that 946 cases of foot and mouth 
disease have actually been identified in that country.  As of 
yesterday, the number of animals slaughtered or to be slaughtered 
because of foot and mouth disease numbered well over one million. 
That represents about 2% of all the cattle, sheep and pigs in 
that one country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard here tonight and from news reports how the virus 
has spread to France, the Netherlands and the republic of 
Ireland.  We have also heard tonight how it can happen here.  We 
may not have a case of foot and mouth disease in Canada today, 
and it is very likely that Canada has kept the disease out of the 
country for the last 50 years, but we also know based on the 
experience of Britain and other countries that a serious outbreak 
today would lead to the slaughter of possibly thousands of 
animals, would cost our agricultural industry dearly and would 
certainly cost our federal government billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions we have to ask tonight that need to be addressed 
by the government are around preparedness.  Are we truly prepared 
and ready in the event this virus should enter Canada  Some of 
the experts in the field have questioned whether we are prepared. 
I think our job tonight is to put on the record some of those 
concerns and to encourage the government to take those concerns 
very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I think of a report just last week in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> that quoted one of Canada's leading veterinary 
professors, a person by the name of Otto Radostits.  He is a farm 
animal veterinary professor at the University of Saskatchewan and 
has co-authored a textbook on the diseases of cattle, sheep, 
pigs, goats and horses.  This expert says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question, that if we have not been handling these 
kinds of crises in Canada, we are not as prepared as we should 
be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggests, in fact, that the government must take this issue 
more seriously and put in place a far reaching plan in the event 
of this virus entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard in the last couple of weeks from the 
president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of 
Canada, Mr. Steve Hindle, who suggested that there is a 
veterinarian shortage in the country today which could mean a 
risk of a foot and mouth disease outbreak.  That individual said 
on March 13 by way of a press release: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inability of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to address 
serious recruitment and retention issues within its veterinary 
community could endanger Canadian livestock. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to suggest that the outbreak of foot and mouth 
disease currently sweeping the United Kingdom and threatening 
Europe has led his union, representing some 500 veterinarians and 
other professionals at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, to 
question whether Canada is prepared to deal with a similar 
threat.  I think this is a reputable source of information that 
needs to be taken seriously.  That is the purpose of tonight's 
debate and I trust that the government will be listening to these 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Palliser also mentioned the concerns of the 
Canadian Cattlemen's Association, as quoted in the <I>Western 
Producer</I>, indicating the belief that there is no emergency 
response plan available to all players which could go into effect 
within hours of disease detection. 
That is another serious concern being raised by a very reputable 
farm organization in the country.  It needs to be taken 
seriously.

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of whether we are prepared needs to be addressed 
very specifically by the government.  Why are Canadians concerned 
and why are members of parliament registering concerns here this 
evening?  There is no question about it.  We know from reports by 
the auditor general that there are problems in the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency.  There is an under-resourcing in that agency. 
We know we fall short of important inspection capacity.  We know 
there are real questions about a dual mandate in that agency 
which could compromise speedy decisions in the interests of 
animal health and well-being and Canadians' health and 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are also sometimes concerns about openness and 
transparency with regard to the government.  Those concerns have 
to be addressed because they is at the heart of this matter. 
Secrecy and silence breed suspicion and concern, not the other 
way around.  It is by being open and transparent that we can deal 
with the concerns of Canadians and be more prepared than we are 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point to one example.  Often we raise concerns 
where a potential problem is arising and the government suggests 
we are only fearmongering and raising unnecessary fears.  That 
has happened in the case of mad cow disease, where we have seen 
similar concerns raised and a similar reaction by government in 
terms of secrecy and silence and a tendency not to be totally 
forthcoming around problems identified or actions taken. 
Certainly we have seen that on the health front.  I am quite 
familiar with some of the difficulties in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight is an opportunity to open the doors, to lift the shroud 
of secrecy, to ensure that there is full public awareness and 
that the plans of the government with respect to foot and mouth 
disease are fully disclosed and outlined for the public.  That 
way all Canadians can be prepared and every Canadian can do his 
or her share in ensuring that this virus does not enter Canada 
and is contained at all costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time 
with a colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to be able to support 
my colleague, the minister of agriculture, during this critical 
debate as our agencies work together to prevent foot and mouth 
disease from entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency has long played an 
important frontline role in assisting the CFIA with the 
administration of its import requirements.  The threat of this 
disease approaching our shores has intensified our partnership in 
recent weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues should be aware that the CFIA and the CCRA 
have a dedicated team that is working non-stop to try to prevent 
an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Canada.  Our partnership 
is not new.  We have worked closely and successfully in the past 
to protect Canada from the damage of the Asian long-horned beetle 
and from mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before foot and mouth disease was found in the United 
Kingdom, the CCRA normally referred all commercial shipments of 
meat and animal product to the CFIA, regardless of origin.  When 
the outbreak was confirmed, the CFIA immediately banned all 
commercial imports of meat and meat products and CCRA customs 
inspectors were alerted to increase their monitoring of those 
shipments.  Immediately senior CCRA officials met with their 
colleagues at the CFIA to identify ways in which the CCRA could 
support one of their highest priorities:  the security of all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT121"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT121"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2140

<A HREF="#LINKT120"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are responding.  With the guidance of the CFIA, we are 
addressing all the different points at which foot and mouth 
disease could enter Canada:  by ship, by air, through the postal 
or courier systems and across the border.  We are going well 
beyond our usual procedures to minimize the risk of this disease 
arriving in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members have seen for themselves, the CFIA has placed 
disinfecting foot mats at airports.  The CFIA detector dogs are 
also being used.  One of the ways in which the CCRA is supporting 
the CFIA is through intensified questioning of all travellers at 
major airports, including travellers arriving from the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking all travellers for their responses to customs 
declarations on food products, about their intentions to visit a 
Canadian farm and whether they have visited a farm in the 
European Union or Argentina in the last two weeks.  If the answer 
is yes to any of those questions, they are referred to CFIA so 
their belongings can be examined for signs of disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, against the threat of foot and mouth disease, the 
CCRA has also forged a partnership with Canada Post, due to the 
concern that people in Europe and Argentina are sending packages 
containing meat and animal products to relatives in Canada.  We 
at the CCRA have stepped up our efforts so that virtually all 
packages from the European Union and Argentina are being 
examined.  We do not want to take any risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fears have not been without basis.  In the last two weeks, 
the CCRA has detected over 120 kilograms of meat products, 100 
kilograms of cheese, 38 plants and even a litre of milk in the 
packages received at one customs mail centre alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of shipments by couriers, the risk is low. 
Nevertheless we have increased our examinations of European and 
Argentinian shipments and more parcels are being opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our land border crossings, we are aware that the United 
States is free of foot and mouth disease.  We know that the U.S. 
department of agriculture has announced that it has stepped up 
security, scrutiny and inspections at border points.  The USDA 
has also prohibited shipments of animal products from high risk 
countries.  Those actions lead us to conclude that the risk from 
the United States is low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the CCRA realizes that foot and mouth disease is not 
something to be taken lightly.  The CCRA stands ready to assist 
other government departments and agencies to keep our country 
safe, healthy and prosperous.  We will continue to work with the 
CFIA and to monitor the situation at the land borders carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reinforce for my hon. colleagues the fact that the 
CCRA is taking its responsibility of protecting Canadians 
seriously.  This is our highest priority.  During this tense 
period, though we work hard to keep the stream of trade and 
tourism flowing, fighting foot and mouth disease comes first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA is prepared to take additional action in co-operation 
with the CFIA to deal with the threat of foot and mouth disease. 
Not only are we ready to assist other government departments and 
agencies, but we are getting support from other organizations 
such as the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. 
In fact the Canadian Cattlemen's Association recently commended 
the CCRA and the CFIA in a letter.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been pleased and grateful for the diligence and the 
dedication of the staff from both agencies during this stressful 
time.  Of special note is the implementation of the disinfection 
systems at the ports of entry, which have been exceptional.

entering Canada.  We are ready and willing to assist any way we 
can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Duplain (Portneuf, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely 
pleased to be able to speak to this issue this evening. 
Portneuf being in a rural area, agriculture is one of its 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came here, I chose to be a member of the 
standing committee on agriculture, as well as of the rural 
caucus.  These two bodies provide us with the opportunity to 
hold many discussions on agricultural problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard various points from the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food and the Minister of National Defence on the problem 
being addressed this evening, foot and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to assure everyone that the foot and mouth disease 
epidemic in the European Union and Argentina is one of this 
government's absolute priorities.  Like the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris and everyone here in this House, we want to stop 
this terrible disease from entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of the steps we have taken to 
promote animal health in our country.  Canada has, it must be 
said, carved out a world reputation on the basis of the quality 
of its food safety system.  The respect we enjoy is in large 
part due to the attention we give to animal health issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is mandated to provide 
efficient and cost effective federal inspection services, as well 
as other services relating to animal health, food safety and 
plant protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's expertise has gained it international recognition. 
The inspection standards it has established, based on science 
and on regulations, enjoy a worldwide reputation.  These 
standards ensure that Canada imports safe and quality products 
and exports products that are of equal safety and quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for animal health, the CFIA sets policies, performs 
inspections and monitors compliance with the law as well as 
industry performance as far as animal and plant health is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years we have seen what a serious threat animal 
diseases represent for Canada's animal resources.  There are a 
number of factors responsible for escalation of this threat. 
Among these is the increase in international trade and in 
population movements. 
Climate change also affects animal habitats and health. 
Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of new animal diseases 
and the return of old ones, such as foot and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with all these challenges, the CFIA has kept Canada free 
of the communicable diseases considered the most serious in 
terms of public health and socio-economic consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of the leaders of the International Office of 
Epizootics, the OIE.  This is an international organization 
whose standards on animal diseases are accepted worldwide. 
Signatory countries are required to report to the OIE all cases 
of disease within their borders, as prescribed by the 
international animal health code.

<A HREF="#LINKT122"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diseases appearing in list A of this code are communicable 
diseases which may spread exceedingly rapidly and may have a 
profound effect on public health or on the economy.  These 
diseases are of great significance to international trade in 
animals and animal products.  Foot and mouth disease is a good 
example of a disease on list A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may be proud of the fact that Canada is one of the few 
countries that can claim to be free of diseases on the OIE's A 
list.  This is a singular accomplishment.  In addition, through 
its screening and eradication activities, Canada controls and 
limits the spread of other animal diseases in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been quite successful to date, in part through the speed 
and hard work of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  It is on 
the lookout for and identifies diseases and fights them.  It 
manages the health of animals services, inspects imports, screens 
for pests and exotic diseases and ensures that animals are 
transported without cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA's health of animals activities play a vital role in 
protecting public and animal health in Canada. 
The outbreak of foot and mouth disease raging in the United 
Kingdom and in Europe will put our health of animals system to 
the test. 
Canada has been free of foot and mouth disease since 1952, and 
we intend to keep it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is taking rigorous measures 
to keep the disease out of Canada.  The agency has suspended all 
import permits from EU countries and Argentina for susceptible 
products.  These products include not just live animals, meat 
and unpasteurized cheese but also embryos and animal semen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Visitors must answer a series of questions and declare any 
plant, animal or other products on arriving in Canada. 
Inspectors are patrolling major airports with dogs specially 
trained to detect the odour of any concealed food, plant, animal 
and fish products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA is enforcing special measures at airports where 
international flights could introduce the disease from Europe. 
It will also be launching an ad and media campaign to warn 
international travellers of the risks they run of inadvertently 
bringing the disease into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here I wish to point out that despite all these measures 
it is very important that members of the public themselves take 
care when returning from a trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA recently sent Canadian veterinarians to the United 
Kingdom to help with the fight against the outbreak of foot and 
mouth disease and with efforts to eradicate it.  This is a 
valuable opportunity for our veterinarians to acquire firsthand 
experience with a disease that does not yet exist in Canada. 
This experience will help us better prepare for the possible 
appearance of exotic animal diseases, particularly with respect 
to surveillance, diagnosis and management of sources of 
outbreaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to reassure the House that the returning veterinarians 
are subject to a full quarantine and disinfection before leaving 
the United Kingdom.  They are highly aware of the importance of 
cleaning and disinfecting organic material such as soil, manure 
and hay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can congratulate ourselves on the fact that Canada has been 
spared a good number of the more serious afflictions that have 
hit the livestock industry of many of our trading partners. 
However 
our good fortune comes at the price of constant vigilance.  The 
outbreak of foot and mouth disease now raging in Europe is 
forcing us to step up our vigilance.  We are fortunate to now be 
able to count on a firstclass system of animal health.  We must 
give it our unconditional support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is good to be here tonight to talk 
about foot and mouth disease.  I would like to recognize the 
member for Brandon—Souris and congratulate him on bringing this 
issue forward tonight. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT124"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT124"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2155

<A HREF="#LINKT123"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to read in the paper that there has only been 
a total of 991 cases of foot and mouth disease in England. 
However, the consequences of that are that one million 
animals have either been slaughtered or are due for slaughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit tonight about the kind of disease 
with which we are dealing.  As we know, it is a virus and is very 
communicable.  It has an incubation period of about 14 days. 
Because of that the discovery of it lags the infection of the 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This disease weakens and debilitates animals.  It causes 
blisters on their hooves and mouths.  It affects cattle, swine, 
sheep, deer, goats and all ruminants.  It does not affect humans 
but we can carry it for a limited time on our clothes and shoes. 
It can be found in dirt, in food products, in our respiratory 
tracks and it can also be transferred in the wind.  Interestingly 
enough, it can survive freezing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of this have been enormous.  If we look at the European 
Union and the piles of burning carcasses that we have seen on TV, 
we recognize that there is an economic cost to this.  However, 
there are other costs as well.  There is a political cost in 
Europe right now.  The election has been delayed because of this 
disease.  We read today that animals were being dug up and 
reburied because people were afraid they were contaminating water 
supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The psychological damage in Europe has also been great.  We see 
a way of life being destroyed.  I had a lady tell me that if they 
were going to take her husband's cows away they may as well bury 
him with the cows.  We understand what European farmers are going 
through as they watch their livestock being destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has paid a cost as well.  In response to the 
recent foot and mouth outbreak it has taken some measures.  It 
has moved swiftly to protect its borders.  It has included things 
like prohibiting shipments of products from high risk countries 
and increased personnel and surveillance at ports of entry.  It 
has tightened regulatory enforcement and strengthened its federal 
and state industry co-ordination, which has accelerated its 
research and implemented education campaigns.  It has also sent 
experts, as we have, to Great Britain to study this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost can be high in Canada as well.  I would like to quote 
from our press release of last Thursday after the news 
conference.  I will quote the member for Selkirk—Interlake who 
is the chief agriculture critic for the Canadian Alliance. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Livestock industry experts have estimated that the cost of an 
outbreak of this disease could cost up to $20 billion in the 
first year.  We all must work together to prevent this disease 
from occurring here. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are concerned.  The Canadian Alliance is working together 
with the government on this issue.  I have raised this issue at 
least four times in the House and tonight is the fifth time.  It 
is good to see that it has moved on to the agenda for Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we do not politicize this issue.  We have 
tried to avoid that.  However I have a couple of questions for 
the government tonight.  There are two areas where there have 
been some problems with politicizing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One MP from Alberta asked CFIA people to come out to meetings in 
his riding and discuss this issue with ranchers.  He has had a 
very difficult time getting permission to do that.  Permission 
has to come from the people in the minister's office.  He is 
having a hard time because they think it is going to be a 
political meeting.  The member is trying to make sure that does 
not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw in the media some details of the plan the government has 
created to deal with 
foot and mouth disease. We have yet to see the 
plan.  I would ask the government to come forward with it and lay 
it out so we can see what will happen if we have to deal with 
this problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to talk publicly about this issue.  We need 
leadership from the government.  We need cautious but very 
aggressive measures.  We need to avoid overreaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease existed before this spring.  There were 
only 48 countries in the world that were seen as being free of it 
at the beginning of the epidemic.  We need to present a balanced 
and safe way of dealing with this disease.  Overreaction will end 
up with consequences, particularly with trade, and those are 
consequences that cattlemen do not want to experience.  We need 
good inspection and a good border patrol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit tonight about what is being done.  We 
see that the border has been closed to swine and ruminant 
products and the importation of fresh, chilled and frozen meat 
products.  That is a good beginning.  We have restrictions on 
bringing products back to Canada.  We have upgraded our 
inspections.  However, do we have enough personnel?

<A HREF="#LINKT124"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Palliser spoke earlier about whether our 
personnel are adequate and whether they are trained adequately. 
We need to take a serious look at that.  The consensus indicates 
that we do not have extra field staff right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one example to bring forward tonight.  A constituent of 
mine came back from Europe about 10 days ago and wrote to me the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attendants also passed out declaration forms which we all 
filled out.  One of the questions asked was “Are you going to be 
on a farm in Canada in the next 14 days?”  I answered yes.  All 
the other questions had a “no” answer so this one was quite 
obvious, and it was the last question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once into the airport we went through customs, the customs 
officer looked at my passport and declaration paper and put me 
through.  I am not sure he even noticed the “yes” to the “on 
the farm” question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon stepping on the mat, I said to the fellow, that was in 
charge of the process, that I had better clean my feet good 
because I was going to be on a farm in the next 14 days.  After 
saying this to him he said to me, “Oh! Oh! Oh!”  He then 
proceeded to tell me some of precautions to take. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her letter she asks the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if I had not mentioned to the man, at the cleaning mats, 
that I was going to a farm in 14 days?  He would not have told me 
a thing, I would have walked through just like the thousands of 
other people coming from Europe into Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need our border people to be very vigilant in looking after 
this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad to see this morning that we turned back a ship which 
was filled with military vehicles.  We were led to believe that 
they were washed and disinfected in England and apparently they 
were not.  They had dirt on the vehicles and I was glad to see we 
caught that and sent them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we also need is education.  Our greatest 
danger from the disease is probably from tourists entering Canada 
who do not understand what they are doing or what they are 
bringing with them when they come.  Travellers must know the 
facts.  We need to have signage at our airports and we need to 
have brochures available on airplanes.  That is happening and it 
is not too soon.  It is good that it is taking place right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that farmers need to take some responsibility. 
They need to restrict access to their livestock.  Many of these 
people have spent years establishing their herds.  They are just 
like family to them and they need to take the responsibility of 
making sure that they are not in a position of allowing the 
disease to come on to their farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge.  I 
would like to raise another point.  I acknowledge the sacrifice 
that some of our citizens are making.  I raised this with the 
parliamentary secretary for agriculture. I also raised it on 
Friday night during members statements.  It is about our young 
people who are trying to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency there are students from Swift Current, 
Shaunavon and Bengough who are trying to decide whether they 
should take school trips to Europe over the Easter holidays. 
They are trying to do the right thing out of a sense of 
obligation to their home areas.  The communities are responding, 
as they typically do, by helping out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the government will issue a travel 
advisory dealing with foot and mouth disease so that when these 
people make a decision not to go they will be 
refunded their airfare by Air Canada.  Many of them are having 
trouble dealing with the airline companies, with the tour 
companies, and they are not getting full refunds.  I believe they 
should be receiving refunds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I should like to make sure that this does not 
become a partisan debate.  I realize that this is the end of a 
long and in some ways fractious day.  I am a new member here.  I 
came here to try to work with people together on issues.  I say 
tonight that I would like to work together with the other 
parties.  I am glad the motion came from this side of the floor 
and that we are dealing with it together.  All members should 
work together to make sure that this disease does not become a 
problem in Canada.  We cannot afford it and we do not need it. We 
have to keep it out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to an issue that must 
be brought to the attention of Canadians.  The seriousness of the 
issue is something that we all need to address.  I support the 
comments of my colleague in that this is a non-partisan issue 
that we all have to tackle as best we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a town called Picture Butte in southern Alberta. 
Our motto, which we adopted a few years ago when I was mayor of 
that town, is that Picture Butte is the livestock feeding capital 
of Canada.  That is a motto that we carry proudly because we have 
that industry in our area.  We are glad to have it there.  We 
work hard to keep it safe and to keep it on the right side of the 
environment.  A lot of people are involved in that industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has 25% or 26% of the national livestock business.  We 
have cattle and calves, over five million animals alone; hogs, 
1.7 million; and sheep and lambs, 167,000.  Processed animal 
sales are $3.2 billion; dairy products, $1.5 billion; and feed 
manufacturing, $533 million.  We have cattle and calf receipts at 
the farm gate of $3.3 billion; $505 million for hogs; sheep and 
lamb, $14 million; and livestock purchases altogether, $970 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an outbreak in Canada of this disease our borders 
will be shut down immediately.  The whole industry would come to 
a grinding halt.  We are not only talking about meat products but 
dairy products as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exports out of Alberta for beef and veal, $1.4 billion; pork, 
$177 million; live cattle, $511 million; and hogs, $92 million. 
This is a huge industry.  These figures are a quarter of what 
goes on in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this plague comes to Canada it will lower the standard of 
living of every Canadian.  It is important that we get this 
information out.  This is not a rural issue.  This is a 
Canada-wide issue.  It is very critical that all Canadians take 
part in making sure that Canada remains foot and mouth disease 
free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the employment figures in Alberta, in animal 
production there are 40,000 people involved; in mixed farming, 
8,000; and in the processing end of it, 10,000 people.  They 
would be affected immediately.  I am not talking about trucking, 
handling facilities, auction marts or the customs work.  Those 
people would all be out of a job the day after foot and mouth was 
discovered in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative we do all we can to keep it out of Canada.  Our 
party has offered some suggestions to the government.  It is good 
to see that it is moving on them, that there is an advertising 
campaign to educate every Canadian on what it means if it does 
come into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information must go out to travel agents to educate travellers 
leaving or coming to Canada.  In my riding I have sent some 
information out to all the school boards.  I am glad my colleague 
mentioned that the government should issue a travel advisory so 
that students who are planning to leave Canada during the Easter 
break have an option on whether or not to go.  Many of them will 
not go because they appreciate what the industry means to them at 
home.  It would help with their travel plans if some options were 
available to them and if the government would issue a travel 
advisory advising them not to leave the country.  The airlines 
would support something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get calls from people every day that see exceptions at 
airports.  That is something that we have to absolutely make sure 
does not happen.  The luggage of anyone who has meat or brings 
anything illegal into the country should be taken away and 
disinfected.  We have to make sure that every item is seized.  We 
must have maximum patrols at the airports and maximum inspections 
of all equipment and people coming into the country. Thousands of 
tourists come out of the United Kingdom and Europe every week. We 
have to be absolutely sure that this disease cannot be carried 
into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIA has to work hard.  All of us have to support the 
government in releasing the resources necessary to make sure that 
our borders are protected.  Our party will work co-operatively 
with the government to do that.  We have to make sure that the 
information gets out through whatever means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have information from the United States, New Zealand and 
Australia.  They have put information on the web, advising their 
producers what would happen if it enters their countries.  They 
are advising of the things they are doing to make sure it does 
not enter their countries.  They are also indicating the steps 
that producers need to take if it does happen to get into their 
countries.  This is the type of information we have to get out to 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a national strategy involving all departments of 
government: agriculture, customs and health.  All these people 
need to get together and have a plan in place to keep the disease 
out of Canada.  We have kept it out of Canada for 50 years.  It 
has been in the world for 50 years and has not come to Canada. If 
we are diligent we can make sure that it does not happen now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a national strategy with all the people involved, all 
the resources from all the departments put together, we can do a 
better job.  We can bring the possibility of it coming to Canada 
down as close to zero as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will take our offer of support.  I have 
not mentioned the member for Brandon—Souris.  I thank him for 
bringing the issue forward.  It is something we support and an 
issue we were looking at ourselves.  We need to devise a joint 
plan and national strategy by all departments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had two or three cases back home where groups of students 
have come to me and said that they do not want to go on their 
trip.  They could not get their money back so they were trying to 
find some options.  The travel advisory is something that needs 
to be done in a hurry.  I do not know which department would need 
to do it.  Hopefully the agriculture minister could talk to his 
cabinet colleagues and have it issued so that these people would 
have some options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough that this is a national issue which 
will affect every Canadian.  Perhaps we could imagine our 
standard of living dropping immediately by 20% right across the 
board, no matter where we are or who we are.  That is how 
important and how big the issue is.  It would cost $20 billion, 
and some estimate it would be as high as $26 billion, in the 
first year alone to eradicate the disease if it did get into 
Canada. It would take years and years to get over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding people are not sleeping.  It is a nightmare to even 
think what would happen if it came, evidenced by some of the 
pictures we have seen coming from England.  We cannot allow that 
in this country.  The cost of keeping it out will be minuscule in 
comparison to the cost if it does get here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work together and put the money in place.  We need to 
put the resources in place.  We must do whatever we need to do to 
keep that disease away from our borders so that we do not have to 
see the same visuals that we see coming out of Europe. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the one thing that we have heard tonight 
is how serious it would be if the disease ever came here.  We 
have seen what has been happening in the United Kingdom where 
tens of thousands of animals have been shot and buried.  There 
might be a possibility that it has also infected the deer 
population.  This is a problem that will not be solved quickly. 
It has jumped the channel and is on the continent proper.  It is 
in France, the Netherlands, Iceland and Argentina. This gives us a 
rough idea of how extensive it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said tonight that it would cost the United Kingdom 
over $20 billion to get it under control, not to eradicate it but 
to get it under control.  On the continent itself the cost in 
Europe could be over $100 billion.  These are things that the 
government takes very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about an outbreak in Saskatchewan in 1952.  I 
did some research on it to get a rough idea of what happened, 
because at that time I was only one year old.  In 1952 it cost $1 
billion to get it under control and to eradicate it. The member 
has been talking about $20 billion.  In 1995 dollars, using the 
Saskatchewan example, it would cost well over $30 billion in just 
the one instance.  This is one of the reasons we have to be very 
careful with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an amazing little virus too.  According to the website for 
the Ontario ministry of agriculture and food and rural affairs, 
the foot and mouth virus survives freezing temperatures.  It has 
an incubation period of 8 to 21 days.  It has been found viable 
in milk pasteurization of 72°C for 15 seconds.  It has been 
removed from cattle stalls 14 days after the removal of cattle. 
In addition, it has been removed from urine after 39 days, soil 
after 28 days in the fall and soil after 3 days in the summer. 
That tells me right off the bat that it is sensitive to 
ultraviolet rays.  It has been removed from dry hay at 22°C after 
20 weeks of storage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be carried by people for up to 14 days after contact with 
the disease.  It can be inhaled and trapped in a human's 
respiratory tract for up to 36 hours and then expelled in saliva 
or breath.  It can travel 300 kilometres by water and 80 
kilometres over land.  It can cling to clothing, shoes or luggage 
for at least nine weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have travellers coming back to Canada from the United 
Kingdom and Europe, here is what they should do.  They should 
declare all meat, dairy and other animal products they bring into 
Canada.  The items should be left at the airport where they can 
be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the traveller must visit a farm he or she should make sure 
that clothing and footwear are free from soil or manure, clean 
and disinfect footwear by washing with a 50:50 solution of 
vinegar and water, machine wash clothes in hot water or have them 
dry cleaned.  It is also recommended to stay away from a farm for 
at least 14 days after returning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Livestock producers and organizers of shows, which is another 
point where livestock will come together, should exercise caution 
before allowing visitors on farms or to livestock events.  They 
should make them aware of the risks and the precautions to take. 
Although humans are not susceptible to foot and mouth, they are 
carriers.  They should advise tourists to take additional 
sanitary precautions such as washing and disinfecting all 
personnel effects and equipment that accompanies them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly important to clean and disinfect footwear as 
described above and to provide protective footwear and clothing. 
Organizers of shows and events must take extra precautions in 
installing disinfectant footbaths and foot mats at the 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been raised a couple of times tonight, are we doing 
enough?  I want to tell everybody that in November 2000 we did a 
national and an international simulation exercise.  That included 
representatives of the livestock industry, the provinces and 
Emergency Preparedness Canada.  It was very extensive.  It was 
how to isolate and eradicate the virus so it cannot spread. 
Right now we are doing a follow-up workshop to ascertain what we 
learned by doing that exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing we did was put forward a foreign animal disease 
manual.  That is being put on the website of the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency.  The website is www.inspection.gc.ca 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to see as the vice chair of the 
standing committee is a contingency plan brought before the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food so we can assess 
it.  I would like to see that done as quickly as possible.  I 
believe it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say again that we are committed to continuous 
learning.  We did that by sending over some veterinarians.  They 
were in the UK and experienced first hand what the disease was 
like.  They were brought back to Canada.  They went through the 
disinfection procedure.  They stayed away from livestock.  We are 
now going to have them talk to our animal science people and give 
lectures on what they experienced while in the UK. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can teach somebody else better than somebody who experienced 
it first hand?  They experienced the hurt and pain of having to 
go into somebody's farm and shoot all their livestock.  They 
experienced having lines of cattle, sheep and pigs out in a 
field.  They experienced the fact of having a huge hole dug at a 
former air force base and having the livestock buried in it. 
They experienced all that first hand.  They also experienced what 
the British veterinarian service has gone through to try to 
contain the virus. 
They have all that very pertinent knowledge and information that 
they brought back to help us put together a good contingency plan 
so that if the worst ever happens, we can have this under control 
as quickly as possible.  That is imperative.

importation of susceptible animals and animal products from the 
EU and Argentina.  It has also suspended the issuance of import 
permits of live animals, semen, embryos and animal products of 
susceptible animals.  We have control over any import permits 
that have been issued but not used.  These are being cancelled. 
We are working on tracing any products coming into Canada to know 
exactly where they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to put it on the record that we know 
this is a very important issue.  It is a problem we do not want 
to see get out of hand.  Quite frankly, I feel that we as a 
government are doing everything physically and humanly possible 
to make sure that foot and mouth disease does not get into 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this emergency debate 
initiated by the hon. member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he called for this emergency debate on foot and mouth 
disease, the hon. member gave credit and applauded the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency for its advertising campaign.  I agree 
wholeheartedly that this agency is addressing this potential 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease does not have significant human health 
effects but it is easily transmitted by humans.  It can travel on 
clothing, on vehicles,  on the person and in prepared foods.  An 
important line of defence in protecting Canada from foot and 
mouth disease must be to make people aware of the precautions 
that they can take to help keep this terrible disease out of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government has taken the initiative to provide 
Canadians and travellers to Canada with information about what 
travellers coming or returning to Canada can do to prevent the 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus my remarks tonight on the government's 
communications plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the CFIA as it is commonly 
known, has established a task force to co-ordinate the 
dissemination of information about foot and mouth disease.  It is 
collaborating with the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association 
and other federal and provincial partners to provide 
veterinarians, producers and the public with information about 
foot and mouth disease and has provided a toll free number. 
Maybe I can use this forum to give that toll free number.  It is 
1-877-227-0677. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my constituents travel outside Canada as tourists and on 
business.  They need to be aware of the care they should take, so 
the government will increase its campaign to keep foot and mouth 
disease out of Canada with advertisements in the travel sections 
of major dailies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I am sure hon. members were watching the show, the 
CFIA had a five minute segment on CTV's <I>Canadian Farm Show</I> 
and more television public service announcements are planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency also has foot and mouth 
disease related materials available on its website, including 
information bulletins and fact sheets on key topics.

<A HREF="#LINKT129"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Copies of those fact sheets are displayed at various locations 
in the airports.  Most of us come through the Toronto airport and 
the Ottawa airport.  The information is there for us.  The agency 
has established a toll free information line to respond to 
Canadians' concerns.  A travel advisory has been given to customs 
officers across the country to hand out at airports.  There is 
signage at the airports informing travellers of disinfection 
procedures, and members earlier referred to those disinfection 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the print media two articles on foot and mouth disease have 
been placed in the <I>Canadian Veterinarian Medical Association 
Journal</I> and an article will be placed in a supermarket journal 
which is distributed to 10,000 supermarket retailers across 
Canada.  Most of us, when we visit the supermarket on the 
weekend, can be assured that information will be there for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, an article has been prepared and will be electronically 
distributed to more than 1,000 community newspapers.  Ads will 
also be run on inflight airline TV presentations and in 
agricultural trade publications.  We want to warn travellers and 
farmers of the dangers of the disease.  We want to send a clear 
message.  It is up to all of us to keep this highly contagious 
disease out of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken other steps.  We plan to release travel 
information cards to passengers, alert travel agencies and 
increase content on the CFIA website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the recent communication initiatives but 
others are being prepared.  Communication activities such as 
information on the outbreak in Europe, we take very seriously. We 
recognize that everyone has a role to play to help keep the 
disease out of Canada.  We want Canadians to be aware of the role 
they play in prevention.  It is up to all of us.  We must all be 
involved in prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has kept the disease out of the country for over 50 
years.  We will increase surveillance.  We will continue to ask 
international passengers to walk through a disinfectant footbath. 
We will continue to educate the public and travellers.  We will 
use communication as a powerful tool to prevent the disease from 
coming to Canada.  We will talk about this in our communities, 
our schools, our churches and in our public avenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that we are in agreement on all sides of the House 
that prevention is really the route for us to go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak on this very important issue in Canada.  My party and I 
thank the hon. member for Brandon—Souris for bringing this 
important issue to the Speaker's attention so that we can rise 
and debate on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people are asking why someone from Nova Scotia would be 
debating the issue of foot and mouth disease.  In the 
Musquodoboit Valley I have many dairy farmers who are extremely 
concerned about what would happen to them if this disease ever 
came into Nova Scotia, and for that matter, the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot of facts and figures about the costs to Canada if 
the disease came in.  It was anywhere from $20 billion to $26 
billion.  Those figures are just on estimated losses from the 
producers themselves.  Everyone tends to forget what this would 
do to tourism and other aspects of the economy.  In fact the 
losses would be immeasurable.  It would be absolutely scary to 
see what would happen.  We heard that school groups throughout 
the country have cancelled or plan to cancel trips into England 
and other parts of Europe.  That also figures into economic 
losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I echo the sentiment of many speakers here tonight who said that 
we as a parliament, we as a country, must do everything we can to 
prevent foot and mouth disease from coming into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members spoke about the stories they have heard or the e-mails, 
faxes or phone calls they have received from various people who 
have gone through customs at airports at various points of entry 
into Canada and the lack of attention to detail that various 
customs agents have portrayed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former airline employee for 18 years at the Watson Lake 
airport in Yukon and for 8 years at the Halifax airport, I can 
assure the House that the customs people there do an excellent 
job of trying to prevent not only drugs and illegal immigrants 
from coming in but also those various diseases that should not be 
coming in either through meats, cheeses or other contraband 
items.  The problem time and time again is that our customs 
agents just simply do not have the resources in terms of human 
personnel or finances with which to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand tonight that the minister of agriculture is 
working very diligently in this regard.  He has said very 
positively in the debate tonight that they will do all they can 
to be extra vigilant at our points of entry throughout the 
country to try to prevent the disease from coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should be congratulated on his words tonight.  We 
will work with him as a political party, the New Democrats, along 
with our other colleagues in opposition to ensure that various 
agencies throughout the country have the human and financial 
resources to do the job they would actually like to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former airline employee I would also like to say to the 
House that tomorrow I will be calling the airlines, Air Canada 
and others, to see if it is not possible for them to institute a 
total 100% refund policy for anyone who cancels a trip overseas 
because of the fear of spreading hoof and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the airlines could do this as a sign of goodwill.  It 
is also good business practice.  I do not believe they need an 
act of parliament to be able to do it.  As an airline employee I 
will be calling my contacts tomorrow to see if indeed airlines 
like Air Canada can take the lead, become good corporate citizens 
and do their bit to help eradicate the disease in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also like to send kudos to our agricultural critic, the 
member for Palliser, on his comments tonight on the disease.  He 
and other members come from the prairie provinces.  I come from a 
area with small farming in Musquodoboit Valley.  For western 
producers it would be absolutely scary to see what they would go 
through.  I can only imagine, as was mentioned before, that many 
of them are not getting very much sleep at night worrying about 
their livestock and what it would mean in terms of losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we had an emergency debate on the farm crisis in 
the oil and grain seeds sector and what was happening to our 
farmers and other producers.  We talked about the ramifications 
of trade deals, their losses of revenue, people leaving the farm 
by the thousands, and the young people not taking up agriculture. 
Can anyone imagine now what the livestock industry is thinking 
about and what it is going through?   Again it makes anyone kind 
of wonder why a young person would ever get into agriculture of 
any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage young people to take up agriculture because it is a 
wonderful career and a great livelihood.  It is something they 
can make money at and actually help feed the rest of the nation 
forevermore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to say on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia that 
we have a tremendous amount of people coming from various points 
such as Iceland, England, Europe, the United States and other 
areas into the Halifax airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a private conversation the member for Windsor—St. Clair 
suggested that many people in Windsor actually go to Detroit to 
fly overseas.  When they come back to Detroit it is just a matter 
of getting in their cars and coming back again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion to the government would be to ensure that it is 
extremely vigilant on all travellers coming in from the United 
States.  We tend to have a fairly porous border where a lot of 
people come back and forth.  To prevent the disease from coming 
into Canada, we must be extremely vigilant with all those 
entrants from the United States.  A lot of our exports go to the 
United States.  If hoof and mouth disease came into this country 
we know that border would be shut down in a heartbeat, which 
would have a devastating effect upon agricultural producers in 
beef and cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a parliament must do everything we can to ensure that we 
convince and give confidence to our producers that we will 
support them in every effort we can to prevent the disease from 
coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any person with a heart would have to send their love and 
prayers to the people of England right now. 
There are horrific pictures of thousands upon thousands of what 
look like healthy animals being crated up with backhoes, put in a 
pit and burned.  That is just not what is supposed to happen, but 
that is the only way they can prevent the disease from spreading.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of pictures and newscasts that we do not 
want to see in this country.  We should be doing all we can to 
assist the people of Britain to ensure the disease does not 
spread.  It is already in other parts of Europe.  We should be 
doing everything we can to ensure it does not spread any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education equals prevention.  It has been said before that we 
must tell our embassies and consulates around the world to be 
ever vigilant in telling people what they must do when they come 
to Canada.  Every person coming into the country must take 
responsibility to ensure they do everything they can to prevent 
the disease from coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I wish to thank the member for Brandon—Souris for 
bringing forward this important debate.  I also thank the Speaker 
for allowing us the time.  I know we cannot take any questions or 
comments, but I want to thank you, Madam Speaker, for being here 
with us to listen to this important debate.  By working together 
I am sure we can keep this terrible disease out of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, they call it the isle of tears.  It is 
also called the island of death.  It is an island in the St. 
Lawrence, 50 kilometres downstream from Quebec City, called 
Grosse Île.  This island was Canada's quarantine station from 
1832 to 1937. It is where all the immigrants coming to Canada had 
to spend a quarantine period before they went on to Canada 
proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this because I believe this debate on foot and mouth 
disease, and the problem and indeed crisis we are facing now, 
actually signals a larger issue, an issue that is going to 
perplex the next generation of Canadians.  Indeed I think what we 
are facing with foot and mouth disease today is a symptom of a 
hazard that is the result of this global village that is 
occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first, Madam Speaker, just give you a little bit of 
history of Grosse Île.  Grosse Île was set up in 1832 as a result 
of a cholera epidemic that broke out in India in 1826 and spread 
across the Middle East, arriving in Moscow in 1831.  By 1832 it 
had reached Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days people did not know much about disease.  They only 
saw the impact of disease.  It was called Asiatic cholera and 
people died in the thousands.  The Canadian authorities faced 
with the great ships and sailing vessels that were coming over 
with the great waves of immigration were faced with the dilemma 
of immigrants coming into Canada who may or may not have been 
carrying diseases that may infect the rest of the population. 
What they did was erect at Grosse Île facilities for holding 
immigrants for several weeks and for sterilizing their clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you can visit Grosse Île today.  It is now being 
turned into a national park.  You can see at Grosse Île the 
installations where the immigrants came.  They were in a large 
building.  They were forced to strip, take all their clothes off. 
Through one door they walked through a series of hot showers to 
wash them clean.  Through another door their luggage was carried 
into a primitive autoclave in which their clothing was sterilized 
with hot steam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite that many people sickened and died at Grosse Île.  They 
estimate about 20,000 Irish alone died as they tried to enter 
Canada in the years between 1832 and 1937.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst time was in the 1840s when this time it was typhus. 
Typhus is carried by lice.  They did not realize at the time that 
this was the problem.  They did know, however, that certain 
primitive sterilization procedures seemed to combat the disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that story, this little bit of history, is 
significant is we move forward 60 years and what we find is that 
people come to Canada through our ports, but mostly through our 
airports with no quarantine period, with no thought of 
sterilization, with no concern up until this foot and mouth 
disease crisis that they may be carrying infectious diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this foot and mouth epidemic tells us is that we now have a 
situation in the global world we are living in, this global 
village, where diseases are worldwide.  Today we are facing a 
crisis with respect to an animal disease which threatens to kill 
a large quantity of our agricultural industry.  It has the 
potential of devastating our cattle industry.  We have seen the 
pictures of course in Britain of thousands and thousands of 
animals being slaughtered and buried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must take a break and note that I am splitting my time.  It is 
such an engaging topic that I actually would like to speak at 
some length because I am an historian and I am interested always 
in the way the past has instruction for the present and future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is now suddenly Agriculture 
Canada, suddenly the government and suddenly the public are 
activated by this need to look at the security of our ports of 
entry when it comes to the possibility of infectious diseases 
arriving in the country.  Suddenly we have an emergency on our 
hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the earlier speakers and I am confident the 
government is doing all it can under the circumstances.  I think 
what we are faced with now is a harbinger of further dangers to 
come, other dangers that may affect our food crops but other 
dangers that may also affect our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding just recently we had a terrible scare where a 
person had come in from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
suddenly became ill.  She showed all the symptoms of Ebola virus. 
She bled out of her pores and every symptom indicated that she 
was carrying one of the most highly infectious and most fatal 
diseases known to man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The happy story is that after she was put in isolation and all 
the medical expertise was applied to the situation, it was 
discovered that whatever it was, and they still do not know what 
it was, it was not this particular infectious disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this says to us and what the foot and mouth crisis says to 
us is that we as a nation, we as a government and we as a people 
have to be aware of the fact that we are moving into a new 
century in which there is a new type of threat to national 
security.  It is not enough to suddenly put together defences 
which involve mats on the floors of airport corridors that 
sterilize the soles of shoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to create a game plan that puts us in a position where 
we are prepared to respond to another crisis that might affect 
our food crops.  There are diseases that affect rice and there 
are diseases that affect wheat.  I do not want to sound alarmist, 
but there are also very scary diseases out there that affect 
humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one positive thing we can get out of this crisis that is 
facing us today is that we as parliamentarians and we as the 
Canadian public should support our government in setting up long 
term strategies that look at this problem in a long term fashion, 
and looks at it not only in terms of the agricultural industries 
but in terms of national security in the broadest sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to co-operate not only with other government agencies. 
It should not just be the department of agriculture because it 
happens to be a disease that affects cattle.  It should be 
co-ordinated by Emergency Preparedness Canada and it should 
embrace all departments including Health Canada.  It also should 
affect of course the way we train our customs officials.  Even 
more than that, it is not just a national issue.  It is not just 
a federal issue.  It is a provincial issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the time has come when the provinces and the federal 
government have to get together.  They have to talk and they have 
to develop strategies between them and share the costs that look 
to the security not only of our food supply, not only of our 
agricultural industries, Madam Speaker, but also to the security 
of the generation of Canadians to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to be among my colleagues in the House today and 
participate in a debate in which I believe the goals of all of us 
are the same.  We really do want to prevent a tragedy happening 
in Canada, a tragedy that is taking place in other countries in 
Europe at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to examine this not only from the point of view of what 
the government can do for me, what industry can do, what all of 
the agencies who will communicate the message can do, but what I 
can do.  What have I been doing that might inadvertently harm 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the number of times I have come home through Pearson 
airport and ticked the form that shows I am not going to a farm 
in the next 14 days.  I wonder to myself how many times after I 
have ticked that box I went to my cottage on the weekend.  As I 
went to my cottage on the shores of Lake Huron I moved through 
the farm country in beautiful southwestern Ontario.  I think of 
how many times I may have stopped at the local farm to pick up a 
dozen eggs or to walk along the paths in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rural area.  I am an urban member.  Most of the people 
in my riding would consider that they do not very often visit 
farms. I do not think this is true.  We are very mobile in 
Canada.  I think of all the school trips that my children have 
taken to a farm in the springtime.  I think of what might happen 
this spring.  Maybe this year we should not continue those 
innocent children's trips to a dairy farm or those school trips 
to visit barnyard animals.  Maybe our farmers would be well 
advised to be a little more protective of their livelihood by 
keeping out people who are not necessary to the operation of 
their agricultural business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are world travellers who travel for business and pleasure 
and who come back to their places of employment and engage in 
normal conversation and contact with other employees who they 
know live in a rural environment.  I think of how it would be 
wiser, maybe, to stay away from these people for the protection 
of all of us for a period of 48 hours, and how it would be wiser 
for sure not to visit with friends who we normally might visit 
with in the country during a time when we have just returned from 
a trip overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things we can do.  We have to be knowledgeable and not 
panic.  As I walk over a mat coming through an airport from an 
overseas country, I might want to consider the other two pairs of 
shoes that might be in my luggage.  Maybe before I come back into 
the country I should do something to disinfect those shoes. I 
know that customs officials have dogs that will likely, through 
their training and from scent, pick up manure or ground and dirt 
that could be on my luggage.  However, there is something I could 
do.  When I come home I could make sure that my clothes are dry 
cleaned and washed.  I could wash my hair and use that 50:50 
vinegar-water solution on those shoes or the outside of my 
luggage or whatever I care to do.  I do not think we should 
panic, but I do think we can all do our part.  We do not have to 
be experts, but we do have to take care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annually, tourism in Canada is a $50 billion industry, with 70% 
of that tourism within Canada by our own citizens and 30% coming 
from the exterior into the country.  We still have a travel 
deficit in our tourism.  Maybe this is the year I could take a 
Canadian vacation and see this beautiful country from sea to sea 
to sea.  I could take along my children and show them what Canada 
means.  Maybe it means a visit to Quebec.  Maybe it means a visit 
to Atlantic Canada or to the north or out west. 
It is something that I could do and that other families could do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to see devastation in the tourism industry.  I 
know what will be happening in Britain this summer.  I know that 
their rural paths are closed.  I know that Stonehenge is closed. 
This is an economic tragedy, but it is a tragedy that must affect 
so many people's lives and so many different levels of their 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do something to prevent this tragedy from coming here.  I 
think we have confidence in our government, in our farm 
organizations and in our communications materials.  We are 
getting the co-operation of our print media, our airlines, our 
farmers, our veterinarians and our scientists.  We are getting 
the projects through training and the implementation at our 
borders through the customs officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are working toward the goal together.  It is the 
partnership of civil society, the civilian population of the 
country, that at the most basic level is the most responsible 
party for making sure this disease does not enter our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do our share.  I think it is incumbent on each and every 
one of us to look at our own decision making and our own actions 
and make sure that we are not accidentally the entry point when 
we can use very simple means of prevention, many of which have 
been outlined by members in the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very grateful to the member who initiated the debate.  I am 
pleased to work in the House in a collegial manner.  I am pleased 
that we are finally talking about something that is worth getting 
up and speaking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise this evening to address the 
issue of foot and mouth disease, a very serious issue and 
something that is of great concern to farmers and ranchers in my 
riding of Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you may know, Madam Speaker, and no doubt you do, Medicine 
Hat produces a tremendous amount of beef, a lot of which is 
exported to the United States.  Not only is this a concern for 
people within Canada, but obviously if foot and mouth disease 
ever came to Canada again it would have a profound impact on our 
ability to export beef.  Consequently it would have a huge impact 
on the economy in Canada.  It is a multibillion dollar industry 
in Alberta alone and tens of billions of dollars when we talk 
about how it would affect the livestock industry right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to put this into perspective if I can.  I have a press 
release in my hand from the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, a 
group that speaks for the industry.  These individual members 
have a lot of stake.  They are producers themselves.  I think 
this puts it into perspective.  The release states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cattlemen's Association today reminded cattle 
producers that the risk of introducing Foot-and-Mouth Disease 
into Canada is minimal so long as the proper precautions are 
observed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes on to describe some of the precautions people can 
take.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Many countries in the world have Foot-and-Mouth Disease and we 
have successfully kept it out of Canada for almost 50 years,” 
says Carl Block, Chair of the CCA Animal Health Committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carl Block comes from my friend's riding, from the Cypress area 
in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Block goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the heightened awareness of this disease and the increased 
surveillance taking place at points of entry into Canada, we may 
well be less at risk now than in the past when it was next to 
impossible to get travellers to take this disease seriously. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The release continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Block points out it is neither practical nor possible to ban the 
movement of people to and from countries where Foot-and-Mouth 
Disease exists. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's not forget we're not just talking about Europe. 
Foot-and-Mouth Disease exists in many countries around the world 
including India, China and parts of South America, Africa and 
Asia.  We cannot shut ourselves off from the rest of the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are wise words.  People need to put this in perspective. 
This disease has been around forever.  We have managed to deal 
with it successfully by taking some simple precautions.  Today, 
with such heightened awareness, we are taking far greater 
precautions and it should give people some comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all of that, we need to make sure that the 
precautions the government has announced are in fact being 
implemented. 
That is where those of us in the Canadian Alliance have some 
concerns.  I trust members across the way do too.  This is not a 
partisan issue.  I think that people in the House want to make 
sure Canada is doing everything it can to block the spread of 
foot and mouth disease, which could obviously have a devastating 
effect on Canada or any country it enters. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT135"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are really two things that we need to emphasize when we 
talk about what we can do.  One is knowledge and the other is 
action.  I would argue that if there is something the government 
could have done better and still could do better when it comes to 
foot and mouth disease, it is to ensure that people know about 
foot and mouth disease, that they have the knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a large degree, the government to this point has relied on 
the media to get its message out.  I would argue that this is 
perhaps a little dangerous.  When we rely on the media, what we 
tend to get is a very skewed and sort of hysterical view of what 
is going on.  When people see the media, what they see are big 
piles of burning cattle.  I think that frightens a lot of people. 
They should be concerned, but that does not really tell us the 
true story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the CCA is pointing out, this disease has been around 
forever.  The chance of it coming to Canada is minimal if 
precautions are taken.  The government should be advertising and 
letting members of the public know exactly what they can do to 
stop the spread of foot and mouth disease.  The government should 
explain to the public that it is not harmful to human health, but 
that humans can carry the disease.  The government needs to do 
that but it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has advertised in the past for things that were, I would 
argue, a little less essential.  Now when we have a serious issue 
that Canadians need to know about, whether they are travelling to 
Europe or planning to travel to Europe or any other country where 
there is foot and mouth, or when it comes to preventing this from 
being spread if it ever does enter into Canada, people need to 
know how to prevent it.  People need to know what precautions 
they can take on the farm and that kind of thing.  The government 
should be advertising.  That is one thing the government could do 
to really help, but it has not done that yet.  I and my 
colleagues, many of whom are sitting around me right now, held a 
press conference the other day to emphasize that this is a 
positive step the government could take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back from the U.K. a few weeks ago.  One of the things 
that surprised me was that there were no signs in airports 
warning travellers to be aware that if they had been in a rural 
area in Europe or wherever they should declare, for instance, 
whether they had muddy shoes in their suitcases.  To me that 
would be a common sense, simple thing that customs and revenue 
could do at airports.  The shoes could come out, be put on the 
slurry mat and cleaned up with disinfectant.  Then away the 
travellers go.  It is dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there were no signs like that.  Not only were there no 
signs, but when I went through customs I was not asked a question 
about that.  I was asked pointedly if I had food.  I was glad to 
hear them asking about that.  However, they did not ask the 
important question about muddy clothing.  They did not ask me if 
I had been to a farm.  I did have to fill out a form stating 
whether I would be going to a farm, but they did not ask me if I 
had been to one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the sorts of questions that customs officials should 
be asking and up to this point have not been asking.  We would 
sure like to encourage them to do that.  That is a common sense 
step they could take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials should be letting schools know that there is a danger 
of children carrying foot and mouth disease if they go to Europe 
for some kind of school trip.  In some cases there is money at 
stake and maybe the kids will go anyway.  If they do go, they 
need to know what the precautions are.  That is something the 
government could do.  It could give the message to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is action.  I have already touched on this to 
some degree.  We need to make sure that we have all the slurry 
mats in place.  We received reports just the other day that in a 
number of airports these mats were still not in place.  That is 
not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have sent 10 veterinarians over to the U.K. to help them with 
the outbreak.  This is great.  I am glad we did that, but surely 
one of the things they found out was how easily this disease 
spreads.  One would think that the government would talk to these 
people and learn from them that we should have the necessary 
precautions in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why we would not have slurry mats in place 
with a vinegar solution on them to kill any foot and mouth 
disease.  That is so straightforward.  It is one thing for the 
government to announce these things, but it is another thing for 
government to actually implement them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure we have slurry mats in place 24 hours a day in 
airports.  I am sure members will be pushing the government to do 
so.  When people get off a plane from a country where there is 
foot and mouth disease, especially the U.K. where it is seemingly 
out of control, they will pass over the mat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk briefly about British soldiers.  CFB Suffield is in 
my riding.  A lot of people are concerned about British soldiers 
bringing foot and mouth disease to Canada from the U.K.  However 
the precautions they take are far greater than those a regular 
traveller takes.  The equipment and clothing of the soldiers are 
completely disinfected not only on British soil but also at this 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as we found out, the system seems to work.  Some vehicles 
arrived from the U.K., brand new vehicles that had never been to 
a rural area.  They got as far as Montreal and were discovered to 
have mud on them.  Our people, wisely, said it was unacceptable 
and sent the vehicles back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a call from the British High Commission today.  They are 
sensitive to the fact that I have Suffield in my riding.  They 
said they were sorry and that it would never happen again. 
Apparently the vehicles were driven from the U.K. base on a 
lowboy trailer.  As they drove to the port to be loaded on to the 
ships some mud splashed on them.  It should have been dealt with 
at the port and that would have been the end of it. Unfortunately 
the vehicles got as far as Canada, but our people caught the 
problem and wisely turned everything around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the clothing was disinfected.  Everything else was done 
right.  The system did work and we are assured the British will 
be more careful in the future and not let it happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to offer common sense ways to deal with the issue. 
We urge the government to ensure the measures it has announced 
are implemented, because if they are not there is a potential for 
real problems.  We certainly do not want see that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to participate in this emergency debate, 
a debate that has far reaching implications for the Alberta 
livestock industry and all parts of the economy of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of weeks ago we had the supply motion on the state of 
agriculture.  A lot of my research for the talk tonight was done 
in preparation for that supply motion.  I am happy to say that a 
lot of positive things have happened and that we have seen the 
government move on this non-partisan issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has reacted to some degree to the concerns 
brought forward by agriculture and other affected groups in the 
country.  However we always wonder if it is enough.  It is a 
fearful disease but we believe, as my hon. colleague for Medicine 
Hat said, that we can minimize the threat by taking proper 
precautions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the forth time I have stood in the House to voice the 
concerns of my constituents who have called and written my office 
on a daily basis.  To say there have been hundreds of calls would 
not be an exaggeration.  The letters and phone calls that have 
poured into my office, and the people who have visited in person, 
have all expressed absolute horror and fear about this infectious 
livestock disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I welcome tonight's debate I have reservations, given 
the lateness of the hour, about how effective it will be in 
disseminating this important and necessary information.  I 
challenge members from all sides of the House, particularly those 
who live in predominantly rural Canada where the business sector 
relies on a strong livestock industry, to take the debate to the 
constituencies, to their home towns and to townhall meetings to 
meet the people who are most concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I took the initiative and arranged townhall meetings 
throughout my constituency beginning next Wednesday in Stettler, 
which is the most central location in my riding.  That evening 
guest speakers will include a representative from the cattlemen's 
association and an import-export specialist from the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT137"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government.  Tonight we heard a number of members 
say they did not want to be partisan on the issue.  There were 
reservations about the government allowing the Canadian food 
inspection agent to come to my riding.  However he has been 
granted the go ahead and will be coming to Stettler on April 11. 
On the following evening of April 12 he will be in Camrose, the 
largest urban riding in my constituency of Crowfoot, for another 
educational forum on this infectious disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best and the most effective way to reach the people of 
Canada and our constituents is to go to them.  We cannot conduct 
a two way dialogue in the House with the people who are most 
impacted by the decisions we make and the courses we chart.  Our 
constituents may have specific questions and very plausible 
solutions.  The only way to hear their opinions and address their 
concerns is to meet them in person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all members of the House to follow the lead and 
host townhall meetings during the breaks.  I encourage them to 
put the disease at the forefront of newsletters to their 
constituents and point out the seriousness and the threat it 
presents to the Canadian cattle industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated on more than one occasion in the House, and in 
local papers throughout my riding during the last couple of 
weeks, farmers are plagued with problems that negatively impact 
their industry and their ability to produce safe and fine quality 
foods.  We certainly do not need to import a problem that could 
decimate an already fragile agricultural sector.  Precautions 
must be taken to stop foot and mouth disease from entering this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have just stated, I receive on a daily basis constituents 
from throughout my riding who express their concerns about the 
disease.  I empathize and share their anxiety.  The largest 
portion of Alberta's agricultural income comes from the cattle 
industry.  It would be absolutely devastating to the financial 
well-being of our province and our country if this virus were to 
attack our cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would go far beyond the cattle industry.  It would affect the 
whole economy of the country.  It would affect the entire 
agricultural sector.  It would affect tourism.  It would affect 
the rural way of life.  It would affect the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of my colleagues have already noted, according to 
livestock industry experts the estimated cost of an outbreak of 
this disease could be higher than $20 billion in the first year 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fight the 1952 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 
Saskatchewan, which affected only 42 farms, we had to put down 
1,300 cattle, 300 pigs and 100 sheep.  The cost to the Canadian 
taxpayer and the federal government was $1 million.  In today's 
economy the cost would be close to $7 million for the same 42 
farms, and we would be unlikely to contain it to 42 farms.  In my 
constituency there are more than 42 farms in some of the smaller 
counties alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations food agency has cautioned that no country is 
completely safe from foot and mouth disease.  This is due to a 
number of factors such as increased international trade, 
increased international tourism, and the movement of animals and 
animal products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago the huge concern in my riding was with the 
military coming in.  The military has understood the concerns 
about the disease and has reacted to them.  It has listened to 
people's concerns and has moved to rectify the problem.  However 
we still need to take precautions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease was, according to news reports and the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, confirmed in the United Kingdom 
on February 20.  It was confirmed in France and Argentina on 
March 13.  Since that time it has moved into the Netherlands and 
Saudi Arabia and the whole of continental Europe. 
Foot and mouth disease is extremely serious.  It is one of the 
most contagious of all animal diseases which causes losses in the 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian animals are very susceptible according to the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency.  If an outbreak occurred, the virus could 
spread rapidly to all parts of the country through routine 
livestock movement.  Unless detected early and eradicated 
immediately, losses could reach billions of dollars in the first 
year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about wildlife.  The member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands spoke about the deer, elk and bison and what 
would happen if infections were carried in them.  They would 
remain like a reservoir for the virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Canadian Cattlemen's Association was here in 
Ottawa.  I had the pleasure of meeting with Dave Salverson, 
Wilbur Stewart, Kevin Boone, Arno Doerksen and others from 
Camrose who were very concerned about the outbreak of foot and 
mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canadian ranchers are nervous about the potential of a 
Canadian outbreak, but their largest fear is that even if it was 
to come into continental North America, the United States, the 
borders would be closed.  Protectionism would come in and it 
would negatively affect the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 50% of our beef exports destined to the United States, 
western cattlemen say their industry would take a huge hit if 
their market was closed.  The cattle industry is one of the 
bright spots of Canadian agriculture.  We enjoy extremely good 
beef prices such as we have not seen for a long time.  Roughly 
one in two Canadian steers heads to external markets.  Canada 
does not have a domestic demand like the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect and safeguard the disease from coming in.  I 
implore the government to take every precaution necessary and to 
ensure that those precautions are stringently being enforced to 
prevent foot and mouth disease from entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do without causing the whole country to break into 
fear?  First, we need to be sure that the public is educated.  We 
need to see posters.  Every person travelling internationally 
needs to have a brochure to understand this type of disease.  We 
need to be sure that travellers understand the ramifications of 
breaking the law and bringing in, as the hon. member from the 
other side said, meat and dairy products from other countries. 
They need to understand that it is severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also implore the government to have a plan ready that the 
cattle industry would understand.  It would help people to 
realize that they have a government that is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can combat the disease and we can prevent it from coming into 
the country by taking safeguards.  We need to minimize the 
threat, but we need to realize how severe it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week is Emergency Preparedness Week.  Communities will be 
discussing recovery plans from severe weather, fire, flood and 
other things, but there is nothing that may have as large an 
impact on society as this disease.  We cannot afford to wait. We 
must be prepared if it strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member who brought the debate to the House tonight. 
I believe it is the issue that many Canadians see on the media 
every night.  I appreciate the motion as it was brought forward 
and the opportunity to come to the House to speak to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in view of the late hour I will only speak for a few 
minutes.  It is a very serious issue and I appreciate that many 
members have participated in the emergency debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make sure that my colleagues on all sides of the House 
realize that in my northern Ontario riding of Algoma—Manitoulin 
there is a lot of 
agriculture.  There are dairy farmers in the Algoma district, the 
western areas of the Sudbury district near Massey, the Lee Valley 
area, and over to Manitoulin Island.  We have a surprisingly 
large number of dairy farmers. In addition others raise 
beef cattle. 
On top of that vast tracts of land in my riding are a habitat to 
moose and deer.  The tragedy of the foot and mouth disease raging 
in the U.K. right now hopefully will never reach our shores.  If 
it does, we have to protect, not only domestic animals that are 
husbanded by our farmers but the wildlife which is also our 
responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I received some comments from constituents such as Mr. and Mrs. 
Hoback of Thessalon who expressed their concern.  Bill Orford, 
a farmer on Manitoulin Island, has also expressed concern.  They 
wonder whether we should close our borders to tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure we are at that stage yet but I think the 
government is prepared to look seriously at the problem and we 
will see what happens.  We know we need to protect our 
agriculture and the tourism industries.  We have a very 
responsible government.  I am sure that members on all sides are 
will put partisanship aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we witness the unfolding of this crisis in Europe, England 
and Argentina it is something like a volcano.  We cannot plan for 
volcanoes but when they happen they come fast and furiously. 
Hopefully this will not be a volcano but it could well be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say a few words in support of the government's 
efforts so far to protect Canadians, Canadian agriculture and 
Canadian wildlife.  Today we saw a British ship, which was 
bringing in equipment in support of some British troops training 
at Suffield, turned back because the equipment had soil on its 
tracks and tires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes the matter very seriously and I am pleased 
to participate, albeit briefly, late this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  There being no 
further members rising, I therefore declare the motion carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 11.17 p.m.)
