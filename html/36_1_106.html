</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I ask for your patience this morning.  I have a large 
number of petitions to present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first grouping there are 74 pages to this petition with 
the signatures of 1,819 concerned Canadians from Ontario, 
Alberta, Manitoba and my home province of Saskatchewan. They are 
concerned that by ratifying and implementing the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child that government bureaucrats 
and the courts will be legally entitled to determine what is in 
the best interests of the child, not parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners feel parental rights and responsibilities are 
being undermined by government implementation of this UN 
convention and they request parliament to address their concerns 
by adding protection of parental rights and responsibilities to 
the charter of rights and freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the second group of petitions that I am pleased to 
present there are 48 pages with 1,134 signatures of citizens from 
Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia and British Columbia calling for 
the repeal of Bill C-68, the Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners have asked me to keep a running total of 
repeal Bill C-68 petitions that I have introduced.  These year I 
have introduced 139 pages with 3,409 signatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians are concerned that the government is spending 
hundreds of millions of dollars registering more than 18 million 
legally owned guns while the number of police officers per capita 
has dropped to its lowest level since 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore these petitioners request parliament to repeal Bill 
C-68, the Firearms Act, and spend their hard earned tax dollars 
on more cost effective crime fighting measures such as putting 
more police on our streets and highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the next group of petitions there are 24 pages with 
the signatures of 603 concerned Canadians from Ontario, Nova 
Scotia, Manitoba and British Columbia.  These petitioners believe 
that many thousands of the more than one hundred thousand 
abortions a year in Canada are medically unnecessary and actually 
increase health risks for women undergoing this procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners request parliament support my motion, M-268, 
which would require a binding national referendum at the time of 
the next election to ask voters whether they are in favour of 
government funding for medically unnecessary abortions.

pleased, Mr. Speaker, to present four petitions comprised of 30 
pages with 710 signatures of concerned Canadians from Ontario, 
Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians are concerned that there is no provision in the 
charter of rights and freedoms that prevents government from 
taking anything they own without compensation and nothing in the 
charter which restricts the government in any way from passing 
laws which prohibit the ownership, use and enjoyment of their 
private property or reduces the value of their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners request parliament to support private member's 
Bill C-304 which would strengthen the protection of property 
rights in federal law.

signatures of my constituents of Yorkton, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These constituents are concerned that the public is not being 
protected under the current Young Offenders Act.  They are 
concerned that young offenders who commit crimes such as murder, 
arson, rape and robbery do not get adequate punishment under the 
current act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore these petitioners call on parliament to bring in new 
and tougher laws for young offenders and also request better 
enforcement of these laws.

Speaker, I am pleased to present my last petition with 36 
signatures of citizens from the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners are concerned that the Canadian Wheat Board 
exercises its monopoly power in a discriminatory manner by 
forcing only prairie producers to sell their grain to the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call on parliament to either scrap Bill C-4 or support the 
following amendments.  Change the object of the act to maximize 
financial returns to the producers, remove the inclusion and 
exclusion clause, allow producers to opt in or out for fixed 
periods, allow the auditor general to conduct annual audits and 
allow producers to get information under the Access to

continue to exist on earth and that these weapons pose a threat 
to the health and survival of human civilization and the global 
environment.

Burnaby—Douglas and members of the Richmond riding of the New

</I></B></P><P align=left>They note the multilateral agreement on investment will 
disproportionately expand and entrench unprecedented rights to 
transnational corporations and foreign investors at the expense 
of the Canadian government's ability to direct investment policy 
as a tool for the benefit of all Canadians.

the Animal Defence League. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refers to the very low penalties currently in place for 
deliberately causing pain and injury to an animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls on the Government of Canada to impose harsher penalties

</I></B></P><P align=left>It urges parliament to establish peace tax legislation by 
passing into law my private member's bill, the conscientious 
objection act, which recognizes the right of conscientious 
objectors to not pay for the military and within which the 
government would declare its commitment to apply that portion of 
their taxes that was to be used for military purposes toward 
peaceful purposes such as peace education, war relief and 
humanitarian and environmental aid and housing.

many already presented on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, residents of West Kootenay—Okanagan, draw to 
the attention of parliament that violent crimes committed by 
youth are of great concern to Canadians, that the incidence of 
violent crimes by youth would decrease if the Young Offenders Act 
were amended to hold young persons fully accountable, and 
increase periods of incarceration to deter young people from 
committing criminal acts; therefore your petitioners call upon 
parliament to significantly amend the Young Offenders Act to

petition we will hear that.

would like to have the age limit lowered, have longer periods of 
incarceration for individuals who commit violent crimes, to hold 
them more accountable and also to hold the parents more 
accountable when they contribute to the crime by not giving 
proper attention to their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two petitions today.  The first has to do with the subject 
matter of misuse of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are from a number of parts of Canada including 
from my riding of Mississauga South.  They would like to draw to 
the attention of the House that the Food and Drugs Act is 
designed to protect Canadians from the harmful effects related to 
food and drug consumption and that the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages may cause health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically they point out that fetal alcohol syndrome and 
alcohol related birth defects are 100% preventable by avoiding 
alcohol consumption during pregnancy and generally, that 
consumption of alcohol impairs a person's ability to operate 
machinery or an automobile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to mandate the 
labelling of alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers and 
others of the risks of alcohol consumption.

the second petition has to do with the family.

that managing the family home and caring for preschool children 
is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.

National Forum on Health which cites that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who choose to provide direct 
parental care to children in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate that tax discrimination against families 
who choose to provide direct parental care to preschool children 
in the family home.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 21 has been absolutely languishing now for eight 
months.  In the name of patience it would be nice to know from 
the government if it intends to answer this question, let alone 
when. I have raised this countless times.  I would like to know 
when we might expect to get an answer to this very 
straightforward question.

has repeatedly sought an answer to this question.  I can assure 
him that it will answered.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to 
provide strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian 
Forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity 
to put forward the following motion that be it resolved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to 
provide strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian 
Forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have this opportunity to put forward the motion, 
but it gives me no pleasure that this government has created a 
situation where a motion such as this one needs to be put 
forward.  It gives me no pleasure.  It gives the Tory party no 
pleasure.  It gives Canadians no pleasure that this government 
has failed to provide strong political leadership to the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth can no longer be hidden.  Everybody in this country 
knows that the Prime Minister abuses the forces.  Nobody knows it 
more than the men and women who serve Canada in Canadian forces 
uniforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate will show how this government's failure has 
resulted in the terrible living conditions for members of the 
Canadian forces.  We will demonstrate how this government's 
failure has resulted in inadequate health care for members of 
Canada's forces. 
Today's debate will show how this government has failed to 
provide proper equipment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things have resulted in deplorable morale in the 
Canadian forces.  That is not leadership.  For these reasons this 
House must condemn the government for failing to provide strong 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I have completed my opening remarks members from the 
government and maybe even the minister himself will give a list 
of great achievements by the government. They will tell this 
House that they have bought new search and rescue helicopters and 
new submarines for the navy.  They will announce how they are in 
the process of overhauling the military justice system with Bill 
C-25 which at this very moment is in committee. They will talk 
and talk but that is what this government is very good at, 
talking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to draw the attention of all members of this 
House to what the government is not saying. This government must 
recognize these shortcomings. It must recognize problems such as 
poor living conditions, inadequate health care and low morale, 
and it must take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1994 defence white paper, the government wrote: “Defence 
policy must respond not only to an uncertain and unstable world 
abroad, but also to challenging circumstances at home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party strongly believes that we must recognize the efforts 
made by our forces in times of peace, and particularly in times 
of war, to defend Canada, its honour, its interests and its way 
of life. We must recognize that contribution by leading the 
Canadian forces into the 21st century, because they are the ones 
who are carrying the torch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forces have been criticized a lot over the last few years. 
While the Prime Minister, referring to the Somalia inquiry, said 
that everybody can make a mistake, he did not address the 
problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the Prime Minister has looked for quick and easy 
solutions to the problems that need real attention.  He disbanded 
the airborne regiment and the problems grew.  He disbanded the 
Somalia inquiry before it had a chance to finish its job.  That 
is not leadership.  The problems continue to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1994 defence white paper committed to combat capable forces. 
The government made that decision to have combat capable forces. 
However to make those forces effective and truly combat capable, 
the Prime Minister is ignoring the problems the Canadian forces 
are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with the House my experiences and the 
experiences of the members of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs as we travelled across this country 
from base to base.  We covered a lot of bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to talk about equipping our forces.  I am sure my 
colleagues in the House have read recent reports on how our 
soldiers are trying to do their jobs when they do not have the 
most basic equipment.  Recently there was a cover story in 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine with the headline “Fighting Mad”.  I 
am talking about uniforms and boots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee visited the base at Petawawa the commander of 
the Royal Canadian Dragoons was wearing a one-piece jumpsuit 
instead of his regular kit.  He said it was because he could see 
right through his regular uniform and did not see a new uniform 
coming. When we talk about equipment we have to consider major 
purchases as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Prime Minister spent $500 million to cancel a helicopter 
contract in 1993.  One year later the 1994 defence white paper 
stated that the forces desperately need that helicopter.  What I 
am speaking about right now is the replacement for the 30-year 
old Sea King helicopter which flies off the back of our brand new 
frigates.  That was in 1994 and now it is 1998. This government 
spent $500 million cancelling a contract and there are still no 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should think that the government paid only $500 million. 
This government is still paying and paying dearly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited Shearwater last week and was amazed to see the Sea 
King helicopters on the maintenance floor completely torn apart. 
I wondered what had happened that the helicopter needed such 
extensive repairs.  I was told that the helicopter needed 70 
hours of maintenance work for every one hour in the air.  That 
does not sound very efficient to me. The helicopter through its 
regular life was supposed to have eleven and a half hours of 
maintenance for every one hour.  Even that would seem high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, the pilots are afraid to fly them.  They are not 
coming out in public and saying this, but when one talks to them. 
And their hair is turning white.  If one motor fails, it is a 
chance whether or not they get back. Why are new helicopters not 
being ordered?  Our guys are doing a super job keeping these 
things in the air but the Prime Minister is not giving them any 
help.  He does not give them any leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all I want to talk about this morning.  I feel it is 
my responsibility to tell the House about the inadequate health 
care the government provides to men and women in the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that doctors on military bases can treat 
soldiers but cannot treat soldiers' families.  This creates 
problems that are simply not necessary.  In fact the base doctors 
I have spoken to who are trained as family doctors want to 
practise family medicine.  Instead, because they are not allowed 
to treat the families of soldiers, they end up dealing only with 
the soldiers themselves and their particular medical and 
psychological problems. If the House needs further evidence, I 
will read from the testimony of a Canadian forces member who came 
before the committee in Halifax: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My name is Michael Robert Innes.  I was released from the 
military on a 3A medical category on December 23, 1997 stating 
that I was unfit for military service or any environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a decision from the Charlottetown medical review board 
that my illness is attributable to my service in a special duty 
area in Croatia, the former Yugoslavia.  Subsection 21.1 of the 
pension act provides entitlement for a disability that is 
attributed to, was incurred during or aggravated by your military 
service.  I receive 25% of this decision currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of my life has been affected to the point where I 
cannot work, ride a bike, play hockey, go camping, swimming, 
rough house with my kids, household chores.  God bless washing 
dishes.  These are things I used to take for granted. Showering, 
getting dressed is difficult for me.  The physical activity is 
painful, debilitating and affects every area of my life. I limit 
my activities and try not to let the illness regress to the point 
of being bedridden because it happens very easily and it is 
harder to come back each time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family as well as myself had to make adjustments in our 
lifestyles dealing with limitations of this illness. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Innes cannot get his full benefits because although he 
was released from the military because of his disability, he has 
been denied his claim because he does not meet the definition of 
disabled.  This makes very little sense. The government closes 
its eyes.  It provides no leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact as the committee travelled from base to base I learned 
that soldiers suspect that when the government no longer wants 
them, after 20 years normally, it just lets them go.  It usually 
finds a medical excuse to use to get rid of them.  It gets rid of 
these soldiers because they are past their prime. Soldiers who 
expected to learn a trade in the military find that their skills 
are not recognized outside and life only becomes more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Canadian forces mechanic I met explained that he works on 
heavy trucks that are all well over 20 years old.  When he leaves 
the service he told me he will not be able to get a job as a 
mechanic because he does not have a clue how the newer vehicles 
are built today with modern components.  He has no idea how they 
operate, so he is out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should be considering a program to better 
educate our soldiers and perhaps provide them with an option of 
civilian course work under a program that both the soldier and 
the government would pay into.  Has the government proposed 
anything like that?  No.  Why not?  Because it never shows any 
leadership.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about living conditions on bases across Canada. 
In fact it is probably best again if I read from the testimony of 
a witness who came before the committee.  They speak far more 
eloquently on how the government failed than I ever could.  At 
Canadian Forces Base Petawawa, Angela Hulbert explained how she 
lived on the base with her corporal husband in their PMQs, 
private married quarters.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gale force winds blow through our window frames in the 
wintertime.  We have to chip the ice off the inside of all our 
windows.  Our furnaces run steady just to keep the house 
liveable.  Actually, it is not liveable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My kitchen cupboards are on the outside wall.  I can actually 
freeze things in them, so we do not need a beer fridge because we 
have a beer cupboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have such bad mould and mildew on our window sills, the water 
runs off it constantly and makes big patches of paint and gyprock 
come off the walls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we decorate the place ourselves just to make it liveable, we 
have to put it all back the way it was when we leave.  I do not 
consider dirt-white liveable.  We like to decorate a little bit 
and then we have to change it all back to dirt-white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a river that runs through our basement every spring. 
They tell us that we do not pay for our basements, so it does not 
matter what condition they are in.  We do not have a storage 
closet, so we have to use the basement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we showed up in Halifax, the whole thing had changed a bit. 
Then they were receiving letters saying that the Canadian Forces 
Housing Association is now charging $30 to $40 because now they 
consider that the basements are usable.  Maybe they consider they 
have indoor swimming pools.  She also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our washers and driers are down there.  I do not think it is good 
for my appliances when they are sitting in at least six inches of 
water for part of the day or two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask for something to be done and of course they are either 
coming or they say they will call us in a few days.  We don't 
hear from them and they figure we'll just forget it, I guess. 
They never show up.  They never call back.  If you call them 
back, they just say they are coming.  A couple of years go by and 
they are still coming.  I do not think any other landlord would 
get away with this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this acceptable to the House?  Is this the way the men and 
women who protect Canada deserve to live?  Is this right?  I do 
not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say more about the horrid living conditions but I hope 
the House gets the idea.  Our soldiers and their families are 
living in terrible conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now these have been secrets the Prime Minister has refused 
to share with the public.  Canadians have to know and they are 
starting to know that men and women who serve in Canada are not 
properly respected and do not have the proper political 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut the defence budget by 30% in the last 
five years.  That is taking its toll.  It is taking its toll on 
equipment.  It is taking its toll on training.  As the defence 
committee travelled from base to base this spring, we found it is 
taking its toll on the simple quality of life that my party 
believes soldiers all through our forces should enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have become so desperate, something called the Canadian 
forces personal support agency has been set up within the 
Department of National Defence, mandated to provide for the 
morale and welfare of the men and women of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will they achieve this?  They will sell space, just like a 
hockey rink.  The Department of National Defence will sell space 
for corporate logos.   We will be the only NATO country that 
instead of our flag painted on our trucks and helicopters—we do 
not have them yet—we will see a big logo that says “Drink 
Coca-Cola”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about McDonald's? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Everybody will have a chance.  If that 
is the best leadership that the Prime Minister can provide, the 
House must condemn the government for its failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government expects Canada's forces to jump when the 
Prime Minister gives the word and while the dedicated people who 
make up the Canadian forces will always respond when the 
government calls, the government abuses the dedication of the 
forces to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of a more disgusting waste of talented and 
dedicated men and women than to abuse their dedication by not 
providing them with equipment, training and resources they need 
to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government continues this trend of abusing the 
Canadian military there will come a time when the Prime Minister 
says “Okay, boys, it is time to go”, and the response will be 
“I am sorry, sir, we cannot do the job”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer will come not because they will not want to perform 
that particular mission, not because they do not want to come to 
the aid of Canada, but because their government has let them down 
and they no longer have the resources to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That day will come sooner than we think because the government 
refuses to show the smallest ounce of leadership and do its 
fundamental job to protect Canadians.  For that the government 
must be condemned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is best to close with the words of Marguerita Bargiel 
who came before the committee at CFB Petawawa.  Her husband has 
been in the Canadian forces for over 20 years and she was a 
military brat before too.  She is somebody with a long 
experience.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This stinks.  Let me tell you, I'm not too impressed with the 
whole system.  I'm fed up.  I guess I'm not the only one.  You do 
your best and you get screwed.  That's the way it is these days 
in the Canadian forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to my hon. colleague, whom I had the pleasure of 
working with on the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs, which he referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed pretty much the same things he did. I think the main 
concern right now in the Canadian forces is pay. Our military 
feel they are underpaid, and I agree. In addition, for 
non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, opportunities for 
advancement are practically nil. The organization is top heavy, 
which is unusual nowadays. That is another problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to equipment, I agree with him that we need state 
of the art equipment meeting current military requirements. I 
think that, for the next little while at least, governments will 
have to balance spending between human resources, military 
equipment and military training. These three budgetary items 
must, unfortunately, be kept under tight control at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what personal thoughts the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead has on this issue of financial resources 
apportioning for the purchase and use of equipment, for human 
resources, military pay, severance pay and so on, and finally 
for training military personnel, exercices conducted on land, on 
sea and in the air. Does he have any idea how these funds should 
be apportioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I did not talk about salaries, which is also another 
problem. It was one of the main issues raised during our tour 
across the country. I am convinced that we will hear more about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I did briefly, the hon. member also raised the issues of 
training and of how personnel are treated. I briefly mentioned 
that the problem has to do with the possibility of getting an 
education. People join the army and most of them stay for 20 
years. Then they leave without a profession to fall back on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you a specific example. Let us assume that a person 
is a licensed electrician in the armed forces. When that person 
leaves the forces and tries to find a job anywhere in the 
country, his licence from the military is not worth anything. 
That person has to start from scratch again and serve an 
apprenticeship of at least four years to become an electrician, 
when he is already one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about mechanics, whose situation is exactly 
the same.

share, as is the case in the United States. What they do down 
there is a good example, because they have a fund to which 
soldiers contribute so that, at the end of their stint, they can 
attend university or an apprentice school. They have that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about maintaining a balance between equipment 
and personnel, and I definitely agree with him that our soldiers 
are getting the short end of the stick. General Baril said there 
would be no trade-off. I do not know how he is going to do it, 
but he will definitely need more money. It is not possible to 
achieve both, but we have no choice. There is clearly a shortage 
of personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military personnel need proper equipment and clothing to do 
their job properly. A significant amount was budgeted for 
clothing, but the clothes have yet to arrive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, having 
attended one of the SCONDVA meetings and having heard from 
numerous veterans and members of the present military, morale 
seems to be a big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fine men and women go away and serve our country.  They 
are separated from their families for a very long time.  They are 
faced with keeping a family together yet they have to do it from 
thousands of miles away.  These families incur huge phone bills 
just to be able to be in touch with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from one lady who spoke about the fact that when they 
started speaking by phone the phone bill was hundreds of dollars. 
Instead of having quality family time they were fighting about 
the high cost of the phone bill and what it would do to their 
very limited budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my hon. colleague see as a solution?  What about 
possibly looking at some kind of toll free line that military 
people could use when they are on extended tours of duty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  Unfortunately at this point I have to get ahead of 
the minister.  A lot of that problem has been solved.  There have 
been some good moves made toward that.  General Baril has opened 
a line in Bosnia where people can call back every day if they 
wish.  I see the minister smiling; he is happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one point.  Look at all the points we could have 
gained.  There are still some problems to be looked.  We had some 
problems with the ships in Halifax but they are working on 
addressing them right now.  A lot of work is being done with 
Internet so they can work with e-mail.  The problem we did hear 
about it is that in many cases these people do not have the funds 
to purchase a computer and therefore cannot get e-mail. The 
family resources centre has purchased some computers and they 
actually have a 24 hour service set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That problem is being addressed, but it has taken a long time to 
get to that point when the technology has been there for quite a 
while.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the last

special division of 14,000 troops that would form an elite corps

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B> Mr. Speaker, the underlying problem here is the 
lack of money.  A lot of time is invested in training people to 
go to Bosnia, for example, where one group is going in June. 
They get training and then they come back here afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not enough time between deployments.  They do not have 
enough time to be properly trained and to set up a proper team. 
But the major problem in all of this is always money.  They do 
not have enough equipment either.  This sort of project requires 
the latest highly specialized equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad, because we are always working with big forces, 
like those of the Americans and the English, who are well 
equipped.  We do a very good job with what we have, but we 
cannot keep doing it.  Things keep deteriorating.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that when you 
point a finger at somebody there are three of them pointing back 
at you.  I think that is particularly appropriate for the 
Conservative Party today because there are three fingers pointing 
back at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the conditions they have talked about today are ones 
that were in place when they held the reign of power in this 
country.  When Brian Mulroney and his Conservative government 
were in power we had problems with all of the areas they are 
talking about.  And that is exactly what they are doing.  Talk, 
talk, talk.  Yadda, yadda, yadda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this government that in fact is taking action to rectify 
these problems.  We are providing the leadership that is 
necessary to prepare our Canadian forces for the new millennium, 
to comply with the requirements of the defence white paper, to 
provide the kind of support for our forces personnel and their 
families and to help provide for a quality of life for them that 
they rightly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative defence critic said there had been a 30% 
reduction over the last four years.  That is quite true.  Our 
defence department has been cut 30% in its purchasing power and 
23% in actual dollars.  It has gone from just over $12 billion 
down to $9.4 billion.  Yes, the defence department and the 
Canadian forces, together with every other department and every 
other program of the federal government, has had to contribute to 
deficit reduction. Why?  Because of the big deficit we inherited 
from Brian Mulroney and the Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They virtually put the economy and the fiscal condition of this 
country into ruin.  The first priority of this government was to 
put the country on a proper fiscal course to be able to provide 
the kinds of jobs that our economy is now providing.  We have 
lower interest rates.  Inflation is under control.  We have a 
balanced budget.  Because of what we inherited from that 
government we had to absorb a lot of cuts in defence as well as 
in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about helicopters.  They botched that 
arrangement as well.  They were going out, when the country had a 
$42 billion deficit, and buying expensive developmental 
helicopters with all the bells and whistles, things that were 
relevant to the cold war period which they did not seem to 
recognize as being over.  They were spending a lot of money for 
equipment; money that we did not have at that time because of the 
deficit situation they put us into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have bought search and rescue helicopters.  We will replace 
the Sea King with a new maritime helicopter.  We will do it at a 
cheaper price with off the shelf equipment which is more 
appropriate for our needs and cheaper than what they were going 
to provide.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to dealing with the issues that face our forces 
personnel and their families, the pay, the living conditions, the 
housing conditions and all of the other things, there is nobody 
who is more committed than I am in seeing that these problems are 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of this government, because that is what this 
government wants to do, I went to the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  At the very first meeting 
I told them “This government wants to deal with these issues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had visited a number of different bases during the summer, 
within two or three months of being appointed Minister of 
National Defence, and I heard a number of stories.  I told the 
committee, made up of members of all parties, to go to the 
different bases and communities and listen to what our forces 
personnel and their families have to say about the challenges 
they meet.  How are they coping?  Are they having difficulties in 
terms of pay levels or housing?  What about the postings which 
result in them frequently being moved from one part of the 
country to another?  Families face difficulties when they are at 
home and forces personnel are overseas, sometimes in some rather 
dangerous conditions.  All of these things are important to this 
government.  It is important that we address them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very first meeting of the committee I asked members to 
address those matters.  I said at the time that I needed to have 
a stronger understanding on the part of all members of 
parliament, on the part of the government and the Canadian public 
as to the challenges our forces personnel and their families are 
facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard from the member this morning is of course what I 
heard previously and what others are now hearing in the standing 
committee.  The reason those hearings are being held is because 
of the leadership of this government and the desire to get to the 
bottom of these issues and the desire to take corrective action 
to make sure that our forces personnel have a quality of life, a 
standard of living, that is befitting of the great service they 
provide to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we hear today is a regurgitation of what we have heard 
from the public.  What suggestions do those members have?  They 
do not have any suggestions at all.  They ridicule every other 
idea. They even criticized the idea of trying to get sponsorship 
for various non-public activities, non-core activities of the 
military.  They got it all wrong in the course of doing it.  We 
are not about to put “Drink Coke” on our tanks or on our 
armoured personnel carriers, or submarine sandwiches on our 
submarines.  They know that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that what we are talking about are things like tattoos 
or the Snow Birds performances, all of which are not part of the 
core activities, but are areas where we do require some 
sponsorship, tastefully done I might add.  It will not be done 
with the kind of advertising logos they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been going on for several years.  There is nothing new 
about this.  It is an appropriate way of getting sponsorship for 
the things that are not part of the core activities of the 
Canadian military.  Those things that are core, which require 
public funding, will continue to be handled out of public funds 
in the traditional way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got that all wrong.  The other thing he was wrong about was 
our allies.  They all do it.  When the United States sends 
entertainers abroad they get sponsorship.  They are all doing the 
same kind of thing, but it is those additional things that also 
help, whether it is the Snow Birds or a tattoo, to give the 
public a better understanding and appreciation of the skills and 
the talents that our forces personnel have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tragic as the events of the Saguenay, the Red River and the 
ice storm have been, they have also given the Canadian public a 
better understanding and appreciation of what our forces 
personnel are all about and the kind of professionalism they 
bring.  In concert with that professionalism, this government is 
providing leadership to make sure those forces are ready for the 
next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are bringing about institutional changes.  We have agreed 
with more than 80% of the Somalia commission report.  We 
appointed a new chief of defence staff and overhauled many of the 
senior positions within the Canadian defence upper echelons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought into the House the most extensive amendments to 
the defence act since its creation 50 years ago.  They did not 
bring any amendments to the defence act.  We are overhauling the 
military justice system to make sure we have an appropriate 
system for the new millennium.  We have had reports on our 
reserves and we are implementing those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases we are not even waiting for the reports. We are 
taking action now.  The 9% increase in pay is an example of 
something we are doing now.  The retirement allowance for the 
reserve forces is also something we are doing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Institutional changes and reforms are being carried out and 
monitored by a former Speaker of the House, the hon. John Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purchase of the helicopters, the submarines and the armoured 
personnel carriers are all decisions that came out of the white 
paper.  The things they did not do and did not do properly we are 
carrying out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also improved communications, as I think even the hon. 
member has admitted, both between the forces and the public and 
within the forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just a quick thumbnail sketch of a lot of things that 
other speakers I hope will get a chance to talk about further, 
but it clearly shows that when they point their finger there are 
three pointing back at them for their inadequacies during the 
time they were in government.  This government is showing solid 
leadership. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, every chance he 
gets, our colleague, the Minister of National Defence, says the 
Conservative Party, always the Conservative Party, is the one 
responsible for everything that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things that need to be remembered, if one wants 
to be objective.  For instance, the matter of the debt, which 
will take but a few seconds. Let us talk about the period from 
1970 to 1984. In 1970, the debt stood at some $15 to $18 
billion.  The Liberals multiplied it tenfold.  By the time we 
took office in 1984, the debt had reached $200 billion.  Instead 
of multiplying it by 11, we doubled it.  That is a considerable 
slowdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, however, we knew the deficit had to be controlled, 
so we adopted tax reform measures. 
Moreover, free trade, against which you voted, has freed up 
considerably more money to reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister, since his choices are 
supposedly always the wisest possible, how it happens that, 
having suspended the helicopter purchase contract, negotiated at 
the time for $33 million, he is now bragging about the same 
purchase, but at $40 million plus, without considering that 
there was absolutely nothing set aside for R&D, and nothing for 
maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they pay 20% to 25% more for helicopters and try to 
convince us that the wait was worthwhile, after spending $600 
million?  How can he claim that it was worth the wait, and then 
try to boast to us about the purchase? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the 
Conservatives are not very good at figures, given the way they 
ran up the deficit, and they seem to have a hard time recognizing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They equally have a very difficult time coming to grips with the 
helicopter purchase.  They fail to understand that they were 
proposing helicopters at a time when we could not afford them. 
They were military development helicopters which meant that a lot 
more money was going to go into the development stage before they 
would fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are buying off the shelf helicopters that are already 
commercially certified in search and rescue which do not have all 
of the costs associated with them which their proposal had.  We 
have ended up buying helicopters, and subsequently the maritime 
helicopters, at 30% less than what they would have paid.  That 
was a shame.  The taxpayers could not afford that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased about the search and rescue helicopters that 
we are buying.  Yes, they are a cousin of the helicopter that was 
in its developmental stage, but getting it off the shelf and 
commercially certified is a lot cheaper.  This helicopter will 
meet our requirements, which was the most important aspect of 
this purchase.  It went through a very rigorous test and an 
extensive examination to ensure that it was the helicopter to 
best meet our operational needs and to do it at a price that was 
affordable to the Canadian public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more important is to note that buying it now as we have, we 
bought it at a time that we could afford it.  We got rid of that 
big deficit which we inherited from the Conservative government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to address the comments of the minister about debt, and also the 
Conservative Party, I do not think either one of those parties 
can claim to be on the high ground in that area.  After all there 
is a $600 billion debt.  The Conservatives added $250 billion. 
The Liberals trashed the taxpayer by adding another $100 billion 
since they have come into office.  Nobody can claim the high 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking about the military, I just came out of committee on 
Bill C-25.  It became evident on how undemocratic our process 
really is.  This bill is coming from the top down.  I ask the 
minister, in producing a bill and pushing it down to committee, 
why does he not give the committee more power to adjust, make 
amendments and do what is right for the military through that 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe if the member 
goes back to the committee instead of sitting in here he might be 
able to get some amendments put on the table.  We are certainly 
happy to see him discuss the matter at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the National Defence Act amendments, as I indicated 
these are very extensive amendments.  They have come through as a 
result of two things.  A lot of the recommendations in there 
should not be new to the hon. member.  A lot of them came out of 
the Somalia commission report.  All of them virtually mirror the 
report from former Chief Justice Dickson and his committee on the 
military justice system. They are well thought out by people, 
including a former chief justice of Canada, as to the kind of 
updating that is required in the military justice system to 
ensure that it has within it Canadian values and justice 
principles that are also acknowledged in the civilian area as 
being those that are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are updating and streamlining the operations.  If the hon. 
member has some amendments, or his party has some amendments, 
there has been every opportunity to be heard at the committee.  I 
look forward to the committee reporting back to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There seems to be a lot of interest, and we are very attentive in 
the minister's answers to our questions. I would seek unanimous 
consent to prolong the questions and comments so that we can hear 
the hon. minister's reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the questions and comments time on the minister's speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that there is not 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for questions and comments has now expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to stand here today, although I have to say I am 
somewhat surprised that this motion came forth from the fifth 
party, the Conservative Party, from parts of the maritimes and 
from parts of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Parts of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  There are no Conservatives in Alberta. I 
obviously appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say the least, I cannot begin to stress how disappointed I 
have been with the treatment of our Canadian forces and how this 
government has impacted on their well-being and their 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again my surprise is that the motion comes from one of the two 
parties that really contributed to the problems we see in our 
military today. It was the Tories who continued to gut the forces 
during their disastrous tenure in government. 
I do not think they have a whole lot to offer in this debate 
apart from the fact of making it a debate.  I certainly agree 
with them on that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military exists fundamentally to protect the freedoms of our 
country.  It is a proud institution which has distinguished 
itself in two world wars, the Korean war, the gulf war and a 
myriad of other international conflicts.  Our peacekeepers have 
set the international standard for competence, professionalism 
and humanitarianism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the past 30 or so years have seen an increasing 
tendency by the federal government to neglect its 
responsibilities to the Canadian forces.  Decreased funding, 
increased bureaucratization, failing equipment and a decreasing 
standard of living have taken an enormous toll on the morale of 
the forces. I am going to throw in one other item because I 
believe that military justice is a key aspect to morale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we see a two tier system as is present with only some 
tinkering done with Bill C-25 which the government is introducing 
we are not going to see morale improve a whole lot.  I find that 
rather unsettling.  The government has had years to make 
corrections to the military justice system and to the defence act 
and has failed to do so until now.  And when it does so, it is 
superficial to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about decreased funding, increased 
bureaucratization, failing equipment and a decreased standard of 
living having taken its toll on morale there is no question that 
these evils are also cutting into the forces' operational 
capabilities.  Members of the forces are now in the uncomfortable 
and often unrealistic position of being asked to perform duties 
with outdated equipment and with insufficient financial support 
for themselves and for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report released about two or three weeks 
ago clearly puts the military at a disadvantage when it comes to 
their equipment and the way they are being administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Touching briefly on those points, first is decreased funding. 
For too many years successive governments, and the very 
government which ran up higher and higher deficits, cut 
mercilessly into the heart of DND, into the military.  It seemed 
that DND served as the sacrificial lamb whenever governments 
wanted to take an overt demonstration of cutbacks.  It is easy to 
whack somebody who cannot defend themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inefficiencies of the operation continued behind the scenes. 
When it came to showing the public how the government was 
balancing the budget, it was balanced on the backs of those who 
cannot defend themselves.  There are no advocates for the 
military on that side of the House.  None. When the government 
wanted to make this demonstration these cutbacks were always 
deemed as belt tightening.  Unfortunately at some point belt 
tightening became limb amputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election, Reform proposed that the military's 
budget should be preserved at approximately $11 billion.  We 
argued that this was already too low for the military to function 
effectively but we felt that $11 billion was a realistic figure 
which could be justified when compared to other government 
obligations.  We argued that a strong military is an essential 
resource and therefore should be protected along with other 
government necessities.  In other words cuts should come from 
somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the DND budget has been cut to just over $9 billion. 
Now even the auditor general is warning that equipment is getting 
dangerously outdated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy is a term that the 
Liberal side of the House understands to perfection.  Perhaps the 
greatest mistake the Canadian government ever made with respect 
to the forces was folding it into the government bureaucracy and 
treating it as though it were just another government department. 
This had a number of disastrous effects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all it fostered a sense of careerism which had not 
previously existed. Many military leaders that have the military 
and the country at heart have made it very clear to this 
government that this was going to happen.  It refused to listen. 
Suddenly, advancement in bureaucracy replaced advancement in the 
military chain of command.  Kowtowing to bean counting 
bureaucrats became essential for career development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military is not and should never be just another government 
department. The very nature of the military requires that it 
exist outside the bureaucracy but is still accountable to 
parliament, words that are going to be difficult to swallow on 
that side of the House which really does not appreciate many 
democratic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Why don't you talk about what the men 
and women say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  This of course is unsettling to 
bureaucrats and to politicians who want to retain control over 
all aspects of the government. It is control that this government 
really would like to maintain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to listen to the debate that is happening 
here today. My colleague from Calgary Northeast is making some 
excellent points but it is very difficult to hear because of the 
heckling from the other side. It seems to me that the member 
should reserve those comments for debate or questions rather than 
the strong heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The debate is certainly lively and 
has been for a good part of the morning.  If the hon. member 
cannot hear, then he has a valid point.  I know it is important 
that all members be able to hear the debate. The hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast has the floor. I think hon. members might show 
the proper deference to the hon. member while he speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you so much.  That 
would help a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is essential however if the military is to thrive is to 
keep the bureaucrats and the politicians out of the 
administration of the military.  What do they really know?  But 
unfortunately we are looking at a government today that is 
somewhat dictatorial in its viewpoints and likes that control.  I 
have to say that the Liberals have only contributed to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a little bit about the Somalia inquiry.  It 
was in many significant ways an extremely important process. It 
brought to light the need for several positive changes to the 
Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recognition of the need for military justice reform and 
increased accountability throughout the ranks are positive 
results of the inquiry.  Without the Somalia inquiry, the top 
brass in national defence would never have been exposed to the 
glaring light of public accountability. Although restricted again 
by this government not wanting to expose everything, it was 
exposed as to their accountability and they were found wanting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Somalia inquiry also exposed the Liberal 
government's gross arrogance.  In shutting down the inquiry 
prematurely, the Liberals took abuse of power to dangerous new 
heights.  It was the first time an inquiry was ever shut down. 
Never before had a government shut down a public inquiry simply 
because it was embarrassing the very government that commissioned 
the study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the whole Somalia affair also did massive damage 
to the otherwise stellar reputation of the forces.  Just when the 
inquiry was starting to get to the root of the defence 
department's internal problems, the government ended the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly commend the member of the Conservative Party for 
bringing forth this motion.  The debate is worthy and necessary. 
It has to reach heights beyond what it has right now to really 
provide a greater input of information to the public. I commend 
the member on the motion he has presented to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it somewhat ironic to hear the member bringing forward the 
word dictatorial.  Just yesterday in this House I heard the 
Reform member speaking about how lovely democracy is on such a 
controversial debate and how it is working so well in this House 
and the very next day he is saying that there is no democracy and 
that in fact it is dictatorial. 
Maybe they should get their stories straight.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  I would certainly like 
to take this opportunity to make a comment to the minister and to 
offer my sincere appreciation on behalf of the men and women in 
Canadian Forces Base Borden for the excellent job he has done in 
representing their needs, in meeting with them and in trying to 
find proactive ways of handling military issues coming into the 
next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look across the floor I see a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
Members opposite are riding on the backs of men and women in the 
military.  They sat here in the last parliament and constantly 
tore the military apart over the Somalia inquiry, offering no 
positive words of encouragement whatsoever.  Yet today they stand 
here and run off at the mouth about issues that they know very 
little about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to money, I have a question for the hon. member.  In 
1995 the Reform proposed budget suggested slashing $1 billion 
from the armed forces or the defence budget.  I am just wondering 
how the hon. member feels he could better serve the military by 
slashing $1 billion from the men and women in our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member likes to talk 
about verbal diarrhoea but there is only diarrhoea coming from 
one side of the House.  Referring to democratic procedures, they 
are sadly amiss over on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime example of this very undemocratic process is to watch 
the hepatitis C vote.  How many members had to kowtow to that 
front line and their leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  To suggest that somebody in the House has diarrhoea is 
absolutely outlandish.  Why can the hon. member not stick to the 
issues and answer the questions?  Enough of the rhetoric— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We have a lively debate going on but 
I do not believe the hon. member for Simcoe—Grey has a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member for Calgary Northeast will be 
judicious in his choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a very appropriate 
ruling.  I know members on the other side are very delicate, very 
sensitive, when it comes to the process of democracy and the hep 
C vote was one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came out of the defence committee too and it is the same 
process.  It is a top down process.  Here we had a bill trying to 
correct the justice system within the military and it was all 
dictated up here and down at the committee.  They sat there like 
a bunch of trained seals, clapping when they were asked to clap, 
jumping when they were asked to jump.  That is the committee and 
that is the committee process that has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, he says Reform wants to cut $1 
billion out of the defence budget.  How little he knows about 
Reform policy.  How little he understands even his own party's 
policy when it comes to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government wants to chop $2 billion from this 
budget, down from $9.2 billion.  The Reform, recognizing that 
there is a strong need to support our men and women in the 
Canadian military, wants to increase this budget to $11 billion. 
That will take care of the procurement problems and the rusting 
out equipment.  That will take care of some of the social 
problems and complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had five years to correct the problems.  For 
five years it let the military suffer.  For five years it allowed 
housing away below substandard to exist in which to put military 
families, five years and there was no consideration of the social 
needs of military families.  That is where the fault lies and 
there is the answer to the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time for questions and comments 
has now expired.  I know hon. members are disappointed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to the speeches for some time now and I must say that, 
when I was teaching at a college in Quebec, if a student of mine 
had behaved like one of the hon. members just behaved in this 
debate, I would have gladly thrown him out of the classroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of situation explains why Canadians judge us so 
poorly. But I would like the public to know that most members 
behave rationally in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased today to speak briefly on the motion put forward by 
the Progressive Conservative Party. 
The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to 
provide strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian 
Forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to point out to my Conservative 
colleagues that the members of the Canadian forces are paid by 
the Canadian taxpayers and not by Her Majesty, for whom I have 
the greatest respect. I think we could simply call them the 
“Canadian forces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let us get to the matter at hand. Providing 
political leadership probably starts with managing Canadian tax 
dollars effectively. 
Now, in his latest report and previous comments, the auditor 
general, as you know, repeatedly indicated several flaws in 
terms of military spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, he stated that two thirds of the $3.3 billion defence 
budget, that is $2.2 billion—so it is $2.2 billion out of 
$3.3 billion—were spent on goods and equipment that did not 
really meet the needs of our troops. Now, $2.2 billion is a lot 
of money. It is an incredible amount of money. In fact, it would 
eliminate the deficit in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money was spent of military goods that did not meet 
our needs. Let me give you some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Griffon utility tactical transport helicopters:  a study 
done in August 1992, after the department had decided on the 
Griffon, showed that its load capacity was less than that 
required to transport a gun or engineer equipment.  The long and 
short of it is that this is a helicopter that is not capable of 
lifting what is put into it, what it has to carry.  Its load 
capacity for evacuating wounded and for logistical support was 
also lower than required.  The government bought a helicopter 
that was quite simply not up to the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the Leopard thermal weapon sight.  The 
results of tactical analyses on how to modernize the Leopard do 
not justify the decision to improve only the night vision 
system.  If the government had been willing to spend the money, 
what the army needed was for the entire vehicle to be 
modernized, including the gun and the armour. 
According to the study, that was the minimum that would have 
been acceptable.  More money badly spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the Lynx replacement project, project Coyote. 
The tactical concept used for the Coyote armoured reconnaissance 
vehicle was based on a number of studies, including a simulation 
study used for the Leopard.  This study showed that, without 
powerful backup, armoured vehicles similar to the Coyote cannot 
withstand the enemy fire they would have to face in mid-intensity 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean.  It means that the government is buying 
armoured vehicles that are not up to the conditions in which 
they may find themselves.  More money badly spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I point out that still more money has been thrown away on 
second-hand British submarines? 
I predict that, a year from now, the auditor general will come 
back to this topic and it will not be to congratulate the 
federal government but to tell it that, once again, it has 
wasted taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But enough about money.  Money is important, but it is not 
everything.  Now we are going to talk about integrity, and about 
the Létourneau commission and what went on in Somalia. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government showed poor political leadership in categorically 
refusing to shed light on the events that took place in Somalia. 
Justice Létourneau had a mandate. To properly complete his job, 
he would have needed a little more time. We are not dealing with 
any old thing here, but issues that are important for 
maintaining democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Létourneau requested that his mandate be extended to 
December 30, 1997, or a six-month extension. That is all he 
needed, but the Liberal government simply denied this extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caused a scandal, of course. I must admit that it is not 
clear whether this is only a Liberal scandal or also a 
Conservative scandal, as this whole thing started under Prime 
Minister Campbell, who ran in the 1993 campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, the current Liberal government swept this issue 
under the carpet by not extending Justice Létourneau's mandate. 
Let us face it, for all intents and purposes, the unilateral 
decision made by the minister represents nothing less than 
direct political interference in a judicial process, which is 
contrary to every democratic principle, including the separation 
of powers between the judicial and legislative branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on. Fortunately, we have a committee, the defence 
committee, that is currently touring military bases. 
I would like to briefly comment this tour, first because it is 
an important tour and second because I had the pleasure of 
sitting on this committee when hearings were held at Canadian 
Forces Base Valcartier in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recall, many senior officers testified at these hearings, 
as did many soldiers and members of their families. I can 
remember part of what was said. First of all, the lower ranks 
are underpaid. They cannot provide their families with a decent 
living on their pay. This is not inconsequential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are regions in Canada where the cost of living is so 
high—take Vancouver for instance—that we have seen Canadian 
forces members based in Vancouver go on welfare because they 
could not make ends meet with their pay. Is that political 
leadership? Let us be serious. The government goofed a long time 
ago. 
It is wasting our money on equipment that does not work, and it 
underpays the most important resource in our armed forces, 
namely our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now come to moves. Military personnel gets transferred from 
one base to another. When they move, they must sell their house 
if they have one and, more importantly, their spouse must quit 
his or her job and try to find another one. It is not easy for 
an English speaking spouse to find work near the Valcartier base 
because, as you know, things are done in French in Quebec. But 
the reverse is also true. It is not easy for a French speaking 
spouse to find work in an English province. All this causes 
serious disruption to family life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is worse. Take the case of a young francophone whose 
parents are transferred to a base with an English environment. 
What school is that young francophone going to attend? 
How is he or she going to get an education in French? Some 
situations are truly deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to the protection afforded to our military, in 
the case of an occupational injury. If the injury occurs in a 
theatre of operations, they are entitled to generous 
compensation, based on the nature of the injury suffered. 
However, if the occupational injury occurs here, during training 
in Canada, our military do not get any compensation. Worse 
still, they are released, because they are no longer able to 
fulfil their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No injured worker in Quebec would received such shameful 
treatment, as Major General Forand pointed out during the 
hearings. Something must be done about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of building maintenance. Military 
buildings are deteriorating because there is no money to 
maintain them. 
We will lose a fortune because we cannot afford to do 
inexpensive repairs that would keep these buildings in good 
shape.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the federal government is mismanaging our money 
and the Canadian Armed Forces. I can guarantee you that things 
would be different in a sovereign Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague from Portneuf for summing up what he 
saw during a tour of our military bases.I was also on that tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the minister of defence blamed the Tories for leaving 
our armed forces in a really poor state. You know, it is always 
easy to blame others. One is never to blame, it is always the 
other guy's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no deficit in Canada before 1973. The first one to 
open the door to a deficit was the current Prime Minister of 
Canada, who bragged about being the first finance minister from 
Quebec to become prime minister. I do not think it does us great 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, it is easy to always blame others. I have noticed 
several things. Let us use the example of our armed forces. 
In Trenton and in Petawawa, some members of our Canadian Forces 
told us that they had been waiting eight months for a pair of 
boots. Our soldiers in Bosnia buy kevlar equipment from the U.S. 
military, because we are unable to provide them with what they 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the Auditor General of Canada told us in his 
report that the RCMP had 4,000 hats in storage in Ottawa. Some 
people have too many hats, others have to do without boots. 
There is currently a lack of warm equipment for those who are 
posted to Alert. What is the problem? It may lie with our 
suppliers who are probably not getting as much as they think 
they deserve, because they are not providing us with anything. 
Have we come to the point where our soldiers will have to 
provide their own rifles and their own bullets to join the army? 
We are almost there. Eight months for a pair of boots, does that 
make any sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to housing. Our colleague said he was concerned 
about the welfare and health of the members of our armed forces 
and their families. 
The committee visited military housing.  I do not know whether 
he would want to let anything live there.  There was two feet of 
water in the basement and military personnel were told to keep 
quiet, they were not renting the basement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They get a $100 increase and end up with $46 after taxes.  The 
cost of food is raised from $200 to $425 a month and housing 
costs are raised by $125 or $150 a month, and military personnel 
are told they should be content with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Morale has bottomed out.  The military are exhausted.  The armed 
forces are demoralized.  Meanwhile, the minister is spouting 
fine rhetoric, saying he did this or that well.  The armed 
forces, however, are a disaster.  Something has to be done to 
raise their self-esteem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporal Paquette in Trenton, a francophone, with a quadriplegic 
child whose only hope is to one day learn to speak, cannot 
obtain the services of a remedial teacher in French to teach his 
child to speak.  After 17 years of service he is told “If you 
are unhappy, why don't you go home to Quebec and leave the 
forces?”  This is the way our soldiers are being treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Mégantic—Compton—Stanstead nodding, because 
it is true.  He was there and heard the testimony with me.  When 
will all this come to a stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of dollars have been wasted.  I remember the 
cancellation of the privatization of Pearson airport.  Doug 
Young, the minister at the time, said it would cost us a maximum 
of $25 million.  Last time I looked, the government was being 
sued for some $500 million because of this purely political 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the purchase of helicopters was not the greatest 
decision by the party previously in government, but its 
cancellation cost us an arm and a leg.  At some point, there is 
a need for consistency, for logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my hon. colleague, who does an admirable job in all 
areas, but especially in this one, to tell us what he thinks of 
the well-being and the morale of the military.  Perhaps he would 
give us some details.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague for Chambly is 
too kind, but he is right about the Canadian military being 
highly skilled and the Quebec soldiers having great courage. The 
problem is not the military or the military hierarchy, but the 
political decisions that are made against the best interests of 
the general population and the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some soldiers have shown me drinking water that was so dirty I 
would not have bathed in it. I would not even have given a dog a 
bath in that water. It was unbelievable. That is what was coming 
through the water supply system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only hope that this debate will help the government 
realize the importance of making decisions that will give our 
military the means to do their job, so that we have soldiers who 
are proud of what they do, who are well paid and well thought of, 
who have decent housing and who are properly dressed and well 
equipped, and so on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the motion by the member for Compton—Stanstead: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to provide 
strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to say that I have to agree with the conclusion reached 
by this member that the government has indeed failed to provide 
strong political leadership to Canadians who are within the 
military and also working for the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 11 months that I have had the privilege of 
representing the people in Dartmouth, I have been quite frankly 
astounded by the deep malaise I have seen in every sector of the 
community involved with the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sector is substantial.  In Dartmouth and Halifax there are 
10,000 military personnel and over 2,000 civilian personnel 
working for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our citizens have been central to the war effort in both the 
first and second world wars.  Thousands of sailors and merchant 
marines have sailed out of our harbour and thousands have never 
returned.  Thousands of civilian workers stayed a home during the 
wars and fuelled the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My communities, probably more than any in this country, have 
really felt the effects of war.  Everyone has a grandmother or an 
aunt who can remember the exact place where they were during the 
Halifax explosion.  That explosion killed thousands of people in 
our community, an east coast community right here, during the 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember something that happened to me when I first arrived in 
that community.  I went to a church that has now become my 
church.  I was there on Remembrance Day with my children and a 
couple of people in the choir came down from the choir. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took off their robes and started singing “The Band Played 
Waltzing Matilda” which is a very poignant song about a young 
Australian soldier going to Gallipoli, fighting in that war and 
then returning with his legs blown off. It is an anti-war song. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked around me and there was not a dry eye in sight.  There 
were many military families in that church that day.  I thought 
these were people who have a whole different view of fighting for 
a country and investing a great deal in it from what I ever had. 
I think I really changed my mind that day.  I began to understand 
some new things about what commitment meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now the MP there. A great percentage of the people who come 
through my door or call our office are from the military or 
civilian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking for assistance intervention with DND, with DVA. 
They need ministerial inquiries into pension issues, unfair 
dismissals from the Department of National Defence and simply the 
draconian methods of downsizing that have been going on under the 
process of alternative service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to fight for some of these citizens, I have run up 
against bureaucracies and a leadership that will not take 
responsibility, is not responsible or responsive to the concerns 
of these people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 8 and 9, I sat in on the parliamentary committee which is 
crisscrossing the country to hear quality of life concerns within 
the military.  I listened to dozens of soldiers and sailors, some 
of them fathers, and their wives speak out about the situations 
facing them.  I heard from a peacekeeper who had been sandbagging 
PCBs in Sarajevo for seven months.  He had been exposed to 
incredible environmental poisons so that now his health is 
completely gone.  He was pleading before the committee for a 
decent pension level so he could look after his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A father named Al Lannon spoke for his son Glen Lannon, a young 
man from Truro who was injured during a military exercise at Camp 
Shilo.  He was trying to receive some sort of pension that would 
allow him to take care of his family.  A woman named Susan 
Rierdon spoke on behalf of her husband Terry Rierdon who returned 
gravely ill from his deployment in the gulf in 1990.  They are 
still fighting for recognition of his illness. They are still 
waiting for the government to take some responsibility for the 
wounded soldiers and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Rierdon had a question for the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that our country will not stand up with us in our hour 
of need?  Veterans affairs is a minefield, and as I speak, 
Terry's pension is under complete and total review.  The outcome 
will not be known for one or two months due to misplaced 
paperwork.  Medical documentation that was misplaced at veterans 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's not new to me.  Misplaced files, unreturned calls, constant 
delays are standard.  I am the sole paper fighter for the 
military and veterans affairs.  As an ex-military wife, I am 
ashamed, not only of the way our family has been treated by this 
country's agencies, but the treatment of all our ill and 
forgotten lost soldiers.  I appeal to each one of you to restore 
dignity to those brave men and women, they all served us with no 
questions asked. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A sailor who now has AIDS and hep C from tainted blood 
transfusions done in a military hospital said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a battle for my life and to make matters even worse I 
must now fight a major bureaucratic battle with national defence 
and veterans affairs to ensure that when I no longer breathe that 
my wife and children will not starve, will not lose the family 
home. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these submissions paint a picture of an oppressive, 
vindictive leadership, a bungling, secretive bureaucracy.  All 
expressed fears of reprisal for coming forward and all are 
waiting for such things as pensions.  They are in line-ups for 
operations.  They are waiting for diagnoses from military doctors 
whom they have lost faith in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civilian military workers await the next round of cuts which 
will see their jobs diminish.  Jobs that used to bring $12.50 an 
hour, family supporting jobs, are now privatized and restored at 
$7.50 an hour.  I do not blame them for their feelings of anger 
and betrayal.  Their years of service have been met by the 
prevailing government attitude of privatizing everything that 
moves, of shifting responsibility to the private sector so it 
does not show up on the government books, so the Minister of 
Finance can gloat and bray about his surplus, while communities 
such as mine become weaker and more anxious by the day about 
their futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people did not become part of the military effort to fight 
for those values.  They did not fight for the values that now 
pervade the leadership of the military and the government.  They 
committed their lives because they had an ideal of a country and 
a community they wanted to live in and were willing to fight for. 
That ideal involved the concepts of justice, fairness, equality 
and protection of the weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have parliamentary committee crisscrossing the country to 
hear quality of life issues from military personnel and their 
families.  Each night we see on the news the horror stories of 
the families that have no money and are going to food banks.  We 
hear the horror stories I have just put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear that the country is waking up, that our own 
citizens are waking up and changing some of the stereotypes and 
mythologies they carry about the military.

probably a very large report released by the committee.  There 
will be lots of trees cut down in the interests of this weighty 
document.  However the document will mean absolutely nothing 
unless there are ears to hear and unless there is a strong 
political leadership within the government to back up the 
recommendations of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leadership must herald the return to the values for which 
these young men and women have fought and put down their lives: 
justice, co-operation, care for the wounded, the vulnerable and 
the ill.  If it does not happen we will in the not too distant 
future have no one left willing to stand up to fight for a way of 
life: democracy, fair play and justice.  All we will have is 
generals who will be by themselves rattling their sabres.  We 
will have our ministers flaunting their reports.  However the 
battle for the way of life we believe is valuable will be lost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, so much 
for the 1994 defence white paper that the minister of defence 
claims the government is still committed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper has been turned into a word of fiction.  The 
government has ignored the white paper, its own defence policy. 
We saw a news release that was sent out today by the minister of 
defence saying that he welcomes the auditor general's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report also condemns the Department of 
National Defence and what it has been doing.  I wonder if he will 
look at the recommendations in the auditor general's report and 
really implement them.  He certainly has not implemented the 
white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has ignored the white paper, its defence policy, 
and failed to implement many of its very necessary 
recommendations.  These recommendations include replacements for 
the Sea King, new multi-role support vessels for the navy, 3,000 
extra soldiers, new armoured personnel carriers for the Canadian 
army and upgraded weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to chapter 7 of the national defence white paper for 
those on the other side who may want to read up on their 
government's official policy.  The unofficial policy and the one 
most often put into practice has been neglected.  How can we in 
Canada in good conscience continue with alliances such as NATO 
and the UN when we do not give our armed forces the resources to 
meet our obligations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we have been embarrassed.  All Canadians are embarrassed 
now as are the members of our armed forces.  We cannot continue 
to expect the respect that has been shown in the past for the 
many Canadians who have given their lives in conflicts all over 
the globe when we do not give our armed forces the ability to do 
the job we are asking them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that we are saying to Subway that it can put an 
ad on our submarines.  That is what we are to do.  We will serve 
Subways to the men who serve on the submarines.  I cannot believe 
that we are to put Rocket 88s on our rockets.  I cannot believe 
that we are to sell ads to raise money and to put those ads on 
our vehicles and on all of our equipment.  That is the way we are 
to raise money.  I have never seen this done in Canada.  It is an 
embarrassment around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut the defence budget by 30% in the last 
five years.  That has affected equipment and training.  Recent 
news reports have highlighted the effect it has had on the 
quality of life of the soldiers.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most of us in the House are aware, a second lieutenant at CFB 
Moose Jaw told the defence committee how he moonlights as a 
security guard for $5.75 an hour so that he can feed his family. 
A sailor aboard the HMCS <I>Calgary</I> canvasses for the United 
Way.  There is a gentleman in Moncton, New Brunswick, Mr. 
Soueracher, who when he was in the armed forces had a blood 
transfusion.  He now has AIDS and he contracted hepatitis C.  Our 
people will not even look at the man because they kept absolutely 
no record of the blood transfusion. 
His wife was there during that operation.  There is still on the 
bottom of his foot a spot where they put the transfusion, but 
they will not give him his medical records.  He offered to fly 
here and talk with the Minister of Veterans Affairs or with his 
staff, and no one will meet with him.  I cannot believe this is 
happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general noted last month that defence spending often 
does not match the goals and the policies of the department.  He 
pointed out that while Canadian soldiers were expected to fight 
alongside the best and against the best there was not sufficient 
capital to equip and modernize our forces.  The auditor general 
also noted that despite a commitment to ensure that the 
experiences of the 1970s were not repeated when equipment was 
rusting out rapidly, the long term capital plans and the defence 
services program currently forecast a decline in equipment 
spending over the next five to fifteen years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine?  We will have decline for the next 15 years.  We 
just will not have a Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minister of defence is saying that he will listen to the 
auditor general.  He never listened to the white paper and he did 
not adopt it, and he will not listen to the auditor general 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about our veterans that made great sacrifices to uphold our 
values in international law and security?  What do they get in 
return?  The government has made deep cuts to veterans programs. 
It has slashed veterans affairs operating budget over a three 
year period by $182 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have wives of veterans coming to me.  They cannot afford to 
bury their husbands.  The merchant navy will be here on the Hill, 
on the steps of the Parliament Buildings, to protest.  One 
merchant navy veteran said to me “I would rather sit there 
because they would have to bury me in the end.  They will not 
give my wife enough to bury me so I will sit there on a hunger 
strike.  When we die on the steps of the Parliament Buildings 
they will have to do something with our bodies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe it.  We should reinstate the means test back to 
$24,000 for the last post fund.  It should be a priority.  It was 
reduced in 1996 to $12,000 and very few veterans now qualify for 
burial benefits.  That is $12,000 between husband and wife, not 
just for the veteran.  Various legion branches have passed 
resolutions calling for reinstatement of the last post fund to 
$24,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of World War II the Canadian merchant marines grew to 
180 ships and 12,000 mariners.  Sixty-seven ships were lost with 
11,046 mariners killed and 198 taken prisoner.  Despite being 
referred to as the fourth arm of the fighting services during the 
war, merchant navy veterans were denied veteran status and many 
of the benefits offered to veterans.  In particular, they were 
offered very limited career training opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a country have recognized the injustices against our 
merchant navy seamen and women.  Why have we not compensated them 
adequately?  Some of the measures the merchant navy is seeking 
include a payment of a tax free $20,000 to each merchant navy war 
veteran or surviving spouse as compensation for their exclusion 
from many of the benefits offered to military veterans after the 
war and for the job and career opportunities merchant seamen were 
denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be an extension of the same benefits available to 
allied military veterans to veterans of allied merchant navies, 
provided the latter meet standards applicable to military 
veterans.  We need to look after our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time with my hon. colleague from Quebec.  I 
want to close by saying that we need to look after our veterans. 
Not only do we need to look after our veterans.  We need to look 
after our military right now.  We need to look after the man from 
Moncton and all those others who have not been treated in a 
manner in which they deserve.  We will continue to fight for each 
and every one of them until this is corrected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party this morning in connection with 
the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think that the hon. member is painting an 
extraordinarily bleak picture of the Canadian Armed Forces at 
this point in time.  None of us on this side of the House would 
suggest for a moment that there are not some problems within the 
military, but the picture painted by the hon. member goes a 
little too far with respect to reflecting the reality of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the hon. member.  One of them relates 
to the whole issue of the white paper.  As a member of the 
national defence committee I just returned from the committee 
hearings in Halifax and the maritimes.  We talked to quite a 
number of people.  I had the opportunity to speak to Rear Admiral 
Dusty Miller who is in charge of the maritime Atlantic command. I 
asked him about the whole equipment issue, whether or not we 
could do the job that has been mandated to us in the white paper 
and in connection with the Department of National Defence mission 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rear Admiral Miller was very clear in terms of his comments.  He 
said that when Canada gets the Upholder submarines we will have 
one of the most modern navies in the world, some of the best 
equipment available in the world and some of the most highly 
trained people in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the reality of the situation, I think it is 
reflected in the commitment the government has made to the navy 
over the last number of years: 12 brand new frigates in the 
Canadian navy, absolute state of the art in terms of weapons 
systems, radar, communications systems and computer systems.  It 
is the very best technology we could possibly offer our men and 
women in uniform on those frigates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime coastal defence vessels is another example: 12 
brand new maritime coastal defence vessels, and we have the 
Upholder submarines as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to respond to that aspect of the equipment 
and whether or not she is prepared to admit that perhaps she 
painted a little too bleak a picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue she raised was on the personnel support 
programs.  We are seeing commanders in the case of the maritime 
Atlantic command who are taking the initiative.  I spoke to one 
service person who showed me a card produced by maritime— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are on questions and comments.  The hon. member has been 
giving a speech. I believe there are other members who would like 
to ask questions.  We only have a certain amount of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This period is called 
question and comments so a member is quite free to comment rather 
than to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, all I want is enough 
time for me to reply to his question.  It does not leave a lot of 
time for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not hear the last 
comment by the hon. member for Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I have the answer if I have the time to 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Madam Speaker, the other question I have 
is in connection with personnel support programs.  It relates to 
some innovative thinking that is occurring within the Canadian 
forces right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with companies providing support to members of the 
Canadian forces.  What is wrong with that?  What difficulty does 
the hon. member have with that?  It shows some real leadership 
and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, when it comes to the 
submarines, they have bought used submarines from Britain and 
unlike nuclear subs they cannot stay submerge indefinitely and 
therefore do not allow for Arctic patrolling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general takes note of a very limited capability to 
assert national will in the very demanding environment of 
Canada's Arctic.  He has stated this is not good. 
Furthermore, when it comes to the Sea Kings he did not mention 
that because some of our people lost their lives.  In our area 
they lost their lives and their parents are writing to us and the 
Sea Kings are still there.  Every one that goes up in the air has 
to have 70 hours of maintenance afterwards.  It is an absolute 
disgrace.  Why do I not want McDonald's and Subway and everybody 
on the side of our vehicles for national defence?  Ask around the 
world.  It is embarrassing when we reach rock bottom like that. 
For our defence people that is embarrassing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So I say to him work to put back the respect that should be 
there. Some of our people now in the forces there are going to 
food banks.  He wants me to be proud of that. No, I will fight 
tooth and nail to give them their respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank my leader for sharing her time with me. She is totally 
committed to defending the interests of both our veterans and 
all active members of our armed forces who are experiencing very 
serious problems at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward this motion because we are aware that the 
present government has brought our armed forces back to the 
sixties 
and seventies. They are close to not being operational. This is 
strange because we expect a lot from our soldiers and their 
families. 
It seems to me that it is the duty of the House of Commons to 
care about what is going on within our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody is pretty much aware of this reality that is 
devastating our armed forces. It does not affect 10,000 or 
50,000 people, but hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Our 
soldiers are directly affected by this devastating reality. 
Are their immediate families and their extended families. 
Practically all Canadians are affected by what is going on right 
now, by what we have been learning about life within the armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of the Progressive Conservative Party for 
Chicoutimi, Quebec, I must say that there are soldiers in that 
region who worked extremely hard during the national disasters 
that hit our country in recent months and recent years. 
Members of our armed forces have been and continue to be our 
national heroes. However, this fact must be recognized in a 
tangible way; the government must act responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this issue affects hundreds of thousands of people, indeed 
all Canadians, we think the time has come for a ministerial 
statement, either by the Minister of National Defence or the 
Prime Minister, to show all Canadians that we are committed to 
modernizing our Canadian forces and making them effective again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect a lot from these people and I am positive they do not 
feel their services are considered essential. They are called 
upon for every activity, for every national disaster we go 
through. 
They are also called upon to travel to other countries, to give 
up being with their families for months at a time, with 
absolutely no recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in power is waiting on the recommendations in 
committee reports.  It does not need to wait; at the very least, 
it could start by immediately improving its management of 
equipment replacement.  It costs about $1.5 billion a year just 
to replace and modernize our equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk about many purchases that have been made 
without regard for the priorities that any soldier would be able 
to set.  The supply department itself is extremely inadequate. 
These are things that could be done very quickly.  Normally, 
recommendations in the auditor general's report can be acted on 
within the year.  But instead the government is waiting on the 
standing committee's report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the committee's final report is in, there are extremely 
progressive measures I think the defence minister and the 
government could take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian soldiers have been serving abroad for four years now, 
as well as at home. And who is Canadian soldiers' worst enemy? 
It is the budget slashing Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agrees that there has to be rationalization, but the 
government has gone into the banking business.  It has set aside 
$20 billion in a special fund at a time when our soldiers are 
underpaid and lack modern equipment.  They are the laughing-stock 
of other countries. 
With completely obsolete equipment, they are the best soldiers 
in the world.  That is what the government should do something 
about and pronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all began with a purely political move, the cancellation of 
the helicopter contract, which had been carefully worked out. 
This contract cost hundreds of millions of dollars in delay, 
compensation and the whole business of renegotiating a new 
contract that is costing several millions more than the 1992-93 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are serious shortcomings with respect to 
activities such as training, that have not been taken into 
account.  Also not taken into account were the cost of 
replacement parts and maintenance, as well as the $960 million 
because of postponing replacement of the old and now unreliable 
Labradors and Sea Kings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it goes on. I prefer not to speak about R&D.  The contract 
was scrapped, a term the government understands.  It promised us 
it was going to scrap free trade, even though it has been 
responsible for raising our export figures from $90 billion to 
$215 billion.  It also promised to scrap the GST, another thing 
it has not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it did scrap, however, was the helicopter contract. 
Renegotiating a poorly negotiated contract cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former national defence chief of staff has admitted that the 
Canadian army was ill equipped to fight a true armed conflict. 
Really now.  According to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, in 1996, the chief 
of defence staff said that the Canadian army is not equipped to 
wage a serious war, and the rank and file are justifiably 
dubious about the competency of the high command. We are not 
talking about 1939, before the second world war, but about 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 auditor general's report, it was pointed out that 
certain well-known deficiencies in their tanks made it impossible 
to keep the risk of missions on which the armed forces were sent 
to an acceptable minimum.  This means that the Canadian 
generals—and this merits careful reading because there is a 
considerable responsibility here—sent thousands of soldiers to 
combat zones in Bosnia and Somalia, knowing that their safety 
was compromised because of serious deficiencies in their 
armoured vehicles.  The auditor general said that even 
machine-gun bullets could go through them. And our military 
personnel were riding in these, an instance of unacceptable 
irresponsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our party has decided to make this an official 
motion today in the House of Commons, in order to try to bring 
about some rapid improvement if possible and, of course, to also 
continue to work, as our colleague is, within the standing 
committee in order to have an official report ready very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for troop morale, one need only look at the reports from the 
standing committee currently travelling across the country to 
see how devastating this situation is to our armed forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A senior officer based, not in Washington, at the Pentagon or in 
Silicon Valley, but in Bagotville, in my riding—no one will 
challenge me on reporting what was said there, I am sure—told 
me that the situation was “just this side of a crisis”. This 
means that the government should not wait for the standing 
committee's official report. There are plenty of reports 
available. There are reports by the auditor general, who 
recommended that our military be better equipped both in terms 
of personnel and of operational equipment. That much the 
government can do, and it should do it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the armed forces sometimes come across instances of 
shameless squandering on purchases of various equipment, on 
which they do not dare blow the whistle for fear of what would 
happen to them if they were found out. 
This is not Russia, or the former Soviet Union. This is not 
right. I hope the government will take into account the 
recommendations made by both the auditor—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I had made one this morning, and I would like to hear 
the hon. member for Chicoutimi on this. The problem is that 
proper training is not provided. Individuals who leave the armed 
forces after a 20 year military career have no training. There 
should be an education system. Perhaps we could share the costs: 
we take a little off their pay and the government could chip in. 
This way the costs would be shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When their service engagement is over, they could go back to 
university, college or training school. I know this is an area 
my colleague knows well. Perhaps he could comment on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, after my defeat in 1993, I had the opportunity to work 
with base authorities in certain areas of training. It was one 
of the positive sides of my defeat, since it allowed me to get 
closer to businesses and to work somewhat like in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposed measure is the creation of a well trained rapid 
reaction corps. I want to go back to this. It is also 
recommended that an ombudsman be put in place, because our 
military are afraid to speak up. We need an ombudsman in the 
Canadian Armed Forces. It would allow us to improve military 
operations on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Based on all that information, we think the 
government has no choice. It must make a statement on the state 
of our armed forces and their ability to fulfil their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the auditor general asked of this 
government. Over the last five years, in addition to scrapping 
the helicopter deal, the government has been scrapping the whole 
of the Canadian Armed Forces, both in terms of their equipment 
and in terms of the pride that our military used to have. These 
people feel that the authorities, and particularly the 
government, never listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we must set up a rapid reaction corps and have an 
ombudsman who will listen to our military on a daily basis 
because, as I said, they are afraid to speak freely. They were 
very pleased to appear before the committee, but afterwards the 
issue will be completely forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have effective means of protecting the lives of our 
military, and this affects not just tens of thousands of 
citizens, but hundreds of thousands of them. I am convinced that 
we could then implement all the recommendations made by the 
standing committee on national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the work being done by the committee members from 
all the political parties is positive and effective. But the 
government must act immediately, because our military are 
leaving the forces. This is unprecedented. They are leaving. It 
is unbelievable. I see it in my region, on the base in 
Bagotville. Our best specialists, our best pilots and our best 
technicians are leaving the military, because they do not feel 
that they are considered as valuable individuals in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we want to take action. Today is Armed Forces Day in 
Canada, and it is an opportunity to show greater respect for our 
military.

Madam Speaker, my hon. friend from Chicoutimi spoke very 
eloquently.  He mentioned the helicopters.  We heard from the 
minister of defence this morning.  He talked about how this was 
actually a good deal for Canadians.  Somehow he expects Canadians 
to accept that receiving half the helicopters at a loss of over 
half a billion dollars, a helicopter that has only half the 
capacity of the one we would have purchased under the previous 
government, is a good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my friend might respond to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for 
Chicoutimi has 15 seconds to answer the question.

thank our colleague, who is on the standing committee, for the 
very positive work the committee has done for all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of the helicopters is another scandal of the present

National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak to this motion because the examples of 
leadership this government has shown with respect to the Canadian 
forces are demonstrated day in and day out by the very pride we 
have for the dedication, the skill and the professionalism of 
Canada's soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pride in the Canadian military has very deep roots and today's 
Canadian forces draw inspiration from the courage, commitment and 
accomplishments of the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen 
and women who served before them for this country in war and in 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has proudly demonstrated the great honour of 
being the custodian of the distinguished military heritage we 
have.  I believe the need to maintain Canadians' pride in their 
military tradition is a responsibility which we must and do take 
very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the men and women of the forces also take that 
tradition very seriously.  They are currently experiencing a 
period of intense operational activity and they continue to 
perform every mission with great skill and courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of the Canadian forces is to defend Canada and 
Canadian interests and values while contributing to 
international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the world is in the midst of incredibly dramatic 
changes.  One example is that NATO will expand to include former 
members of the Warsaw Pact.  We are full, active partners in 
collective security organizations like NATO and NORAD because 
Canadians believe their security is indivisible from that of our 
allies, old and new.  We continue to contribute to UN 
peacekeeping missions and other multilateral operations because 
Canadians believe they have a duty to promote stability and 
alleviate the suffering which is often caused by armed conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has participated in virtually every peacekeeping mission 
ever organized, with more than 100,000 women and men posted all 
over the world during the last half century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peacekeeping also requires patience and discipline, as well as 
innovation and courage.  We have made some mistakes on our 
peacekeeping missions, and some serious ones, but we have also 
achieved some remarkable successes and, on balance, we have as a 
nation done a great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces in the former Yugoslavia helped to prevent 
fighting from spreading to other parts of the region.  They saved 
countless lives by assisting in the delivery of humanitarian 
supplies and preventing more massive assaults on civilian 
populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peacekeeping and peacemaking are proud and dangerous 
undertakings to which the army, navy and air force all 
contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibilities of the Canadian forces also include the 
surveillance and control of Canadian territory, air space and 
maritime areas of jurisdiction. 
They include the securing of borders against illegal activities, 
fisheries and environmental protection, the protection of 
Canadians from all manner of disaster and, when required, aid of 
the civil power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way of knowing what the 21st century holds for 
Canada, nor what the challenges and tasks will be for the 
Canadian forces.  The totally unforeseen changes that have 
occurred on the international stage in the past 10 years are a 
guarantee of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  How will the Canadian forces prepare for the 
challenges of the 21st century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's view the choice is clear.  We must retain 
multipurpose, combat-capable forces to carry out the essential 
mission of defending Canada and contributing to international 
peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian forces are to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century and carry out the roles provided by the government, roles 
which Canadians support, they must be flexible, well equipped, 
thoroughly trained and able to fight if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the 20th century our allies have depended on Canada 
as a reliable contributing partner to the preservation of 
international peace and security.  The courage and the commitment 
of the men and women, along with our equipment, our training and 
our skills, have enabled Canada to participate with the most 
modern and professional armed forces in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a choice to maintain Canada's historic role and 
stature as a nation in NORAD and NATO.  To do this we must 
continue to provide the Canadian forces with the tools to do the 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced over $1 billion in equipment 
purchases.  We have an obligation to spend the taxpayers' money 
wisely.  That is why, wherever possible, we are choosing to buy 
off the shelf commercial technology to upgrade the equipment now 
in our inventory, or in some cases to consider purchasing used 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also restructuring the forces, downsizing 
headquarters, reducing infrastructure and improving management 
practices to enhance operational efficiency and to provide 
Canadians the best value for their defence dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous initiatives are under way and we are seeing excellent 
progress.  In 1994 we had 52 bases and stations, far too many for 
the size of today's military.  Today the number has been reduced 
by more than half to 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my childhood I lived in PMQs in Zweibrucken, Germany; 
Centralia, Ontario; Bagotville, Quebec; and Trenton, Ontario.  My 
father was a proud member of the RCAF and I am very proud of him 
and others who serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces need our support and they need our 
understanding.  They must be given missions that are clear, 
realistic and achievable.  They deserve our respect and our 
gratitude.  No matter what challenges we face, no matter what 
choices we make, we must ensure that we do what is best for our 
men and women of the Canadian forces and for Canada.  That is why 
the government has embarked on an examination of quality of life 
issues which face our military personnel and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs to undertake an extensive comprehensive 
examination of the people issues so important to a modern 
military.  This committee has been travelling across Canada and 
has visited our troops serving abroad.  They are hearing 
firsthand what we need to hear, the very concerns of the Canadian 
people serving us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is planning to present the report in the fall and 
the government will at that time again demonstrate the leadership 
necessary by taking concrete action as required and I am 
confident it will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision of the future is that of a revitalized Canadian 
military made up of multipurpose, combat-capable troops, both 
regular and reserve, ready and able to carry out any of the 
operations entrusted to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city of London, Ontario we are extremely proud of the 1st 
Hussars, a most decorated reserve unit with a sterling and long 
history.  In the last month I had the very real honour of being 
able to inspect the quarter guard.  That was a very proud and 
memorable moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also within the last month I was pleased to address the men and 
women graduates of our Canadian military colleges who reside in 
southwestern Ontario.  I know that these leaders are willing to 
accept their mantle of leadership.  They understand that service 
is before self. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces of tomorrow will continue to be a 
streamlined command and control structure that will be capable of 
producing the best possible combat forces in the most efficient 
and cost effective manner possible.  We will be proud of them.

set by these thousands of men and women who for over 130 years 
have provided loyal and courageous service to Canada and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to thank them as we stand in this Chamber 
today and on those occasions when we deliver ourselves in service

the men and women who serve in our Canadian Armed Forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was very 
interested to hear the remarks of the hon. member opposite. 
Unfortunately, I have not reviewed the guard of honor. I guess 
he was accompanying the Prime Minister or some minister.  I was 
more involved with the lower ranks, with enlisted personnel, 
with the people we never see but who live in a submarine in a 
room the size of a toilet.  I listened to these people.  I 
certainly did not inspect the boots of the military standing at 
attention on Parliament Hill or anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I can tell you that I saw the terrible things that partisan 
politics, no doubt—it cannot be from anything else—prevents 
the hon. member from criticizing, like the member for 
Nepean—Carleton, who sits on the same committee as I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned a francophone in Trenton who has a young 
quadriplegic child.  The child is three and a half years old and 
does not speak yet.  The name of the person is Denis Paquette. 
He is at the Trenton base.  All he wants is a transfer back to 
Quebec so his child may be taught to speak.  This is all the 
child will be able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contacted Corporal Paquette in Trenton, as the hon. member was 
starting her speech.  He said he is getting nothing but 
reprisals for complaining to the committee when it visited 
Trenton and is being told that he might be encouraged to leave. 
He has been told that, if he is transferred to Quebec City, it 
will be for compassionate reasons, but they will not pay to move 
him or his family.  That is the member's wonderful Canadian 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time a look was taken at the army's human resources.  I 
could almost believe that the soldier who wrote <I>Une armée en 
déroute</I> was right.  Our soldiers are poorly paid and poorly 
outfitted.  They travel in style, on lovely big vessels, leaving 
the Sea Kings aside, but they do have new equipment.  Everything 
has been spent on equipment and very little on human resources 
and soldiers' well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the member would agree to live in the 
so-called PMQs, the houses soldiers are provided with that are 
not fit for a modern family, where the stoves do not even have 
hoods to vent cooking odours.  Is this what the member thinks 
makes our army so wonderful right now and contributes to the 
well-being of soldiers?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on members to have a bit of compassion and to listen to 
soldiers' complaints, such as that of Denis Paquette, about the 
insurmountable human problems they are up against.  And to think 
that the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has just 
been told that the army is wonderful, that there are no problems 
and that she is making it out to be worse than it really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent three weeks on the ground.  Some of the committee 
sessions lasted from 1.00 or 1.30 p.m. until midnight. Like the 
member for Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, we heard soldiers tell us 
that they were not even allowed to see their own medical file. 
The excuse given was national security.  This is wonderful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that members examined their conscience, that for once 
they set aside partisan politics, that they set the record 
straight and admitted that our soldiers are badly paid and badly 
outfitted.  A soldier came to tell us that he had been waiting 
six months for boots and nobody believed him until his colonel 
came to tell us it was true.  He had no boots.  For six months, 
the man had been wearing the boots of another soldier who had 
retired last year.  What does she have to say to the soldiers in 
Bosnia who buy kevlar suits from the Americans?  How are we 
going to send them over?  Wearing loincloths, like the Indian 
tribes of old?

stand here and correct the hon. member.  I did not travel with 
any minister.  I was not with the Prime Minister.  I was doing 
the work as an everyday member of parliament in my riding. 
Whenever I had the opportunity over the last five years I 
talked to the men and women who serve with the reserve units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my unit I have talked to people who have served in Somalia. I 
have talked to people who have served in Bosnia.  In my city we 
are going to send people in the 1st Hussars to Bosnia again this 
June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this speaker makes derogatory comments not founded in fact, 
I must correct him because it is far from the truth.  It is the 
men and women.  Maybe this—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to address this motion on the 
government's leadership with respect to the Canadian forces. I 
believe the government has shown tremendous leadership in this 
area.  I am pleased to report that the residents of my riding of 
Waterloo—Wellington also believe the government has shown 
outstanding leadership in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples of leadership this government has shown with 
respect to the Canadian forces are demonstrated day in and day 
out by the very pride we all have in this House, and all 
Canadians, for the dedication, skill and professionalism of 
Canada's soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen. That pride is 
demonstrated by people in my riding and all Canadians support our 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pride in the Canadian military has very deep roots.  Today's 
Canadian forces draw inspiration from the courage, commitment and 
accomplishments of the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen 
who served before them in both war and peace. This government has 
proudly demonstrated the great honour of being the custodian of a 
distinguished military heritage, something we as Canadians can be 
proud of.  The need to maintain Canada's pride therefore in 
military tradition is a responsibility we as government take very 
seriously, and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has participated in virtually every peacekeeping mission 
every organized.  That is a great feat and certainly reflects 
well on this country, with more that 100,000 men and women posted 
all over the world during the last half century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian forces are to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century and carry out the roles both in peace and in war provided 
by the government, roles that Canadians support, they must be 
flexible, well equipped and thoroughly trained and be able to 
fight if and when necessary.  I reiterate the government's record 
in preparing the Canadian forces for the 21st century speaks for 
itself.  The government has taken action. This is what leadership 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight some of the actions the government has taken in 
this very important area.  Immediately following coming into 
office, the government fulfilled its commitment to cancel the 
EH-101 helicopters ordered by the Conservative government. They 
were simply too expensive for what was needed.  Also the 
government made a commitment to significantly enhance the role of 
parliament in stimulating informed public debate on defence 
issues.  The parliamentary committees reviewing Canada's defence 
and foreign policies conducted extensive and unprecedented 
numbers of public consultations in 1994.  The government has also 
held a number of parliamentary debates on major foreign policy 
and defence issues, including Canada's role in multilateral peace 
operations in Haiti and most recently in the Arabian gulf and the 
Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's defence policy as introduced by this government charts 
a new course for the Department of National Defence and the 
Canadian forces.  Priorities were set out and some tough 
decisions have been and will continue to be made in this regard. 
The Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces have 
fundamentally changed the way they do business.  A program of 
extensive institutional renewal was introduced and is currently 
being implemented across the entire defence organization.  That 
is important to note.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of reform is ongoing.  In March 1997 the report of 
the Minister of National Defence to the Prime Minister on the 
leadership and management of Canadian forces and the progress 
outlined in the commitment to change document released last 
October demonstrates that much has already been achieved in terms 
of improving training, education, morale and leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence has established a monitoring 
committee on change to monitor change initiatives and their 
effectiveness.  An independent ombudsman to enhance fairness 
within the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces 
is in the process of being established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces are 
committed to gender integration and the Canadian forces are world 
leaders in terms of the proportion of women in the military in 
the number of areas in which they can serve.  That too is a 
source of pride for residents in my riding and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains committed to maintaining multipurpose 
combat capable forces to carry out a range operations both at 
home and abroad in the fulfilment of its commitment to 
multinational institutions such as the UN and NATO.  Resources 
are focused on maintaining the core capabilities of the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also committed to ensuring that the Canadian 
forces have the tools they need to do their job.  This is a 
priority, and rightfully so.  Over the last year there has been 
significant progress on important capital acquisitions, including 
the purchase of 15 new search and rescue helicopters, four 
Upholder class diesel-electric submarines, armoured personnel 
carriers, maritime coastal defence vessels and the tactical 
command control and communications system.  All these are 
important acquisitions that we need to have in place for the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced amendments to the National Defence 
Act to modernize and strengthen the military justice system and 
to more closely align it with Canadian values and legal 
standards. This is an important move and one that underscores the 
commitment of the government in terms of this important period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also committed to improving the quality of 
life of the members of the Canadian forces and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
is currently examining the social and economic needs of Canadian 
forces personnel.  The government looks forward to its report and 
recommendations.  We will certainly await that report and the 
importance it will carry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to informing Canadians about the 
good news in the Canadian forces.  Steps have been taken to 
improve communications both within the department and with the 
Canadian public. It seems we should always say thanks for the 
tremendous work the Canadian forces do on our behalf. It is 
important that we do so in order to show them our ongoing 
gratitude for the tremendous work they do on our behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces have 
accomplished much over the last number of years.  The government 
has provided the necessary leadership. It has made the right 
decisions and followed through on its commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the government's leadership, the Canadian forces are 
prepared for today's challenges and especially for those of 
tomorrow.  It is important to underscore and ensure that all 
Canadians understand we are preparing for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown outstanding leadership and commitment 
when it comes to the Canadian armed forces. It has demonstrated 
the leadership required and the ongoing commitment necessary to 
ensure the Canadian Armed Forces are considered to be one of the 
best in the world.

Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from the Conservative Party 
for putting forth this motion.  It is very deserving at this 
time.  The House would do well to listen to what the opposition 
has to say concerning our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major problem in this decade, particularly since 1993, has 
been that this government has chosen to run the military like it 
runs one of its departments. 
It has chosen to run the military with the same secrecy. If it 
wanted to look at one of Canada's success stories, it is when the 
military looked after itself and the politicians stayed out of 
it.  But the government has not done that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a case in point recently, within the least year, the military 
had a conference in Winnipeg.  The theme of the conference was 
efficiency and accountability.  Now the auditors are being asked 
to look into this $2 million conference which lasted only four 
days. It was attended by Canada's top military officers and their 
guests. If that does not sound like a department of this 
government, nothing does.  That is exactly what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to military documents obtained by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Lakeland, food and alcoholic drinks for the 
conference cost $74,000.  It sounds like a department to me. 
Furthermore, this conference included $8,000 in tips to the 
staff.  It sounds like a department to me. The defence minister 
has now confirmed that the auditors are going to examine this 
four day conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of any country's military and particularly that of 
Canada and the glorious past to which the government has been 
referring took place when the military ran the military. If we 
tried to run the RCMP like this government is trying to run the 
military we would have no national police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals since coming to office in 1993 have done nothing 
but tear the guts out of the military.  While they talk about all 
the purchases, they have chopped the military budget by $3 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to some of these people in the military.  I 
congratulate my colleague from the Conservative Party who said do 
we ever need an ombudsman.  In the military today as with this 
government there are a minister, deputy ministers, political 
hacks and all the rest of it and then at the bottom we have the 
real troops.  That is what has been wrong with our military.  The 
soldiers, the people in the front corps, are telling this 
government on every trip they make that is the problem with the 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether these people have read the auditor 
general's report, but he says the military is rusted out. It is 
like VIA Rail, it cannot replenish its stock. Only recently have 
the Liberals moved to do something about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the committee travelling across Canada right now looking 
at the quality of life in the military stopped at the base in 
Moose Jaw.  I hope the members of the committee talked to some of 
the people I talked to.  I hope they were as shocked about the 
conditions in which the military families were living as I was. I 
hope they saw the squalor of some of the houses. I guess as long 
as we are going to have a department with a military being run as 
a political organization, that is exactly what we can expect to 
achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the search and rescue helicopters it took four years to end 
up with the same EH-101 Cormorant that the Liberals had scrapped 
in 1993 at a big price.  It took four years for the Liberals to 
sign a deal with the British to buy four used submarines.  It 
sounds like a department to me. It does not sound like the 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not have the maritime ship borne helicopters.  We 
are told we are going to buy them. 
I would like to say this as a positive note and offer a 
suggestion to this House. Everything I have said has been 
positive but it will be received by members opposite as being 
negative.  That is the problem.  I just spoke the truth. I 
realize members opposite do not like that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion in this country of Canada's military is not 
negative.  It is the government's handling of the military that 
is looked on negatively.  We could do a poll on the Somalia 
inquiry should no one believe me.  That would tell us what is 
thought of politics and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we could do a lot to improve the image of the 
military.  In the area where I live it is impossible for young 
people to become part of the militia because they are not 
encouraged and they would have too far to travel as there is no 
military establishment nearby.  Many of the young people whose 
grandfathers served in the famous South Saskatchewan Regiment 
have to drive all the way to Regina to become part of the 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the Minister of National Defence to go out and 
sell a program with the cadets of the three branches.  I truly 
believe that if we could sell the cadet program in our schools 
and in organizations within our communities, not only would that 
help children with a number of problems and give them something 
to do but it would also be a real source of recruitment into the 
military when the time is right. If someone enters and stays in 
the cadet program until they have completed high school, it may 
well be that they will want a career in the military.  This is a 
program we should give serious attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this country is never again disgraced with the 
government's closing down of the Somalia inquiry.  When this 
inquiry was going on and then was cut off it reminded me of a cat 
making a deposit on the pavement and trying to cover it up.  You 
just cannot cover it up.  You cannot cover up the Somalia 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take some real steps, and I hope it will 
during this tour, to bring Canadians' image of our military up to 
where it once was.  Our military image has really gone down. It 
has really fallen in the last 10 to 12 years. That is what my 
hon. colleague's motion is all about and that is what every 
member of this House and myself want to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parting words are to get the military out of the politicians' 
back pockets and let it run as a true military force. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening to the hon. member opposite and his 
reference to the secrecy in terms of what the government and the 
military are doing.  I could not believe I was actually hearing 
what he was saying.  It is incredible to think he would make that 
kind of statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely my hon. colleague should know, and in fact I hope he 
does, that the defence committee has been listening very 
carefully to what the military has to say. In fact the committee 
has taken soundings in terms of what is being said at various 
places across Canada.  Might I remind the hon. member that the 
committee has done so in Yellowknife, Vancouver, Comox, Edmonton, 
Cold Lake, Esquimalt, Valcartier, Bagotville, Kingston, Petawawa, 
North Bay, Trenton, Gagetown, Goose Bay and Halifax. In fact I do 
not think he realized that hearings were held in Moose Jaw as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member that this is a government intent on 
listening very carefully and very closely to what the armed 
forces personnel and people in this area have to say. I think it 
is very important that we go on record to note that is in fact 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is really simple.  Why would the hon. member 
downplay the tremendous hearings that are being held across 
Canada in order to get the kind of feedback, in order to open up 
the process that we need and think is appropriate?  Why would he 
downplay that?  I think that is really appalling.

finding tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows very well that I talked about the secrecy 
shrouded around the Somalia inquiry and the shredding of 
documents, that is what Canadians thought of the military.  I am 
not condemning talking to people, listening to the rank and file 
and not just the officers and the politicians.  You got it wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all 
allow me to thank my colleague from the Reform Party, who 
supported this morning my motion to create in the armed forces a 
position similar to that of the auditor general and commonly 
called ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this would indeed provide an answer to all the 
serious problems our military personnel and their families are 
confronted to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if our colleague could share with us two or three of 
the most pressing recommendations this government and its 
defence minister should implement immediately instead of waiting 
for the report on which the standing committee on defence is 
working on, to at least show all our troops that we listened to 
what the auditor general has been saying for the past two, three 
or four years. I would like to hear my colleague on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Absolutely, there should be the same procedure in place within 
the military which I know exists within the RCMP and police 
forces.  Even the lowest recruit has a right to issue a 
complaint. In doing so they know full well that the complaint 
will reach its proper source and they will not be penalized for 
putting their reasoning forward.  We found out in the Somalia 
inquiry that when they got to the touchy political part that is 
when the problem started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right and it is a good question. We should get the 
politics out of this and let the military run it and reach 
solutions without the politicians getting into it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to commend the Tories for their motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is entirely right to condemn the government for what it is 
not doing with the military.  It is condemned for its failure to 
provide strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian 
forces. Political leadership.  Nobody is asking the government to 
provide leadership in the field.  We expect from this House that 
it will provide strong leadership to the military, to the forces 
in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the military do for us and what have they been doing in 
the past?  They fought alongside the armed forces of a lot of 
other countries in many wars over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In World War I they fought in the trenches.  They fought 
heroically.  They fought with self sacrifice.  They were 
completely selfless. Some of the worst things that could happen 
to a soldier happened to soldiers in World War I.  They did 
everything that could be done to help win that war.  They fought 
in trenches.  They had a fledgling air force.  They fought at 
Vimy Ridge.  They fought at Maple Copse, the Battle of the 
Somme.  Those are the words that define the heroic history of 
Canada in World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In World War II there was Dieppe, the Normandy landings on 
D-Day. I am proud that my wife's father was at Normandy on D-Day. 
My mother-in-law, a war bride, did everything she could to help 
in the defence of Britain during the war that encompassed that 
land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were the London air raids, the battle of Britain and the 
battle of the Atlantic. That was only the European theatre. Our 
people fought everywhere on this globe in the second world war. 
There is probably not a member in this House whose family was not 
affected by the wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Korean war.  I have known and employed veterans of 
the Korean war.  They suffered. They suffered not without 
meaning.  They suffered because they believed in what Canada 
stands for, democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people should be looked after in the way we would expect 
someone who has sacrificed for us would be looked after.  They 
should not be left lying on the sidelines somewhere. We have 
picked them up off the battlefields but have we looked after them 
once they have returned home?  They have trouble getting pensions 
and any number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only in declared wars that our people have fought. 
They have been there for peacekeeping missions around the world. 
They work in disaster relief in Canada, just recently during the 
Winnipeg flood and the Quebec ice storm.  Our soldiers were there 
as volunteers, not because somebody picked them up.  They went of 
their own accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past our military have been shot at, gassed, bombed, 
shelled, sunk in ships and crashed in planes.  They have been 
made prisoners of war, taken hostage and more.  They have served 
in temperature extremes.  They have practised in the Arctic and 
have served in the deserts.  One would think with all of that it 
would be enough suffering.  Is it?  Not according to the Liberal 
majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay is ridiculously low for what I just listed as the things 
they do.  We have seen on television and committee members have 
heard the military give testimony on the dismal housing 
conditions. And the equipment. I know a man in the navy who 
served on a wooden ship. It is almost the year 2000.  What kind 
of things are we handing these guys to defend our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are responsible for our national defence.  They 
help out in times of national disaster.  They keep peace around 
the world.  We would think that they would be accountable to 
parliament and the Minister of National Defence.  But we also 
think that the Minister of National Defence, this parliament and 
this country is responsible for their well-being. The way they 
have been treated is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading “Dishonoured Legacy:  The Lessons of the Somalia 
Affair” we find that with respect to peacekeeping they have been 
at it for 40 years.  In 1992 what did they find? There was no 
comprehensive training policy based on changing requirements. 
There was an absence of doctrines, standards and performance 
evaluation mechanisms.  That does not speak to a government that 
is responsible for looking after the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence military activities are 
ineffective in respect of parliamentary oversight.  I am just 
reading a little bit again from “Dishonoured Legacy:  The 
Lessons of the Somalia Affair”.  A 1994 examination by a joint 
committee of the Senate and the House of Commons was unanimously 
in support of the view that there is a need to strengthen the 
role of parliament in defence matters.  That would increase the 
morale of our people.  They obviously do not envision parliament 
having a day to day role in things but they say it needs to be 
effective in promoting accountability when it receives, examines 
and publicizes reports.  That is when parliament is most 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership in matters of accountability and an accountability 
ethic have been found seriously wanting in three areas, the upper 
military, bureaucratic, and what we are discussing today, 
political echelons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was material tabled by the Minister of National Defence in 
1997 which has only been some meagre talk about changes on 
accountability and the desirability of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Liberals had a white paper calling for a combat 
capable defence force, multipurpose.  What do we have?  We have 
had years to get helicopters which were cancelled as a political 
ploy.  What have we got now?  The same helicopters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that make sense?  It does not make sense to me, not to 
Canadians, not to other members of the House.  What are they 
spending nowadays?  It is $9 billion.  What was it in 1993 when 
the Liberals took over?  It was $12 billion.  Let us not discount 
the effect of inflation on those types of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military has not been looked after.  We have used 
submarines, but it only took forever to get them.  West Edmonton 
Mall had more submarines than the Canadian navy for goodness' 
sake and probably better ones than the navy has had up to date. 
It just is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think that is what the government should be about.  It 
needs to have a purpose.  We need to decide what it is to do.  We 
expect the armed forces to support our political, economic and 
environmental sovereignty.  We think that should be happening 
over Canada's territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to continue to participate in NATO, NORAD and any other 
defence organization that may be developed in the future.  It is 
still an issue as recent events show worldwide that things can 
quickly fall apart which we thought were together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need fast response.  We do not need to send our people 
overseas and expect them to wait around in the mid-Atlantic while 
we decide whether or not they are suitably outfitted to go into a 
war theatre or a peacekeeping operation.  That is outrageous.  We 
need to provide these things now.  We definitely need to have our 
military prepared for any event.  We need them to be prepared on 
a variety of facets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in complete agreement with the motion to condemn the 
government for the way it treats our military personnel.  I trust 
that as a result of the motion before the House it will review 
what it is doing and will make the decision to do the right 
thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this weekend I had a marvellous opportunity in my riding.  We had 
inspection of our cadet corps of young people.  It was lovely to 
watch.  I was at an air cadet inspection on Friday and an army 
cadet inspection on Saturday.  I watched the pride.  I watched 
the skills.  I watched the talent that was brought forth in these 
young people in my community.  I found it pretty amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserves are working with these young people and providing a 
fabulous opportunity in each of our communities for them to 
participate and to see firsthand the value that military training 
can bring to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it remarkable to see young people who when they became 
involved were not nearly as focused as they might have been 
otherwise. They developed pride, skills, excellence and moved 
forward. This is something our military people are supplying in 
every community across the country.  Our military people are 
there when they are asked to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter if we are talking about the flood in Manitoba 
and the tremendous work the military did there.  We can talk 
about the ice storm in eastern Canada, Ontario, Quebec and New 
Brunswick, and the service it provided and the praise people 
gave. We can talk about the recent fire in Alberta.  Our military 
went there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very proud, a very strong, a very viable military that 
is doing a job of which we all have to be very proud.  We need to 
thank the military for everything it is offering our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I find that year after year the condemnation of 
the military and its plans and movements is wrong.  It does not 
take very long to think who was in power from 1984 to 1988 and on 
to 1993. 
It seems to me it was a Tory government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember the Tories bringing forward the issues they 
are bringing forward today.  I do not remember them dealing with 
the problems in the military.  I remember them as a very 
different group: see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.  Three 
blind mice could probably have given a better scenario of what 
was happening than the people who sat there and did nothing to 
enhance our military bases during the nine years they ran 
government not very many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the Canadian 
victory at Vimy Ridge, one of the greatest allied victories of 
World War I.  Superb leadership, meticulous planning, and the 
courage, determination and spirit of the Canadian soldier won the 
day.  The qualities that led to a stunning victory at Vimy Ridge 
have characterized the efforts of Canadians in uniform for more 
than 100 years.  The Canadian military ethos is the heart of a 
proud traditional service and the heart of great sacrifice. 
Through two world wars, Korea and 50 years of peacekeeping it is 
what we define as excellence in the Canadian forces.  That 
distinguishes our forces as a great institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This military ethos is based on strong, principled and effective 
leadership.  Leadership is a good word to define the action taken 
by the government with respect to the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of leadership is the government's proposed 
amendments to the National Defence Act, Bill C-25.  Discipline is 
the lifeblood of any military organization.  Whether in peace or 
war it spells the difference between military success and 
failure.  It promotes effective and efficient qualities.  Its 
foundations are respected for leadership, appropriate training 
and a military justice system where equity and fairness are 
unquestionably clear at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in recent years the capacity of the military justice 
system to promote discipline, efficiency, high morale and justice 
has been called into question by a number of incidents.  The 
government looked closely at these events and acted decisively. 
The government has taken leadership.  It responded to the report 
of the Somalia commission of inquiry very aptly titled “A 
Commitment to Change”.  We are implementing about 83% of the 
recommendations in the commission's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1996 the government commissioned a special advisory 
group under the Right Hon. Brian Dickson, former Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court of Canada, to assess the military justice 
system and military police investigative services.  It reported 
on time and under budget.  The minister of the day supported its 
recommendations in his report of March 25, 1997 on the leadership 
and management of the Canadian forces.  The Prime Minister 
endorsed early action on recommendations and work began 
immediately to pursue the implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special advisory group on military justice and military 
police investigative services was also asked to examine the 
quasi-judicial role of the minister of the military justice 
system.  Chief Justice Dickson's recommendations are now being 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government saw that the military justice system was one 
of the key areas in which change was needed, it took action and 
demonstrated leadership.  The government sought advice within the 
military and from the public at large, from distinguished 
Canadians who specialized in the knowledge of the military.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill C-25 are a product of that 
process.  The amendments proposed in Bill C-25 are the most 
comprehensive in the history of the act.  Bill C-25 addresses a 
broad range of provisions in the National Defence Act.  It will 
modernize the provisions with respect to the board of inquiry. It 
will clarify the legislative authority for the performance of 
public service duties by Canadian forces members such as the 
actions during the ice storm of which I spoke earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Bill C-25 is primarily about the modernization of the 
military justice system and has four principal thrusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it will establish in the National Defence Act for the 
first time the roles and responsibilities of key figures in the 
military justice system and will set clear standards of 
institutional separation for investigation, prosecution, defence 
and judicial functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it will enhance transparency and provide greater 
structure to the exercise of individual discretion, investigation 
and charging processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it will modernize the powers and procedures of service 
tribunals including eliminating the death penalty under military 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it will strengthen oversight and review of the 
administration of military justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are made because it is absolutely essential for a 
military justice system to be rigorous, transparent and fair. The 
system of military justice is designed to meet operational 
requirements particular to the armed forces.  It is intended to 
promote discipline, efficiency, high morale and justice in the 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two occasions the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed the 
need for a parallel and distinctive system of courts to meet the 
special requirements of military discipline.  Indeed our armed 
forces must have portable courts which, by using procedures that 
are both speedy and fair, are capable of operating in conflict or 
in peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand the special needs of the Canadian forces in 
respect of justice and discipline, one need only consider a 
variety of tasks they perform in such a professional manner. From 
the Golan Heights to Bosnia, from the floods in the Saguenay and

Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, to the actions that I 
mentioned in Alberta they perform very direct services to all 
people throughout the world as well as to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that they perform very specific functions 
and need to have opportunity to carry out those functions, but 
the justice system must be in place to help as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will make it possible to modernize the code of service 
discipline so that it will meet the particular needs of the armed 
forces while reflecting the values and expectations of Canadians. 
It will make the system of military justice, to the extent that 
military requirements permit, more in keeping with legal 
standards that currently exist in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will greatly enhance accountability and 
transparency, increase confidence in the military justice system 
and certainly give everyone a better understanding of our system. 
They will provide a more modern, effective statutory framework 
for operations of the department and the forces.  They will 
enhance transparency and accountability.  They will increase the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the Canadian forces and enable 
men and women of the forces to do so much to make the country a 
better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes to the National Defence Act demonstrate strong 
political leadership on the part of the Canadian government.  The 
Canadian forces will benefit from the movements with which we are 
going forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned when I first started where my colleagues in the 
Progressive Conservative Party had been.  They were here some 
eight or nine years in order to bring forward plans and changes 
in the military.  It seems to me that during the election 
campaign the Tories admitted that the strength of the military 
was critical to our sovereignty.  Yet the heart of their election 
plan was to weaken Canada by slashing an additional $2.6 billion 
from the national defence budget over four years.  This 
government's restructuring and downsizing of DND has already 
produced a leaner military.  Do they actually expect us to 
believe that they can find $650 million in savings by privatizing 
private property management and food services?  Some of the 
suggestions they made are very questionable and certainly not 
well studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I have heard some different viewpoints from the 
Reform Party.  From what I have seen from the Reform Party over 
the last few years I have some questions.  The Reform Party 
claims to strongly support a well equipped Canadian force.  Its 
fresh start election platform made no mention of any plans to 
improve national defence or international security.  The only 
time the words “national defence” were ever mentioned in its 
election platform was in the list of government areas that would 
be targeted for cuts and spending reductions.  That is what I 
heard from the Reform Party during the election.  That is what I 
have heard from the leader of the Reform Party.  That is what 
most Canadians have heard from the Reform Party day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has consistently called for major cuts in 
defence spending.  In 1993 its zero in three plan would have cut 
$1.8 billion from the defence department's budget.  In 1994 it 
wanted an additional $1 billion cut from national defence on top 
of a 15% cut across the board that it was planning for all 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Somalia affair the Reform Party stood and criticized 
day after day the fact that the military was not performing the 
Reform Party goals and objectives.  Yet today it comes in here 
and suggests that it is supportive of military actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians remember the stinging attacks, the budget cuts, 
the crunches that it was suggesting.  Now it has changed its mind 
on most of the policy that I see coming forward.  I ask members 
of this House how many times they have heard the Reform Party 
talk about cuts.  It is always more money here, more money there. 
It has totally turned its whole position around.  To me it is 
very ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that we should be playing politics as much as we 
do with these issues.  It is clear that we need to be decisive. 
We need to put in place decisive measures.  We need to move the 
agenda forward.  We certainly need to show the respect that the 
Canadian military has and should have.  We need to make certain 
that this process is in place so that we will have a service that 
defends this country not only at home but abroad.  We have to 
make sure that we can move in a direction that is consistent with 
our allies.  We have to move in a direction with the pride which 
these forces show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, in my opinion, and I believe in the opinion of most 
Canadians that our military is a very proud institution, one that 
has served this country extremely well and one that continues to 
serve this country well.  We have to look at the experts and 
suggestions that are coming forward.  To stand and condemn day 
after day is a pretty bad role that our opposition has taken 
toward military, toward government and toward what is going on in 
this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will touch on one point that the hon. member mentioned.  He 
started off by speaking about cadets.  I will speak about air 
cadets in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the air cadets several years back.  In the 
last two years they have had to close down.  Granted, the cadet 
system is a non-profit organization, but it does work usually 
under reservists who help out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings up the other point of what has happened to the 
reserve over the last four years.  They have cut the hours out of 
the reserve.  They only have 32 days a year to train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government talks about making the reservists a good, solid 
force, yet it is cutting the feet out from under them. It is 
taking equipment away from them.  It is cutting their hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they possibly work with 32 days a year?  Besides that, 
now they say no more summer exercises.  They are all being 
cut out.  This is where we get our young people involved.  They 
get out in the summertime, get jobs with the reserves and get to 
do summer exercises.  Maybe the member could comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the air 
cadets, on Friday night I saw the most exquisite drill team that 
I have seen in years.  As a matter of fact, they were among the 
leading drill teams across Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the reserves are working in my area. 
They are doing the job with young people that really needs to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that these young folks are looking forward 
to all kinds of other opportunities as they go from the base 
level of training up through the air cadet level to experimental 
flying preparation and that type of thing.  The army cadets are 
in a very well structured program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it could well be that in the hon. member's area that 
may not be happening.  However, it is not the same scenario 
across Canada.  In my area there is a well functioning group that 
is carrying on these activities with young people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take hon. members back to about 1955 or 
1960 to see the wonderful armed forces we had at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here today and listened to these comments about being 
the great supporters of the armed forces, about being the ones 
taking care of armed forces personnel around the world and in 
Canada.  What have I heard?  It is the Reform Party that does not 
have all the big plans that should be written down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to this House that this Liberal government is responsible 
for low morale, underpaid personnel and more generals and 
servicemen than our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform at least has a chance in the future to write a page of 
history that will make the armed forces much better.  What we see 
from the Conservatives and the Liberals in this House is a 
history of destruction of our armed forces, particularly with 
respect to unification, underfunding and the low morale that we 
see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member have to say about that Liberal record which 
is really disgusting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that very 
clearly, week after week after week during the last election, I 
heard nothing but cut, cut, cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to this House the Somalia affair was going on.  I 
heard nothing from the members opposite outside of how bad a job 
the Canadian military was doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a lot of people in the military and they felt 
demoralized.  They felt that the actions of the opposition were 
tearing down the institution in this country.  Without question 
it is not just the financial aspects, it is also the attitudes 
which strip any group of pride and greatness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I believe this Liberal government is moving that 
issue forward.  It is making certain that we restore pride in the 
military.  It is making certain we have good directions.  Without 
question I believe that we have taken actions in order to move 
that agenda in a very positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very frightened if it were the Reform Party which 
took the reins of the military some four years ago.  Would we 
have been able to react in Alberta to the fires that started last 
week?  Would we have been able to react to the ice storm?  To me 
the Reform Party has very little to give positive direction.  It 
has been totally critical all the way.  That is unfortunate.  I 
do not hear positives, I hear criticisms.  That is not good.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Armed Forces may well be demoralized after comments 
such as I have heard coming from the government representative 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member refers to pride, talent and excellence. At least 
I believe that is what the hon. member said. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about the flood in Manitoba and he spoke about the ice 
storm.  I was there.  During the ice storm I saw the military.  I 
saw what they did.  Believe me, I thank them.  What the hon. 
member is doing is certainly not thanking them.  He is 
embarrassing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member keeps saying “The Tories were there before”.  This 
is playing politics with the issue.  The problems are here today. 
The government must demonstrate leadership and it is not doing 
that.  What is it going to do for the problems that the military 
is facing today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that Trudeau was there before us.  But what is that 
going to do to rectify the problems of today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if he thinks the military is living below 
Canadian standards.  I heard this morning for the first time that 
injured soldiers are not getting proper care.  We also see that 
the military is living below Canadian standards.  Or are there 
Canadian standards?  We see that members of the Canadian military 
are getting out of the forces and do not have the proper 
education to find a post-military job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think there should be standards in place for 
military personnel so that when they leave the military they will 
be able to get a permanent job?  We should have an education 
system in place to protect these people.  I would like the hon. 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think there is a short 
memory here.  If my memory serves me correctly, $6 billion was 
the position of the hon. member's party on the Cadillac, 
submarine-fighting helicopters.  The military had requested at 
that time to buy helmets and flak jackets, but they were turned 
down. They were turned down on helmets and flak jackets at the 
same time as that party was asking for $6 billion for 
submarine-fighting helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heart of its election campaign was a $2.6 billion cut in 
national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the hon. member is telling me that we should be spending 
more money, but his party's campaign rhetoric was that it wanted 
these huge cuts.  I cannot equate the two.  I do not believe 
Canadians can look at that and say they are consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they are in opposition and looking at the positive 
directions in which we are trying to move, they do not see it the 
same way as they did during the election campaign.  They do not 
see it the same way as they did during their nine years in 
government.  They seem to be missing the point.  Everything does 
not happen overnight.  We have to move the agenda forward, but 
their whole rhetoric was wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Their whole rhetoric, in very many respects, was demoralizing to 
the whole military process: tear down, cut dollars, do something 
different.  I question how they can come back today and give that 
same type of sermon.  They missed the boat when they were there 
and they are still missing the boat today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
listened to my hon. colleague across the way, it seems that he 
spent most of his time simply criticizing a party that has never 
held power in this House.  It never had the power to do one thing 
either good or bad as far as the military is concerned and yet he 
spent all his time criticizing that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking ahead as to what we could be doing, which 
is what I think this debate is for.  The hon. member from the 
Liberal side had the opportunity to place before the House and 
the people of Canada their vision and their goal for the role our 
military should be playing but we did not hear anything from that 
member.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only assume it is because they have no vision, certainly 
not a vision they want to share with the House or with the 
Canadian people. We saw what happened.  We saw their actions.  We 
can judge what their vision is, as secretive as it might be, and 
their goal for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what happened in the Somalia inquiry when something very 
bad occurred that reached into the upper echelons of our military 
command.  After less than two years they shut it down.  We will 
never know the full truth.  We can only speculate at the truth. 
Justice was never done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spend much of my time thinking about and working in justice. 
In order for justice to occur we must have the truth.  Upon truth 
is built justice and from a sense of justice that we have in the 
minds and hearts of all of us there is a peace of mind that 
flows.  From that peace flows the prosperity that we all seek in 
our lives and in our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deny the truth, turn it aside, hide it or shut down 
inquiries set up to find and reveal the truth so that justice can 
be done, so that a sense of justice prevails across our land in 
the minds and hearts of our people, what is left?  Is it justice 
based on half truths or no truths?  What did they do in the 
Somalia inquiry to our country and to the morale of those members 
who worked so diligently during the ice storm and the Manitoba 
flood and who stand ready today to respond to any emergency that 
they will be called on?  They see that justice has not been done 
because the truth has been withheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the government side that this had gone on long 
enough and enough money was spent.  Yet we have had inquiries 
that have lasted four and five years.  We spent as high as $50 
million on some inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party now has the opportunity because it has the 
power to express and put into action its vision for the military. 
What do we see is happening?  We see the hon. member stand there 
minute after minute and not reveal his vision for the future and 
not tell the men and women in the military what is in store for 
them.  He attacks a party that has never held the reins of power 
but does have a vision for the military, a vision for the unity 
of this country and a vision for the people of our land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That hon. member spent almost 90% of his time simply attacking 
the Reform Party of Canada that has that vision.  So what do we 
say about the military?  What is our vision for the military? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of our military should be clearly defined.  What should 
the role of the military be?  We are saying that parliament 
should define that and then equip it to perform those duties thus 
defined. If it is peacekeeping or peacemaking or simply the 
defence of the sovereign nature of our country, if it is simply 
to fulfil those roles, let us decide as a nation and equip our 
military to do that job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just the beginning of the vision we hold for the 
military based on the truth, based on fact, based on consultation 
with not only the military commanders but their grassroots as 
well as the Canadian public.  That is our vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision for this place is to allow our elected 
representatives to be a conduit for the thoughts and feelings and 
concerns of the people we are supposed to be representing and not 
have a form of government that will squash the rights of 
individual backbenchers to stand up and represent the people of 
their constituencies, whether it has to do with the hepatitis C 
issue or the military or what other issue placed before the 
elected representatives of the people who are supposed to have a 
vision of this country for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the vision of the Reform Party and that is what is being 
attacked here today.  Why?  They do not have anything they wish 
to share with the Canadian people, with the members of the House 
of Commons or with the members of the military.  They do not have 
anything to share.  I listened intently, waiting for that vision 
to be revealed and it is not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it not forthcoming?  They have no vision and they stumble 
from pillar to post, from one emergency to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When war raised its ugly head again with the Middle East 
situation and we had to send our people, as our duty and 
responsibility, into that potential conflict, what did we hear? 
We heard that the military had to go around scraping up 
equipment, clothing, helmets to send our people into a potential 
conflict.  That is the vision, or lack of it, the Liberal Party 
legacy has left the military, this House and the people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to me that government members do not grasp this 
opportunity put forward by our Tory colleagues to tell the people 
of Canada what vision they have and what they see in the future 
for the military.  What is it?  Why would they not take that 
opportunity? It is there for us all to express what we believe 
should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heard that but we certainly have heard an awful lot 
of abuse and criticism of a different vision put forward in this 
country for the past 10 years at least in terms of the steps that 
should be taken to put our military on a proper footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have a military we should know what we want 
it to do.  Does that not make common sense? Once we decide what 
we want our military to do, let us equip it to do the job. 
It is that simple.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not hear any expression at all of consulting with people, 
the military or members of parliament as to really what the role 
of the military ought to be and then equipping our people to get 
on with the job.  We have had the debacle of ordering helicopters 
and then cancelling helicopters, ordering submarines, cancelling 
submarines and then ordering submarines again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada would like to know if we are going to equip 
our people what do we want them to do?  Should that not flow from 
determining what we want to do with the helicopters and the 
submarines and what we want to do by reducing the strength of our 
military?  What is the purpose of that?  Or if we want to 
increase it, why?  What is the role we want our military to play? 
Depending on every action that the government takes that touches 
on our military we have not heard a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke left me with feelings of shame 
because we honour and respect one another in the House, 
particularly their thoughts and ideas.  We may oppose them but 
all we heard was a response to a very important subject attacking 
a party that puts forward a vision and plans.  They criticize and 
attempt to lay blame for what has happened to our military on a 
party that has never had the levers of power.  One day I promise 
we will have the power because there is no vision on that side. 
There is a vision on this side, certainly within this caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Tories for this supply day motion because it is an 
important subject and it is time for an accounting.  It is time 
to say to the government what do you have in mind, why did you do 
this, what are you planning to do to correct it, what do you have 
in mind for our young men and women in the military living below 
the poverty line, how can you justify this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for an explanation and all we get is the kind of 
rhetoric we heard. It fills time and space on the agenda but it 
certainly does not answer any question for any Canadian tuning in 
to this debate.  It certainly does not inform them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be informed about what is in store for our military you 
cannot go to the opposition.  You have to go to the government. 
Why the member was attempting to focus the responsibility on the 
Reform Party and put the blame for all the things that have gone 
wrong is beyond me and I think beyond the common sense of anyone 
watching the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a military. The military should be trained.  It should 
have the best possible leadership we have, those who have 
volunteered to serve in this manner.  It should be properly 
equipped and above all it should know exactly what its duty is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear that from my hon. colleagues in the Liberal 
Party who have formed the government for this term and who have 
the sole power, control and responsibility to do those things. 
Let us hear something constructive from the government side 
rather than the belly aching we have heard and the blame laying 
that has occurred particularly against the party that has never 
hurt the military, never had the opportunity to help, never had 
the opportunity to place in position our vision of what our 
military ought to be doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after having listened 
to my hon. colleague from the Reform Party, I think it would be 
appropriate at this time to put some Reform facts about military 
vision on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has consistently called for major cuts to 
defence spending.  In 1993 its zero in three plan would have cut 
$1.8 billion from the defence department's budget.  In 1994 
Reform wanted an additional $1 billion cut from national defence 
on top of the 15% across the board cuts it was demanding from all 
departments. The Reform Party's taxpayer budget released in 1995 
also called for $1 billion to be slashed from the national 
defence budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the vision Reform espoused called for “professional, 
well equipped and sufficiently strong armed forces”.  The Reform 
Party claims that it wants this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last year's election platform, I looked for what the Reform 
Party's plans were to improve for instance national defence or 
international security. In its fresh start election platform 
campaign the only time that the term national defence was 
mentioned was when it was listed as one of the areas of 
government that the Reform Party would target with cuts and 
spending reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform cannot have it both ways.  It talks only cuts and it does 
not talk about what it would do.  It is a good thing for the 
defence department in this country that the hon. member is not in 
government and the responsible side of this House knows how to 
make cuts but also manage a progression into the future.  This 
government does take care of international security and does move 
forward to listen to our armed forces and work toward a path that 
will help them do their jobs professionally as well as help their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member where was his vision?  Where was his party's 
vision?  Where was his leader's vision on defence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member had an 
opportunity again to present her vision and the government's 
vision for the future of the military.  What did she do with that 
opportunity?  She attacked the bits and pieces of the overall 
plan the Reform Party has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the member is not concerned about the fact that many 
armed forces personnel have to use food banks in order to 
survive, that the lowest income of the military is at or below 
the poverty line in this country, as well as the fact that they 
are not properly equipped.  As I referred to earlier, members of 
our military had to scramble to gather up clothing and helmets 
used or unused from hither and yon from other parts of the 
military at a time when we were sending them into a possible 
conflict area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hear what the government has in store for the military 
instead of trying to defend it simply by attacking and using only 
bits and pieces of the plans of our party or any other party. Let 
us hear what her plans are.  She has not told us what her plans 
are.  Why can we not hear what her plans are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada and members of this House are looking 
squarely at the vision of the Liberal Party of Canada, the party 
in power.  This is the member's opportunity during this supply 
day motion to indicate how her party is going to equip our 
military and how they are going to give our military people a 
decent standard of living.  How is she going to do it?

which has shown us how widespread the problem related to the 
armed forces is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what he is calling for is what all Canadians are 
waiting for.  I believe no one in Canada would fault the 
government for making an official announcement, by either the 
Prime Minister or the Minister of National Defence, on measures 
that can be taken immediately to improve the situation of all 
our military personnel, as well as measures for the medium term. 
This could, obviously, mean they would end up with a budget 
spread out over at least five years, for better equipment 
management

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague whether what he is referring to is what the 
auditor general found, the total absence of a strategic plan for 
the Canadian Armed Forces, a plan which would enable it to 
define priorities for the short, medium and long terms for the 
navy, army and air force, through measures that could be 
implemented immediately, tomorrow morning, in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has referred to rationalization. 
Everyone agrees with this, but there are some measures in place 
at the present time that need to be corrected.  I would like to 
know whether this is what my hon. colleague was referring to. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague for his question because he puts his finger right on 
the whole issue.  The auditor general is saying the government 
has no vision for the future, there is no plan, there is no 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we should do is decide what role we want the 
military to play.  How do we decide that?  Let us ask the people 
of this country.  Should we be peacekeepers or peacemakers? There 
is an enormous difference. Let us ask our people whether we want 
to send our military into conflict areas, not to maintain peace 
but in an attempt to establish peace through armed conflict.  Is 
that what we want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should know what the people of Canada want us to do.  Let us 
consult with our military advisers.  Let us consult with members 
of parliament. Above all, let us consult with the people of 
Canada whose sons and daughters we are going to send to face 
these crises, whether it is in this country through a natural 
crisis or through armed conflict in another country.  Let us 
decide.  Let us not have another report from the auditor general 
that says there is no plan, there is no strategy and there is no 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this government so far has been offering.  Again 
the Tory party today has offered the Government of Canada an 
opportunity to place its vision for the future of the military 
before the people of this House, the elected representatives of 
the people of Canada, as well as the people themselves.  Where is 
the vision?  Where is the strategy?  Where is the plan that the 
auditor general called for?  Where is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the opportunity now for perhaps the minister or someone 
else who knows to stand and express that vision.  Where is it? 
Are we going to go to another auditor general's report and have 
him report the same thing, that there is no strategy, no plan and 
no vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity. I am asking members, rather 
than just attack the opposition parties, please let us hear the 
plan, let us hear the strategy. The auditor general is crying out 
for it.  Of course the opposition members are calling out for it 
and the people of Canada are calling out for it.  But above all, 
the people in the military are calling out for some kind of 
leadership from this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
put a question to my hon. colleague from the Reform Party. Among 
the problems affecting our armed forces, I wonder if he does not 
see anything wrong with our military personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the statistics to be found in part III of the 
latest estimates, in the volume about National Defence, the 
three branches of the armed forces, Air, Land and Sea, include 
81,000 individuals, 20,000 civilians and 61,000 military 
personnel. Of these 61,000 military personnel, only 6,500 are 
privates. All the others are officers of the air, land or sea 
forces. For instance, there are 28,000 corporals for 6,000 
privates. There are 6,000 sergeants. Higher up, above warrant 
officers and chief warrant officers, there are 1,487 
lieutenants. There are 6,333 captains to supervise these 1,487 
lieutenants. 
There are 2,938 majors and 66 generals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Minister of National Defence stated that 
morale was low in the armed forces. This may be one of the 
reasons. I can understand that the 6,500 privates must have no 
hope of a promotion because, out of 61,000 members, there are 
55,000 people above them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have highly competent officers who have 6,500 privates 
working for them. Does that make sense? I would like to find out 
what my Reform colleague thinks of this whole situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question.  He certainly came to this debate well informed 
with statistics.  They say that if you are well prepared, you 
shall not fear.  If that is how we can view our military, as well 
prepared and well armed, then Canada need not fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the crux of my hon. colleague's question, our 
military is overweight at the top end.  There are a lot of 
unaccountable people shuffling papers, playing golf, looking at 
one another and wondering what the poor people are doing.  We 
should closely look at our military to determine whether or not 
there is a proper balance in terms of funding and leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership is so important at the grassroots level.  It 
determines the morale of the members, the direction we will take 
and the execution of plans.  It is very important.  There is no 
question that there are more generals in the army today than we 
had during the second world war in the Canadian military. Is that 
needed?  Is that wise?  How did it get there and why?  The big 
question is, is that what we want?  Is that the role we want?  Or 
do we want the kind of military that is top heavy with leaders, 
certainly generals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at those questions.  This is a good opportunity 
for my hon. colleague and the rest of us in the House to debate 
this issue and ask the government, which is in control and has 
the power to do these things, whether or not it has any answers 
to these questions.  Now is the time.  Today is the day these 
questions can be answered by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As the time has expired, we will take up the 
debate after.  We will now go to Statements by Members.

Speaker, the Sault Ste. Marie canal is being honoured in 
“Navigating a Nation”, a set of 10 stamps that pay tribute to 
Canada's inland waterways.  The Sault canal is the final link in 
an all-Canadian water route that extends from the Atlantic Ocean 
to the head of Lake Superior.  It was the first inland waterway 
in the world to have an electrically powered lock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saultites recognize the importance of the canal to their city 
and to Great Lakes shipping.  It is certainly welcome news in my 
riding that Canada Post has chosen to immortalize this world 
famous waterway in a beautifully designed stamp.  The issue of 
these stamps could not come at a better time.  The Sault canal 
lock which has been closed since 1987 is expected to reopen to 
recreational boat traffic early this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hats off to Canada Post for acknowledging the importance of our 
inland waterways and to Parks Canada for making possible the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
has been 29 years since abortion was legalized in this country. 
In those days abortion was used only where a mother's life or 
health was endangered.  But today I think it has gone too far, 
especially when we see taxpayer funded abortions on demand, 
increased diagnoses of post-abortion trauma, indication of 
medical linkages to breast cancer, minors given abortion without 
parental consent and approximately $50 million spent annually on 
abortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everybody in the Reform caucus or across the country agrees 
with me. That is why the Reform Party's responsible position is 
to identify abortion as an issue of personal conscience and 
supports informed debate and giving people a voice through a 
national referendum.  Canadians should be allowed to examine the 
facts on all sides of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, women have a right to know about the risks of 
abortion and taxpayers should know the cost.  For me, if it is 
about choice, let us give women better choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the autumn of 1996, Cindy and three of her children began a 
horseback camping vacation in B.C.  Shortly after their trip

regard for her personal welfare, Cindy left the safety of her 
horse and rushed to Steven's defence.  Despite the poor odds 
Cindy saved her son by diverting the cat's attention to herself. 
During the scramble Cindy instructed her other children to carry 
Steven over two kilometres to the closest source of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the dozens of stitches that he required Steven survived. 
However Cindy was not so lucky.  Only hours after the ordeal 
began Cindy succumbed to the wounds that she sustained during the

one wage earner families in the country have looked for a long 
time for a tax break from government.  The recent budget of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact by offering more relief only to those families that 
avail themselves of day care, the finance minister has once again 
discriminated against stay at home moms and dads.  In so doing he 
perpetuates an economic system with high taxes and high 
unemployment that forces many Canadian parents to both go to 
work.

development.  Many of these children grow up with role models who 
do not reflect their parents' values and beliefs.

Excellence from the Canadian Nuclear Association for its 
exceptional contribution to the development of fusion science 
and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Tokamak project, in Varennes, came to an 
abrupt end, last Tuesday, because of the total lack of vision 
and foresight of the Liberal government. Its penny pinching, by 
completely cutting its modest $7.2 million annual contribution, 
led to the Tokamak project being shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is much more than $7.2 million in annual investment from 
the federal government that the province of Quebec will lose. 
It will lose the fruit of 20 years of labour, tens of millions 
of dollars in investments, first class research infrastructures, 
significant technological benefits, a promising renewable energy 
project, world renowned and experienced researchers and an 
enviable international reputation in the area of nuclear fusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today at the hepatitis C conference the victims blew the lid off 
the health minister's excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the Canadian Hemophilia Society told the conference 
that the number of victims infected before 1986 who are sick 
enough to need compensation is probably only 5,000 to 8,000. That 
is a far cry from the 60,000 people the health minister's 
propaganda suggests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared to pay all those victims who are sick 
enough to help, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it would appear the organizations of victims had a very 
useful dialogue with the provincial health ministers and the 
federal health minister.  Now the ministers are carrying on a 
discussion and we are very anxious to see what consensus will 
emerge on the part of the provincial ministers so that we can 
take appropriate action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it seems that in these discussions the federal health minister 
has sat in stony silence.  Nobody knows what the federal 
government's position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highest responsibility lies with the federal government 
because it is the regulator of the blood system.  This government 
is trying to blame the provinces and say it is their fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this government accept its responsibility and compensate 
all these victims, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has 
always acted responsibly.  I remind the member that when Justice 
Krever published his first interim report the Government of 
Canada acted immediately on all recommendations that had 
relevance under federal authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that same federal authority, the federal minister brought 
his colleagues together and together they fashioned out packages 
that served the short term, medium term and long term interests 
of both hepatitis C victims and those who need a health care 
system that addresses need when it occurs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on the contrary, the provinces were the ones that called for this 
get together.  It certainly was not the federal health minister 
who called for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Page of the Canadian Hemophilia Society said this today 
when he came out of the meeting: “Three provinces, Ontario, 
Quebec and B.C., are willing to move forward.  What is missing is 
federal money here.  With federal money we think the rest of the 
provinces would be on side”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, will the government commit to leading the way in giving 
compensation to all victims who need government help, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has 
always and continues to believe in addressing the needs of 
Canadians as they occur. It also believes in working together 
with all the deliverers of the health care system and they are 
the provincial and territorial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done and continue to do is address the interests of 
all Canadians in a collaborative effort in order to be efficient 
and effective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, listen to 
the government's excuses for not compensating these victims. 
First off, its numbers.  It said 60,000 to 80,000 victims.  The 
victims say it is 23,000.  It then goes on to the issue of fault. 
The victims say they will sign no fault.  It then said the whole 
thing would break the system.  These are all excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government continuing to try to get this conference 
to fail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member himself in the House said that 
compensation should be based on fault.  Now he has changed his 
position from what he originally said.  So much for his 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want this conference to fail.  We want it to succeed 
in the interests of victims.  We are actively taking part in the 
conference and trying to treat the matter very seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make 
my position clear again: compensation for every victim.  This is 
quite different from the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the headline the health minister hopes to take out of 
this meeting: “Oh, we couldn't reach a consensus.  The provinces 
are at fault”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this federal government had taken a powerful position into 
these meetings, if it had gone in there as leaders, we would have 
a solution to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this federal government been followers instead of 
leaders? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not imagine the member 
opposite has ever thought that his theatrics might be clouding 
his judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we have a conference attended by ministers at all 
three levels sitting together trying to fashion out a package 
that will address all the needs of all the victims and all 
sufferers is an indication of leadership. 
If he objects to leadership that involves the federal authority 
bringing together partners at the provincial and territorial 
level, he has a different—

threat of separation, this kind of problem is to be expected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister recognize that, by the irresponsible remarks 
he made and keeps making, he is condoning and justifying the

simply asking the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who 
made some unfortunate statements, to give us an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister not admit that his ministerial responsibility 
is not to add fuel to the fire on an issue such as this one, but 
rather to strongly condemn those who want to prevent someone 
from getting a job because of his political beliefs?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

in Canada creates this kind of difficulty.

more acute with the threat of separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize what he just said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not understand that he just sent the message to all 
sovereignists in Quebec that the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedom, which prohibits discrimination based on political

is freedom of conscience. I strongly believe that politics 
should have no influence whatsoever on the public service. I 
would never ask anybody to take an oath of allegiance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

provocative stance and not to carry out any nuclear tests.  We 
have also called in the Pakistani high commissioner to Canada and 
given him the same message.

nuclear materials and technology to nations that refuse to sign 
the non-proliferation treaty.  Canada is hiding under the nuclear 
umbrella of the U.S. and NATO.  Canada has failed to aggressively 
push for the global elimination of nuclear weapons.  Canada must 
end its own ambiguity and complicity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

so with respect to Pakistan.  We cancelled our nuclear program 
with that country at the same time we cancelled our program with 
India almost 25 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, we have already sent a firm message to Pakistan 
that it should not take a provocative stance, that it should not 
carry out tests.  Certainly it is a signal that the action we 
have taken against Indian we are ready to take against Pakistan. 
We hope it will not be necessary.  With respect to the measures 
we are already looking at taking against India, we are 
considering applying, if necessary, the same further steps 
against Pakistan.  That is firm action and I think it speaks for 
itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to take part in this debate.  I noticed that the motion 
deals with the failure of this government to provide political 
leadership.  I am very surprised to see that given the track 
record of this government.  Clearly their definition of political 
leadership and ours is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to be splitting my time with the member for 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight a couple of issues and specifically talk 
about the reserves.  Since this government took office in 1994 it 
has restored public confidence and pride in the Canadian 
military.  We have given the forces a clear mandate to change the 
way we do business and get a bigger bang for the buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 we produced the defence white paper.  We cut the 
bureaucracy and reduced the number of top military brass.  There 
was procurement reform and 3,000 more soldiers were added to the 
army.  We increased the number of reservists to 30,000.  We have 
re-equipped the forces.  This is clearly leadership, not failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the hon. member across the way would put 
such a motion forth.  I am not going to dwell on the record of 
the Conservative Party or the comments we heard during the 
election from the Reform Party.  I want to talk about positive 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of negatives in the House so I want to talk about 
the positive things this government has been doing, in particular 
the leadership we have shown with regard to the armed forces and 
in dealing with the issue of the reserves and the total force 
concept outlined in the 1994 white paper on defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning with the first principle, reserves are value added 
because they are so deeply embedded in Canadian society and our 
Canadian traditions.  The militia idea goes back to the earliest 
days of New France.  Citizen soldiers fought off attacks on their 
country in the 1770s and again in the War of 1812.  They were the 
backbone of national defence after the establishment of the 
modern Canadian state in 1867.  They kept their skills alive at a 
time when Canadians wanted to think about anything but war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a proud military tradition in this country.  One just 
has to look back to the first world war, Vimy Ridge; the second 
world war, D-Day and the battle of the Atlantic; recently the 
Persian gulf.  Canada has participated in over 40 peacekeeping 
operations.  This is a record we can be proud of as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians fought and died in Korea between 1950 and 1953.  They 
have shown bravery.  They were the shock troops of Europe in the 
first and second world wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserves in particular are a bridge between the regular 
forces and the Canadian public.  They are made up of the Canadian 
public all across this country.  Most important of all, the 
reserves are a vital and relevant defence resource implicit in 
the message of the total force.  The reserves are not a frill or 
some out moded luxury.  They are a necessity, an integral part of 
the Canadian forces.  They are able and expected to augment and 
sustain regular units or, in some cases, execute specific tasks 
not generally carried out by the regular forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The militia has since the 19th century provided individuals and 
entire units for the whole range of army imperatives.  Naval 
reservists have major responsibility for coastal and harbour 
defence and naval control of shipping.  The air reserve is 
creating a national pool of trained personnel to supply air force 
deployments at home and away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communication reserve has been a leader in the 
implementation of the total force.  The Canadian Rangers provide 
a military profile in our vast north and other isolated areas of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During operation recuperation when we met the storm of the 
century with the largest peacetime deployment of the Canadian 
forces in our history, the reserves were there.  The reserves 
supplied fully one-quarter of the more than 16,000 military 
complement which carried out essential tasks in Ontario, Quebec 
and New Brunswick. 
The availability of these reservists demonstrates the value added 
effect of this service because we could not afford an additional 
4,000 regulars to be available on such short notice for such 
emergencies.  I know my hon. friend across the way would agree 
with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of what the reservists did during the ice storm of 
1998 and what they did during the floods in Manitoba and in the 
Saguenay.  I know hon. members feel the same delight as I feel 
that our men and women are cheered on the streets across this 
country for what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief of defence staff likes to remind us, the ice storm 
highlighted one of the Canadian forces' most essential roles, 
protecting the lives and possessions of Canadians in times of 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be less than frank if I did not think and say that these 
recent operations in Canada have helped with restoring the 
contract of trust between Canadians and the forces. Reservists 
are every bit as important a part of this process as our regular 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government took office it very quickly made it a high 
priority to reform, modernize and upgrade the reserves as part of 
the program to improve the overall capacity and operational 
effectiveness of the entire force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need well trained and well equipped reservists, organized and 
cohesive and logical military structures which use resources more 
effectively than in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is easier to criticize than it is to provide 
solutions.  The government has been providing solutions since 
1994 on this issue.  But again we will hear all the negatives. We 
will not hear the positives because of course that is not the job 
or the role of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put a great deal of study into the restructuring of the 
reserves, including the convening of a special commission.  The 
most complicated aspect of a restructuring program concerns the 
militia.  We have decided to reorder the geographically based 
districts into brigade groups, organized along functional lines, 
again showing leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is engaged in an evaluation program based on 
carefully thought out criteria and extensive consultation with 
the reserve constituency, notably honorary colonels of the 
reserve 2000 committee.  The final decision will not be easy but 
I know that every effort will be made to make it fair and to make 
it equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the complex labour goes on the government has not stood 
still on other fronts.  We have improved equipment available to 
reservists. The soldier project, Griffon helicopters for the 400 
squadron at Borden and the 438 squadron at Saint-Hubert, and the 
delivery of maritime coastal defence vessels are some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year we have introduced an improved pay and 
benefit package for reservists which, combined with the reserve 
force retirement gratuity, demonstrates the commitment to 
recognize and to compensate our citizen soldiers for their 
sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the assistance of the House of Commons Standing Committee 
on National Defence and Veterans Affairs we are also examining in 
a comprehensive way the needs of people in the military.  We must 
ensure we provide an appropriate level of support to the men and 
women of the forces and their families and that includes 
reservists.  I know my friends and colleagues on the other side 
would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces liaison council is making great strides in 
protecting civilian jobs and benefits of reservists.  There are 
over 4,500 employees in the databank.  Over 3,000 of them have 
stated their support of the reserves, while 1,800 have agreed to 
grant military leave to reserve employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we can be very proud of the work our reservists do. 
Concerning underrating and underutilizing reserves in the past, 
we are taking care of that.  We find them indispensable and they 
have shown their commitment to their country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Oak Ridges for his comments.  I am always 
quite interested in the reserves, being a reserve member for six 
years many years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the member's comments, where he is talking about what we 
have done for the reserves, going in the wrong direction.  Yes, 
we have added numbers to the reserves but we have cut down their 
hours.  We have cut them to less than half and also we have cut 
out all the exercises they do.  So what we are doing is cutting 
out their training.  We are not giving them a chance to train 
properly.  So instead of getting higher quality reserves, we are 
lowering the quality of our reserves and they do not deserve 
that, particularly since we are using reserves an awful lot these 
days overseas. 
It is important that they get good basic training at the reserve 
level so they can continue on at the regular level.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also talking about preparation and equipment and I 
thought I would mention at this point our submarines.  He 
mentioned the 1994 white paper.  The white paper was quite clear 
that we needed those submarines and it was a good deal. That was 
four years ago.  We finally ordered the submarines, but it will 
take a couple of years for them to get here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime this month we have another submarine that is 
being decommissioned and another one will be in September.  That 
will leave us with one submarine.  That is our total fleet.  We 
will go for a couple of years with one submarine.  It is not very 
logical.  That submarine will not be out too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member would care to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
for his comments.  As far as the reserves are concerned we are 
going through a process.  We have made improvements, as I said 
earlier in the House, whether it be in terms of pay and benefits 
or whether it be in terms of equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the process is not finished.  We obviously want to have 
the best equipped, the best trained reserves and armed forces 
generally.  Rome was not built in a day and clearly we are 
improving.  As far as submarines are concerned, we did not buy 
the nuclear submarines to which the previous government had 
committed itself, but we have an agreement now in terms of the 
four new submarines from England.  It is excellent value for the 
Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we do not want to be in a position as we were in 
preparing for the first and the second world wars when we did not 
have the necessary equipment.  We want to make sure that if we 
are to send our forces overseas on peacekeeping missions or 
involve them in activities in this country we have the right 
personnel with the right equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even heard in the House today that the Government of Italy 
requested that Canada provide assistance.  Again we have 
personnel who are recognized for their professionalism around the 
world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we on this 
side of the House are trying today to bring forth the concerns 
and the situation in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep listening to the other side of the House which is 
pointing the finger at past governments.  I do not know how far 
back they will go to past governments.  I am expecting that soon 
they will be talking of Sir John A. Macdonald and blaming him for 
some of these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the concerns my colleagues and I have been addressing 
today are related to dollars.  Others are related to how people 
are treated.  Those are concerns that I believe most of my 
colleagues on both sides and I have.  That is what we want to 
debate today.  We are discussing these issues so people, 
parliamentarians and Canadians know there are concerns out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I never mentioned past 
governments other than my comment on nuclear submarines.  I am 
quite frankly not interested in what the previous government did 
because I am interested in what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked about whether we had failed in political 
leadership.  I demonstrated at the very beginning all the things 
the government has done.  The gentlemen over there should listen 
up.  If they ask questions they had better be prepared to listen 
to the answers.  Otherwise they should not ask questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to be participating in the debate today on 
the opposition day motion.  Just to get the motion on the record, 
it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to provide 
strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sponsored by the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead.  I 
have had the pleasure of working with the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead over the last number of months. 
The two of us are on the national defence and veterans affairs 
committee.  I must say that he is a very diligent worker and that 
he brings a lot to the table in terms of discussion.  He has done 
a good job that way.  The hon. member would probably agree as 
well that in framing the motion as he did he very much overstated 
the case with respect to the current situation in the armed 
forces.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take the opportunity to put this matter into some 
perspective.  Certainly the world has changed greatly over the 
1990s.  The challenges we have faced in the 1990s and the 
rapidity of change we have experienced as a society and indeed 
right across the globe have been tremendous.  Governments have 
tried to respond to that as best they could, and our government 
is no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we faced the prospect of forming a government in 1993 
clearly we were concerned about security issues.  All Canadians 
are concerned about security issues.  One of the foremost 
security issues we had to face in 1993 was our financial 
security.  As a result some decisions had to be made.  When we 
had a $42 billion deficit to deal with, some decisions had to be 
taken with respect to restoring financial security to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result cutbacks had to be made in government.  It was not 
just the Department of National Defence that experienced those 
cutbacks.  There were many other departments.  It is safe to say, 
and most members would agree, that there has been a significant 
cutback in government activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, in the post-deficit situation we face right 
now there is a realization and a recognition that some of the 
departments of government used to perform a lot more activities 
than they do now.  There has to be some action taken to address 
the problems that have occurred in those departments, and the 
Department of National Defence is certainly one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its budget has been reduced, as has already been mentioned, from 
$12 billion in 1993-94 to its current situation of $9.38 billion 
in 1998-99.  This process has not been easy.  I have to salute 
the Minister of National Defence for his actions since he took 
the post.  He has done what no other minister of national defence 
was prepared to do, which was to have the national defence 
committee go across the country to talk with individual soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and women to find out what concerned them, what 
was on their mind, what were the issues they had to deal with on 
a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That took a lot of political courage.  When we start a process 
like that one we really have no idea where the whole process will 
end up.  From that standpoint the minister is to be 
congratulated.  Having had the opportunity to discuss this issue 
with the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead, he would generally 
agree with the observation that it took some political courage to 
do what the Minister of National Defence has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, we have had the opportunity to go to 
many bases.  Just to give an example, the committee touched down 
and held hearings in Yellowknife, Esquimalt, Comox, Edmonton, 
Cold Lake, Moose Jaw, Val Cartier, Bagotville, Kingston, 
Petawawa, North Bay, Trenton, Gagetown, Goose Bay and Halifax. 
For anyone who was counting that was 15 different locations to 
date.  I have had the pleasure of speaking to Canadian forces 
members in all but two of those locations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal from members of the Canadian forces. 
We have heard about the issue of salary.  There is no doubt that 
the issue of salary is one that is very important to members of 
the Canadian forces, especially younger members of the forces 
that occupy the junior ranks, the privates and corporals of the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I frankly do not know how some of them are able to do it on the 
salary they are making right now.  Their starting salary is 
$17,000 and $18,000.  The salary rises as the spend more time and 
are eligible for pay increments, but members of the national 
defence committee would agree that base salary has to rise.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already taken steps to improve the salaries 
of members of the Canadian forces.  I hope that in the not too 
distant future we will be able to see further improvements in 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of housing has been mentioned.  That is certainly one 
of the more important issues for members of the forces who have 
families and are living in the PMQs.  We have seen some very poor 
accommodation for members of the forces in many locations across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very old stock and it needs to be replaced.  How we do 
that in today's financial environment will take a lot of 
innovation and creativity on behalf of employees of the 
Department of National Defence in the Canadian forces housing 
agency who are charged with that responsibility.  I hope they are 
up to the task because our soldiers, sailors and airmen and women 
certainly deserve better than what they have right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard about other issues including the care of the 
wounded and the injured.  There should be better ways of dealing 
with the problem of unemployed spouses on Canadian bases.  It 
continues to be a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many families take two incomes for granted, but that is not 
often the case at a Canadian forces base.  A spouse has 
difficulty getting employment with private businesses outside the 
base. Many employers refuse to hire them when they know they will 
be posted somewhere else in a few years.  They are not prepared 
to make investments in terms of training and skills.  We have 
also heard about the problem of post traumatic stress syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just a few of the problems we have heard about in the 
course of our hearings across the country.  The hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead would agree that at the same time there is a 
tremendous esprit de corps in the forces.  Some people say that 
the overall morale in the Canadian forces could probably be 
improved quite significantly but that the unit morale is very 
strong. There is a strong esprit de corps or a strong connection 
between people working in a platoon, a company or as part of a 
ship's crew or air crew.  They feel proud to wear Canada's 
uniform. They feel proud of the record of our Canadian forces men 
and women abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of equipment is important.  The forces are in the 
process of enhancing or improving the equipment available to 
them.  As I mentioned in earlier comments today, our navy is 
among the most modern in the world in terms of the technology it 
has available.  The same can be said of our air forces with the 
CF-18s and their precision guided weapons which are among the 
most modern in the world.  The army definitely needs more 
equipment.  The government is in the process of equipping it with 
new armoured personnel carriers and other equipment it needs in 
terms of clothe the soldier program and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than condemning the government, the opposition should be 
congratulating it for having the political courage to go out 
there to speak to the men and women of the Canadian forces to 
learn what is on their minds.  I congratulate the Minister of 
National Defence and the government for their courage in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately the matter rests with the government.  As far as the 
men and women of the Canadian forces are concerned I am confident 
the government will do the right thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member who has just spoken.  This has 
been perhaps the most open and honest approach we have heard from 
that side all day.  I commend him for that.  At least he alluded 
to the problems we face.  I assure him that this side of the 
House and the committee to which he referred will be looking 
forward to his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read in newspapers and magazines about the problem of the 
Department of National Defence in relation to NCOs and 
commissioned officers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a part of Canada which has the RCMP as the 
provincial police force.  I have been in the same area for a long 
time.  The highest ranking officer that has ever been in our 
detachment, albeit this is the RCMP, is a corporal.  Imagine 
having three sergeants and one constable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I heard correctly today, and this is part of the problem that 
the government should be addressing, we have something like 65 
generals in the Canadian army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will have to 
interrupt the hon. member, because we have another question to 
go.  The hon. member for Nepean—Carleton can form a response to 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  I would be happy to, Mr. Speaker.  Were 
there too many generals at one time in the Canadian forces?  I 
think the answer is yes.  The number has been brought down from 
approximately 130 to about 70. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Sixty-five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  There you go.  Are there too many?  We 
are working toward 60,000 regular members at this point in the 
Canadian forces.  Are 60 some generals too many?  I am not sure 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one comment that I did receive which I think the hon. 
member would be interested in.  I was speaking to a 
non-commissioned officer in Halifax.  He mentioned to me 
something which I thought was very interesting which was that 
only nine members of the Canadian forces earn over $100,000 per 
year. That is for an organization that, as I mentioned earlier, 
takes from the federal budget $9.3 billion and has a complement 
of 60,000. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member opposite mentioned that there was good esprit de corps in 
the armed services. I would like to quote from an April edition 
of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“To make any unit run, you have to have esprit de corps,” said 
Warrant Officer George Parrott of Edmonton, who served in 
Croatia, Bosnia, Germany and Quebec during January's ice storm. 
“When I joined in '83 they made you feel good about working as 
hard as you possibly could to achieve the highest level you 
could.  Right now, there is not that feeling of being proud of 
who you are and what you represent”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is by a member of the armed services speaking about the 
assault on morale.  How does the member reconcile his remarks 
with these comments from an enlisted person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, I 
have had the opportunity to visit about 13 of the 15 bases where 
the committee has held hearings.  I can say this quite honestly. 
I have talked to hundreds of members of the Canadian forces.  I 
am giving my general observations. Certainly there are going to 
be people in an organization as large as the Canadian Armed 
Forces who are going to have different views on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general observation I have had from people is that within 
their own unit when they are tasked to go to Bosnia, or 
participate with the army, or if they are on board one of our 
frigates, whether it is the HMCS <I>Toronto</I>, the 
<I>Vancouver</I> or the <I>Ville de Québec</I>, the ship's crew, 
the companies, the battalions, are very proud of what they do. 
They are very concerned about some issues obviously in terms of 
pay and benefits and those sorts of things. In terms of 
discharging their work, they are very professional.  They are 
very proud people and very happy to wear the uniform of the 
Canadian forces.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
honored to speak to this motion, which reads:

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to 
provide strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian 
Forces. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking on this motion, it is very important to note the 
words “provide strong political leadership”. 
Note that the motion does not simply say provide leadership, but 
political leadership.  This puts the emphasis on the elected 
representatives which is where I believe it firmly belongs.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, when we speak of the Canadian forces we are speaking about 
the civilian and the military components, a fact which often 
escapes the public.  Sometimes when the public think about the 
Canadian forces, they think solely about those men and women in 
uniform.  We must remember that there is also an important 
contingent of men and women working side by side those men and 
women in uniform.  They are the civilian workers who team up to 
provide Canada with an excellent, proud and professional service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also when we think about the Canadian forces, we have to 
remember that the people working for the Canadian forces 
sometimes find themselves in a category of occupation which is 
often overlooked by the public except in times of emergencies, 
such as policemen, firefighters and emergency workers.  These are 
people with jobs we would not normally want to do ourselves but 
we are certainly happy to have them there when the occasion and 
the need arises.  Perhaps politicians fall in that category as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the category of workers who sometimes find 
themselves in a thankless job. People are their friends as long 
as they are doing exactly what they want them to do but the 
minute that is not the case they seem to forget about them.  We 
have to remember that sometimes the public do not give as much 
recognition and as much honour as they should to the people in 
our Canadian forces.  Because of the nature of this occupation it 
is very important that we have good leadership, not only 
leadership within the services, but also good political 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing the public sometimes fail to remember is that a 
job in the military today, even though we talk about 
peacekeeping, is still very dangerous. It is not a job to be 
taken lightly.  In an article in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine 
Sergeant Dale Lyne in speaking about his work in Bosnia talked 
about the fact that his engineer regiment dodged booby traps to 
defuse land mines.  They survived having guns held to their heads 
by the local combatants.  They retrieved body parts of soldiers 
blown up by mines.  This is certainly not a job a lot of us would 
aspire to.  Because of the nature of this job, we feel it is 
important that there be adequate political leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes us feel that today there is not that quality of 
leadership?  Already the member opposite has mentioned many of 
the problems that would support the fact that there is need for 
good strong political leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard about low morale because of frozen pay levels and 
lack of promotions.  There are a lot of problems around family 
life and inadequate housing. Many spouses find themselves unable 
to meet their daily expenses and struggle while their spouses are 
away.  We hear stories about soldiers having to buy their own 
boots to serve in Bosnia. There are many instances which we read 
about or hear about which lead us to feel that there is just 
cause for the low morale which exists within the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of military members who have families.  We are told that 
the long absences can be devastating for those who are left 
behind.  I read in a magazine article about Andrea Grant who has 
two children and is married to a leading seaman at CFB Halifax. 
She lives in a cramped apartment in the city's north end.  She 
said that she sometimes cries herself to sleep when her husband 
is at sea. Not too many of us can relate to the feeling of having 
to cry oneself to sleep because their loved one is away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally can empathize to a certain point with the aspect of 
someone being away that you care about.  My father worked on the 
railway. 
He was away from home at least three or four days each week.  As 
a young boy growing up I can well remember how much we missed his 
presence in the home and how happy we were when we would hear the 
doorbell ring when he returned home from his trip on the train. 
He had a special ring on the doorbell and we automatically knew 
it was him.  Even the family dog recognized that ring of the 
doorbell and would jump up and run to the door before any of us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was not in any danger when he was away. He was working 
on the train and unless there was a train accident he was quite 
safe.  But our armed services personnel are quite often away in a 
foreign land in a different culture.  They are faced with unknown 
things that may occur, for example land mines.  We can therefore 
understand why someone like Andrea would cry herself to sleep 
while her loved one was away. These are some of the things which 
our armed services personnel are faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we read stories, one as recently as in today's paper, 
reportedly, and I say reportedly because all the facts are not in 
yet, but reportedly about a $2 million party for the top brass in 
the military.  When we look at this kind of expense, whether it 
be $2 million or $300,000 as the minister said today in question 
period, it is still a fairly major expense for a celebration when 
people are faced with an inadequate amount of money perhaps to 
buy medicine for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another story along those lines. Quoting from a 
magazine, we are told the story of Kathy Couture who had never 
broken the law in her life until one night in October 1996.  She 
walked into a pharmacy in Victoria, slipped a bottle of 
children's Tylenol into her pocket and walked back out.  She said 
“I was terrified.  I shook for hours when I got home”. 
Couture's six year old daughter Natasha had a raging fever.  It 
was five days until her husband, sailor Mario Couture, would be 
paid and the family did not have the $5 to pay for the medicine. 
They had moved to Victoria from Halifax only weeks before and 
they knew no one they could ask for the money. “My husband was 
shocked.  I was shocked”, said Couture.  “I still cannot 
believe I did that.  But I had to”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion of this story talks about the parliamentary 
committee that travelled to Victoria in January.  Her husband 
chose not to speak.  He was afraid he might be too honest and 
would offend some people, but Kathy did speak out.  She did speak 
out because she had hurt so much.  She said it is her friends and 
neighbours in the military subdivision that kept her going while 
Mario was at sea.  “It is very hard on your self-esteem.  I 
think to myself I am worth more than this”.  Kathy can only hope 
the politicians hear her testimony and agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say today it is important that we as politicians hear 
these stories, understand and show some empathy.  When we are 
making decisions concerning our armed forces we should not look 
at the bottom line as being the dollar but rather look with a 
compassionate heart to see what we can do to help our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence said today in question period 
when he was talking about the forest fires in Alberta that once 
again the armed forces were coming to the aid of fellow 
Canadians.  I would ask today, who is coming to the aid of our 
Canadian forces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member if he feels that the initiative that 
was undertaken by the minister was a worthwhile one, in terms of 
having the national defence committee go from base to base asking 
members of the forces about the problems regarding salary, living 
conditions and working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not concede in his franker moments that 
was an act of political leadership relating to the forces, it was 
something that was absolutely necessary?  It is a difficult 
process and one that certainly has not been easy for the 
government in terms of hearing the various stories that have come 
up.  It is a difficult process and one which was absolutely 
necessary under the circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I would ask concerns the Canadian public as 
a whole.  The hon. member may or may not be aware that I have a 
motion on the order paper to declare June 15 as Canadian forces 
day and to celebrate the achievements of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that something the member and his party could support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those two 
very interesting questions.  Certainly it is very important for 
the standing committee to hear stories directly from members of 
the Canadian forces about what they are experiencing.  Even more 
important than hearing them would be for the government to show 
strong political leadership to follow up on the concerns in a 
meaningful way to address the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to declaring a given day as Canadian armed forces 
day, we always have to be careful that when we declare any given 
day as a special day we do not lose sight of the fact that every 
day of our lives should be special for those issues.  We cannot 
weaken our obligation in that way by just having a special day 
where we highlight certain things.  It is important to 
concentrate each day of our lives upon the concerns of our 
Canadian forces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it rather interesting that the NDP member is talking from 
the heart about this issue.  As we travelled to different bases I 
was very disappointed to see that members of the NDP were not 
that involved.  They did not show up at a lot of the places 
except if it happened to be in one of their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are self-professed as being very strong in the ASD file. We 
really did not hear a lot from them.  Maybe the member could 
answer as to why they did not show up at those meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, rather than answering why 
we did or why we did not I would like to emphasize some of the 
things we in fact did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our members travelled to Goose Bay, Labrador, to see 
firsthand the situation involving the downsizing of services 
there.  Many members of our party have been involved directly 
with military personnel and with civilian personnel and hearing 
their concerns firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may not have been in the same places as the hon. member but 
we have been there.  We have always been there and we will 
continue to be there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 1993 the 
NDP had chosen to help the military by voting against the 
purchase of EH-101 helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering why today we hear complaints from members of the 
NDP who say that the government should be supporting things of 
this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I always find questions a 
bit amusing when people point to something in the past and try to 
justify exactly what is happening today.  The hon. member can 
look to his own party.  He can look to positions that were taken 
at one point in time and then subsequently changed for whatever 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the present situation with respect to our 
Canadian forces.  We are supportive of the concerns they brought 
forward.  We want to work in the best interest of resolving those 
issues.  I do not want to dwell upon past history which has no 
meaning to what we are concerned about today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in the debate this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who served for a brief period on the defence 
committee and to elaborate on the last question asked about why 
we were not more visible at those public hearings, I remember 
that the first swing the committee took was in late January.  Our 
caucus had a meeting and a subsequent meeting the following 
weekend so I was only able to get to one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must respond to the question of the hon. member for 
Nepean—Carleton regarding whether it demonstrates great 
political leadership and wisdom to convene the committee to hear 
frankly from military men and women about pay and rations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calling a committee meeting probably demonstrates the absence of 
political leadership.  The easiest thing anybody can do is to 
have a committee to discuss an issue.  As I said in committee, 
and I feel very comfortable standing in my place and saying it 
here today, a lot of this was about busy work.  It was to keep 
the defence committee travelling around.  It was also demeaning 
to hear people admit that they used food banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meeting I attended in Moose Jaw in late January, Mr. Cory 
Robinson, a second lieutenant at CFB Moose Jaw, indicated he had 
to go to the local town and country mall to moonlight there for 
$5.75 an hour to properly feed, house and clothe his family.  It 
must have been extremely difficult for Cory Robinson and hundreds 
of other people who attended those meetings.  They all came out 
because they are concerned but I am sure it was not easy for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember saying at a committee meeting last fall that I did 
not run for parliament to determine what was an appropriate pay 
and ration for men and women who serve in the military forces.  I 
am aware that there are professional people who do this on a 
permanent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are standards.  There are groups that are at the lower end 
of the pay scale and others at the upper end that are doing 
relatively the same kind of work such as police officers and 
firefighters.  If we look to the United States, the United 
Kingdom or other appropriate countries we can find their levels 
of pay and benefits for military men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not accept that it is showing great political leadership to 
have directed the defence and veterans affairs committee to 
travel around the country to meet with people to discuss this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was probably a way of keeping the defence committee from 
looking at other things that would be more relevant.  Obviously 
we do need an effective well paid military, but if we wanted to 
look at the helicopter issue or submarine issue in a more in 
depth basis we could not do it because we were travelling to look 
at pay and benefits.  I do not accept at all the premise I have 
heard earlier this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Halifax West also talked about alternate 
service delivery.  That has been a major concern in the Palliser 
riding which has 15 Wing Moose Jaw.  I will read into the record 
a recent letter from Mervin Ernest who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My co-workers and myself have been in limbo awaiting decisions on 
contract finalization and most of all, job offers 
from—Bombardier—.This whole privatization process has dragged 
on far too long.  This has been an extremely stressful time for 
all the employees and their families.  I have seen many 
manifestations in my co-workers including stress illnesses and 
all the personal problems it can cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's very clear that with everyday that passes, current 
Departure Incentives, Alteration and Relocation options that have 
been available to us will very soon cease to exist—. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an employee of DND, I have only two burning questions.  Do we 
have a job or not and if not, will there be financial assistance 
(Early Departure Incentive—) for those being terminated? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bold face he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please, we just want to get on with our lives! 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of lack of esprit de corps that the committee 
has seen and heard about over recent months at both the military 
and the non-military levels.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time the Canadian government has not decided 
what it is that the department of defence could and should be. It 
is trying to be all things to all people.  It has not decided 
whether its primary role is to be a peacekeeping role or whether 
it is to be a full military role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it has been unable to decide that, it is stretched very 
thin.  Its equipment, as we all know, is relatively seriously 
outdated.  It is stretching badly the pay, rations and benefits 
of the men and women who serve in the armed forces or the 
civilians working in the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the government demonstrates the leadership to determine 
what in effect it will be when it grows up, these problems will 
continue to be there with the poor quality of housing and the 
lack of other amenities which come with that territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen any lack of leadership.  I would agree 
wholeheartedly with the recommendation before us: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House condemn the government for its failure to provide 
strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we put an end to this charade of travelling around and 
forcing people to demean themselves by telling their personal 
stories, of their trips to the food bank and their moonlighting 
jobs at a minimum wage, and get on with the job of paying our 
Canadian men and women who work in the armed services a decent 
and fair salary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
since my name was mentioned by the last member I feel compelled 
to stand once again.  You are damned if you do and damned if you 
don't as far as the NDP is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had said they were to talk to a few generals to 
straighten out the problem with morale, quality of life and 
living conditions in the forces, the NDP would have been the 
first party to say that was another top down solution and that 
the government was ignoring the rank and file.  However, when the 
minister takes the initiative to have the defence committee go 
out to various bases in a true bottom-up solution, to solicit the 
views and concerns of members of the forces, the NDP goes on the 
attack once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate because it is a very historic effort on the 
part of the defence committee.  It has never happened before in 
Canadian history.  It has never gone to members of the Canadian 
forces, who are trained in terms of their discipline not to speak 
up, not to be political, to receive their comments. The minister 
is to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another comment to make before I sit down.  The NDP does 
not seem to understand either the white paper and what the white 
paper is all about.  The white paper provides for a multipurpose 
combat ready force serving Canada.  That is exactly what we have. 
There is no confusion there.  If the member read the white paper 
I am sure he would appreciate the details of what are the 
responsibilities of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I simply do not 
agree that there was any leadership demonstrated in this whole 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they did not want professionals to look at the situation and 
resolve it, why would they not simply let the Canadian military 
have the right to join a union as some other countries do and 
negotiate pay and rations with the government?  Why not sit down 
and do it that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  They do not want to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  How is that known?  Has there been a 
vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  I have been to 13 bases and the 
consensus is absolutely no way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Please do not leave 
the Chair and the rest of members out of this debate.

there are secret votes, there are hand ballots, there is hand 
raising and the whole thing.  If the government was serious about 
this it would consider this option.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased this afternoon to address this motion on the 
government's leadership with respect to the Canadian forces.  I 
believe that the government has indeed shown tremendous 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the then Minister of National Defence published his 
report to the Prime Minister.  That report, along with Chief 
Justice Dickson's report on military justice, contained 100 
recommendations on how the Department of National Defence and the 
Canadian forces should move forward to change, to improve and to 
restore the pride and sense of purpose of the forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reports recommended that action be taken in areas such as 
military discipline, value and ethics, leadership, the command 
and rank structure, operational missions, terms and conditions of 
service, the national headquarters and relations with the 
Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very comprehensive nature of these changes reflects the 
extent of the challenges we were facing.  At that time the 
Department of National Defence and the forces were emerging from 
turbulent years.  There were challenges to respond to successive 
budget cuts, personnel reductions and a very active slate of 
operations both at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intense public scrutiny was taking its toll and resulted in the 
leadership, discipline, command and management, and even the 
honour of the Canadian forces being called into question.  But 
since that time the Department of National Defence and the 
Canadian forces have been very busy implementing these 
recommendations and putting in place many other initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I describe those initiatives I would like to briefly 
mention some of the many initiatives the government took during 
its first mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government established the special joint committee 
on Canada's defence policy of which I was a member.  In response 
to that valuable report the government wrote the 1994 white paper 
on Canada's defence policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 it was this government that established the commission 
on restructuring the reserves.  I am proud to say that I was 
chairman of the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs when we reviewed that commission's report. 
Since then the government has made numerous achievements in 
implementing necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closer to home, I wish to commend the minister for his 
commitment to Prince Edward Islanders when he announced the 
construction of a new naval reserve base in my riding of 
Hillsborough.  This new base is now up and running and is 
recognition of the islanders' unwavering support for the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might just say that in 1939, the day war was declared, every 
one of the members of the HMCS <I>Queen Charlotte</I> volunteered 
for active duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get carried away with the countless past initiatives, I 
should revert to the most recent examples of how the government 
has shown excellent leadership.  To begin with, there is almost 
entirely a new leadership team.  Solid leadership is essential to 
implementing reforms, and every one of these leaders has 
expressed their commitment to moving the agenda forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of these changes is the NATO flying training in 
Canada program.  Under this initiative, which was announced last 
November, industry partners will carry out most of the functions 
that are now handled by the defence organization.  This project 
will significantly reduce the cost of training military pilots. 
It will also mean almost $1 billion in direct industrial benefits 
for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just two types of changes, but there are other major 
areas of reform that show leadership.  For example, the Minister 
of National Defence responded last October to the report of the 
Somalia commission of inquiry in a report very aptly entitled “A 
Commitment to Change”.  This report addressed each of the 
commission's recommendations and indicated agreement with some 
83% of them.  Of the 28 recommendations that were not accepted, 
most of the underlying concerns have been or will be addressed in 
a different way than the commission members specified.  But they 
will be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the commission's recommendations were already 
implemented and others have specific target dates for 
implementation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission of inquiry requested that the minister report to 
parliament on the department's implementation of the commission's 
recommendations.  In addition to this report, the minister has 
asked prominent Canadians to participate in the minister's 
monitoring committee on change, which will report semi-annually 
to him on the department's progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important initiative is amending the National Defence 
Act to allow for comprehensive change to the military justice 
system.  These amendments, which were referred to the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, will help to 
renew the Canadian forces by enhancing the transparency, fairness 
and effectiveness of the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, following this morning's very productive meeting, I 
expect a favourable report to the House to be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments, the most comprehensive ever since the 
enactment of the NDA in 1950, clarify the roles and 
responsibilities of key figures in the military justice system 
and establish a clear separation between investigative, 
prosecutorial, defence and judicial functions.  The amendments 
improve accountability and transparency by creating two oversight 
bodies, namely, the Military Police Complaints Commission and the 
Canadian Forces Grievance Board, both of whose reports will be 
tabled in parliament by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementing these reforms is all about being able to maintain 
multipurpose, combat-capable forces that are able to defend 
Canadian interests and contribute to international peace and 
security.  Moreover, these reforms are also about ensuring the 
trust, respect and confidence of Canadians as the forces carry 
out these tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government believes this policy stands firm, it has 
also taken steps in the past year on certain white paper issues, 
such as equipping the forces.  For example, among the various 
capital investments made under our leadership, the government is 
acquiring four Upholder class, diesel-electric submarines from the 
United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also decided to purchase 15 search and rescue 
helicopters for the Canadian forces.  The Cormorants have the 
power, speed and endurance to cope with the extreme weather 
conditions and vast distances that characterize Canada's unique 
and challenging search and rescue environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, since last year there has been a very busy slate of 
operations, both at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind members about the natural disasters 
Canadians faced over the last year and that the Canadian forces 
took part in all of them.  We have recently sent 50 Canadian 
forces personnel, including 16 reservists and some equipment, to 
help fight the terrible forest fires in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as undertaking these domestic operations there 
have also been changes in the forces' international activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, just yesterday the minister announced that we are 
sending 20 to 30 personnel and 10 specialized front-end loaders 
to Italy to assist in the clean-up of the devastating mudslides 
in the area of Sarno, Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December members of the forces returned from serving with 
the United Nations mission in Haiti, where they assisted in 
sustaining a secure and stable environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Canada agreed to participate in two new missions.  In 
February the government announced that Canada would send the 
patrol frigate HMCS <I>Toronto</I> and two KC-130 Hercules 
tactical air-to-air refuelling planes to the gulf as Canada's 
contribution to possible military action against Iraq.  The 
government has also approved Canadian participation in a new 
three-month United Nations peace support mission in Central 
Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have described so far we can see that a great deal 
of work has been done over the last year.  Changes are being made 
on every front.  I believe these changes have demanded strong and 
effective leadership from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are changes that will improve transparency and 
accountability, changes that will improve the quality of life for 
members of the forces, changes that will ensure the forces can 
continue to do the job that the government has assigned to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government has indeed shown and will continue 
to show leadership with respect to the Canadian forces and it 
should be commended for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to another ministerial 
speech from the parliamentary secretary.  I would like to bring 
up this point with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the natural disasters that have occurred in the 
last several years across our country, in the Saguenay, in the 
Red River and the ice storm, and I fully support the military's 
role, their great efforts and their great work to help the people 
affected by those disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if such a disaster were to occur in British Columbia, 
what would the government's response be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government closed CFB Chilliwack in the Fraser Valley. 
That base would have provided support to the greater Vancouver 
region if there were a natural disaster.  There are over two 
million people in that area.  The closest base has now been moved 
to a Liberal riding in Edmonton. 
What a big surprise.  I cannot believe it.  If there were a 
natural disaster in that region of the country the forces would 
have to go through the Rockies for 12 hours with heavy equipment 
to get there.  If there were a natural disaster, I rather doubt 
that route could be taken by the forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary mentioned that there is a new naval 
base in his own riding.  Surprise, surprise.  I am questioning 
whether the government is basing these decisions on sound policy, 
on directions for the country, or is it more political patronage 
in the establishment of these facilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hear about CFB Chilliwack and why this government 
chose to close that facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, numerous bases have been 
closed over the last number of years, Chilliwack among them.  A 
lot of bases were closed, but the really big hits took place on 
the east coast of Canada.  The air base in my own province of 
Prince Edward Island was closed in 1989.  These things have been 
going on since the end of the second world war.  Many of these 
bases were out of date and no longer needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Canadian forces' being able to get to British 
Columbia, there will be no problem with that.  As I said in my 
speech, we have already sent troops to Italy.  I am sure if we 
can send them to Italy we can certainly send them to British 
Columbia a lot faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the naval base in Prince Edward Island is concerned, 
it has been ongoing for a number of years.  It was through this 
government that we finally got the money to complete it.  This 
was promised long and ever ago.  It is now in place on the east 
coast.  It is a very good naval base.  I believe that Prince 
Edward Island and all other provinces deserve to have a military 
presence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Veterans Affairs.  I hoped he would talk a little about the 
problems between veterans affairs and the Canadian forces.  In 
our travels through the different bases we heard quite a bit from 
people who suffered injuries while in the forces.  When they 
leave the forces and go to veterans affairs there seems to be a 
block in the interchange between the two.  Information is not 
getting across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with different doctors.  The Canadian forces 
have one doctor and when they go to veterans affairs they see 
another doctor.  There seems to be a blockage.  Every time 
somebody applies to veterans affairs they do not seem to get the 
two tied together.  Medical documents seem to disappear. They 
melt going from one to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the parliamentary secretary tell us whether the 
information handed down to the committee will go immediately to 
veterans affairs to be handled, or will we have to wait for it to 
go through report stage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his questions.  There is no doubt, and I have heard it many 
times in my office as I know he has heard it in his, that people 
have experienced this breakdown in communications and, for want 
of a better word, this turf protection between the two 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to members from veterans affairs the day before 
yesterday as they appeared before our committee along with a 
liaison officer from the Department of National Defence.  There 
are still problems with people who are injured in the forces who 
then leave the forces and come under the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.  However, I am confident this is being overcome.  It is 
not 100% yet.  There is no doubt there is a long road to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about different doctors, one from national 
defence and another from veterans affairs, examining the same 
person.  These things must be overcome and they are being 
overcome as we go down this road.  As this communication 
continues, as a result of a number of investigations by the 
committee, by the McLellan report and others, I believe it will 
be much easier for people leaving the forces to get veterans 
affairs benefits than it has been in the past.  That is not to 
say it is right and all fixed by any stretch of the imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am confident from what I have heard in the last week 
that the changes being made are real and that people are very 
serious about making this transition as seamless as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to join this debate on the motion concerning the armed 
forces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague has just indicated, the record of this 
government in meeting the defence challenges and defence needs of 
this country is outstanding.  Our defence policy is responding to 
the characteristics of the post-cold war environment.  Our 
Canadian forces have shown themselves to be fully capable of 
executing this policy.  This is a clear reflection of the strong 
political leadership which the government has provided to our 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces are designed to do many things.  They 
protect Canada's sovereignty, secure our global interests and 
co-operate with friends and allies in maintaining a stable, 
peaceful international system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, the Canadian forces have 
played an increasingly important role in promoting international 
peace and security around the world.  They have participated in 
an unprecedented number of peace support operations during this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years our Canadian forces have been subject to 
intense public scrutiny and indeed criticism.  Yet at the same 
time they have continued to carry out their assigned tasks both 
at home and abroad with professionalism and courage.  These fine 
men and women have been put to the test time and time again and 
they have accomplished great things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military is recognized around the world for its expertise 
and experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of our Canadian forces performed admirably during the 
gulf war.  They made a meaningful contribution to that campaign. 
Since then they have participated in several deployments to the 
Arabian gulf area to assist in the maintenance of the embargo 
against Iraq.  They have reached out to help and have spared no 
effort in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda.  While 
they could not stop the bloodshed, General Dallaire's tiny force 
was able to save thousands of lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They continue to assist in the international community in 
dealing with the tragic conflict in the Balkans.  Their military 
contributions include land, sea and air capabilities as well as a 
wide range of humanitarian activities.  They helped stabilize the 
volatile situation in Haiti and initiated a wide range of 
humanitarian projects throughout that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They led a multinational response to ensure the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance in central Africa thereby serving as a 
catalyst to help break the impasse that had kept refugees in 
camps for two years. Recently the Canadian forces have deployed 
troops in the Central African Republic to assist in the 
maintenance of peace and security there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned this afternoon, our Canadian forces 
have been asked to assist with the tragic mud slides in Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have responsibilities very close to home.  Last January 
the Canadian forces mounted an operation which attracted 
Canadians' favourable attention and I am sure warmed their 
hearts. Operation recuperation was the largest peacetime 
deployment of the Canadian forces in their history. Just as the 
storm in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick showed Canadians at 
their very best, banding together in times of trouble to assist 
their friends and neighbours, it also highlighted one of the 
Canadian forces' most essential roles: protecting the lives and 
property of Canadians in times of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operation recuperation at its height saw more than 16,000 men 
and women of our Canadian forces deployed from bases across 
Canada into storm ravaged areas where they assisted civilian 
authorities in responding to one of the greatest natural 
catastrophes in Canadian history. Masses of uniformed men and 
women are a sight seldom seen in Canada's urban areas but there 
they were during the terrible ice storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders, British Columbians, Quebecois, New 
Brunswickers, indeed military personnel from every part of the 
country assisted with hydro repairs, distributed camp cots, air 
mattresses and sleeping bags, set up and distributed generators, 
assisted in clean-up operations, acted as police and advisers and 
supplied water and hot meals. 
I spent three days in the ice storm area and I saw this myself. 
It was remarkable to see armed forces with full equipment 
functioning in our own country in that way.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never was it clearer that the Canadian Armed Forces are a deeply 
rooted national institution representative of all Canadians and 
available to all Canadians.  They provide a source of comfort, 
security and pride drawing us closer together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the assistance provided during the Red River flood in 
Manitoba last year, or in the Saguenay and previous natural 
disasters, or at the present time in Alberta fighting the forest 
fires, these were proud moments for our Canadian forces. They 
were fulfilling one of the crucial functions of any national 
military organization:  reacting, and quickly, to the unexpected 
at the direction of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operation recuperation was a chance to render aid where and when 
it was most needed, to help the taxpayers and citizens of Canada. 
It was an opportunity to reinforce public faith in our Canadian 
forces, in their professionalism, in their commitment to service 
and in the value of maintaining a substantial viable military 
organization even in times of peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet with more than 16,000 unarmed Canadian service personnel 
rebuilding hydro wires and helping people in need move to heated 
homes and emergency shelters, we must not forget that this 
mission, critically important though it was, was only one of many 
that we were asking our men and women in uniform to perform at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time that thousands of our personnel were deploying 
into eastern Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, hundreds more 
were completing a much longer journey to meet Canada's United 
Nations obligations in the former Yugoslavia as part of the 
international community's ongoing commitment to peace and 
stability in that part of the world.  They were replacing other 
Canadians who had been there busy performing the same function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both missions were right and just.  Both were rewarding and 
potentially dangerous.  Both demanded of our citizens in uniform 
the utmost in training, preparation, will-power and skill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These missions and others like them are not easy.  The 
professionalism of Canadian forces personnel in deploying so many 
people and so much equipment so quickly to trouble spots does not 
come without a tradition of expertise and many years of training 
and experience. Such operations demand organizational skills, 
physical toughness, mental agility and the art of leadership. 
Sheer flexibility too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of where the army, the air force and the navy have been 
and what they have done in just the last two years.  Saguenay, 
Haiti, the skies over Bosnia-Hercegovina, Manitoba, Zaire, the 
Arabian Sea, ex-Yugoslavia, the Central African Republic, 
Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick, Italy. These are in 
addition to all our more longstanding, ongoing obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Canadian forces have accomplished so much 
during the past few years is proof positive that this government 
has provided and continues to provide strong political leadership 
to Her Majesty's Canadian forces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member who said his government has 
provided leadership for some time. It may be true in a sense, 
but there have been some scandals. Some military personnel gave 
a wake-up call to the government by doing unacceptable things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I also want to pay tribute to the Canadian and Quebec 
members of our armed forces. A number of my former students are 
serving in the forces and they honour us through their 
tremendous work. However, when we say that a government must 
take its responsibilities, we mean a lot more than that. What do 
we do with an army? 
Do we want a peacekeeping force or combat troops? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canada should opt for a peacekeeping force and that 
decision should be made collectively. The government should 
assume its responsibilities, because what will the role of an 
army be in five or ten years, if not to maintain peace, or to 
provide services to the community, as was done in the 
Lac-Saint-Jean region, in the areas hit by the ice storm, and in 
Manitoba? I salute our military for their role in these 
instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to define the role of our forces. But how are we 
going to equip them? With submarines? Through contracts that 
were signed, that the government does not want to fulfil, or 
that it countersigns? 
We lost an incredible amount of money with the helicopters. Is 
this taking one's responsibilities? I do not think so. Is this 
providing leadership? I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about another point, women in the forces. 
How many women said they were almost persecuted? How many women 
generals are there in the Canadian forces? Women do not have the 
importance they deserve, and I wonder what the hon. member has 
to say about this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for a 
number of interesting points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like to say first though.  I think 
for a variety of reasons our armed forces have come through a 
period of time when they have been subject to enormous public 
scrutiny and criticism.  Although wherever there is fault there 
should be public scrutiny and criticism, I would like to think we 
have come through that stage now and we are at the time when we 
can support our armed forces and we can compliment them for the 
things that they have done and for the things that they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I was trying to do in my speech.  It was not to 
ignore some of the problems but the time I hope is now past to 
emphasize the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the other parts of my colleague's questions, 
first in defining the role, as I tried to point out, we ask a 
great deal of our armed forces. We ask them to be available for 
disasters here and abroad. We ask them to be in relatively 
peaceful peacekeeping situations and very dangerous peacekeeping 
situations and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how in the modern world we can design an armed 
forces except one that is very flexible and capable of performing 
all sorts of tasks, while at the same time being combat capable. 
It is important.  The Canadian forces are a military unit. They 
have to be combat capable, but also in the new world they have to 
be able to adapt to a great variety of situations. I do not think 
it is easy to define a single role or even one or two roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the matter of equipment. It is very 
important, as has been stressed today, that we now move steadily, 
after some of the problems that we have had, and properly equip 
our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the submarines.  I myself, as you know, Mr. Speaker, 
have done a great deal of work on sea ice.  I have studied sea 
ice in various parts of the north.  I greatly regret the fact 
that we have not had the capability, except by air, of getting 
people and troops, if that is the right thing, into some of the 
remote parts of Canada which are covered by ice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The submarines, I hope adapted for under ice work, will be a 
useful addition to one of the many capacities that our armed 
forces need, which is to deal with the huge northern territory, 
land and sea, that we have in those parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to women, I make the point again, in my view great 
progress has been made with the role of women in all parts of our 
armed forces.  I agree with my colleague and I hope that progress 
continues. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Employment insurance.

<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I will be 
sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a very rich and proud military history.  Since 
Confederation our young men and women have responded to this 
country's call to arms by risking their lives in defence of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exploits of our Canadian military personnel are legendary 
throughout the world.  History will always remember the 
determination of our heroic young Canadians at Vimy Ridge during 
the first world war.  Their heroism helped turn the tides of 
battle in favour of leading to the eventual allied victory.  Vimy 
helped define us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second world war saw our young Canadian soldiers involved in 
some of the most important battles of the war.  The ill-fated 
landing on the beaches of Normandy, our victorious return to 
Dieppe and our successful victory during the battle of the 
Atlantic are all part of Canada's proud military history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often lost to Canadians is the vital role our military has 
played and continues to play in helping maintain a peaceful 
existence throughout the world.  Our Canadian peacekeepers are 
among the most respected throughout the world.  The demand for 
Canadian peacekeepers continues to exceed our capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Records of Canadian peacekeeping operations can be found in 
troubled countries throughout the world including Bosnia, Turkey, 
Somalia and Haiti, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently our military has received great praise for its 
efforts at home.  I would like to extend our appreciation and 
congratulations on recent citations of excellence for the work 
performed during this winter's ice storm, as well as last year's 
Winnipeg floods.  At present some of our forces are involved in 
fighting forest fires in Alberta.  These acts of compassion 
within our own boundaries have helped rekindle the once proud 
image of our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the military's proud image in the past tense because 
since the government took power it has done everything in its 
means to reduce this proud organization from a first rate 
fighting force into nothing less than a support operation for our 
NATO allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It pains me deeply to have to say this about our military. 
However, consistent government cuts in military spending and a 
lack of leadership from the top are responsible for seriously 
reducing our military's capability resulting in serious morale 
problems.  It does not take long to come up with reasons there is 
such a serious morale problem in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has done more in recent years to destroy 
our Canadian military than the German army did during both world 
wars.  It closed many of our military bases across the country 
including CFB Cornwallis in my riding.  In most instances these 
bases had a long and proud history of service to the Canadian 
people.  The government has even refused to allow stained glass 
windows that were removed from Cornwallis base to be returned as 
part of the new military museum.  These windows were donated to 
the base by those who trained there to commemorate all those who 
participated in the battle of the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part of our military heritage has been tucked away where 
only a select few will have an opportunity to enjoy them.  The 
wishes of our military personnel are once again being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our brave young helicopter pilots continue to risk their lives 
each day flying dangerous, antiquated Sea King helicopters. These 
helicopters have long since worn out their usefulness and should 
be replaced.  For each hour flown it takes almost 24 hours of 
maintenance, and I believe I am conservative in that comment. An 
hon. colleague says 70 hours of maintenance.  It is not a good 
ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For what can only be described as crass politics at its worst, 
the Liberal government chose to gamble with the lives of our 
brave pilots by cancelling the former government's EH-101 
helicopter deal.  Not only did it stick Canadian taxpayers with a 
$500 million cancellation penalty, but it also delayed delivery 
of much needed helicopters putting our pilots at risk of death or 
serious injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say it has purchased new search and rescue 
helicopters at a much cheaper price.  These new helicopters 
resemble the cancelled EH-101, but taking into account some of 
the needed modifications to these new helicopters the final tally 
will be very close to the original EH-101 deal therefore offering 
Canadians no savings at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military personnel who served in the gulf war deserve our 
utmost appreciation for a job well done.  They distinguished 
themselves with honour.  How does the government choose to 
recognize these brave men and women who once again answered the 
country's call in a time of crisis?  I am not sure it recognizes 
the valiant efforts of these soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government still refuses to recognize this conflict as the 
gulf war, instead choosing to call it special duty area Persian 
Gulf.  I believe we are the only country involved in that war 
which does not acknowledge it as such.  By not recognizing it as 
a war the government can defend its decision not to award the 
veterans the same disability benefits as they would war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent SCONDVA hearings in Halifax we heard from a 
number of military personnel and their spouses.  Among those 
presenting was a wonderful human being from my constituency by 
the name of Sue Riordon whose husband has been left totally 
disabled from the effects of gulf war syndrome.  The military has 
a gulf war clinic, yet the government does not recognize the gulf 
war.  Military doctors question the existence of this syndrome. 
Surely they cannot deny the debilitating effect this disease is 
having on thousands of Canadian and U.S. veterans alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People such as Sue Riordon, Louise Richards, Rudy Saueracker and 
Michael Innes, to name just a few, have had to battle the 
Department of National Defence every step of the way to try to 
obtain benefits they and others affected by gulf war syndrome are 
legally entitled to receive.  Many former veterans have refused 
to pursue their rights for fear of reprisal through possible 
reduction of their existing pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason for fear as Sue discovered.  Having raised very 
pertinent questions about gulf war veterans benefits she quickly 
found herself and her husband being chosen for audit with the 
results continually pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military needs the government to show some leadership.  The 
stories about military personnel moonlighting because they cannot 
make ends meet, our veterans having to fight tooth and nail with 
national defence to secure an adequate pension, living 
arrangements on bases that are far less than normal standard, 
torn uniforms, outdated equipment, and a serious lack of 
direction for our military personnel are all about problems that 
must be immediately addressed by the Liberal government if we are 
ever to restore pride and dignity to our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we have a duty to Canadians including our 
Canadian forces.  If we do not speak up for them who will?  If we 
continue to treat them with disrespect how will others treat 
them?  If the government fails to provide leadership to our 
forces how can we expect our forces to show leadership whether it 
is in Canada or abroad? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few of the illustrations of the government's 
continuing campaign not to provide for the military.  The 
government sends speaking notes on Remembrance Day in November 
and then forgets about its veterans until next year.  I believe 
we should remember and honour our veterans each and every day. 
The government has forgotten our veterans.  The government wants 
to forget the men and women who serve in our forces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am humbled to stand in the House today to speak on behalf of 
all the men and women who fought and continue to serve so 
valiantly on foreign soil in the quest for peace and freedom. 
Lest we forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for West Nova 
especially the genesis of his talk.  He seemed to be using all 
the correct terminology when speaking about our military being 
honourable, dedicated, devoted and hard working. Then he reached 
a certain point in his discourse where he went downhill faster 
than an Ottawa valley otter could slide into the local creek, on 
his belly I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised the case of the helicopters and was 
rather creative in his methodology.  I had a math teacher in high 
school who certainly would disagree. 
In the first instance he was talking about $5 billion with the 
Conservative government, and then the Liberal government did the 
right thing and put the helicopter bidding process out for public 
bid.  It received the best bid that it possibly could get, 
although personally I was a little disappointed that Boeing, 
which is in my riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, was not 
the successful bidder.  We saved literally hundreds of millions 
of dollars in the awarding of that contract.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said there were certain reprisals for people who 
appeared before the defence committee which has been travelling 
throughout the country.  Many people do not realize that 
committee members from all political parties have been doing an 
absolutely outstanding job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say to the member for West Nova that even a member from 
his particular party has not been real conservative in his 
thinking when it comes to looking after the spouses and members 
of the military.  He should inquire from his colleague in his own 
caucus.  All people who appeared before the committee have been 
told very explicitly that there will be no reprisals whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Is this a speech or a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  I am getting to the question.  I just 
had to set the record straight.  I will rush to the conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the veterans he would be interested to know that 
the veterans in Canada have without a doubt the best compensation 
of any veterans in the entire world.  I would ask him, if he 
would care to do so, to respond to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in 
answering the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member states that he was very happy to hear my 
comments, but I think he became disturbed when I went further and 
spoke the truth about the situation that our forces are faced 
with.  I think it hurts him.  My mother used to tell me an old 
saying that the truth hurts.  The truth is hurting and we are 
hearing it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just quote a couple of facts about the cost of killing 
the deal for the EH-101 back in 1993.  They do not take into 
account that the deal the Conservatives entered into in 1993 was 
for 15 search and rescue helicopters and 35 shipborne 
helicopters.  We are getting 15 helicopters similar to the 
EH-101s for a similar cost or less money but by the time they are 
reconfigured to function the way they are supposed to there will 
be very little saving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  The hon. member just goes on and on 
shooting rhetoric across the floor so I will sit down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the morale.  I would like to 
ask him the following question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With approximately 60,000 troops in the Canadian forces and 60 
generals we have more commissioned officers per soldier and per 
military personnel than any country in the world.  No wonder the 
NCOs are in the mood they are in.  Would the member not agree 
with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the morale question in the 
military is not necessarily one that has to do with dollars, 
cents and equipment.  It is how people are treated.  It is how 
military men and women who are still serving see their 
counterparts that have left the military being treated by the 
institution they so proudly serve.  When these types of things 
happen we cannot expect anything but for morale to drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The staffing situation is also another issue but I see that I do 
not have time to continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, essentially 
today's debate has touched on a number of details and 
information, but primarily the problem is this government's lack 
of respect for the men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces. 
I think that is the way it can be summed up lack of respect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military personnel go everywhere in the world.  People react 
favourably when they see “Canada”.  They are drawn to the men 
and women who represent us in peacekeeping missions.  They are 
glad to see our soldiers in Bosnia and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is flooding or some other problem in some part of the 
country, our armed forces personnel go out into the part of the 
country affected, to our counties, to our rural areas, and 
Canadians and Quebeckers are glad to see the men and women of 
the Canadian forces out lending a hand.  They are glad to see 
them there, glad to know they are not ignoring those with 
problems, glad they will lend a hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of the armed forces are respected by people 
everywhere except by the government, or more precisely by 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared to say that, when it comes to looking at the 
problems of the armed forces, my colleague for Compton—Stanstead 
is far more aware of the details than I, but one might say that 
the general in charge of the armed forces is a man respectful of 
his men and women, and respected by all, a man who is doing a 
good job.  What is it that is not working properly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We turn to the minister.  I would not want to make any excuses 
for the minister, but I do believe that in some cases he wants 
to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces receive the 
equipment, the training and the money they need to do a good 
job.  The problem again lies within cabinet.  We do not know 
how, but funding is being cut by 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the helicopters we have today—because the government 
decided to buy some—every hour of flying time requires 70 hours 
of maintenance.  Essentially, our helicopters are birdhouses 
with rotors on top.  That is what they are like now.  They put 
the lives of our pilots and their passengers at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we would have the latest model helicopter had the 
Liberals, for strictly political reasons, not spent over $500 
million to cancel a contract on an election promise.  This shows 
a lack of respect for Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also shows a lack of respect for Canadians for having wasted 
$500 million.  The Minister of National Defence also displayed a 
lack of respect for parliamentarians in preparing to announce 
the purchase of helicopters by trying, for purely political and 
partisan reasons, to find a way to hide the fact that the 
helicopters were the same as those the Conservatives wanted to 
buy, in consultation of course with the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They looked for a little hint, a little sales pitch to say that 
the helicopters were not the same.  They came up with a name: 
Cadillac, Chevrolet.  That was the best they could do.  In the 
meantime, months went by and no helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was totally partisan.  How can the men and women in 
the forces feel good about themselves and young people be 
interested in signing up if the purchase of the helicopters was 
delayed over the need to come up with a name like Cadillac or 
Chevrolet?   They waffled about for six months.  This is a 
flagrant lack of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The armed forces are being realigned, but there are limits. 
There is still a problem.  Our soldiers have no boots.  The 
uniforms are pitiful.  The men and women in the Canadian Armed 
Forces have no boots.  There are no boots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a mayor for some ten years, and we supplied work boots to 
our employees.  That was customary.  We had them.  If a pair of 
boots were worn out, we replaced them.  They are having a hard 
time getting boots for the Canadian Armed Forces.  There are 
limits.  Is there no respect? 
How do we expect to get people to join the armed forces when we 
cannot even equip them properly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I have in my riding one of the businesses that 
manufacture boots for the armed forces. I am sure that it is 
ready and able to carry out a contract to supply the men and 
women of the armed forces with boots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of lack of respect, which my colleague touched 
on, concerns those who saw battle and supported allied forces in 
the gulf war. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not admit that the gulf war was a war. Why? Because, 
once again, they do not want to recognize gulf war veterans. 
They are showing a lack of respect for the men and women who 
fought and provided support services in Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with helicopters. Instead of describing 
them as Cadillacs, they describe them as Chevys. Instead of 
talking about the gulf war, they talk about the Persian 
adventure or whatever. There is a big problem somewhere. I hope 
the minister is not the problem. I do know, however, that the 
problem is within cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear message ought to be sent to the men and women of the 
Canadian Armed Forces to let them know that the days of savage 
and disrespectful cuts are over. First we cut their funding, 
then we ask them to give us a hand. Enough is enough. It is time 
to send them a very clear message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Helicopters were finally purchased, but at an absolutely 
incredible price. Let us not forget that, until the old 
contraptions were replaced with brand new helicopters, for each 
hour of flight, the military had to spend ten hours on 
maintenance. It all adds up. Now, we can say goodbye to our old 
contraptions and fly decent aircraft. Eventually, we will also 
get decent submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we not send other messages as well, because our Canadian 
Armed Forces members are human beings. 
There are human problems on the bases.  There have been a number 
of suggestions, in several documents, that an independent 
ombudsman be established to whom the men and women in the forces 
could turn to obtain information and report difficulties.  Why 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be one of the best messages we could send the men and 
women in the Canadian forces, and it would not cost a fortune. 
We are not talking about helicopters, boots, submarines or 
canons.  We are talking about the human element in the armed 
forces.  The human issue must be resolved by humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we hope that there will be humans, men and women, on 
the government side, who will finally understand what the men 
and women in the forces are really going through and agree to 
provide solutions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nippissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member has a problem with the way he sees money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My apologies.  I speak French like an Ottawa valley logger.  My 
French is not as clear as that spoken in Paris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has a big problem with money.  Permit me to 
point out that, before the last election, the Progressive 
Conservative Party was talking about cutting $800 million from 
the defence budget. The member said the Liberal Party showed no 
respect in its handling of the helicopter and submarine 
acquisitions, but it is the Conservatives who decided to cut 
some $800 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might ask my colleague to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understood perfectly.  The 
member's French is truly excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, tell my hon. colleague not to think too much 
because, if he does, he will come up with the right answers and 
probably cross the floor to join us.  I therefore ask him to be 
patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of money, and I made this very clear, there is of 
course an economic context.  What is clear, however, is that the 
armed forces have always been one area where it was easy to make 
unwarranted cuts.  It is peacetime, the government says, and 
proceeds to cut, cut, cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to pursue the matter, however, he 
could perhaps read the document and the appendices.  What my 
colleague, the member for Compton—Stanstead, regularly proposes 
in committee is that there should be a guideline and some common 
respect for the men and women of the Canadian armed forces.  I 
think that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I remind the member that we have nothing to learn 
from him about finances, because, with an election in the 
offing, the government party, with a single stroke of the pen, 
signed a lovely cheque for $500 million and up to cancel a 
helicopter contract for strictly partisan reasons, thus 
endangering the lives of the men and women who fly these bird 
houses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate.  I think the role 
of the Canadian government, at least these past few years, in 
supporting the defence forces has been not brilliant but very 
good at the very least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct my remarks primarily toward the reserves 
because I am very interested in the whole issue of the reserves. 
My riding is Wentworth—Burlington, but close to my riding in 
Hamilton there are two major reserve battalions of great historic 
fame, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and the Argyle and 
Sutherland Highlanders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just two weeks ago the member for Burlington and I went on a 
training exercise with the Argyles at Meaford, the militia 
support training centre opened in 1995 near the little town of 
Meaford in the Bruce Peninsula.  Note the date, 1995. This is 
obviously an initiative of this government, not the previous 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This militia training support base is a part of a series that is 
to be opened across the country. There is already one that has 
been opened at Valcartier in Quebec.  There is another one to be 
opened in the west at Waineright ad there are two to be opened at 
Gagetown and Aldershot in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of these proving grounds is to give Canada's reserve 
forces an opportunity to train in near combat circumstances. 
Meaford is a section of ground that was set aside during the 
second world war for the training of our troops for overseas. It 
went more or less into mothballs for many years.  It was opened 
1995 primarily for the use of the militia but also permanent 
force people train there as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting.  The member for Burlington and I 
arrived about noon and we were taken on to the proving grounds. 
There are some very excellent and modern support buildings, 
barracks for permanent forces primarily but also for militia 
forces.  The area is very large, comprising of a lake, a section 
of the Niagara escarpment, a lot of brush and mixed countryside. 
In one section of the proving grounds there is an artillery 
range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we were there we saw artillery being fired. They use live 
rounds because they want to test the quality of the ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, we went down to where the Argyles were dug in. 
There were dug in to some terrain facing the mock enemy. The mock 
enemy were not all that mock.  They were U.S. marines from 
Buffalo who were testing out the Meaford proving grounds. They 
were the supposed enemy approaching the Canadian militia across 
about two kilometres of open ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting.  The youngsters who were in the 
foxholes dug on the side of the hill were men and women who had 
been recruited from primarily the city of Hamilton and the 
surrounding area. There they were in foxholes with their primary 
support weapon, the C6, and a machine gun derived from that in 
their positions. They were staring across the countryside at the 
opposing forces that were supposed to be coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting for me.  I have done some research in 
the past on the military.  One of the great dangers of peacetime 
military is that it might get engaged in buying toys or buying 
hardware that has political value but little real value in the 
event of combat.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a military historian, I was most interested to see that 
these young militia members in their foxholes were armed with 
something called a C6, an automatic fire weapon that fires bullets 
of about .25 in calibre.  It is actually measured in millimetres but 
I can never get the metric straight.  It is half the weight of the 
bullet that would be carried in a normal AK47 or M30 or whatever 
it is the Americans use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weapon was totally without class.  In other words, I cannot 
imagine gun dealers across the world wanting to acquire this 
weapon.  It is manufactured in Canada.  We started manufacturing 
it in Canada for Canadian forces only four or five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a superlative firearm.  The average soldier can carry 
twice the amount of ammunition as an opposing soldier carrying 
one of the more traditional firearms that we would expect in 
Russian made weapons and certainly NATO made weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that someone in Canadian forces hierarchy is thinking 
very carefully and is considering the fact that when there are 
Canadian forces in the field, they want to minimize the weight 
and maximize the amount of munitions they actually carry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a superb gun as well in the sense that the militia 
members demonstrated to me and explained that it was a gun that 
fires dirty.  In other words there is not a lot of maintenance. 
It is extremely reliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought to myself that there is a lot of intelligence going on 
somewhere in the Canadian forces brass, in its hierarchy, to come 
up with a specific firearm for use by the Canadian forces and 
which is unique to the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provided that we do not have a repeat of the catastrophe that 
occurred in the first world war with the Ross rifle.  I do not 
know whether many people around here remember Canada's first 
foray into producing its own— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  George Proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  George would know.  I do not know that 
many people in this Chamber would go back to the first world war. 
Certain members might, perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, this is a superb weapon, and I am very, very 
impressed. I was given the opportunity to fire the machine gun. 
It was quite amusing.  It was more amusing to see the member for 
Burlington lying on the ground firing this machine gun because as 
you know, Mr. Speaker, the member for Burlington is noted for her 
charm and forthrightness. It was quite amusing to see her down in 
the trenches firing this machine gun.  Fortunately, it had blanks 
in it and I felt quite safe as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point about this is that this machine gun was 
highly portable and the amount of kickback was very minimal.  We 
are looking at weapons that have been designed for the modern 
battlefield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to my militia, it was very interesting because there 
they were, all dug in.  Their weapons were in place.  Later we 
moved down the road to look at the opposing forces. Along the 
road came the U.S. Marines and I have never seen anything like 
it.  It was really amusing because these enormous young men with 
big shoulders were marching along. I could not help but laugh 
because in comparison to these youngsters serving the Canadian 
militia up on the hill awaiting the enemy, they were huge 
strapping professional soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that this C6 .25 calibre high power weapon is a 
great leveller.  The reason they can use the lighter weight 
bullet is that it has the same ultimate impact of bullets twice 
as strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I am just showing my Canadian nationalism but in the end I 
would put more trust and more confidence in those youngsters from 
Hamilton who were manning those trenches.  Provided that the 
Canadian government always remembers to equip its forces 
properly, we cannot go wrong in the kind of policy that we have 
toward our militia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to that, I will point out that in 1994 the defence 
committee came out with a white paper that suggested cutting back 
on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to listen to what standing committees 
produce and what the MPs in this Chamber produce in 
recommendations to the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say with some satisfaction that the defence minister 
overrode some of those recommendations and had another report 
done.  Rather than cut the reserve forces back to a total of 
24,000, he in fact reinstituted a basic level of 30,000 for the 
primary reserve.  In this year's estimates almost $1 billion is 
going into the support of Canada's reserve forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should switch for a moment. I have another story with respect 
to our reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very long ago, I think it was last year, the HMCS 
<I>Shawinigan</I> came into Hamilton harbour on a demonstration 
cruise.  The then defence minister was there to tour the ship and 
I happened to be able to come along.  Local dignitaries on the 
afterdeck were enjoying an occasional glass of wine and quite 
nice sandwiches.  I had the opportunity to go along with the 
first officer and tour the <I>Shawinigan</I> from stem to stern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the C6 gun I was talking about.  The <I>Shawinigan</I> 
is a superb little vessel.  This is tomorrow's ship. Technically 
it is a minesweeper.  It goes along on the ocean and it is 
supposed to spot mines, but in fact it maps the ocean floor.  It 
has multiple defence capabilities.  There is a container in the 
back of the vessel. At that time the container contained extra 
barracks.  The <I>Shawinigan</I> is designed just like a container 
vessel.  Any container containing any kind of weapon system on 
the <I>Shawinigan</I> can be transposed and it can be turned 
literally overnight into any kind of a support vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that impressed me about the <I>Shawinigan</I> is 
that it is designed to be extremely mobile.  The design of the 
ship's bow thrusters, which are not installed and I hope the 
defence minister will install them shortly, combined with the 
type of propulsion it has, the <I>Shawinigan</I> can actually turn 
on a dime.  It can turn on its length.  It should be able to turn 
on its length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's world we have the problem of homing torpedoes. These 
are torpedoes which can be left on the sea floor and as soon as a 
vessel passes nearby, they can pursue the vessel and sink it. The 
<I>Shawinigan</I> has the capability of avoiding contact by one of 
those undersea missiles on very short notice. This is one of the 
reasons it is such an excellent support vessel, an excellent 
minesweeper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to say this, with all due respect to the Minister 
of National Defence, but I actually like the forethought that has 
gone in to the Canadian built <I>Shawinigan</I> more than the 
forethought that is going in to the submarines that we are buying 
from Britain. I do want to say that I support the minister's 
decision to buy the submarines, but Canadian built is better. 
These vessels, like the <I>Shawinigan</I>, and there are four of 
them, are better than anything in any known navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that have to do with the reserves?  The entire crew of 
the <I>Shawinigan</I> except for the chief officer are reservists. 
The reserves also have a naval reserve based in Quebec, for those 
who are interested in the regions of the country and how they 
play into our Canadian forces.  We have about 5,000 reservists 
and they take their training and do their duty on these vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was most interesting to go around with the first officer.  I 
am really sorry I do not remember where in the country he came 
from.  He was most informative in showing me the various systems 
in place on the <I>Shawinigan</I>.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Canadian defence policy, preparing for the next 
millennium and preserving our nation, we have to stay ahead of 
the worldwide threat that will constantly develop against Canada. 
I am not talking about peacekeeping.  I am talking about actual 
threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that Canada is one of the richest nations in 
the world.  I am sorry to say that we have to protect that status 
and our sovereignty.  We will always be the subject of a certain 
amount of hostility from other nations, not necessarily third 
world nations nor former iron curtain nations. There are other 
countries which sometimes have designs on Canada. That should 
make us want to preserve a very active and capable military 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the reserves are so important rather than a 
professional army which takes a long time to change.  With great 
respect for our own professional army, professional armies are 
like military bureaucracies.  When you join as a private or as a 
young officer and you stay in for 20 or 30 years, you are very 
much influenced by your first experiences.  Your vision tends to 
be rooted very much in the past.  An army with at least half of 
its response force made up of reserves has an advantage.  It 
provides the opportunity to work with young people to create a 
modern army that is loyal to its new weaponry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meaford was an interesting experience. There was a change from 
armoured personnel carriers and tanks.  The Persian gulf war 
showed us that this type of hardware is enormously vulnerable and 
is no longer an effective answer in a land war.  We have actually 
turned back to the citizen soldier.  This is another reason I 
like reservists.  We are creating a Canadian forces based on the 
classic concept of the citizen army.  It is just like republican 
Rome.  When the state gets into trouble it has a cadre of 
relatively well trained personnel to call upon to answer the 
emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not pretend to be an expert on all the things the 
government has done in terms of national defence, I believe the 
minister is very much on track with his changes to the reserve 
forces.  This is where we should make the investment.  In 
tomorrow's wars, whether it is peacekeeping, whether it is local 
wars, or whether it is a national emergency, we need intelligent 
citizen soldiers who understand modern weaponry and modern 
tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would put my faith any day in those young militia members I 
saw at Meaford or on the <I>Shawinigan</I> rather than in the 
professional soldiers I saw from the United States or any other 
country either in NATO or out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his very interesting speech.  I quite 
enjoyed it. There is only one thing that bothers me a bit.  It is 
probably the same situation as the situation I expressed to the 
member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this thing of the militia.  The member said that the 
government has made steps by increasing the numbers of militia. 
The member talked about Meaford and other training centres across 
the country and about improving training.  At the same time the 
bean counter somewhere along the line has said it is fine that 
the numbers have been increased but now the expenses have to be 
cut down.  So they have dropped the training to 32 days a year 
which is not enough time to give somebody good training and to 
get them used to it. The member has seen how the militia works. A 
normal training year used to be in the 60 day range. 
Now we are talking half of that time.  By expanding the numbers 
but cutting the hours we are dropping behind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see both the hours increased and our soldiers 
well trained, particularly our militia.  Part of the problem is 
that we seem to be comfortable with the fire power they have. 
Unfortunately they are lacking a lot of other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The militia has access to clothing, but they do not seem to have 
access to other things such as equipment.  Our soldiers find 
themselves in the opposite situation.  They do not seem to have 
access to clothing.  Something seems to be missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member would care to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the advantages of a 
debate like this is that we can raise genuine issues that we are 
concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was at Meaford I was impressed by the basic weaponry they 
were supplied with.  They had excellent weaponry.  But I did 
notice that the tents, for example, in the communications area, 
although well organized with maps and so on, had holes in them. 
My thought was that if it rained they would get pretty wet. 
There was no doubt about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that while I applaud the fact that the 
primary reserve level has been brought up to 30,000, I would 
actually like to see it increased even more.  I would like to see 
the reserve increased by another 10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I failed to mention in my speech is that the reserves have 
an enormous role to play in our society in giving young people an 
opportunity to serve in an environment in which they put selfish 
motives aside and look at larger issues such as serving their 
country and being part of an effort that is not celebrating just 
the individual, but working together as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not mistake my remarks that I am only here to praise the 
government.  I believe there are things the government can do. I 
agree with the member on the equipment problem.  I believe from 
what I have heard the defence minister say, especially during 
question period, that there is a move afoot to re-equip the 
Canadian forces.  If we are going to send these kids out to fight 
it is very important that they have the best weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that someone at the head of the defence establishment, 
and I would like to think it is the minister but I suspect there 
is some brass involved as well, is thinking ahead and will supply 
the Canadian forces with the appropriate weaponry first.  Next 
must come good equipment and, I agree, more hours if possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed my colleague's remarks, but I would like again to pick 
up the question of the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague.  He gave the example of citizen 
soldiers in our cities, but it seems to me that many of the 
peacekeeping operations that we have around the world are best 
served by a judicial mix of regular soldiers and citizen 
soldiers.  Very often the troops are dealing with civilians and 
it is good to have combat-ready troops, but it is also good to 
have troops who may be combat-ready but who live in normal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect of that, of course, is that the reserve 
provides a presence for our armed forces in all the communities 
across the country and it ties in with the cadets.  I heard the 
member's remark about the increase.  I had heard that we were 
perhaps the only one of the G-7 nations with fewer reserve troops 
than regular troops.  I wonder if my colleague knows if that is 
true and I wonder if he would comment further on how we might 
develop a larger, more diverse, effective reserve force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the 
member's question is, we need to make more of a financial 
investment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have the infrastructure because the armouries are 
there, but if we invest in another 10,000 reservists and the 
equipment they require we will more than recoup that investment 
in the savings we make on intercity problems.  It is not that we 
are taking off the street kids who would otherwise be involved in 
crime.  It is not that at all.  When we take young people into 
the Canadian forces in a reserve capacity what happens is that 
they go back into their communities with their uniforms and they 
become a part of the community.  It is like the Boy Scouts.  They 
return to their communities and they have a tremendous role to 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the value of the reserves, of the citizen soldiery, in 
the ice storm incident and in the problem we had with the floods 
out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a worthy investment.  Let us agree on all sides of the 
House that we can conclude this debate by saying there is 
consensus on all sides of the House to invest more in the 
reserves and to do more for the young people of Canada.  It will 
promote the nation, it will promote the flag and it will make 
Canadians that much more proud of themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the previous speaker made some comments with respect to the 
submarines about which I was very intrigued.  He did not seem to 
be all that enthused with the decision to go with the Upholder 
submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence committee recently had the opportunity to tour the 
HMCS <I>Okanagan</I>, one of the current submarines in our fleet. 
Commander Dermot Mulholland was delighted about the fact that 
they are very cheap.  He said it was like a dream buy for the 
Canadian forces.  They are extremely quiet and they are faster 
than the current submarines, the Oberon class submarines.  They 
will also give us an opportunity to train well with the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What problem does he see with the Upholders?  Many people think 
it is a great deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the problem with the 
Upholder is the <I>Shawinigan</I>.  Vessels like the 
<I>Shawinigan</I> are more than a match for vessels like the 
Upholder, and the <I>Shawinigan</I> costs a lot less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the Upholder is a good investment, and I support the 
government on this, is that we need to have modern submarines in 
order to play games with the Americans.  Basically that is what 
it amounts to.  In order to stay abreast of any submarine warfare 
we have to have the latest in technology and the Oberon class of 
submarines is the latest in technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the purchase of the British submarines is 
basically an exchange deal for time on Canadian ranges for 
British troops.  It is not so much a dollar investment as it is a 
military exchange with the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, in tomorrow's world, smaller is better, although I 
do support, in principle at least, the purchase of the four 
British submarines. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to start by saying that I appreciate the efforts of the 
Conservative Party for presenting this motion today.  The motion 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to provide 
strong political leadership to Her Majesty's Canadian Forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expected that we would have heard from speakers from all 
parties in the House today that in fact that leadership is 
missing.  We have indeed heard as we travelled with the defence 
committee, of which I am a member and of which many of the 
members who have spoken are members, that there is a lack of 
leadership on the part of the government when it comes to the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about this leadership from a couple of points of 
view.  First, I will give a clear demonstration of the lack of 
political leadership by making two key points and then I will 
demonstrate the lack of commitment by talking about one 
particular case involving the military's most important assets, 
people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT90"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT90"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the lack of political leadership can be clearly 
demonstrated in several ways.  Let us start with funding.  Money 
is not everything.  Putting more money into the military is not 
going to solve many of the problems that we have in the Canadian 
military today.  However, funding has dropped below a critical 
level which does not and will not allow, even with proper 
management, Canada to sustain the kind of military force that it 
needs to provide the basic security that Canadians expect for our 
country.  Funding has dropped from $12.5 billion in 1992, just 
before this government took office, to $9.3 billion this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this government, as it has over the past many years, as 
all governments have over the past 30 to 35 years, found the 
military to be an easy target.  Because of the lack of commitment 
shown to the military by the top leadership in this country the 
general public does not get too excited when the military is cut. 
That situation is changing due to the involvement of the men and 
women in our forces in some of the key natural disasters that 
have taken place.  But funding has been cut from $12.5 billion to 
$9.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than funding, a complete lack of support on the part of 
our Prime Minister and this government has been shown in several 
ways.  For example, when was the last time we heard the Prime 
Minister say that we need a strong military to provide basic 
security for this country?   I challenge anybody to remember 
that.  I certainly cannot and I doubt that anybody in this House 
can.  It has not happened.  The Prime Minister is not committed 
to having a strong military.  When was the last time we heard the 
Prime Minister say that the men and women of the forces are doing 
a great job?  We saw a little bit of that when the men and women 
of the forces were involved in the ice storm, in the floods and 
in peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister seems to completely miss the point that the 
primary role of our forces is to provide security for Canada as a 
sovereign nation.  The lack of belief on the part of governments 
over the last 30 years that we need a strong military force to 
provide that basic security has led to the situation we see 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That contrasts dramatically with what we see in the United 
States. I point to our neighbour to the south.  There are a lot 
of things they do not do right, in my judgement, but one thing 
the president certainly does is acknowledge the need for a strong 
military to protect that country.  Occasion after occasion he 
points to the men and women who have served so well.  We could 
point to the men and women in the Canadian forces in the same way 
because they have served well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the lack of commitment by bringing the 
attention of this House to a specific case which was dealt with 
in committee about three weeks ago.  I will quote the chief of 
defence staff who was at the committee meeting in a minute. 
However, first, I want to set this up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woman by the name of Mrs. Dolhan phoned me.  I talked to her 
for some time.  This is an extremely serious situation which I 
believed would be dealt with.  It involves Master Corporal Dolhan 
who is a member of our forces.  He was parachuting under very 
unsafe conditions.  He was one of eight out of eleven in that 
particular jump who fell into trees.  He was injured.  There was 
a bungled rescue attempt to get him out of the tree.  He ended up 
in the hospital.  The comments made by him and his wife were that 
they have had absolutely no support from the military.  That is 
sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this case to the attention of the chief of defence 
staff in committee about three weeks ago.  The chief of defence 
staff, General Baril, said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the examples that we are taking, that when an 
accident happens we've got to cover all angles.  We have only one 
chance of maintaining and furthering the confidence of the men 
and women who are serving and if we miss it, we miss it for a 
long, long time and we hear stories that Col. McLellan has heard. 
We will never be able to repair the damage that was done, but on 
that case I think that I can assure you that we got the bull by 
the horn on this one. 
</UL>
<He was referring to this case of Master Corporal Dolhan.  Even 
after bringing it to the attention of the chief of defence staff 
and after the chief of defence staff saying he was going to take 
care of it, I get this call from Mrs. Dolhan last night saying 
that nothing has been done.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK259">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 1, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal Code (genetic 
manipulation), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had no hesitation whatsoever in agreeing to second Bill C-247, 
introduced by my colleague for Drummond and entitled an act to 
amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore pleased to rise today during this last hour of 
debate on this bill.  We are debating the necessity of clearly 
banning the cloning of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rapid progress made in recent years in new reproductive 
technologies raises crucial questions on medical ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than year ago, Dolly the sheep was in the headlines all 
over the world.  Scientists in Scotland translated science 
fiction into reality by creating a lamb from a cell taken from 
an adult female sheep.  She subsequently gave birth to a 
seemingly perfectly healthy lamb.  The clone, a carbon copy of 
the original, caused a commotion throughout the world, and 
reopened the entire debate on regulating the new reproductive 
techniques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If applied to human beings, this technique raises important 
ethical questions. 
Scientists say that cloning does not require very sophisticated 
technology and could unquestionably interest some scientists or 
provide an opportunity for rich eccentrics to realize dreams as 
dangerous as they are appealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I draw your attention to the work of a Chicago 
scientist, Dr. Richard Seed, who wants to open a human cloning 
clinic to produce children for sterile couples, a new kind of 
fertility clinic. This announcement, reported by the press 
earlier in the year, makes us realize the extent of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This scientist applauds the absence of legislation in the United 
States; there is nothing preventing him from going ahead with 
his project. Should his country ever pass legislation 
prohibiting cloning, he would do his experimenting in Mexico. 
This is the context in which Bill C-247 takes its full 
significance. 
The only way to counter such behaviour is to prohibit the use of 
this technique altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it involves the future of mankind, who we are as human 
beings, our origin and the whole way we relate to each other, to 
allow human cloning, appealing as it may sound, is to destroy 
the uniqueness of each individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the speed at which new reproductive technologies were 
developing, in 1989, the federal government established a royal 
commission of inquiry—better known as the Baird commission—on 
the subject. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT92"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT92"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years, and $28 million, later the commission handed in its 
report:  1,275 pages and 293 recommendations, including one to 
ban human cloning, and I quote “We have judged that certain 
activities conflict so sharply with the values espoused by 
Canadians and by this commission, and are so potentially harmful 
to the interests of individuals and of society, that they must 
be prohibited by the federal government under threat of criminal 
sanction.  These actions include human zygote-embryo research 
related to ectogenesis, cloning—”.  This is from page 1022 of the 
Baird commission's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the urgency and importance of the problem related to 
ectogenesis, it was not until 1997 that the government decided 
to take action and introduced Bill C-47.  But came the election 
and the bill died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of the 36th Parliament, the government has 
done nothing about this issue, although the situation is 
evolving rapidly and more than ever demands new legislative 
measures with respect to new reproductive technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is now one of the only major western countries that has 
had neither the courage nor the will to pass legislation with 
respect to these technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the announcement by Dr. Seed, which I mentioned 
earlier, some 20 European nations approved a text prohibiting 
human cloning and introducing sanctions.  This text completes 
the European convention on biomedicine signed by 22 member 
countries of the Council of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure will extend to all European countries that sign the 
protocol and will entail serious sanctions for infractions, in 
particular the loss of the right to practice for offending 
researchers.  This measure will also apply to European citizens 
and European corporations operating outside Europe.  These 
concrete measures should be echoed in North America.  Bill C-247 
is a step in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was no accident that the Scottish lamb was given the name 
Dolly.  No civilized society will ever have the right to give 
life to infinitely reproducible dolls.  Our most precious asset 
is our identity, our right to freedom and life in every sense of 
the term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that this bill will receive the unanimous 
approval of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on Bill C-247, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code as it relates to genetic manipulation. I 
congratulate the member for Drummond for her efforts in 
sponsoring this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-247 would amend the Criminal Code by adding after section 
286 a prohibition for genetic manipulation that could lead to 
human cloning.  Mary Shelley's <I>Frankenstein</I> has hit the 
nineties and it is a scary thought that science has advanced at 
such a rate that this has become a reality, that in a science lab 
a person might have the ability to create human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think once again we find ourselves in the position in 
government and in parliament to try to keep up to the quickly 
advancing rate of science.  As technology continues to advance we 
too must advance and turn our minds to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very timely in light of the recent technological 
advancements and developments that have resulted in, among other 
innovations, the successful cloning of a sheep.  As we have seen, 
what once was thought to be completely impossible becomes 
reality.  We as law makers must be prepared in advance of other 
new reproductive and genetic technologies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government in this instance has been slow and 
I want to remark on the steps it has taken.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party did have the foresight to lay the groundwork 
for developing policy options with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the Progressive Conservative Party of the day had 
established a royal commission on new reproductive technologies 
and that commission's mandate was to examine the social, medical, 
legal, ethical and economic considerations and implications for 
new reproductive and genetic technologies.  In particular, it was 
to examine the area and implication of women's reproductive 
health and well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following extensive consultations with Canadians the commission 
reported its findings to the new Liberal government in November 
1993, more than four years ago.  The commission stressed at that 
time the need for the federal government to adopt a comprehensive 
public policy on new reproductive and genetic technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that commission the Liberal government announced 
a voluntary moratorium on the nine NRGTs in 1995, which 
continues to stand to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Liberals tabled Bill C-47, the human reproductive 
and genetic technologies act, which prohibited 13 practices 
including cloning, transfer of embryos between humans and other 
species and surrogacy arrangements.  Unfortunately the Liberals 
did not consider the legislation to be a priority and it died on 
the order paper with the calling of the election last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with so many other pieces of legislation that died on 
previous order papers, the Liberals have yet to reintroduce Bill 
C-47.  Again, hats off and praise to the member for Drummond. 
Through her private member's bill she has attempted to fill a 
void that was left by the government's inaction in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Conservative Party I am pleased to say that we 
support Bill C-247, the legislation that would draw a clear line 
in the Criminal Code and set parameters in the area of human 
cloning.  Moreover, since the government has already recognized 
that there was a need for some form of regulatory regime for 
reproductive and genetic technologies, I hope government members 
will join with those in the House in opposition who are in 
support of this bill.  They have taken what I would describe as 
baby steps in this direction in the past in response to the report 
I spoke of earlier and were moving in that direction.  This in 
essence provides a vehicle to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note, however, that although Bill C-247 is an 
important step to fill the vacuum there are still plenty of 
legislative measures that need to be put in place and addressed 
by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of the 13 specific procedures that would have been 
prohibited by the government's legislation had that bill passed 
in the last parliament, only 2 are addressed and proposed in this 
private member's bill.  Furthermore, Bill C-247 does include a 
national regulatory regime with a mandate to enforce controls on 
improper genetic testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has a responsibility to introduce 
comprehensive legislation similar to and based in principle on 
that initial report, similar in content to what was before the 
House in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with complementing the work of the member for Drummond, 
any legislation the government introduces should also reflect an 
emerging consensus for the need for a national regulatory regime 
to manage the field of reproductive and genetic technologies. 
This regime should also be allowed to be managed in a way that 
would protect health and safety for all those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is very much in need of guidelines in this area.  Next 
month will mark the second anniversary of the government's 
tabling of the human reproductive and genetic technologies act 
and I encourage the government to stop any delay in bringing this 
important issue back before the House and follow the example set 
by the member for Drummond and introduce legislation to control 
new reproductive and genetic technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, avoid any abuse or forays into this area without 
some guidelines and parameters that would be firmly established 
by legislation.

Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this issue because I believe it 
is a classic example of the value of Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Drummond for bringing the bill 
forward.  It addresses one portion of an issue that was covered 
in Bill C-47, the bill that died on the order paper as a result 
of the last election which purported to make all kinds of fixes 
to issues of human reproductive technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with our present system of government 
sponsored legislation is that the government tries to get, and 
rightly so, as much bang for its buck as it can.  It prepares 
omnibus bills that address entire issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Bill C-20 is a very elaborate bill that is looking 
at amendments to the Competition Act.  There is a group of bills 
that look at whole issues that are debated in very grand style. 
Sometimes they occasionally come to grief because they try to fix 
so many areas that many flaws are discovered and the bills fail. 
Bill C-47 on human reproductive technology is a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What killed it for me was that it wanted to stop genetic 
research which would have in effect led researchers along avenues 
that would have corrected genetically inheritable diseases like 
muscular dystrophy.  We had this incredible situation where a law 
was coming down the pike that would have stopped cloning of human 
beings, which we all agree is frightening and something we should 
at least have a very long moratorium on.  By the same token it 
would have attempted to kill research in areas very much in the 
public interest that hopefully would alleviate human suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the government—and I do not mean it as a 
criticism of the government—traditionally in the parliamentary 
system has always come down with big bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I think Private Members' Business has a tremendous role is 
doing exactly what the member for Drummond is doing with her bill 
which looks at one urgent issue.  That urgent issue is that at 
least Canadian society and at least this MP, if I may so, are not 
prepared to have research go forward which could possibly lead 
tomorrow to the cloning of human beings. That is a frightening 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not that we can make jest of it, but there are certain members 
of the opposition I would only want one copy of.  If we had 
multiple copies of them I think we would all be very worried. 
That aside, the reality is that we are not yet sufficiently 
sophisticated as human beings to play God.  I do not think we can 
afford to go back into the science fiction books and actually 
produce multiple copies of the same human beings.  Quite apart 
from religious ramifications it would raise huge ethical 
dilemmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot even begin to imagine the ethical problems that would 
confront society in the process of choosing who would be copied. 
Who would it be?  Would it be some top politician?  Would it be 
some artist?  Who would be the first to be cloned?  Then how 
would we prevent people being copied illicitly who might be 
carrying genes or characteristics that are reprehensible yet have 
the money to copy themselves? 
It is an absolutely unacceptable concept.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is we know now that it is possible, or if not 
possible it is immediately on the horizon.  The member for 
Drummond recognizes this.  Discarding all the controversial 
aspects of Bill C-47, she focused on the one thing that I think 
most Canadians would absolutely agree with, that we must at least 
have a moratorium now on the cloning of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's objection, as I understand it, is that the bill 
would put the restriction and the penalty in the Criminal Code. 
This is not an appropriate place for this type of penalty.  We 
can give the government the benefit of the doubt on that.  The 
government has to be very concerned about tradition, the 
appropriateness of legislation and its effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I tend to support the member for Drummond on this 
issue.  We must remember that if it goes into the Criminal Code 
it will only be a temporary measure until we can come back to the 
issue.  Maybe it will take us a year.  Maybe it will take us two 
years.  Maybe it will take us ten years, but we can come back to 
the issue with a more comprehensive bill on reproductive 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I do not think we will have an easy ride with any 
new omnibus legislation on the subject.  We need the bill to make 
very clear that the country does not tolerate and will not 
tolerate attempts to clone human beings.  We can be open to other 
forms of genetic research because we have to, because it is in 
the interests of humanity to encourage our scientists to continue 
with genetic research, but we should draw a line in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does it.  It puts it in the Criminal Code but probably 
only temporarily and later we can move it to a more appropriate 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a classic example of Private Members' Business which 
raises an important issue, offers Canadian society and the 
government a way of putting on the back burner a very difficult 
and emotional issue and sets it aside for now until society knows 
better how to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say the member for Drummond has done us a service by 
bringing the issue before the House and I thank her for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
constituents of Winnipeg North—St. Paul in debating Bill C-247, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code on the subject of genetic 
manipulation.  Of course the subject matter has a profound impact 
on our human race, on our very humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of our being was shaken when a little more than a 
half a century ago, in 1944 to be exact, research scientists in 
the United States observed for the first time a human egg being 
fertilized in a glass dish outside the womb of a mother. 
Thirty-four years following that scientific milestone the first 
live birth of a child, having its beginnings outside the human 
body, occurred in England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was international news at the time, but at once it raised 
many fundamental societal questions.  I therefore understand that 
today we are debating 20 years later this issue in the Chamber in 
the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Drummond on her initiative.  I 
concur in principle with the thrust of the bill, its prohibitions 
on the cloning of the human embryo and of genetic manipulation 
that could allow the transmission of an altered genetic structure 
to a subsequent generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My intervention is in the nature of a friendly submission.  I 
have a reservation.  How will the single focus, enshrining in the 
Criminal Code one point of the very broad and complex 
reproductive technology issue, be seen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing for this debate I revisited the two volume report 
produced by the royal commission on new technologies that I may 
have the guidance of its work and its wisdom.  The royal 
commission on new reproductive technology chaired by Patricia 
Baird issued its final report entitled “Proceed with care” on 
November 15, 1993.  It contained 293 recommendations.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed further allow me for greater clarity to define 
certain terms in the language of human biologists.  First I go to 
the fertilized egg before implantation as it develops during the 
first 14 days.  An embryo refers to a developing human organism 
after implantation in the uterus until about eights weeks after 
fertilization and a fetus refers to the human organism at the 
beginning of the ninth week after fertilization until the time of 
birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did I define these terms?  The terms embryo donation, embryo 
transfer and embryo research are inaccurate since they all occur 
with zygotes and not with embryos in the language of human 
biologists.  However the terms continue to be commonly used and 
we understand them in this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Embryo research since the milestones in 1944 and 1978 has raised 
questions about the ethical and legal status of the embryo and 
about how society's respect for human life should apply to the 
situation.  Concerns have been expressed about the potential 
impact of embryo research on women and on society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission was given the mandate to examine how new 
reproductive technologies should be handled in our country.  Some 
40,000 people were involved in the work on the report “Proceed 
with Care” from which I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissioners have set out a blueprint for how Canada, with its 
unique institutions and social make-up, can deal with new 
reproductive technologies, regulate their use, and ensure that 
future developments or use are in the public interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it will ensure that only ethical and 
accountable use of technology is made, and demonstrate that 
Canadians have wisdom, humanity, and compassion in the way they 
choose to use technology. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 293 recommendations were categorized into three general 
categories:  first, recommendations regarding the need for 
criminal legislation to set boundaries around the use of new 
reproductive technologies in Canada; second, recommendations 
regarding the establishment and operation of a national 
reproductive technologies commission to manage new reproductive 
technologies within these boundaries; and, third, other 
recommendations addressed to existing federal departments and 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to criminal legislation and relevant to the bill 
before us, certain activities according to the commission 
“conflict so sharply with the values espoused by Canadians and 
by this commission, and are potentially harmful to the interests 
of individuals and of society, that they must be prohibited by 
the federal government under threat of criminal sanction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem with the bill in terms of a submission is that the 
actions defined by the commission include human zygote-embryo 
research related to ectogenesis; cloning; animal-human hybrids; 
transfer of zygotes to another species; maturation and 
fertilization of eggs from human fetuses; sale of human eggs, 
sperm, zygotes, fetuses and fetal tissues; and advertising for or 
acting as an intermediary to bring about a preconception 
arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What then will be the implication if out of this two volume 
report we pick one or two items and say we will criminally 
prohibit it at this point?  Might it be implied wrongly that the 
others are sanctioned?  I am worried about that. I submit that we 
ought to use an approach that is integrated and comprehensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue raised by the bill before us is of profound importance 
to all Canadians.  How we deal with it, as suggested by all the 
speakers, is a reflection of our credo and faith as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit that I say again I concur with the 
principle of the bill.  It is also in this spirit that I offer my 
reservation and why I would prefer that the bill before us not 
proceed at this time but be taken into account as we await the 
government's more comprehensive response and integrated response 
to this very delicate human issue that transcends political 
partisanship and challenges us to a more thorough, careful but 
urgent look as we prepare our parliamentary response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this response may not be limited only to criminal 
legislation but should encompass the totality of the 
recommendations contained in the two volumes of “Proceed with 
Care”, the full report of the royal commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to speak and I thank my colleagues for their 
indulgence.  I have to say I will be speaking against the bill 
and I encourage my colleagues to give serious thought to my 
arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not opposed to the idea of prohibiting cloning.  I think 
everyone agrees on this point, and that is not where the problem 
lies with the bill introduced by the member for Drummond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw your attention to the second part of page two.  I 
will quote from it, if I may, and then list my reasons for 
opposing it. 
The second part would necessarily prohibit the following, that 
is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—alter the genetic structure of an ovum, human sperm, zygote or 
embryo, if the altered structure is capable of transmission to a 
subsequent generation. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a step back and perhaps put into 
perspective why I think we should not approve such a measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the international community launched what is called the 
human genome project, an exercise of some 52 countries over 15 
years that had as an objective to map out the human genome, our 
entire chromosomes, the entire sequencing, the 100,000 or so 
genes that are contained in human chromosomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada participated in that effort up until last year to the 
tune of $21 million over five years, $1 million from the National 
Research Council, $1 million from the Medical Research Council, 
and the balance from Industry Canada.  That has now lapsed and 
Canada is no longer at that table. I think we should be back at 
that table and I encourage the government to consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project is going so well that it is quite possible that by 
the year 2002 the entire human genome will have been mapped out. 
Why is that significant to this?  There are about 4,000 genetic 
diseases known.  It is quite probable that we, the human species, 
will have the ability to isolate the genes that cause these 4,000 
genetic diseases and cure them.  There are two ways of doing 
that.  One is the somatic approach which means that we can cure 
the individual and it does not get transmitted into the next 
generation, which is fine but then we would have to do it for 
every person who is born with that genetic disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are possibilities that we could cure some of these 
diseases for good.  To put this into the Criminal Code now would 
prohibit Canadians benefiting from such advances when they come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Hamilton—Wentworth was saying this could be 
in 10 years.  The odds are very good that some of these diseases 
will be curable long before 10 years from now.  I would hesitate 
to put in the Criminal Code something which would prevent us from 
curing genetic diseases and transmitting that cure from 
generation to generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against the intent of prohibiting human cloning but I 
certainly would not want us as parliamentarians to prohibit the 
curing of diseases permanently.  That is what we strive for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution my colleagues in support of this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering a new era, that of genetics.  We have had a 
number of eras, but, in three or four years, we will have the 
capacity to understand our genes.  Naturally, there are benefits 
associated with this, as there are also monstrous disadvantages 
we cannot yet imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need not necessarily preclude the possibility of passing 
on a genetic correction from one generation to another.  I think 
I also agree with the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  What has to be done, and what 
the government must do, and the responsibility is its, is to 
draft framework legislation for the whole issue of genetics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be able to set controls on this enhanced knowledge and 
to reap its benefits.  Naturally, we must ban anything that can 
be very harmful.  I think everyone can agree on that.  Instead 
of passing a bill like this one, I call upon the government to 
act and to strike a parliamentary committee if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we must admit, dear colleagues, that we are on the verge of 
an absolutely amazing era.  As parliamentarians and as 
legislators of this country, we must take the bull by the horns 
and create a legislative framework that will indeed ban such 
things as the cloning of human beings, without banning the 
possibility of correcting genetic diseases or curing them 
definitively.  We must not make that error.

these are things I believe in. Well intentioned as the bill may 
be, I believe it is a mistake to put such limitations in the 
Criminal Code at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that serious thought will be given to this, and that 
instead of making this mistake, we will collectively do what 
must be done, which is to make a pre-emptive strike and to create 
a framework which will enable us to benefit from this new 
knowledge and to eliminate the possibility of the human race 
doing itself harm.

<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak to a matter I have raised in the past about employment 
insurance eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is in a crisis.  At the moment, fewer than 
40% of unemployed Canadians are receiving benefits and yet the 
surplus in the employment insurance fund is over $15 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 10, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development 
when the situation would be critical enough to cause him to act. 
When the percentage of those eligible for EI benefits is down 
to 25% or 15%? 
What would it take to get this government to revise its 
eligibility criteria for employment insurance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said he was concerned about the situation but did 
not understand why the proportion of unemployed people who 
qualified for benefits was so low.  Is the government blind or 
simply stupid?  It changes the EI eligibility criteria to make 
it harder to get benefits and then wonders why people do not 
qualify.  After a year the government is wondering why people do 
not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat the minister's response.  He said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst would do well to 
start learning about his own region. 
The employment insurance participation rate in the Atlantic 
region is 75%. The participation rate in the province of New 
Brunswick is over 80%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee you that I am familiar with my region.  My hon. 
colleague across the floor, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I invited the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to come to Acadia.  The local newspapers back home 
supported this, and even ran political cartoons showing the 
Minister of Human Resources hitchhiking his way to Acadia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he did get down to our area and saw the poverty in which 
people are living, he would not be long in noticing that his 80% 
figure does not exist. 
Absolutely not.  What is more, the New Brunswick minister of 
human resources development, a Liberal, has called the 
employment insurance changes terrible, and has said that fewer 
people would be eligible for EI, so more would end up on 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of a Liberal, the New Brunswick minister of 
human resources development, and a Liberal like those members on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, moreover, another Liberal, minister of 
intergovernmental and aboriginal affairs and acting minister of 
education, Bernard Thériault, said that the crisis in Acadia was 
the fault of the employment insurance changes.  How can the 
minister and the government not have any social conscience 
toward the people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is not the only area affected.  Look at Nova Scotia, 
Newfoundland, the Gaspé, and parts of northern Ontario.  Or 
northern Manitoba, northern Saskatchewan.  I am just back from 
B.C., and they had the same problem there too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling upon the government, once and for all, to examine 
its conscience and do the right thing for Canadians, do what 
Canadians want to see done.  That $15 billion in the bank should 
go back to the people it belongs to, in other words back into 
the pockets of the workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this government is very concerned about unemployed workers and we 
continue to develop policies to improve their prospects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we realize the problem is more complex than the hon. 
member is suggesting.  For example, labour market changes such as 
increases in long term unemployment between 1990 and 1994 played 
a significant role in the decline in the proportion of unemployed 
who receive benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply providing passive income support through regular EI 
benefits could never be a sufficient response to the problem we 
are going through.  We understand Canadians would not be 
satisfied with a step backward to an obsolete system.  Instead, 
the federal government is working with the provinces to provide 
real solutions for unemployed Canadians.  We will create more 
jobs by using a three year, $300 million transitional job fund. 
That is now in place using general revenues to serve high 
unemployed areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date the fund has already created 30,355 jobs throughout 
Canada, 8,067 in Atlantic Canada alone. We will also spend an 
additional $800 million per year on active employment benefits 
under EI, bringing federal funding to more than $2.7 billion 
annually by the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are co-operating with provincial and territorial governments 
to deliver these benefits in the best possible way. Labour market 
development agreements are now in place or are under discussion 
in all provinces and territories.  Decisions on the best way to 
help the unemployed get back to work must benefit from the 
knowledge and insights of those who most closely are in touch 
with local markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have confidence that these measures will be successful in 
helping the unemployed return to productive employment.  As 
employment growth continues and the number of unemployed falls, the 
ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed should rise again. 
Nevertheless we are carefully monitoring the recent declines in 
this ratio.  The department is conducting an analysis of the 
situation and the results will be released in a paper in 1998. We 
will use that to make decisions for Canadians in the future.
