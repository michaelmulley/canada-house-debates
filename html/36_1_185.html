<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian citizenship, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to oppose Bill 
C-63, the government's proposed changes to the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and I are well aware, as are many Canadians 
across the country, that our immigration and refugee system is in 
bad shape. In this legislation the government has chosen to deal 
with issues concerning Canadian citizenship instead of the 
serious flaws in our immigration and refugee system. This is 
mismanagement by the minister.  She is mismanaging her 
priorities.  Canadians want her to work on our broken refugee and 
immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should welcome genuine refugees.  They deserve our 
protection.  In his December 1997 report the auditor general said 
that the current process does not quickly grant Canada's 
protection to claimants who genuinely need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have no political will to improve the situation. 
The Liberal members on the immigration committee even refuse to 
study in the future business of the committee the abuse of our 
immigration and refugee system by drug dealers, terrorists and 
other criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine one morning waking up and seeing someone sitting in your 
living room.  You wonder how that person entered your home. No 
bells rang.  You had not let anyone come in.  Eventually you find 
that while the front door was closed the person had no difficulty 
using the back door.  It had been left wide open.  After dealing 
with the person, would you not make sure to keep the back door 
closed?  Then the next time someone rang the bell you would know 
who your visitor was and you would have the opportunity to show 
the courtesy of welcoming the guest in and making him or her feel 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our immigration system the front doors are closed or 
partially closed.  But the back doors are wide open and the 
government is keeping it that way.  In our refugee process and 
system the back door is abused by criminals.  Drug dealers come 
here to sell drugs to our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country of immigrants.  Genuine immigrants should be 
welcomed through the front door. Their cases should be processed 
as quickly as possible without any harassment or unnecessary 
court expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has no political will to fix the system. 
Rather, it wants to make patchwork changes to the Citizenship 
Act. The auditor general cautioned the government against making 
patchwork changes.  He indicated that the problem is complex and 
that there is a need to conduct a total review of the refugee 
claim process.  It is four and a half years— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be debating an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship.  What the member is talking about has nothing to do 
with the citizenship bill.  He is talking about a piece of 
legislation that will come to the House in good time, which is 
the review of the Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been happening continually from that side of the House. 
They have not been talking about the citizenship— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have been through this a number of times now.  Our colleagues 
have a right to come into the House of Commons and speak directly 
to a bill in any fashion they wish if they think they can get 
their point across. If the Liberal government members do not like 
it, that is just too darn bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Standing Order 
101(2) speaks to relevancy. Relevancy in committees of the whole 
is very strictly applied. Relevancy in debate is not as strictly 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the decision of the Chair during the course of this 
debate that relevancy would be applied but not strictly applied 
as it would be applied in committee of the whole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the admonition of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  I think it is valid. 
During debate we do have to be germane to the issues at debate. 
However, in the debate on citizenship and immigration the two 
very often overlap from both sides of the floor.  We need to give 
each other a little elbow room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am debating Bill C-65 
and I was on clause 2(1) under interpretations.  I am 
discussing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The 
bill is Bill C-63, not Bill C-65 or any other bill the hon. 
member would like to talk about.  It is a citizenship bill. 
Twenty-seven million people in this country are Canadian 
citizens. They were born here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. 
parliamentary secretary has made his point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am debating Bill C-63 
which is in my hand. I have read every page of it thoroughly. 
This is an act respecting Canadian citizenship.  I was on clause 
2(1) under interpretations.  I am discussing the definition of 
citizen and citizenship and also in clause 6 and clause 8 which 
state “The minister shall, on application, grant citizenship to 
a person who”.  I am talking about the person who, which is very 
much relevant and I am sure that the member will let me proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is four and a half years since the Liberal dominated 
committee presented its report but we have yet to see any action 
from the government.  That is why it does not want to listen to 
what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency a genuine refugee has been waiting for over 
five years and still has not been granted this status.  He was 
tortured for his religious beliefs.  After he arrived in Canada, 
his brother was tortured and killed by the police.  Now his wife 
and children are being harassed and tortured.  His family cannot 
reunite until he is granted this status in Canada. A day is too 
long for him to wait.  My constituent is under tremendous 
pressure and mental torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it this way?  Who is responsible?  The Liberal government 
is responsible for this mess. That is what we are talking about 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we want to welcome genuine refugees to our country. 
We want to help those people who need the help.  Our refugee 
system is so full of flaws that it does not grant quick 
protection or provide protection for those who genuinely need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fixing our broken immigration system, the Liberals 
have us debate changes in the Citizenship Act, Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general deplores the fact that it takes on average 
more than two and a half years to settle a refugee status claim. 
The average processing time went from seven months in 1993-94 to 
nearly 13 months in 1996-97.  It almost doubled in two years. 
This same period saw a sharp increase in the backlog of claims 
waiting to be processed, from approximately 17,500 to 29,000.  A 
person claiming refugee status can count on staying in Canada for 
more than two and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years, close to 60% of claimants have 
presented themselves to Canadian officials without a passport, 
personal identification or even travel documents.  This makes the 
refugee determination process longer and makes it extremely 
difficult to remove failed claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general says that out of 20,000 persons ordered 
deported, the department could act on only 4,000 cases and the 
remaining 16,000 are consumed in the system. If that is not a cat 
and mouse game being played by the department, then what is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Immigration Act requires airlines to ensure that their 
passengers are properly documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These very same concerns were addressed nearly 10 years ago by 
the auditor general.  The Liberals continue to make Canadians 
wait for changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the realistic expectations for the speed 
and efficiency of claims be set out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that federal agencies respond to these 
expectations within well defined parameters.  There is need to 
ensure the integrity and efficiency of the refugee determination 
process.  Fairness and efficiency are legitimate and important 
objectives.  The Liberal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
is choosing not to do anything about the problem.  Instead we are 
going back to changes in the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look briefly at the conditions of granting citizenship as 
proposed in Bill C-63.  On presence in Canada, clause 6(1)(b) 
proposes to define the term “permanent resident” more concisely 
than does the current act.  Bill C-63 calls for 1,095 days of 
physical presence in Canada in the five years preceding 
application for citizenship.  However, Bill C-63 does not provide 
any mechanism for determining when the applicant arrives in 
Canada or when the applicant leaves Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On penalties for bureaucratic delays, the current act allows 
individuals whose application for permanent residence is approved 
to count each full day of residency in Canada from the date of 
application as a half day toward the total needed for the 
citizenship application.  According to this act, applicants will 
now be penalized for the system's bureaucratic delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly in the case of adoption it is left up to the minister 
to define the parent-child relationship in cases of adoption.  In 
defining family, clause 43 gives the minister the power to 
redefine spouse, marriage, family and family relations.  She will 
not consult Canadians.  She will not consult parliament.  She 
will decide herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things I wanted to say about patronage 
appointments, about the language requirements and about the oath 
which was designed by the minister and not by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing Liberal arrogance and a lack of respect for 
parliament and the people of Canada.  The minister's first 
legislation should have been aimed at fixing a failed immigration 
system rather than citizenship.  There is no political will to do 
anything about these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I predict the government will not attempt to change the 
immigration and refugee system in the immediate future.  It is 
already too late for many of those who are victims of crime.  The 
minister has been in her portfolio for three years.  She should 
have addressed the serious problems of our immigration and 
refugee system before tinkering with the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I will be voting against the bill on behalf of the 
people of Surrey Central and many more Canadians who are looking 
forward to changes to this act.  We have been terribly let down 
and disappointed by the government's lack of action in addressing 
the serious problems in the immigration and refugee system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to talk about immigration and citizenship from a 
historical perspective because I think it helps us to understand 
something about ourselves and about how we got to this debate on 
Bill C-63.  Everyone needs a history reminder once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration to Canada is very much based on the Canadian dream 
of upward mobility.  A fascinating book was published in 1988 
called <I>The Chinese in Canada</I> by Peter S. Li.  Being from 
British Columbia, the story in this book is of strong interest to 
me.  As of the 1981 census about 75% of Chinese origin Canadians 
resided in B.C. and in Ontario.  I have no reason to believe this 
has changed significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from our native population it is commonly held that no 
other racial or ethnic group has experienced harsher treatment 
than the Chinese in Canada.  The Government of Canada passed the 
first anti-Chinese bill in 1885.  It is no accident that this 
coincided with completion of the CPR railway. 
Fifteen thousand Chinese labourers worked on the B.C. section of 
the CPR between May 14, 1880 and July 29, 1885, saving the 
company millions of dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1885 bill brought in a poll tax put in under the 
Conservative government of the day, a poll tax being a head tax. 
The Liberals increased this poll tax to $100 in 1900, a hefty sum 
indeed in those days, and then increased it again in 1903 to 
$500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1923 the Liberal government passed the Chinese Immigration 
Act which suspended Chinese immigration until 1947 when it was 
repealed.  Chinese Canadians refer to the passing of the 1923 act 
as humiliation day.  Between 1923 and 1947 essentially no Chinese 
were allowed to immigrate to Canada and those already here were 
denied many of their civil rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1885 to 1947 policies resulted in few women Chinese 
Canadians.  Prior to 1923 Chinese immigration was usually 
arranged by contractors or with individuals and voluntary. 
Typically, as a consequence of the head tax which was a cost for 
bringing wives or parents to Canada, men arrived single and lived 
as bachelors in Canada. In 1931, for example, out of a total 
Chinese population of 46,000 in Canada, less than 10% were women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1885 to 1923 migrants were largely men and then essentially 
all Chinese immigration was stopped for a period of 24 years. 
This bachelor society inhibited a second generation of Chinese 
Canadians and the population of Chinese Canadians shrank 
dramatically between 1923 and about 1950.  It was only post-World 
War II that family reunification and new immigration brought 
normality to Chinese immigration and family relationships in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Structural racism in Canadian immigration gradually disappeared 
after 1947 due to a combination of court challenges and 
government initiatives.  In 1957 a major event occurred with the 
election of Douglas Jung as a Conservative MP in Vancouver, the 
first Chinese Canadian member of parliament.  We all know of the 
valued contribution of the Chinese Canadian community in Canada 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As distasteful as the story is of how government handled Chinese 
immigration to Canada, there are lessons for us all.  The story I 
have told is to demonstrate that government has discriminated 
against racial groups in Canada and it is important to design our 
immigration and citizenship rules in such a way that this 
discrimination does not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizenship is an enviable status in the world 
community.  Canada must set the rules and we must do so in a way 
that is fair to legitimate aspirants who match Canada's needs, 
that offers fair opportunity and that penalizes those who want to 
impose their priorities on the country by queue jumping or 
abusing Canada's hospitality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the provisions in Bill C-63 give too much discretion to 
the minister and are invitations to abuse our hospitality.  This 
is distasteful and should be changed.  My colleagues have pointed 
out many of these shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways a nation is defined by its immigration and 
citizenship policies.  Ours need major rework and this act does 
not contribute in a major way to doing that.  Today Chinese 
Canadians are represented in all professions in Canada and in all 
walks of life.  As a cultural group they have emphasized 
education because that is how best to express upward mobility. 
This is the legacy many cultural groups have brought to Canada 
and that is what we want to encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now get into some of the specifics of Bill C-63. 
The bill is intended to replace an act which has been in 
existence without any real change since 1977.  It has been billed 
as a major reform but it really does not do that.  Critical areas 
have been neglected and other areas have been altered in a 
negative way.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unwillingness to change integral elements of the act will 
result in the court system ultimately creating law and an 
increase in power of the minister to make closed door decisions 
without oversight by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one major section on citizenship at birth.  Bill C-63 
states in effect that all children born in Canada will continue 
to automatically acquire Canadian citizenship regardless of their 
parents' immigration or citizenship status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations from the 1994 all party standing committee 
stated that children born in Canada should be Canadian citizens 
only if one or both their parents is a permanent resident of 
Canada.  In the judgment of Canadians there is abuse of the 
provision of the Citizenship Act granting automatic citizenship 
to children born on Canadian soil.  The minister stated that she 
made no changes to this clause because there was no research done 
on how big a problem the citizenship at birth issue is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite a statement, recognizing there is a problem, not 
addressing it and not taking the four and a half years since the 
report came out to do anything about gathering statistical 
evidence to support or refute the dimension of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under grant of citizenship the current legislation allows 
individuals whose application for permanent residence is approved 
to count each full day of residency in Canada from the date of 
application as a half day toward the total needed for their 
citizenship application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 penalizes applicants for bureaucratic delays within 
the system, even if those delays are no fault of the applicants. 
Many groups have petitioned the minister to change this provision 
so that applicants are not penalized for bureaucratic delay.  The 
official opposition calls for reinstatement of this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I will speak about is the citizenship oath.  This 
may as well be called the minister's oath.  It was not done in 
the public domain with public input.  We missed a grand 
opportunity.  The government wants to retain its monopoly on 
citizenship and immigration against the better judgment of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to discuss Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a more personal perspective on it.  As an 
immigrant to this country it was an honour when I, with my 
parents and my other brothers and sisters, finally swore the oath 
of allegiance to Canada.  I have an understanding of what an 
absolutely wonderful thrill that was.  Growing up in such a free 
and great country as Canada, I had hoped that other immigrants 
and other people wanting to come here would not be side stepped 
or roadblocked or delayed in any way from their achieving the 
same possibilities that my family and I have achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Bill C-63 is a bit of a bureaucratic nightmare. To 
say to people coming here that they may or may not be accepted as 
citizens of this country because of bureaucratic bungling in the 
department is unacceptable.  It goes to prove that the people who 
drafted the bill did not think of all the particulars. It would 
have been better if they had taken more time and carefully 
drafted the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have concerns regarding the oath of allegiance. 
Even though I come from an area which is very much in favour of 
the monarchy, there are many aspects to the oath of allegiance 
that I think need to be modernized and accepted to more 
Canadians.  The previous speaker from the Reform Party was 
correct that there should have been a wide open debate. 
Something of this importance in stature across the country should 
have been open to all Canadian to debate exactly what kind of an 
oath of allegiance we should have for new Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that is often neglected in the aspect of citizenry 
is our aboriginal people.  They were the first citizens of this 
country.  Nobody asked them.  They seem to get bypassed in all 
these circumstances and everything else.  We came to this country 
400 or 500 years ago and literally took over from them.  They had 
a very good way of life for thousands of years and we came in an 
said we were going to change everything.  That is stretching the 
argument a bit, but unfortunately the fact is they are an 
integral part of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about two founding nations in this country.  We actually 
have three and they were the first.  The part that really 
disturbs me is the fact of having an understanding of the French 
or English language, the two official languages. It is really a 
hardship on new immigrants who come to this country.  There is no 
question that when my family came here they hardly knew a word 
of English at all, not a word.  According to the bill they could be 
restricted from entering this country because of an act of that 
nature.  I find that wrong.  I wish that the minister and the 
government would take that back and review the situation and go 
through the clauses that many of us on the opposition side feel 
are flawed in this department and in this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the bill because the bill does not address the 
real problems in immigration that are reported to every one of us 
as MPs almost on a daily basis.  I know some members in the House 
are in rural constituencies and they really are not exposed to 
the sorts of problems with the immigration system experienced by 
members of parliament in urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give some examples of some of the problems in the 
Vancouver area that simply are not addressed by the content of 
the bill.  I am sure many of the members have seen the news items 
on television where up to 80 Honduran drug dealers are arrested 
at one time in Vancouver in drug sweeps. These 80 Hondurans are 
criminal refugee claimants.  They are not genuine immigrants. 
They are people who have come through our borders using false 
passports, using false documentation and they go straight to the 
drug dealing trade on the streets of Vancouver and east 
Vancouver.  Some of them are as young as 12 and they are here 
illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has done absolutely nothing in her bill to deal 
with that type of problem.  In fact, we are so stupid in Canada 
that we even brought a social worker from Honduras to look after 
all these illegals who are already here taking our welfare 
payments, taking free medical care, taking free dental care and 
all the other benefits that hardworking Canadians are entitled to 
while they deal drugs on the streets of Vancouver and we cannot 
do anything to get rid of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These very same people are arrested over and over again every 
week.  They are taken down to the court house and within an hour 
they are back on the streets. There is an example of a major 
problem in the Vancouver area that has been completely ignored in 
the bill by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same sort of problem in Vancouver every night with 
illegals where up to half of those arrested in the Vancouver area 
on any night of the week are illegal refugee claimants.  Imagine 
that, half of those arrested in Vancouver every night of the week 
are illegal refugee claimants.  That gives members an idea of the 
size of the problem, the strain on our police forces, the strain 
on our welfare system, the court system, all the issues that flow 
from that one problem of porous borders, our inability to keep 
criminals out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the refugee claimants who say they are in Canada because 
they would be persecuted in their own country—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I remind the Reform Party that we are debating Bill C-63, 
an act respecting Canadian citizenship.  It is important that we 
have some relevancy.  What the member is talking about and what 
the Reform— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that my constituents 
consider what I am saying to be extremely relevant to this bill. 
The fact is the bill does not address the problems that they have 
identified for years.  They have begged the minister to deal with 
them.  I have already given some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things my constituents have suggested to the 
minister, and she heard it on radio talk shows when she was out 
there last year, was that she include in a new bill an ability 
for us to get rid of these criminals, to deport them in lieu of 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this absolutely ludicrous situation where a refugee 
claimant can come in and commit a crime, they go into the court 
system and if we are really lucky the person gets put in jail. As 
soon as that person is released on probation, that is considered 
to be a part of the court sentence.  So the immigration 
deportation process cannot start up.  The person can wander 
around the streets, commit another crime and go back to jail. 
This process is repeated over and over again.  Thousands of 
people are doing it in the Vancouver area.  I am certain it must 
be happening in Toronto and it has to be happening in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For an unknown reason the minister is ignoring the problem.  She 
brings in these bills that fiddle around the edges of the 
problems but never deals with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House some examples of the sorts of things that 
happen in my office.  On a weekly basis we get anything up to 
about a dozen immigration case inquiries.  I am an immigrant. No 
one can say I am against immigration.  I could not have come here 
if I was against immigration.  But what I stand for is a quality 
in immigration.  There is nothing wrong with screening people to 
find quality immigrants to come here and who want to be Canadian, 
not for them to bring their problems from some other country or 
to bring criminals into this country, but to bring decent, 
hardworking people who can contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 20 years ago the immigration department worked through the 
embassies to find quality people to come to Canada who had skills 
and who could help the country grow.  Now the immigration 
department is captive of its own system.  The quotas are filled 
almost exclusively by family reunification and people who come to 
invest money.  It is not done in a proactive way to find people 
we really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House four or five recent examples of the types 
of cases that come to my office.  A short time ago a man called 
to say he was having trouble sponsoring his wife from Pakistan 
because the Canadian embassy refused to recognize his marriage. 
We did an inquiry.  What did we find out?  This man married 
someone he had never met.  He had never seen the women.  He had 
never been to the town she lived in.  He could not produce any 
wedding photographs.  Someone else stood in for him so all the 
photographs were of someone else.  He expected me to be an 
advocate for him when he had not even met the woman he was 
sponsoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week an Iranian man called me.  He already had a 
sponsorship list of five people he wanted to bring in. He called 
to ask us to cancel the five he had already decided to sponsor. 
He wanted to change them to a different five.  What sort of 
nonsense is this?  A person does not know who he wants to sponsor 
into the country? It is an indication of another problem that 
occurs in the Vancouver area which is a pyramid selling scheme 
for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People sell sponsorships.  I know my colleague with the same 
name from Fraser Valley had a problem in his area where there was 
a big pyramid selling scheme.  People would go back to India, get 
married and sponsor the person who would then sponsor the family. 
They would go back and get married and sponsor the next group. 
There was a huge amount of money changing hands.  That structure 
was broken up a couple of years ago.  It gives us an idea of the 
sort of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had another case a week ago where a refugee claimant who was 
sponsoring his wife from India called to ask why they had done 
nothing for almost a year.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our contact at immigration Canada advised that the refugee 
claimant in my riding was due to appear in court on kidnapping 
charges.  He had actually kidnapped someone in Canada.  At the 
same time as he is committing these crimes he is trying to 
sponsor more people in.  It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The state of our immigration system is appalling and the 
minister's bill is doing nothing to address these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward the end of last year another woman called asking me to 
write a letter of support to immigration Canada so that her 
husband, who had already been deported back to Iran, could come 
back to Canada.  He had committed a crime in Montreal and had 
been deported twice.  He was counterfeiting money in Canada and 
this woman wanted me to write a letter in support of his coming 
back.  It is absolutely amazing what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had more cases over the past few years than we can count 
of refugee claimants in my riding who have actually gone back to 
the country that they claim they were persecuted in.  They claim 
to be destitute and persecuted but somehow they have the money to 
go back on a vacation to the country that is supposed to be 
persecuting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course they get found out.  One would think that it 
would be an easy job to deport them.  No, sir.  It is impossible 
to deport them.  On average it takes 10 to 12 years to get that 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can tell I am just getting warmed up.  I have a list 
of stuff here but with only one minute left I know I will not get 
through it all.  However, perhaps I have been able to illustrate 
very well the sorts of problems this minister has not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to sum this up in the last minute I have. Last March 
a refugee claimant from Sri Lanka was arrested near Toronto with 
10,000 fake Canadian citizenship cards in his possession.  He had 
paid about $15,000 for them, $1.50 for each Canadian citizenship 
card.  A Nigerian was arrested in May with dozens of false 
immigration documents, citizenship cards, social insurance cards, 
drivers licences and false passports.  Even here in Ottawa the 
RCMP is constantly confiscating false passports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is in a mess and Bill C-63 does absolutely nothing to 
address it.  It is a disgrace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today on Bill C-63, an act to amend the citizenship act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship and immigration matters are extremely important to 
many of my constituents in Markham.  It therefore gives me great 
pleasure to speak to this proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last month we signed up 360 new citizens. Markham has a 
population of 190,000. Roughly 55% are of ethnic origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My caucus colleagues from Saint John, New Brunswick and St. 
John's East have spoken very eloquently about the human side of 
citizenship and immigration cases.  I would like to outline some 
of the details of Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation amends the citizenship act by changing certain 
citizenship rights and conditions for citizens and applicants. 
This bill also revises the criteria for obtaining citizenship, 
the process for granting, denying and revoking citizenship to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a result of the report of the immigration 
legislation review advisory group which was submitted to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in December 1997.  The 
report was entitled “Not Just Numbers:  A Canadian Framework for 
Future Immigration”.  The government had commissioned the review 
to determine how immigration and citizenship legislation could be 
reformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was met with mixed reviews from the press and the 
public.  Concerns were raised about a number of issues, including 
new citizenship tests that require a physical presence in Canada, 
dropping reference to monarch successors from the citizenship 
oath and the new requirements that the person speak one of 
Canada's two official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration gives these and other issues due scrutiny.  We 
need to hear from organizations representing our immigrant 
community.  Furthermore, we need to hear from other individuals 
and groups concerned with the different aspects of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to review some of the substances of the 
legislation. 
Bill C-63 stipulates that a person born in Canada becomes a 
citizen unless the parents are diplomatic staff of a foreign 
government or the United Nations.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also allows the minister to grant citizenship to a 
person who is at least 18 years old, meets the residency test of 
being present for three of the past five years, has an adequate 
knowledge of English or French, and has adequate knowledge of 
Canada, citizenship responsibilities and can communicate that 
knowledge in English or French without a translator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residency test is changed in two significant ways.  First, 
prospective citizens must have been residents for three of five 
years prior to application rather than three of the previous 
four.  Second, the rules are changed to require that the 
prospective citizen be physically present in Canada during those 
three years.  Currently it is possible to be a permanent resident 
of Canada while actually living abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minimum residency requirements may be waived on compassionate 
grounds.  The minister may grant citizenship to a minor or 
adopted child on application.  The minister may also grant 
citizenship to someone who was born outside Canada to a citizen 
parent, is less than 28 years old, has resided in Canada for at 
least three of the past five years and has not been convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons may be stripped of citizenship if they were born outside 
Canada to Canadian citizens who was born outside Canada after 
February 14, 1977, respectively, at aged 28 unless they meet 
minimum residency requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship may be renounced if persons apply to the minister 
because they are citizens of another country or successfully 
apply for another citizenship, not a minor, able to understand 
the significance of citizenship renunciation and not residing in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cabinet may order the revocation of citizenship if a person 
obtained it by duplicity.  Persons referred for citizenship by 
someone who loses citizenship could also lose their citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may not revoke a person's citizenship if the person 
is not notified or if the person within 30 days of notice requests 
appeal to a federal court and it is determined by federal court 
that citizenship was not obtained by some false representation or 
fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 allows the minister to restore citizenship to a person 
whose citizenship was not revoked under the act or prior to the 
legislation or was a permanent resident of Canada after loss of 
citizenship and has at least 365 days of residence in Canada as a 
permanent resident in the two years preceding application for 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister or cabinet believe that it is against the public 
interest, any person may be disallowed from taking the 
citizenship oath.  Such a decision would remain in effect for 
five years.  Any person determined to be a threat to Canadian 
security under the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act may 
also be barred citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally Bill C-63 specifies that persons may be denied 
citizenship if they are on parole, probation or imprisoned, 
charged with an indictable offence in or outside Canada, under 
investigation by the Minister of Justice, the RCMP, CSIS or are 
or have been charged under the Criminal Code, have not been 
granted legal entry to Canada or are under removal order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 lets the minister monitor conformity to the act and 
reverse citizenship decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship judges will be renamed citizenship commissioners and 
will be responsible for promoting Canadian values, respect of law 
and social harmony.  While they will preside over citizenship 
ceremonies, they shall no longer approve citizenship 
applications.  Instead applications shall be decided by 
departmental officers.  The salaries and benefits of the position 
will remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 changes the oath of citizenship.  Where the current 
oath swears or affirms allegiance to the Queen and her 
successors, the new oath swears allegiance only to the Queen but 
not her successors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill makes it an offence to misuse citizenship 
related documents.  It sets punishment standards for citizenship 
officers who engage in wrongful behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large these changes appear welcome and somewhat overdue. 
It seems that every year we keep getting consultation papers or 
reports released by the minister without any concrete action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do worry about the impact that Bill C-63 tougher citizenship 
qualifications will have for international business people and 
others who travel extensively outside the country.  The bill 
would force immigrants to be physically within Canadian borders 
for 1,095 days, a total of three years within a five year period 
before applying for citizenship. 
We need to be careful not to unfairly restrict international 
commercial activities in the private sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one problem that I and others members of the House see 
repeatedly in our offices, that the immigration department is in 
a mess.  The minister has had three years to deal with it and yet 
she has done nothing.  In fact things are spiralling out of 
control.  Most members of the House have put cases into the her 
lap, only to see them completely disappear and evaporate without 
any action being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some of the problems that are taking place. As 
are other members of the House, I am an immigrant to this 
country.  We are deeply grateful for what Canada has given us. 
Let us make no mistake about that.  However, the traditional role 
of immigration into Canada, the backbone and building block of 
our nation, has been watered down by incompetence on the part of 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have traditionally relied on an independent class of 
immigrants, who are trying to get into Canada, to build the 
country.  They are going through the hoops and are told to leave 
the country.  They are told they cannot get in.  They do all the 
work, put their money down, and are sent back to from where they 
came, even when they are employed in this country.  On the other 
hand, individuals who are criminals and commit offences on our 
soil are allowed to walk free on Canadian soil.  What kind of 
immigration policy is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are trying to get legitimate family members into 
Canada are not allowed to do so.  People who are legitimate 
refugees cannot come in.  However those who are bogus refugees 
are allowed to come in.  Why is that so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and above the incompetence the minister shows in botching 
up her portfolio and in what she does to the citizens of this 
country, she does a greater disservice to legitimate immigrants 
who want to come to Canada to build a safe and secure future for 
themselves and their family.  Those are the people the minister 
is slapping in the face by botching up her portfolio.  This needs 
to be fixed.  The minister has had the opportunity to fix it but 
she has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4(1) of the bill indicates that individuals who are born 
on Canadian soil automatically become Canadian citizens.  Let us 
talk about some scams.  One of the scams is that persons can 
bring in their children between the ages of 12 and 16, let 
someone here adopt them and when they become 19 they can bring 
the whole family into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was delivering a baby I learned of another scam.  People 
can come into the country in the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy, have babies on Canadian soil and the children 
automatically becomes Canadian and can then bring the entire 
family into the country.  That is not good immigration.  That is 
gypping the immigration system and immigrants who come into this 
country by going through legitimate hoops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been more intelligent for the minister to have a 
residency requirement for persons coming into the country who are 
having a child who will become a Canadian citizen.  There should 
be a two year residency requirement or they should be landed 
immigrants before they ultimately become Canadian citizens.  If 
those provisions were included this loophole would be blocked. 
Also the loophole with respect to adoption needs to be blocked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can do a number of things.  My colleague from 
Vancouver mentioned the issue of the oath of allegiance.  We have 
a lot of rights in Canada but we do not talk about a lot of 
responsibility.  The minister could have included in the oath of 
allegiance an allegiance to Canada, an allegiance articulating 
the responsibilities of people when they come to the country. 
That would have made the oath of allegiance, the oath of 
citizenship, meaningful.  She failed once again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to build an immigration policy that does justice to 
Canada, if we are to build an immigration policy that will be 
fairer to immigrants as well as to Canadian citizens, we have to 
get back to basic principles.  We have to build an immigration 
policy that focuses on the independent class of immigrants.  We 
have to make sure the people who come into the country have the 
skills to contribute to the Canadian economy and have the 
linguistic skills to be able to function within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize our responsibility to live up to our 
international obligations under the United Nations treaties we 
have signed with respect to refugees.  Letting in legitimate 
refugees is a good thing, a humanitarian and compassionate thing, 
but letting in bogus refugees, people who are using refugee 
claimant status as something to queue jump, does a disservice to 
Canada and Canadians.  Above all else, it does a disservice to 
the legitimate refugees and immigrants trying to come into the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned before, immigrants to the country who 
commit crimes should be sent back to the country they came from 
and banned from coming back into Canada for at least 10 years. In 
that way we would ensure the safety and security of our country 
for both immigrants and Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeking from the minister an element of fairness, an 
element of intelligence, and an element of a co-ordinated 
strategy within the ministry of immigration which will ensure we 
have an immigration policy that strengthens and not weakens 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigrants come through the offices of every member of the House 
with stories of how they have been forced to pay for the mistakes 
of the ministry.  When people who try to bring their beloved into 
the country they come here with a certain set of rules and 
guidelines, only to be told that they have to return to their 
countries of origin and go through the process again.  When they 
go back to their countries of origin they are told to go back to 
Canada.  This costs them money they often do not have.  It also 
causes them an unnecessary amount of time to go through the 
process of becoming a legitimate contributor to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot understand why the minister, after three years in her 
portfolio, has failed to deal with these fundamental issues.  She 
was even guided by the House Standing Committee on Immigration 
and Citizenship.  Four years ago the committee placed 28 
recommendations inn the minister's lap.  Was anything done about 
them?  No.  Why does it take four years to deal with 28 
recommendations from a bipartisan committee to strengthen our 
immigration system?  What we see is Bill C-63 which, if anything, 
nibbles around the edges of our system.

that, his charismatic style won legions of new fans to standard

dashing, dedicated and driven to succeed.  He is equally 
proficient behind a microphone as he is behind a horse, a public

getting rid of regional rates of pay, the GST, and more 
importantly, child poverty, none of which it kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time the Liberals talked about attacking child poverty 
and providing child care to allow parents to take full time, 
family supporting jobs.  They have not done so.  Budget after 
budget more and children became poor.  It is continuing.  The 
child care promise also disappeared along with pay equity and 
abolishing the GST promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government does not seem to understand that in 
order to eliminate child poverty we need to do away with their 
parents' poverty.  The NDP has always supported the creation of a 
national child care program.  We believe that children deserve a 
chance to show what they can do.

It needs it today.  But with bracket creep and the payroll tax 
increases it will spend more in taxes than it did last year, than 
it does this year.

<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, three 
provinces, along with Quebec, constituted a group determined to 
get the federal government to respect the common front on the 
social union.  They were Ontario, Alberta and, to a lesser 
extent and a bit later on, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec very quickly found itself isolated and, less than two 
weeks later, these three provinces hit the jackpot in the 
federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs: 
Were there in fact discussions and negotiations on a financial 
basis with the three provinces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the social union negotiations, it was always 
agreed that we would talk about the social union and the 
ministers of finance would talk about the money angle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on June 15, 1998, the finance ministers from all 
provinces except Quebec told the Government of Canada that they 
wanted to go back to equal social transfer payments, as long as 
equalization payments could be increased accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Minister of Finance announced a few days ago, 
the result being that Quebec will receive 34% of the overall 
transfer and Ontario only 25%.  Ontario is therefore not 
necessarily the big winner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, am I to 
understand from the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs that 
there were discussions to convince British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario to change their positions on the social union framework 
agreement and that a financial argument was never used? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they changed their positions without knowing 
that it would be to their financial advantage.

the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is going around 
telling people that the social union agreement is the eighth 
wonder of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that agreement, the federal 
government pledges to consult with the provinces at least one 
year prior to implementing funding changes in existing social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since, in its budget, the government significantly changed 
funding for social transfers, when did it give notice to Quebec 
of that change? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is mistaken. The eighth wonder of the 
world is the Quebec City bridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for giving notice under the social agreement framework, we 
have been talking about that change not just for one year, but 
since 1990, when the ceiling was imposed on the three richest 
provinces, for two years only. At the time, the current premier 
of Quebec was a federal minister, so he should know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that the first Campeau budget provided 
for equalizing the transfer in 1996. Therefore, we have been 
talking about this issue for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the David Copperfield of Canadian politics is not 
answering our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the federal government invoke social union to interfere 
in the health sector, but not comply with the terms of that same 
social union when it changes the funding of social programs, a 
change that adversely affects Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are three inaccuracies here. First, I just 
explained that this change, which was necessary, was discussed 
over a period of several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Quebec is not adversely affected. Out of the $21.7 
billion in transfers to the provinces, Quebec will get $7.4 
billion or 34% of the total amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is no interference in health. The federal 
government is involved in research because it is also its 
responsibility, and Quebec researchers are very pleased about 
that. I could provide the hon. member with several quotes to 
that effect.

Speaker, yesterday I had a question for the finance minister with 
regard to this so-called health care budget.  The minister 
yesterday responded that some of that money is going to pay down 
past debts.  In other words, this health care budget will have a 
very short shelf life because it is doing nothing to resolve the 
waiting lines crisis in health care.  In fact, it is going to pay 
off past debts.  Can the minister assure us that all that money 
is going to patient care, or is it going to pay down past debt?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

important funding partner.  The provinces deliver services.  In 
order to assist the provinces the federal government in the 
budget made the enormous commitment of $11.5 billion over the 
next five years.  What is really significant is that $3.5 billion 
of that money is available immediately and the provinces will 
decide how they will use those dollars to solve whatever problems 
they have.  We want to know that people in Canada will have 
access to the services they need when they get sick.  They need 
them but it is up to the provinces to deliver those services.

who are doing an effective job.  They have just completed

the minister is wrong about Macedonia and he is wrong about

handles to our troops for protection.  He also tells them not to 
worry, the French will protect them.  Again, if the minister is 
to send our troops into harm's way, into a war zone, why will he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government gave Quebec $1.4 billion in equalization payments to 
get Quebeckers to swallow the fact that they will get only $1 
billion of the $11.5 billion the federal government will be 
investing in health, when Ontario will be getting five times 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Can the minister finally admit that the sum of $1.4 billion is a 
one-time payment covering the past five years and that it is in 
no way a guarantee of the future for Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we look at how things have gone in recent years, 
equalization payments have been stable or have increased.  That 
is a fairly solid guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be said, and I repeat, is that if we add up the 
planned increased in equalization payments for the next five 
years, plus the unplanned increase in the past three years, plus 
the planned increase in the Canada social transfer, we arrive at 
the figure of $21.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion will go to 
Quebec.  That is 34% of the new transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could I ask the Bloc Quebecois to acknowledge that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
equalization payments vary a lot from one year to the next 
according to the state of the economy.  Does the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs realize that, while he guarantees Mike 
Harris $5.5 billion to organize health care, he is saying to 
Bernard Landry “Good luck with your budget.  That is about what 
you are going to get in equalization payments”?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Speaker, I have the figures here to show the hon. member the 
stability of equalization payments in recent years and those 
planned for the future.  This is for Quebec only.  In 1995-96, 
$4.2 billion; in 1996-97, $4.2 billion; in 1997-98, $4.8 billion; 
in 1998-99, $4.6 billion; in 1999-2000, $4.5 billion; in 2000-01, 
$4.7 billion; in 2001-02, $4.9 billion; in 2002-03, $5.1 billion;

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was a 
time when we had one of the best health care systems in the 
world.  That was before the Liberals took power and cut $20 
billion from our health and social programs.  The result of that 
is 200,000 in waiting lines and the wealthy and desperate going 
to the U.S.  For example, a woman from Kelowna said: “It scares 
me to think about what would be happening to me now had I not 
gone to the U.S. for my neurosurgery last fall”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Liberals' worst nightmare not coming to effect, two tier

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Reform Party is prepared to support the complete rearranging of 
the concept of health care insurance.  This concept might include 
such elements as basic deductibles and other variations of the 
health insurance concept”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not two tier medicine, I guess I am wrong when I say 
that the other hon. member, formerly head of the taxpayers

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is 
room for an honest debate on health care which this crew will not 
enter into.  But here is what it will enter into.  It will enter 
into rhetoric on one side and actions on the other.  The actions 
on the other side are very straightforward: 200,000 on waiting 
lists and the wealthy and the desperate going to the U.S. for 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, is it not true that the Liberals have been the creators 
of two tier health care in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is the one who has been pushing two tier 
medicine on behalf of the Reform Party.  Why do they not look at 
themselves in the mirror and admit what they have been doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said not long ago that he proposes removing the 
existing restrictions to the Canada Health Act.  What does that 
mean if it does not mean two tier medicine?  No wonder the 
Conservative Premier of Alberta said about the budget, including 
what we are doing to preserve and strengthen health care: “The 
feds did the right thing in the budget and I have to admit 
that”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1995, that is 
four years before decisions were made on the budget brought down 
this week, the current President of the Treasury Board, who was 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs at the time, stated 
that the per capita formula for distributing the Canada social 
transfer would not be used as it would put Quebec in the most 
unfavourable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
How can the minister's successor proclaim from the rooftops, 
four years later, that the per capita formula is now the best 
for everyone? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> The 
answer is relatively simple, Mr. Speaker. As long as the Canada 
transfer was being reduced, it could not be restored to its 
previous level on an equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to wait for the transfer to grow, in conjunction with 
equalization, before we could do that. And all the provinces 
save Quebec have asked us to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec was the only one to disagree, even 
though it receives 34% of all federal transfer payments. It 
should be very pleased that the equalization portion of the 
transfer keeps growing since it comes with no strings attached. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> What happened at the Privy 
Council during these four years that could bring about such a

allegation, as the Bloc knows full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But since members of the Bloc have decided to stoop that low and 
I have no intention of sinking to the same level, I would like 
to tell my colleagues from the other provinces that the pathetic 
show put on by the Bloc this past week has nothing to do with 
Quebec culture, which is one of trust and solidarity, not petty 
jealousy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-63, an 
act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When debate was interrupted, the hon. 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca had the floor.  He has two 
minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will wrap up my remarks on Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House have the responsibility to do the best that we 
can in all of our endeavours.  For four and one-half years this 
government has been told about the mismanagement and problems 
within our immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration, as members have mentioned, has been a pillar and a 
building block of our country.  Many of us are immigrants and 
were grateful to come to Canada. But the failure of the 
government to deal with the structural problems within our 
immigration system has done a huge disservice not only to 
Canadians, but also to immigrants who have come to this country 
and people trying to get into this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems have been articulated.  The solutions are in front 
of us.  Focus on the independent class of immigrants. Make sure 
that the family reunification class truly appeals to those who 
are immediate family members, not people who are further removed. 
People who come to this country cannot simply come here, have a 
baby and the baby automatically becomes a Canadian citizen. 
Children who are born in this country should retain the 
citizenship of their parents and once the parents become Canadian 
citizens, the children will become Canadian citizens too.  One of 
the scams used by some people who come to Canada is to have a 
child and the child automatically becomes a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the oath of citizenship the minister should have put specific 
and explicit references to the responsibilities a Canadian has to 
our country.  That is very important.  We have a lot of rights 
but we do not talk about the responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are enormous problems faced by immigrants. Immigrants go 
through the hoops.  They try their hardest yet because of 
bureaucratic gross mismanagement they are forced to pay for the 
problems of the ministry.  That has to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the minister to listen to the constructive suggestions 
that have been put forth today.  Listen to them, implement them 
and build a good system for all of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, although I may not be talking specifically about 
Bill C-63, I can assure you that all of my remarks lead into that 
document most thoroughly.  I hope members on the other side of 
the House do not get their noses out of joint too quickly and 
will pay close attention to where this is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to speak to this bill because I am a 
citizen, a new citizen who came to Canada in the late sixties.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to Canada with the intentions of fulfilling a contract to 
teach in a school in Sundre, Alberta, my hometown.  It was only 
supposed to be for a year.  I came here in the sixties with my 
wife and small child and it only took a few months for us to fall 
in love with the country and the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly liked the school system at that time in 
comparison to the one from where I had come.  The schools in the 
United States were leaning toward some very serious social 
engineering. Problems were starting to develop and discipline was 
disappearing.  I was disappointed that was occurring down there. 
When I came to Canada and saw what a fine system was in place and 
how it was being run, I had a strong desire to become a citizen 
of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made application to extend the contract.  It was agreed that 
it would be extended if I would take out landed immigrant status, 
which I did, and if I would agree to become a citizen when I 
became eligible, which I agreed to do and also did.  Upon 
entering the country my wife and I and our one-month old child 
had to go through some very stringent medical exams.  I had to go 
through a lot of security checks.  I was checked strongly in that 
whole area.  Financial obligations had to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I did not object in the slightest bit to all of 
those things.  A number of immigrants who came in at that time 
and who even lived in the same town felt as I do, that all that 
was fair and right.  They felt the government needed to do a 
thorough screening of the people who come to this land seeking to 
become residents and future citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where we have gone and why we have gone the way we 
have in regard to immigration policy or where we are at with the 
refugee policy.  It is really disgusting.  I will not go into any 
great detail on that because members who spoke prior to me have 
done a very thorough job of explaining where we are coming from 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the early years.  After four or five years I 
became eligible to become a citizen.  Then I saw things starting 
to come into the education system and I did not understand why. I 
commented to some of my friends and people associated with 
education as to why they were allowing some of these things to 
happen in the school system.  They had already been tried in the 
United States and they had failed desperately.  It was not good 
for any education system to go in that direction. A lot of them 
did not know because these things were just happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great white towers of government were bringing down mandated 
things that were going to take place. Nobody in any community on 
any scale was ever conferred with as to what kind of school or 
community they wanted. Things just started happening. Mr. 
Speaker, you will remember the era of Mr. Trudeau, the prime 
minister in the early seventies.  That is when things started 
taking place that did not make a lot of sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not arguing with whether the metric system is good or bad 
but I remember when it was decided to go metric.  I had not yet 
become a citizen so I did not want to be too boisterous in my 
feelings.  Down south there were signs up to think metric and all 
kinds of things were being done to promote the metric system. The 
people south of the border in the United States spoke strongly 
and were heard by their government.  The United States did not go 
metric because the people did not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I searched around my community for quite a while and I could not 
find anybody who wanted to go metric either.  Most of the people 
said no.  I thought surely there would not be any problem since 
the people did not want it but lo and behold, we woke up one 
morning and now we have the metric system in this country.  I 
asked people “Why did you let that happen?  You people pay the 
bills, you are the taxpayers, why do you let these things 
happen?”  They said that they could not do anything about it. 
That is just the way things are. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then lo and behold up comes a certain bill that was being 
debated very strongly but apparently nobody across the land was 
very fond of it.  They did not like the bill and did not want it 
to come into being.  That was the language law.  It seemed that 
the country was operating pretty well before all of that.  There 
was a lot of debate and they said no, let us not do it.  But lo 
and behold, we woke up one morning and we had to go through the 
process of changing signs because we now existed under the 
language law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I asked “Why did you let it happen?  Why do you let 
these things go on?  You are the taxpayers.  You are supposed to 
be the boss.  The members of parliament are supposed to be your 
servants, not your dictators.  Why do you let it carry on?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give example after example clear up until the mighty GST. 
I could not find a person anywhere who supported the GST. In a 
massive way people tried to illustrate it through petitions 
asking that parliament not implement the GST, but guess what? 
They got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that, I decided that if I was going to be a citizen in 
this country then I would have to get involved.  I would have to 
speak out.  Because I remembered what the country was like when I 
came here as an immigrant and I suddenly saw where it was going 
and I thought good grief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out comes the charter of rights.  It was not debated to any 
great extent.  Only a few of us noticed at the time that there 
was not an inclusion of property rights.  I asked people “Do you 
realize what you were getting into?  A document that does not 
have the freedom of property rights in place.  Are you sure you 
want this?” I said “Mark my words.  With some of the clauses in 
there, there will be a day down the road when you will have 
courts, judges and other judicial bodies making decisions that 
will affect your lives”.  It became law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, the most blatant example we could have is a judge 
in British Columbia saying that it is okay for a fellow to have 
child pornography in his home.  He declared that, so that is the 
way it is.  And we are supposed to sit back and say that is the 
way it goes, this is Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government of the people, by the people, for the people.  The 
best description of democracy I have ever heard.  I have yet to 
see it occur.  We continually allow those things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then along comes Bill C-63.  I also remember a House of Commons 
committee that was put together four and a half years ago.  It 
came up with some proposals and some ideas of what we should do 
to put together some corrections to immigration, to refugees and 
to citizenship.  The recommendations were brought forward by the 
people of Canada through an extensive consultation program. The 
people stated loud and clear what they would like to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation comes out and it does not reflect one 
thing that the Canadian people said they wanted in this document. 
Not one.  Why?  Because those people over there always know 
best:  “Those poor Canadian people out there do not understand. 
We are the smart ones.  We have been elected and put in this 
place.  We will solve all their problems”.  They are supposed to 
sit back, shut up and take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being an old sheep herder back in my farming days, if I was 
moving sheep from one place to another and I wanted to get them 
across some water to the other side, I had to drag one through 
the water and it would be bleating, screaming and kicking.  I 
would sit it on the other bank.  One was not enough so I would 
drag another one across and there would be two over there. Once I 
got three sheep on the other side, the rest of the sheep would 
say, “There are three sheep over there.  As bad as we hate 
water, we are going to plough through it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what do I see here?  Bills like this one.  We know it is 
going to pass because two or three here have crossed the water 
and all the rest of the sheep will rise to their feet and vote in 
favour of the legislation because those guys know best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stop the dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member but his time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-63.  I am one of many 
Canadians who are very grateful that the hon. member for Wild 
Rose chose Canada as his home.  Without members such as the 
member for Wild Rose we would certainly be further into a 
dictatorship than we already are now.  I thank the hon. member 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House that I am from an agricultural 
background.  Agriculture is very strong in my constituency.  We 
all recognize, to put it politely, what load of fertilizer is 
when see it and smell it.  When I look at the bill it certainly 
reminds me of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some aspects of the bill go a very tiny way to addressing part 
of the problems in the country, but nowhere does it address the 
problems as it should.  Whether or not members opposite like to 
admit it, they spent a great amount of time dealing with new 
citizens and the immigration laws in their daily work schedules. 
I want one of them to stand and deny this is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member in the House since 1993.  Most of the 
concerns with regard to immigration and the downfall in 
citizenship come from first or second generation immigrants. They 
have an abundance of concerns about policy, where it is going and 
who we are letting into the country.  They left their countries 
to come to Canada with great hope and expectations of creating a 
new life and new wealth for not only themselves but for their 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately they now live in a country where many live in fear 
because of immigration laws that allow the criminal element to 
come into the country, that allow the government to welcome them 
with open arms and give them the same rights as every Canadian 
citizen who has resided lawfully in Canada for their entire 
lives. Yet we have the criminal element coming into the country 
under the guise of some of the acts to create havoc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have come to Canada to create a new life well 
recognize this.  They had to put up with it in the countries they 
came from.  This is one of the things they ran from to come here, 
and we are starting to embrace it here with open arms.  That is 
just one aspect of what we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the blatant patronage aspect of the bill. One 
inclusion in the legislation is the continued tradition of 
so-called patronage appointments, namely citizenship 
commissioners.  We do not have to be brain surgeons or rocket 
scientists to recognize exactly what the government means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Far be it for me to 
interrupt the hon. member for Okanagan—Shuswap, but if other 
members in the House want to carry on private conversations, they 
can do so somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assure you this does 
not throw me off topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
rising on a point of order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what am I to make of an 
invitation for the member to come outside? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
rising on a point of order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  No, not to you.  The member for Wild 
Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just heard from 
an member from the other side.  This is typical of what goes on 
and that is fine.  They do not like it when we raise the idea of 
patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What are you talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  That is what we are on now and why 
patronage appointments exist.  They are a gift to those who 
support the government.  That is all they are and nothing more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the hypocrisy of the government and what is going 
on.  It was not that long ago the Canadians census came out. Many 
people in my constituency, first and second generation Canadians, 
filled in a little section by putting in the word Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened when they did that?  The government threatened to 
sue and imprison some of these people because they had the gall 
to write in that they were Canadians.  They came to my office and 
said “Mr. Stinson, I came here to become a Canadian.  I want to 
take on the nationality of a Canadian.  My children are Canadian 
and we look upon ourselves as Canadians”.  Yet the government 
has threatened them for saying they are Canadian.  Even as a 
seventh generation Canadian I was not allowed to put Canadian on 
that census.  What exactly is going on here?  It goes beyond 
being a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the powers in clause 43.  Under this 
clause Bill C-63 grants the minister far-reaching powers, 
unbelievable powers.  The minister has the right to specify who 
may make an application under this act on behalf of a minor, fix 
fees and define who is a spouse for the purpose of the act.  I 
only have to see that part to start wondering what is going on. 
The minister may define what constitutes a relationship of parent 
and child for the purposes of determining the entitlement to 
citizenship under any provision of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian citizen I demand a voice in this regard.  I demand 
the people of Canada also have a voice in this regard and not 
just the minister.  This is arrogance of the highest form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister really wishes to improve the Citizenship Act, 
she should be willing to bring some of these questions into the 
open, have a debate and hear from the Canadian people, not make 
these decisions behind closed doors where she is not accountable 
to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  A committee is doing consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  She is not accountable to anyone. She 
has the right to override anything.  There are dictatorships that 
wish they had this kind of power.  Canadians have sat back far 
too long and just gradually and grudgingly accepted this.  It is 
time for the public to start voicing concerns about what is going 
on in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose was dead on when he said what was 
happening.  I thank the member for Wild Rose for bringing that 
matter to the attention of Canadians.  I hope everybody realizes 
exactly what they are buying into when acts like this one are put 
into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end on that note.  I see members on the 
government side are happy that I will be closing off the debate. 
To tell the truth, I wish I did not have to stand here today to 
talk to the bill at all.  I know hon. members opposite do too, 
because they do not like people out there to hear what is really 
going on.  That is fine.  I understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ultimate wish is that this legislation goes on to the garbage 
pile where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

financial problems testify to this challenge, be it in the 
overall budget or in the efforts of the force to try to combat 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Firearms Act is another example of waste before the 
Canadian public.  The spiralling costs and administrative 
problems are yet other examples that the Liberal government will 
put this type of legislation for political gain ahead of the 
actual costs of the law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of the implementation of the Firearms Act could reach 
as high as an estimated cost of $350 million.  These estimates 
could be even higher.  This comes from the government's own 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I met with representatives of the National Firearms 
Association who are travelling throughout the country promoting a 
more practical and simpler approach to firearms legislation and 
certainly putting greater emphasis on actual safety and actual 
use of government funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal government advocates hundreds of millions of 
dollars for gun registry, the Canadian police information system 
that will house the data from this piece of legislation, the 
important tool police officers use for information purposes, is 
coming apart at the seams and is in need of a drastic influx of 
federal money, $200 million by some conservative estimates, to 
make it operational.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act throughout the country is perceived as 
not working for the average Canadian.  It has been said aloud by 
the government and by the minister in particular on numerous 
occasions that we can expect changes or a revamped version of the 
Young Offenders Act in the near future or, to use the minister's 
often quoted phrase, in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighteen months have passed since these pronouncements were 
first made and this legislative initiative is still forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is in itself an important tool for law 
enforcement in the community but there are financial limitations 
facing our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of how the federal government proceeds with the new 
youth crime legislation, if it does not assume a fair share of 
the cost, it cannot realistically hope that the existing or any 
new legislation will meet the intended ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice admitted in October that substantial 
extra funding is needed to successfully reinforce Canada's youth 
justice system.  And as the minister made that promise in January 
to introduce new young offenders legislation, as she had on 
previous occasions, once again one is left to wonder when it will 
be coming and why in the budget this very week we do not see an 
indication of a government commitment to this new proposed piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's promises in the past have proven suspect on this 
particular issue, so Motion No. 508 in its simplest terms is an 
important opportunity for this House to express its collective 
favour in terms of putting fair funding and fair dollars on the 
table when addressing the issue of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While proposed legislative solutions vary among parties and 
members of this House, I hope there can be some non-partisan 
approach taken to this issue.  The government itself has a 
responsibility to assume its fair share of the programs and the 
services that are being currently administered by the provinces 
to assist in the execution of federal youth crime legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most members will recall, the Young Offenders Act is 
relatively young legislation, having come into effect in 1984, 
and while the statute falls under federal jurisdiction most of 
the consequent services and programs for young offenders are 
provided by provincial and territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original commitment of the federal government was to share 
the risk of implementation of the Young Offenders Act.  This 
included the financial risk.  The federal government therefore 
undertook to contribute an amount approximately 50% of provincial 
spending on young offenders programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that a disparity among the provinces was 
created by these cost sharing agreements.  Prior to the Young 
Offenders Act the cost sharing agreement fell under the Canada 
assistance plan and was based on child welfare related objectives 
and essentially restricted to custody costs, the previous 
legislation being the juvenile delinquents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the original Young Offenders Act cost sharing agreements, 
custody costs continued to be included and the list of programs 
covered by the 50:50 agreement expanded to include post 
adjudication, detention, alternative measures, which is a more 
recent initiative, and bail supervision programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other items such as probation and predisposition reports have 
been added similarly to the list of cost shareable programs and 
the services that were intended under this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the nature of that agreement whereby the federal 
government's contribution was determined by how much the 
provinces and territories would spend on federal youth offender 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caused a disparity which I referred to.  Nearly 75% of the 
federal dollars in the mid to late 1980s was directed to custody 
and custodial programming.  This resulted in less federal support 
for provinces with lower custody rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because different provinces and territories obviously have 
different priorities, the federal government should not 
financially punish those jurisdictions for focusing on 
non-custodial programs which is what I see as implicit in the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stress, however, that in negotiating a new funding 
arrangement the federal government should likewise not punish 
provinces that favour custody in their approach to enforcement of 
the Young Offenders Act or the equivalent youth crime legislation 
whenever that may come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equity and a level standard approach is what is desirable in 
the final analysis. 
I should note that I specifically left out any reference to 
funding formula mechanisms, the reason being that I do not want 
this debate to become bogged down in custodial arrangements 
versus alternative measures. That debate would be for another 
time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion deals with global funding which, regardless of the 
funding formula, heavily penalizes the provinces and territories. 
When the original cost sharing agreement expired in 1989 the 
federal government of the day, facing serious fiscal problems, 
froze its future share of the cost sharing program at the funding 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, I will admit, was a Progressive Conservative government 
but the funding was frozen at the levels which existed at that 
time and the amount that was set aside at that time was $156 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although admittedly a Conservative government along with the 
actual funding cuts in subsequent years, and I refer specifically 
to 1996-97 when 3.9% of that original cost sharing was cut and 
3.5% in 1998-99, the overall federal share of eligible provincial 
costs on young offenders programs fell an average of 
approximately 30%.  In actual dollars that translated into a 
little less than $145 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government froze and then cut its financial 
contributions, the nature of the funding formula remained intact, 
resulting in a persisting disparity between the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the disparity the fact remains that all provincial 
and territorial jurisdictions have suffered at the hands of the 
federal government's decision.  This is another example of 
federal downloading that needs to be corrected before any 
realistic overhaul of the Young Offenders Act can happen.  The 
provinces and territories are rightfully upset by the abandonment 
of the federal government. They are funding the majority of the 
costs and on a national overall average they are funding 70% of 
the young offenders programs which are constitutionally a federal 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that a level of animosity then emerges from 
these provincial-federal talks, in particular in the area of 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the federal government only covers 16% of the cost of 
provincially mandated programs such as health care, 
post-secondary education and social assistance.  Is it any wonder 
that provinces are now clamouring that the share of the young 
offenders programs, which they assert is a federal 
responsibility, be allocated on a similar scale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the provinces are encouraging the federal government 
to revert to at least a 50:50 basis with future federal funding 
arrangements reflecting a reverse share of the federal-provincial 
funding for health care and social programs instead of a 30% 
share which they are currently carrying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this would demand is dollars.  By my calculations the 
federal government is covering 30% of the costs which are set at 
approximately $144 million this fiscal year, and an 84% share 
would come to around $400 million annually.  But we know, as a 
result of the budget, that this will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An honourable and reasonable compromise to this would be for the 
federal government to commit to returning to the 50% share that 
it once assumed.  We are not suggesting that this would happen 
overnight.   In actual spending this would amount to roughly $240 
million.  The wording of Motion No. 508 is such that it would 
allow the federal government to phase in its increase in 
spending.  The details and timeframe would be negotiated through 
a new cost sharing arrangement between the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, if one believes recent articles in the <I>Post</I>, the 
minister has ruled out any return to the level of funding that 
was provided in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am left to believe that the federal government will not resume 
a 50% share of the federal Young Offenders Act or whatever form 
it takes any time soon.  Hopefully the Liberal member designated 
to speak, the parliamentary secretary, will clarify this 
assertion by the minister that there is no intention on the part 
of this government to return to its rightful share.  There 
appears to be no logical reason why the federal government would 
not assume its fair portion.  After all, the federal government's 
credibility, and especially that of the minister, appears to be 
extremely suspect by the majority of Canadians and by the 
majority of provincial and territorial governments on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the youth crime issue itself there is a litany of other 
issues where the federal Liberal government has disappointed its 
provincial and territorial counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four provinces and two territories representing almost 55% of 
Canada's population have filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of 
Canada on the Liberal government's Firearms Act. This does not 
bode well for the confidence that these provinces hold in their 
federal counterpart.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the province of Nova Scotia will be adding its name to 
that list of those challenging the act when it elects a 
Conservative government.  It is a very questionable set of 
priorities when it comes down to an issue as fundamental as the 
Young Offenders Act and the federal government's abdication of 
its responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of this abdication comes from the call of at 
least four provinces for the establishment of a national sex 
offender registry.  Once more we have seen the federal government 
being very slow to act let alone react to calls for such a 
registry.  It is something I have followed closely. Colleagues on 
this side of the House have tried to get the attention of the 
federal government on a number of justice issues only to be 
rebuffed with the response that the government has its own agenda 
which it is committed to following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore equally important in timing when one looks at 
the crisis facing our current law enforcement community, in 
particular the RCMP, with respect to the funding costs it has 
undergone since the Liberals were elected in 1994.  RCMP 
Commissioner Phil Murray has admitted the force cannot continue 
to function with its current funding and that an underfunding of 
the RCMP affects provincial and municipal governments.  This 
again represents a form of downloading.  The CPIC system has been 
described as rusting out.  This is the CPIC system which would 
now also carry the additional burden of gun registry and DNA 
databank legislation.  It is like putting more and more weight on 
a tired old mule, and that is going to collapse. When the RCMP 
problems were particularly acute in British Columbia, that 
province's attorney general mused about the establishment of a 
new provincial police force in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the issue of replacement legislation for the Young 
Offenders Act.  I have spoken to the delay and to the continual 
promise that this is coming.  These promises and the broken 
promises are not new to this government.  Many of the 
recommendations put forward by the opposition in committee were 
not adopted by the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997 the federal Minister of Justice met with her 
provincial and territorial counterparts at the annual meeting. 
She promised at that time there would be new young offender 
legislation coming at their next meeting.  That meeting has come 
and gone.  She showed up with empty hands.  The legislation was 
not there and it is still not before the Canadian people. When 
the federal Minister of Justice met with her counterparts at the 
end of October 1998 she showed up with empty hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to join with me in supporting this motion, in 
bringing it forward for debate and in placing a high priority on 
the federal government's assuming its official responsibility 
with respect to the funding of the legislation that is 
forthcoming for the current Young Offenders Act in its present 
form.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is well aware that the provinces and the federal 
government share responsibility for ensuring an effective 
Canada-wide youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also wishes to note, as she has done on a number of 
occasions in the past, that additional funding will be necessary 
to implement the new legislation she is about to table, as well 
as to support the services and programs that will play a direct 
role in the achievement of several priorities on which the 
federal government and the provinces agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the use to which federal funding is put, I would remind 
the House that, in April 1997, following a thorough examination 
of the youth justice system, the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs submitted certain recommendations regarding 
federal-provincial shared-cost arrangements with respect to 
services for young offenders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee made it clear that it favoured an approach based 
on early intervention where prevention efforts, community and 
family based informal, non-criminal justice and non-custodial 
strategies are given primacy. The committee came to the 
conclusion that cost sharing arrangements should be adapted to 
reflect this new approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that while acknowledging the 
importance of adequate funding for youth justice services and 
programs, the committee did not recommend a return to an open 
ended 50:50 sharing of all provincial costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, the committee specifically recommended that 
discussions with the provinces and territories be undertaken with 
the goal of shifting resources away from custodial institutions 
or incarceration and into community based services. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that, in recent years, Canada as a whole continues to 
be among those nations with the highest number of young 
offenders in custody, continues to concern us.  Although 
international comparisons are difficult, because of systemic 
differences, it appears that Canada incarcerates proportionally 
more young offenders than even the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the rates of incarceration vary considerably across the 
country, varying between 9% and 32% for 10,000 adolescents, 
according to provincial figures.  The rates are generally higher 
where alternative sentencing is rare or non-existent. 
Finally, it is sad to note that the vast majority of youth in 
custody are there for non-violent offences, to which community 
approaches, which promote social values such as responsibility 
and accountability, would be a better response. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes the matter worse is that incarceration is extremely 
expensive.  As more and more money is spent on custody, less and 
less can be dedicated to those alternatives that could eventually 
reduce overall budgets and provide for more meaningful 
consequences for the majority of offenders. A continuing 
deterioration of alternative programming could in turn create a 
vicious cycle by provoking an even greater reliance on custody, 
clearly the position of the Reform Party also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is baloney and you know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  You wanted to incarcerate 11-year 
olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly funds have to be used wisely in support of overall youth 
justice policy that will be reflected in the bill that the 
Minister of Justice is about to introduce.  It would be unwise 
for the federal government to accept, for example, to reimburse 
the provinces for 50% of the current cost of custody when its 
stated policy is to ensure that incarceration is generally 
reserved for the most serious offenders.  With 50:50 cost sharing 
of all youth justice services, the federal government would be 
left with no protection against further increases in the use and 
the cost of custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this type of agreement would seriously restrict 
federal ability to actively promote the development of 
alternative programming or to support the ongoing operations of 
such programming where it already exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the federal government responsibility for the youth 
justice legislation implies a responsibility to see that its 
various components are properly implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why on Tuesday of this week we were extremely pleased to 
find that almost $400 million has been allocated for fighting 
crime at home and abroad, with $206 million of that money being 
allocated to the new youth justice strategy of this government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding will allow the government to move forward quickly, 
implementing a new approach of giving more money to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the federal funding should be used to achieve two 
broad purposes.  First, it should be designed to support the 
implementation of the new federal legislation across the country. 
Second, it should be used to ensure that special attention is 
given to required services and programs that do not yet exist or 
are currently under funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to ensure that federal funding is equitably 
allocated to the individual provinces and territories.  Obviously 
and open ended 50:50 cost sharing of all youth justice services 
and programs would offer no particular support in the 
achievements of the above purposes.  It could actually have a 
detrimental effect in encouraging an inconsistent partial 
implementation of the legislation across the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the provinces are responsible for administering justice 
and can legitimately choose various means to enforce the law in 
a way that suits their individual priorities and specificity, 
the federal government must ensure that the law is applied in 
compliance with its principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will see when the new legislation is introduced, it 
will provide maximum flexibility to the provinces, so that they 
can administer the youth justice system in a way that is best 
for them individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the provinces themselves made that 
request, during our consultations. We listened to them and we 
will follow up on their request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it is perfectly legitimate for the federal government to 
plan its funding so as to give priority to those general 
services and programs that are critical to achieving the main 
objectives of the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it can be expected that some provinces may question 
specific aspects of the proposed legislation, it would be a 
mistake to underestimate the existing degree of support for the 
new approach it reflects.  Similarly, where there might be some 
differences of views with certain provinces in terms of defining 
specific priorities for funding, it would be erroneous to think 
that this is a case where the federal government is imposing its 
views on the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial views have contributed significantly to the shaping 
of the new legislation and will continue to be the key in the 
implementation of it.  Past discussions and continuing 
discussions have also demonstrated there is considerable 
consensus on the need to promote more alternative ways of dealing 
with young offenders. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to build on the basis of a consensus that 
federal funding should first and foremost support the 
development and maintenance of programs that provide significant 
alternatives to the reliance on courts and incarceration. As for 
the provinces and territories, they will continue to be 
responsible for determining how these programs should be 
developed and implemented. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial arrangements will be part of what we hope will be over 
the next several years a flexible implementation phase of the 
youth justice renewal strategy, undertaken in close partnership 
with the provinces and territories as a reflection of our shared 
responsibilities and commitments to youth justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak in support of Motion No. 508 as 
presented by the member from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. We 
appear to be united on this issue.  Maybe there is some hope for 
my hon. colleague yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should increase the federal share of financial support 
for the provisions of the Young Offenders Act, with the eventual 
goal of dividing the costs on a 50:50 basis between the 
Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is essentially calling for the federal government to 
fulfil its original commitment to maintain its 50% share of the 
costs of enforcing the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that as little as a decade ago the 
federal government managed to keep up to the commitment of 
providing half the cost of this legislation.  This was a promise 
made when the Young Offenders Act was brought into force in 1985. 
It is also my understanding that the federal government has been 
slowly chipping away at this commitment to the extent that it now 
provides something close to 30% of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in the recent budget the government appears to 
have committed itself to providing some $200 million in what it 
calls new funds toward youth justice. 
Let us remember, however, that in spite of months and months of 
promises we have not yet seen this government's new youth 
legislation and justice initiatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt that there will be additional costs 
involved.  There is little doubt the provinces will be required 
to commit additional funds toward the new legislation should it 
ever come into being.  I anticipate that the newly committed 
funds will in no way approach the federal government's original 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of this government to maintain the 50:50 split no 
doubt came into discussion when the Minister of Justice was 
negotiating with provincial justice ministers over co-operation 
toward new youth justice initiatives.  I have no doubt that the 
Minister of Justice was threatened with complete provincial 
withdrawal from the funding of youth justice because of the 
continuing shortfall of funding on behalf of her government.  She 
would certainly not want to have a recurrence of the Bill C-68 
situation land in her lap where some of the provinces have 
withdrawn from firearms control financing and have left it up to 
the federal government to operate. Our provinces can only be 
pushed and downloaded on so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of being pushed too far, I will take a moment to 
mention this government's actions with conditional sentencing and 
its impact on the provinces.  The federal government's bill 
became too high in the area of corrections.  So what did it do? 
It brought in conditional sentencing to permit criminal offenders 
to serve their time at home.  Now violent and even repeat 
offenders are able to escape from serving any time in our 
institutions.  This freed up beds and kept the costs from 
escalating for our corrections systems, but it did not 
necessarily reduce the costs to the provinces that have to 
continue to monitor, police and enforce the conditions placed on 
offenders serving their time at home.  Costs were downloaded to 
the provinces.  I would think the provinces would want to make 
sure the federal government does not burn them in the same way 
with its new youth justice strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been actively involved in youth justice issues for a 
number of years now.  I have participated in various youth 
diversion programs.  I have been actively involved with our 
crowns, our courts and our communities in my home province of 
British Columbia.  There are significant demands for additional 
funding to properly operate a successful youth justice program. 
Indeed, virtually all aspects of the youth justice program are 
presently short of appropriate funding to properly do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth diversion programs are by and large operating primarily on 
the good intentions of community volunteers.  While these folks 
are extremely dedicated to the young people in their communities 
and do wonderful work, often a few dollars will do much to soothe 
many of their frustrations.  It is difficult to have a young 
person repaint a neighbour's fence that has been covered by 
graffiti when there is not even enough money to buy the paint. It 
is difficult to arrange counselling sessions or group discussions 
when there is no money with which to rent a room. We cannot 
expect volunteers to continue to support programs from their own 
pockets indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the shortfalls in funding for programs for 
young people placed under secure custody.  They are often 
released back into the community with no education or treatment 
to modify their unacceptable and criminal actions.   If society 
continues to show little interest in helping these young 
offenders they will have little interest in helping themselves. 
It all comes back to proper funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics make it quite clear that young offenders often 
become adult offenders. If we spend effectively on our young 
offenders now, we will benefit in the long run because we should 
not have to investigate, charge, convict and sentence time and 
time again.  If we properly treat the non-violent first time 
offender we will for the most part avoid escalation into more 
serious criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister was recently quoted as complimenting 
Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta for their efforts in the use 
of community sentencing options instead of custody to sanction 
our troubled youth.  All provinces should be encouraged to follow 
and expand on the present successful programs.  To do so, 
however, additional funding will be necessary to set up and 
operate progressive options. How will the provinces be encouraged 
to do so unless the federal government makes significant moves 
toward fulfilling its end of the bargain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it has been said time and time again, it does little good for 
this government to talk the talk, it must walk the walk.  It must 
re-establish its 50% commitment to youth justice and it must 
ensure it never again lets itself fail in its responsibility to 
our future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for 
putting this motion before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is 
asking the government to increase the federal share of financial 
support for the provision of the Young Offenders Act with the 
eventual goal of dividing the cost on a 50:50 basis between the 
Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial 
governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think this is not a big thing to ask for.  If the 
federal government wants to keep an eye on what is happening it 
terms of crime prevention, health care or education across the 
country, it should expect to pay its fair share.  That is really 
what is being asked here. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also means that many problems are created by government 
policies and regulations—provincial or federal.  On the subject 
of crime prevention, many of the decisions taken are taken in 
such a way that it appears crime prevention was not the first 
thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more invested in crime prevention, the lower the crime rate. 
Our young people who live in poverty cannot afford a 
post-secondary education and parents cannot send their children 
to daycare. 
These are things that lower the country's crime rate.  We need 
governments that give priority to prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about prevention as well in the context of halfway 
houses for battered women.  Too many regions do not have such 
facilities for these women.  They do not have the opportunity to 
stay in a safe location so they may make good decisions for 
themselves and their children.  It is important to have such 
facilities, and that is what the majority of Canadians think. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that.  Often when youths commit crimes we 
want to throw them in jail and throw away the keys.  That is not 
the solution.  We have to look at the cause, why young offenders 
are in that situation.  We need resources available to prevent 
children from being in that situation.  Once they are we 
definitely need resources to help them out of those bad 
situations and put them in very good environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, with child poverty increasing on a daily basis, 
one goes with the other.  If I look at just my area, in one week 
there were three bank robberies in small communities of 200 in 
one and 2,000 in the other.  We have to look at that situation 
very seriously.  The increase in poverty is certainly a big 
factor in crime.  A woman in the Saint John area was badly beaten 
during a robbery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look behind why all these things are happening we can 
track it to the individual not having resources available.  I see 
it with teachers all the time who tell me that they do not have 
the resources to help the kids identified in our schools as 
needing help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with a friend who is a French teacher in 
Newfoundland.  They have been told that in order to get a 
psychologist in their school they would have to let a regular 
teacher go.  There are all kinds of situations in that school 
where children and their families need counselling.  We have to 
look at the causes.  When parents do not have a job or are the 
working poor it certainly does not help.  We did not see any new 
funding going toward that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is really nothing in the budget to help in this regard. 
If the federal government wants to have input with the 
provinces, it has to pay its half.  This applies to health care 
too.  The government found itself in a very difficult situation 
at one point.  It used to pay 50% of health care costs but this 
percentage has now dropped to 11%.  The figure might rise to 
12.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for the federal government to say to a 
province “I want you to provide these services in this way”, 
when it contributes only 5% or 6% of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a 13-year old son and a little girl who is three years 
old, but I have no idea what the future holds for Mathieu and 
Mélissa. I hope they will stay on the straight and narrow. That 
is all we can do, to hope, because our children have to make 
their own decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly good for them that their mother has a job, and 
it was great that I could work or be on employment insurance 
when I was off work, because there was food on their plates and 
a roof over their heads. I was perfectly capable of supporting 
them as a seasonal worker because, in those days, we could still 
get benefits between jobs. Without this income, I cannot imagine 
how those years would have unfolded. There was also education, 
including the post-secondary education I had access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that our young people today have access to 
education and that they do not end up $40,000 in debt after 
completing a four-year university degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is often the case, and we are not helping our young people 
with decisions that makes life harder and harder for them, when 
they have no job prospects at graduation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats believe that the government needs to invest in 
families by providing access to child care, support for parents 
and labour policies that encourage employers to respect family 
obligations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I was lucky. All the years I worked, I was with 
the public service, so I had benefits. If my son was sick, I was 
entitled to five days a year at least to look after him. I also 
had a drug plan, which also covered replacements for eyeglasses. 
That helps a lot. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must make a real commitment to provide 
funding to the provinces for more community policing and to 
increase support services for both the rehabilitation of youth 
and support for victims of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP fully supports the motion before the House and 
encourages the government to adopt it and take immediate action 
to address the chronic underfunding of our justice system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is important. We ought to support this motion 
because the future of our young people is at stake. They are the 
ones who will be running this country in the future. We must 
look after them today to ensure that they will be there in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Motion M-508 moved by my colleague, the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
increase the federal share of financial support for the 
provisions of the Young Offenders Act, with the eventual goal of 
dividing the costs on a 50/50 basis between the Government of 
Canada and the provincial and territorial governments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the debate on this motion is rather timely because it 
gives us an opportunity to refer to a item in the budget brought 
down with such fanfare by the Minister of Finance on Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this budget, which has already distinguished itself 
with its many new examples of federal interference in provincial 
health jurisdiction, earmarks $343 million over three years for 
crime prevention, as part of the reform the Minister of Justice 
is preparing to introduce, a reform which serves no purpose, in 
the opinion of justice stakeholders in Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will therefore not be surprised to learn that there is 
no agreement between the Government of Quebec and the federal 
Minister of Justice regarding the use of these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planned reform is repressive in nature and smacks of 
something the Reform Party would dream up. It will cost the 
provinces more, with the bill for Quebec alone forecast at $23 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that, since 1984, the federal government 
has owed Quebec in the neighbourhood of $77 million for 
enforcing the Young Offenders Act.  I will come back to these 
points a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the Young Offenders Act, I must first point out, as 
our friends opposite acknowledged, that Quebec is an example for 
the rest of Canada.  The present legislation effectively meets 
its objectives in Quebec. The proof is that we have the lowest 
rate of juvenile crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report here the remarks made in 1995 by the 
Minister of Justice in the previous parliament.  In his opinion, 
Quebec is an exception to the terms of application of the Young 
Offenders Act in that it focuses on the rehabilitation of young 
people outside the judicial system, an example the rest of 
Canada might follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the federal minister recognized Quebec's uniqueness 
in this regard.  Despite this recognition, legislative 
amendments aimed at increasing judicial interventions with young 
people are, unfortunately, still in fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While youth crime is decreasing more sharply in Quebec, I must 
also add that, although it continues to be a source of 
considerable concern, crime among young people is also on the 
decrease in the rest of Canada.  In 1997, the rate of youth 
crime decreased by 7%, confirming the trend we have seen since 
1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, rather than rush into a reform that will mean a more 
repressive approach to crime among the youth, the minister 
should review the entire question of financial compensation to 
the provinces for the application of the existing law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Young Offenders Act came into effect in 1984, 15 years 
ago already, the federal government was assuming 50% of the 
costs associated with implementing judicial and alternative 
measures. The federal government gradually withdrew, something 
which is becoming a habit. In 1996-97, its share of the funding 
was down to 36%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the federal government's withdrawal, its funding 
formula does not take into account the proportion of young 
Canadians who live in Quebec. While nearly 25% of Canada's young 
people between the ages of 12 and 17 live in Quebec, only 18.28% 
of the federal contribution in this respect goes to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has resulted in a $77.4 million shortfall for Quebec since 
1989. The former justice minister and current health minister 
had promised to restore the balance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the former minister nor the current one ever delivered 
on this promise. The last federal budget can certainly raise 
doubts about this government's commitment to paying off its 
debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is still waiting for a concrete proposal from the 
minister for making up this shortfall, and chances are that we 
are going to wait a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec is the province where the rehabilitation of 
young offenders is the most successful by far, and I might 
remind you that this success is achieved through less expensive 
and less cumbersome measures. What works in Quebec should work 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's Motion M-508 provides us with an opportunity to criticize 
the new approach of the federal government, which clearly seems 
to have forgotten that the youth justice system must reflect the 
fact that youth are still in the process of developing and 
maturing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts must focus on what led up to the offence.  The federal 
government's approach emphasizes the offence per se when, in our 
opinion, account must be taken of the youth's overall situation 
in terms of family, school and peers.  In my opinion, Quebec's 
approach will pay off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, Quebec is unable to support the federal 
government's present approach. First of all, it does not put 
youth crime and adjustment problems in proper perspective. 
Another reason we are unable to support it is because it writes 
off the worst troublemakers, instead of trying to reintegrate 
them into society.  We also reject it because it says that young 
people 14 and older—I heard my colleague mentioning her 13-year 
old son, who is only one year away from being 14—should receive 
adult sentences when they are involved in offences that, while 
they may be very serious, are not necessarily indicative of a 
high level of criminalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the unnecessary complexity of the legal 
procedure, which leaves the door wide open to preliminary 
sentencing by trial and jury.  For all these reasons, it is an 
approach unlikely to help our youth prepare for a productive 
life that will benefit our society, and Quebec is unable to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to thank my colleague, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, for having moved this motion.

wrong with more money for the police, for the courts, or for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just keep going back to the old ways of tax and spend. 
Surely justice is as high a priority as any other priority.  In 
fact it has to be very high on anybody's priority list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government took over, we inherited a $42 billion 
deficit and we have since turned it around to a surplus.  At the 
time we took over, all governments were spending in excess of 
100% of the gross domestic product.  Thankfully under the 
leadership of this Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, 
that situation has been reined in and we are now all living 
within our budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments have been brought to heel by fiscal 
realities and to varying degrees of success have recognized that. 
The most notable exception, I would say, is the fact that the 
Government of Ontario—which I would note in passing is a 
Progressive Conservative government, and how progressive is 
somewhat dubious at times—continues to finance its ways by 
increasing the debt.  These tax cuts that are priorities in 
excess of all other priorities are financed by debt.  At this 
point it has ratcheted up by a full $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of this motion is estimated to be something in the 
order of $100 million to $125 million.  It is open ended.  We can 
draw on it any time and once we start funding it, we cannot 
withdraw from the funding.  It is like the Eveready bunny; it 
keeps on going and going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as this funding starts, the government makes a statement 
that this is a priority in excess of all other priorities. For 
instance, it speaks of a desire on the part of the provincial and 
federal governments to create community based institutions rather 
than custodial based institutions.  That priority frankly would 
be defeated if this motion were to go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you, I and all the rest of us have had 
pretty well as much as we can take on CHST debates.  We get into 
cash, we get into tax points, we get into equalization and we are 
all numb. The numbers seem to go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a uniquely Canadian experience whereby those who receive 
money say absolutely nothing and those who do not receive money 
continue to bitch and whine into the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a certainty in any of these debates, it is that all 
governments want certainty in their financing.  With certainty 
they can plan and budget accordingly.  Both levels of government 
do not want open-ended commitments to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act speaks to charge, conviction and 
sentencing.  In my view, that is the wrong priority.  In my view, 
this is not the priority this government needs to signal at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the young offenders legislation are in accordance 
with the recommendations of the justice committee on which the 
hon. member sits. I would recommend that the hon. member speak to 
those recommendations rather than to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish-Guysborough will now have five minutes for his 
right of reply.  I should advise the House that when the member 
speaks, he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is truly a pleasure to speak in response to my 
learned friends.  I thank in particular the parliamentary 
secretary and the members for Scarborough East, Laval Centre, 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, and Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last statement made by my hon. friend opposite spoke of open 
endedness.  What is truly open ended is the justice minister's 
promise to table legislation.  It has been open ended and we have 
not seen it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an open-ended motion.  This is a motion that would 
suggest a 50:50 share.  That is equitable.  That is split down 
the middle.  There is nothing open ended about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My learned friend from Laval Centre spoke of Quebec's success in 
dealing with youth crime and youth crime initiatives.  I do 
commend her province for that.  The member indicated that it is 
an example that other places, mainly Canada, can learn from.  I 
agree with that.  I think we can learn a lot from the different 
provinces and the approaches they have taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the funding and commitment made by the federal 
government in its initial commitment to youth justice are not 
being held up.  The government is not holding up its end of the 
bargain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, there was a comment made by the parliamentary 
secretary with respect to the current funding and commitment from 
this government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was left with the impression that she was indicating that if 
the provincial government received more money from the federal 
government, somehow this would result in higher incarceration 
rates.  That is absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so absurd about it is that at the same time the 
parliamentary secretary speaks of youth justice initiatives such 
things as restorative justice and alternative dispute resolution 
need to be funded.  More funding does not simply mean more 
incarceration.  The provinces have to exercise that discretion, 
but that was the impression left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the federal government simply holding up 
its end of the bargain.  One would expect that the government 
would at least feel a twinge of moral obligation to increase its 
share of the young offender programs.  Morality and the Liberal 
government seem to be mutually exclusive on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying issue in Motion No. 508 as with any policy area 
affecting federal-provincial relations is the Liberal view of 
government.  Federal Liberals profess to have an unparalleled 
understanding of what is best for the country as a whole.  They 
have a very sanctimonious and arrogant view of what is best for 
the country and how best to spend the country's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to taxpayers money no one can tell anybody the 
Liberal government has a great track record.  As we witnessed in 
the social union negotiations, the federal Liberals painted the 
provinces as somehow the enemy of health care and social 
spending.  We have seen successive budgets.  We have seen the 
education budget.  We have seen the health care budget.  One 
would hope that someday we might see a justice budget coming from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences, child pornography inaction, gutting the 
organized crime budget of the RCMP and the doomed false hope 
Firearms Act are all questionable Liberal priority performances 
on justice issues.  Such sweeping generalizations from the 
government toward the provinces, characterizing them as such, is 
very irresponsible.  Provincial and territorial governments are 
not the inherent enemies of co-ordinated national policy efforts. 
They want all levels of government to work their best and in this 
case work their best to address the problems in our youth justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our federation the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments must work together as partners, not competitors.  The 
provinces want to be included in the decisions.  They want the 
federal government to simply hold up and pay in its amount.  They 
want the federal government to honour its commitments.  Above 
all, they would like just a little respect from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 508 allows the Liberals to reverse the reputation 
they have earned over the years in federal-provincial relations. 
It allows them to tangibly demonstrate they are committed not 
just to changing youth crime legislation but to ensuring the law 
will be adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the outset, laws are only as effective as the 
ability to enforce them.  The Minister of Justice and the Liberal 
government can acquire much needed credibility in renewing their 
efforts and their commitment to the youth justice system by 
increasing the federal share of the young offenders program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my final word on the matter in a final desperate 
attempt to bring the matter forward, I would ask that there be 
unanimous consent given to make this matter a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

adjourned until Monday, March 1, 1999, at 11 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Orders 24(1) and 28(2).
