</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK2"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the question 
of privilege raised by the hon. member for Okanagan—Coquihalla 
on October 21, 1999 concerning delays in the release of 
information under the Access to Information Act caused by staff 
of the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before beginning, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
raising the matter.  I also want to acknowledge the contribution 
of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford, as well as the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Okanagan—Coquihalla has argued that his 
privileges, as well as those of other member,s were breached by 
the actions of two employees of the Minister of National Defence, 
namely Mr. Aldege Bellefeuille and Mr. David Robinson, who 
delayed the release of information thereby obstructing him in the 
performance of his parliamentary work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to assert that the delays in question 
constitute a contempt of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contempt as described by Joseph Maingot in his book 
<I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> is “an offence against the 
authority or dignity of the House”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 22nd edition of Erskine May states that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt 
even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Okanagan—Coquihalla did not state clearly in his 
presentation on this question of privilege nor in the 
supplemental material submitted to the Chair that he personally 
had been obstructed.  The facts, as I have them, indicate that 
the member for Okanagan—Coquihalla had placed requests with the 
Department of National Defence to obtain information under the 
Access to Information Act and received the answers to his 
questions after what he stated was an intentional and deliberate 
delay initiated by Messieurs Bellefeuille and Robinson. Following 
this series of events, the member then proceeded to inform the 
Information Commissioner of his criticisms of the process.  The 
Information Commissioner in his report found the instructions 
issued by these individuals to constitute improper interference 
with the lawful processing of access requests. As a result of the 
members complaint and the commissioner's report, the Department 
of National Defence was informed of the misconduct and acted to 
remedy the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the actions of Messieurs Bellefeuille and Robinson may 
have been deemed improper under the terms of the Access to 
Information Act, this is not a matter that the Speaker can judge. 
As Speaker Fraser eloquently stated in his ruling on January 28, 
1988: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that it is not the duty of the Speaker 
to judge the actions of public officials in the fulfilment of 
their duties.  It is my duty only to determine whether or not 
sufficient evidence has been presented to judge if there has been 
a prima facie breach of privilege or contempt of the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that these public servants were not properly fulfilling 
their duties is not de facto in itself grounds for a charge of 
contempt. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technically, obstructing members in the discharge of their 
responsibilities to the House or in their participation in its 
proceedings is considered to be a contempt of the House. 
However, as Joseph Maingot writes, in his book <I>Parliamentary 
Privilege in Canada</I>, on page 82: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the member must be exercising his functions as a member in a 
committee or in the House in the transaction of parliamentary 
business.  Whatever he says or does in those circumstances is 
said or done during a “proceeding in Parliament”; in other 
words, while the member is functioning as a member, not in his 
constituency, but while actually participating in parliamentary 
business and saying or doing something necessarily incidental to 
parliamentary business. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in order for a member to claim that his privileges have 
been breached or that a contempt has occurred, he or she must 
have been actually participating in a proceeding of parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Maingot reiterates this point on page 86 of his book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Member is doing something inherently connected with a 
“proceeding in Parliament” when putting down a question on the 
Order Paper, a notice of motion, a notice of motion for the 
production of papers, or a report stage amendment; when obtaining 
assistance to do any of these; or when obtaining assistance to 
draft a bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fulfil their parliamentary duties, members should of 
course have access to the information they require. The Chair is 
mindful of the multiple responsibilities, duties and activities 
of all members and of the importance they play in the work of 
every member of parliament.  However, the gathering of 
information by an elected representative through means other 
than those available exclusively to members does not, in and by 
itself, necessarily constitute “a proceeding of parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the 22nd edition of Erskine May on page 121: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correspondence with constituents or official bodies, for example, 
and the provision of information, sought by Members on matters of 
public concern will very often, depending on the circumstances of 
the case, fall outside the scope of `proceedings in Parliament' 
against which a claim of privilege will be measured. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me stress to all members of the House that any matter 
concerning the privileges of members, particularly any matter 
which may constitute a contempt of the House, is always taken 
seriously.  At this time, however, based on the facts presented 
on this matter, the Chair cannot determine that the member has 
been obstructed in the performance of his parliamentary duties. 
I am therefore bound by practice to conclude that there are not 
sufficient grounds to find a prima facie case nor to proceed 
further at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Okanagan—Coquihalla for bringing 
this matter to the attention of the House.

are for the government, but he would be required to report

sold in Canada are sold in bottles upon which a deposit would be 
chargeable.  It may be that the amount of the deposit would 
differ from some of the existing programs, such as those found in 
the breweries of Canada, but the principle is very important to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CIVIL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK29">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-4, an act to implement the agreement among the 
Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the 
European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of 
the Russian Federation, and the Government of the United States 
of America concerning co-operation on the civil international 
space station and to make related amendments to other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely 
delighted to finally be able to speak to Bill C-4, the civil 
international space station agreement implementation act.  This 
bill will allow Canada to fulfil its obligations under the 
agreement concerning co-operation on the civil space station. 
Bill C-4 legally formalizes Canada's partnership in the space 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada will 
work co-operatively with the government to ensure speedy passage 
of the bill.  Why would we not?  It is the culmination of a 
process that was started by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 
President Ronald Reagan at their infamous shamrock summit.  I am 
sure I do not have to remind the House that it was that 
conference which saw Canada-U.S. relations begin to thaw after 
the acrimonious Yankee baiting Trudeau years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was due to this new co-operative relationship that the 
Progressive Conservative government was able to successfully 
negotiate the free trade agreement, an agreement that has 
provided the present finance minister with balanced budgets and a 
fast track to the leadership of his own party.  I am sure he 
joins me in congratulating the foresight of the previous 
government, just as my party congratulates his government for 
continuing this positive relationship with Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues I want to touch on regarding the 
initiative to have a permanently inhabited space station, but for 
just a moment I would like to pay tribute to the powers of the 
dreamers.  One man had a dream, a dream that many different 
friends and allies could design, construct and permanently 
inhabit a space station, a station whose sole purpose would be 
for peace and scientific study.  What is even more remarkable is 
that this vision arose in the midst of a cold war, a time when 
new space initiatives were routinely judged by their strategic 
benefits, not necessarily by their humanitarian and scientific 
attributes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill honours the dream of former President Ronald Reagan, 
as well as the vision of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney and other 
world leaders who quickly coalesced behind the initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to have my words misconstrued by detractors in our 
ranks.  Certainly my party is not advocating carte blanche 
spending on any and all flights of fancy.  Quite the opposite, 
since my party created the Canadian Space Agency in 1989, frugal 
spending with an eye to the return on investment has been the 
hallmark of this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it is the return on investment that I want to deal 
with.  Over a 20 year period the government is telling us that 
Canada's total investment will be $1.4 billion, with 90% of that 
investment going to Canadian industry.  Projected returns on 
investment are three to four times that amount, or at least $5 
billion.  Thus, from a business perspective, this investment 
makes good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Canada involved?  Is it because we are good friends and 
neighbours with the Americans?  Of course not.  If that were not 
the case we could certainly expect to be excluded.  The point 
here is that Canada has been invited to take part because of our 
own scientific merits.  Our contribution to the space station 
includes the design, construction and operation of the mobile 
servicing system, plus responsibilities for the operation and use 
of the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This high tech repair system will feature an agile robotic arm 
with a sleeve bearing the Canada wordmark.  This remote 
manipulator will be monitored on the ground by the Canadian Space 
Agency headquartered in St-Hubert, Quebec.  Clearly, Canada has 
made a name for itself in arming spacecrafts for peaceful 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadarm has become a cliched reference to our contribution 
to space study.  I have no desire to belittle that important 
innovation which put us at the table with other world class space 
studying nations, but the reality is that we have moved 
exponentially beyond those days in both our research and 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our capabilities in space robotics are renowned around the 
globe.  In fact, it would not be arrogant bluster to state that 
this project simply could not go ahead without Canada's 
involvement.  Our investment provides us with one laboratory 
shelf per year for science and technological experiments.  This 
will allow us to further our research in the microgravity field 
which has already produced medical benefits for us in several 
areas, including the treatment of osteoporosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1987 the Canadian Space Agency has allocated over 150 
contracts to Canadian firms and universities for automation and 
robotics technology developed projects, resulting in the 
development of several new technologies which have already been 
alluded to by my colleagues in the House.  In many ways this is 
remarkable considering the shrinking budget that the CSA has had 
to endure over the last several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal government was elected in 1993 it has cut the 
budget to the CSA by 7% thus far.  In the 1999 budget the 
Liberals bragged that they were giving new money to the Canadian 
Space Agency, but in reality the government was cutting the 
budget by 21% from when it was first elected.  We all realize 
that hard decisions have to be made so that we live within our 
means.  However, when a sector of the economy provides so much 
spinoff and keeps racking up success after success, I really 
think we should re-evaluate our goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project goes beyond technological and scientific 
advancement.  As we are all aware, it was due to the hard work 
and lobbying efforts of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that Canada 
gained entry, along with Italy, into what was the G-5. Membership 
in the G-7 guaranteed that no longer would Canada be relegated to 
afterthought status when it came to important international 
initiatives.  At that point we graduated to the big leagues. 
Bill C-4 continues that status for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the United States, the space station's other partners 
include Russia, Japan, Brazil and 11 other European countries. 
It is interesting to note that whenever this agreement is 
referred to in terms of its partners, it almost always lumps the 
11 European countries together as one, while leaving Canada as a 
stand-alone. 
Even the NASA website does this.  The message from the rest of 
the world is clear.  We have assumed the natural leadership 
mantle that the 20th century promised us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party's support for this bill is both resolute and strong. 
However, I would be remiss if I failed to mention our 
disappointment with the way the Liberals have dragged their heels 
in getting this bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partners in the international space station signed the 
original agreement in January 1998.  This agreement provides a 
legal framework for the operation of the space station, including 
provisions for each inhabitant of the station to be subject to 
the laws of their own nation, a very important sovereignty issue 
for all the participants.  The question though is why the delay? 
The bill seems simple enough yet it had not been called for 
second reading before the House prorogued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now the beginning of November.  This agreement has sat 
around for 21 months.  What is the Prime Minister afraid of?  In 
all fairness, I do not see any reason to be suspicious, but it is 
easy to see how waiting until the last minute when this bill must 
receive royal assent by mid-December can raise questions.  These 
questions are entirely unnecessary when a government respects the 
role that parliament and the parliamentary committees have to 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will not delay the bill any further. Let us 
move this bill along and give Canada's best scientific minds one 
more reason to stay and work in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-4, the civil international space 
station agreement implementation act.  I should say at the outset 
that the NDP supports this legislation. Let me give a little 
background on the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998 Canada, Japan, Russia, the U.S. and 11 European 
countries signed the civil international space station agreement. 
Bill C-4 provides the legislation needed for Canada to meet its 
commitments for ratification by all signatories before January 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifespan of the station we are told is 10 years, from 2005 
to 2014, and it will house seven astronauts.  The purpose of the 
station is to do research in the areas of biotechnology, 
engineering, Earth observation and telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's contribution to the international space station is the 
next generation of the Canadarm, the space station robotic 
manipulator system.  This system plays a crucial role in 
assembling and maintaining the international space station while 
in orbit.  It will be used to move equipment in space, help 
astronauts during space walks and it will manipulate the various 
instruments and experiments docked on the ISS.  We are all very 
proud of this Canadian invention and the role it has played thus 
far in the whole area of space development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What rewards are there for Canada?  The cost of Canada's 
participation over a 20 year period is approximately $1.4 
billion. Ninety percent of that investment is being spent in 
Canadian industry and universities.  Indeed we know the 
importance of our universities to our society and to our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1987 the Canadian Space Agency has allocated 150 contracts 
for robotics development technology to firms and universities 
from British Columbia right through to Newfoundland.  Already the 
technology is being used in such diverse areas as prosthetics, 
the deployment of airbags in vehicles, and in a digital imaging 
system for medical radiology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firms have landed international contracts based on the expertise 
they have acquired through their work with the Canadian Space 
Agency or by supplying equipment and expertise to some of the 
other signatory countries to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our participation in the international space station we 
received one rack, or what is known as a laboratory shelf, per 
year for science and technological experiments.  These shelves 
will allow Canada to expand its research in the microgravity 
field which will aid research carried out here in areas such as 
osteoporosis.  It is very important to have this kind of research 
in our society. Certainly the benefits of this technology will be 
great for our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noticed that the bill talks about establishing an 
international space station for peaceful purposes. 
I want to take a moment to comment on that.  I certainly support 
the concept of a space station, but I find it somewhat disturbing 
that we can spend lots of money and move forward with great 
urgency and a certain sense of determination on things that are 
outside of this Earth, the space element.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be good if we could put as much energy into finding 
peace here on Earth and working toward establishing peace within 
the many troubled countries throughout the world. If countries 
across the world would put the same effort that is being put into 
the development of the space agency into establishing peaceful 
negotiations and peaceful relationships between countries, the 
world would certainly be a much better place. If ultimately we 
have an elaborate space station in outer space but we are killing 
each other off here on Earth, what good does it do us in the long 
run? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station will house seven astronauts. The term house 
draws to my attention that here on Earth on the streets within 
our communities many people are homeless, yet we are providing 
very elaborate and costly facilities to advance the cause of 
science and business industries.  I am not saying it should not 
be done; I am saying that we should devote as much attention to 
looking after the kinds of concerns that we see as we walk out of 
our doors and down our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many people living in constituencies right across the 
country have more concern about putting bread on their tables and 
about providing the homeless with shelter than they do with 
proceeding with space development.  That is not to say it should 
not be done and I emphasize that.  People will probably want to 
say I am putting down that effort.  I am not putting down that 
effort. What I am saying is let us bring other efforts up to that 
same level of advancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this project emphasizes industrial development and 
economic development.  It is very important that we as a nation 
move forward in those areas.  But again I would say that we must 
also move forward in the area of social development and meet the 
social concerns that face many of us. It would certainly be good 
to see the kind of money that is being put into space development 
being put into many of the problems that confront our young 
people and the citizens of this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those remarks and that footnote about balancing the kinds 
of priorities we deal with, I would say that I am pleased to 
support this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the NDP member's speech with some interest.  He touched on a 
very important subject and that is to what extent we support 
investing in these high tech projects that take a lot of money 
from the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recognized that when we engage in these projects, 
none of the money really goes up there.  It involves supporting 
our people and businesses that develop the space stations and 
that do the work there. The money actually stays on planet Earth. 
Most of it that is spent in Canada stays in Canada.  It is spent 
here by the people who have earned it, thereby providing jobs for 
a lot of people. If these people did not have that employment in 
the high tech area, then obviously they would leave Canada to go 
to the United States or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked up from the member's speech that he generally supports 
the government's involvement in the international space agency 
projects.  I would like him to respond to the issue of its 
funding. By providing jobs and greater economic activity in 
Canada as a result of it, in fact that does almost directly but 
certainly indirectly help our economy.  It helps all of the 
people in this country, many of whom are struggling economically. 
It would increase the proportion of jobs that are available to 
them as they demand services and products that are put together 
by Canadians.  I would like the member to respond to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member has 
indicated, projects of this nature keep money within our 
communities and they do generate economic activity.  I believe I 
did cover that point in my comments by mentioning that for this 
very reason we support the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at priorities in terms of our communities. 
We have to use the same kind of energy and enthusiasm to tackle 
some of the problems which are very evident in our society such 
as the homeless, the lack of opportunities for some of our young 
people and the concerns they have around education and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not disagreeing with the member's comments.  They are well 
taken.  We did touch upon that and we do agree with that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always very interesting to read, learn and 
discover how people in our country are participating in the 
leading edge technology in this way.  Without technology I 
suppose we might argue that perhaps we would not even be in caves 
and tents because even that is some technological advancement. 
However, at a time when we are looking at the enormous burden of 
taxation on our people, the costs and the prioritizing of the 
moneys that are raised is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member about another aspect of 
this. He mentioned the peaceful programs. Humankind has had 
difficulties in reserving the technological advances for strictly 
peaceful purposes.  We have seen space surrounding Earth explored 
for more than peaceful purposes.  I would like to have the 
member's comments on the peaceful purposes of the project. Is 
there any danger of it going beyond that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would have concerns about the possibility that a space 
station could lead to another space station and that some rivalry 
could take place in space.  Many of us have watched <I>Star 
Trek</I> and <I>Star Wars</I>.  We would certainly hope that this 
kind of development does not reach the point where we are not 
only carrying on wars here on Earth but we are carrying on wars 
in space or using the technology that has been learned through 
these programs to further devastate ourselves on Earth. We have 
to be vigilant about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason I commented that it would be nice if we 
could put energy into finding peaceful solutions here on Earth. 
If we find peaceful solutions among the countries here on Earth, 
then whatever we develop beyond should be guided by the same 
principles.  If we have wars going on here among countries and we 
cannot come to some solution on those issues, then the member is 
quite right in being concerned that perhaps the development of 
more technology might lead to further disaster.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to speak to Bill C-4, the civil international space 
station agreement implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked with the people responsible for the development of the 
Canadian aspects and the participation internationally on the 
space station.  I was impressed by the technological advances 
which Canada is making and the contribution we are making toward 
this space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of questions more than concerns.  We certainly 
support the bill.  I have questions in the areas of the brain 
drain and our young people going south, and where the technology 
is headed and where it is coming from.  I have questions on the 
aspects of training our young people to participate in such a 
project, the distribution of the manpower and technology 
throughout the country.  When talking to people at the space 
agency a lot of the focus and the development and participation 
is in Quebec and some other parts of eastern and central Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having resided in the west for many years, I once again ask out 
of the billion and so dollars that are being spent on this matter 
what is in it for the west and for the young people who reside in 
Vancouver, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina and all those other 
places.  How do they fit into the plans for this sort of thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are spending billions, basically, over the next 20 years, 
do we not have an obligation as a central government to have 
young people participate in this project from across the land and 
not just focus in on one part of the country?  It seems to me 
that time and time again we stand in the House and ask why the 
west is being ignored while other parts of the country are indeed 
benefiting from major programs funded by the central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic that I stand in the House today on a bill with 
which we basically agree.  I also want to talk about what went on 
in the House yesterday with time allocation.  We were expected to 
talk about the Nisga'a agreement which involves as much money or 
maybe even more money than the space station itself.  We have a 
diametrically opposite point of view from that of the government 
and have made clear that there are significant flaws in that 
legislation.  We have said time and time again that 
constitutionality was involved in it.  There was taxation without 
representation and all those sorts of things.  Why was time 
allocation used on the official opposition after four hours and 
12 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government brings in a bill for a little over a billion 
dollars that we essentially all agree on.  We are all happy 
again.  The government is expecting us to roll through the bill 
really fast because it agrees with it and thinks we agree with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the question on whether or not my colleagues and I 
should be sitting in the House allowing these bills to go 
through.  On a large bill like the Nisga'a bill the government 
does everything to interfere in the process of proper debate.  It 
brought in time allocation on the Nisga'a agreement.  We did not 
even have the opportunity for the committee to travel to British 
Columbia because it did not want to travel there.  The bill was 
delayed by a day.  We forced its deferral because we wanted to 
force the government to travel to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I am having a difficult time, as are my colleagues, 
understanding why Bill C-4 on the space agency can come to the 
House and be zipped through when the government called time 
allocation rather than debate something like the Nisga'a 
legislation.  The government is happy when we stand in the House 
to debate the space agency, with which I agree.  It is willing to 
sit around all day and listen to how much I agree with this 
legislation, but when I stand to disagree with the Nisga'a bill 
it calls time allocation because it does not want to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore have a bit of news for the government.  I am sick 
and tired of time allocation and closure on bills.  I formally 
tell the government today that if there is one more time 
allocation or even a mention of closure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Are you going to resign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  No, I am not going to resign.  I am glad 
the member said that because it makes me a bit more angry.  If I 
hear even a whisper of it again on the Nisga'a bill, the House 
will come to a screeching halt.  If the government thinks I am 
kidding, it should just try me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the height of arrogance to table this space agency bill 
after the Nisga'a bill and expect us to stand here and pretend we 
will all be happy.  We will listen to how nice the bill is and 
what a sweetheart deal we have when in fact we have been slapped 
in the face and told the government does not want to hear about 
our opposition to Nisga'a.  I think it has another thought 
coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could hold on to this bill, which I just might yet, and debate 
it for a couple of days.  We will talk about Nisga'a while I am 
doing it and a bit about a few other things.  Yes, I may be 
called me on relevance once in a while.  Yes, I may call quorum 
more than once and play all those silly games.  As of yesterday 
and the Nisga'a debate in the House, 23 of my colleagues were 
sitting here who did not have the opportunity to speak to the 
Nisga'a bill, many of whom are from British Columbia.  That is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we stand in the House to talk about the space agency bill, 
something we all agree with, and we have two Liberals in the 
House talking to each other over there and not even listening. As 
long as we occupy the time of the House of Commons the government 
is okay with that, as long as we agree, but when we do not agree 
as with the Nisga'a legislation it is unforgivable.  We have to 
rush it through the House, do we not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that there is only a couple of them over there and they 
are not listening, we should wake them up a little.  I could call 
quorum but I do not think I will because there are committees in 
place.  We will have to discuss this bill for a while and see 
where it goes.  At the same time we will make reference and 
comparison throughout to the disgusting process which took place 
on the Nisga'a legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taxation without representation in the Nisga'a 
legislation.  We have constitutional concerns and all kinds of 
issues yet to discuss on that bill, but we cannot get our hands 
on it because it was rushed through the House on time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet I see on the space agency bill that a little over $1 billion 
will be spent.  That is fine.  We will just sit here, talk about 
that, smile and all be happy.  That is just plain unacceptable to 
me.  As House leader I will be talking to my colleagues tomorrow 
in our caucus.  I will make the points that we are sick and tired 
of time allocation closure on bills, that we will not put up with 
it any longer, and that we might just talk about all these bills 
a little longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one comment about the space agency bill which the 
government has not really considered.  I well understand that 
another head office like that of Air Canada and all the other 
head offices will end up in Quebec.  When will the government see 
fit to put one in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Edmonton or Calgary one of 
these day?  We do have a little technology out there, believe it 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at some of the good companies in Vancouver, I am sure 
they could match the technology.  Why is it that we get a $1.6 
billion space agency program, which is an excellent program, and 
it happens to sit in Quebec?  Why is that?  Time after time that 
happens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the value of the space agency to the country, I do 
not think there is any question about the technology and the 
possibility that our young people will get jobs and that sort of 
thing.  However, once in a while the government should give us 
the opportunity to have just a wee bit in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the comparison.  If the space agency project 
is to be a good project, it is not just international and our 
participation in space and technology. It is more than that to 
me.  It is young people who should be training now for 10 years 
from now, those who will be working on this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the universities fitting in?  Has the government seen fit to 
bother to try to help with programs at post-secondary 
institutions for students to get jobs in this regard, or will we 
be importing jobs applicants from other countries? Should we 
expand the operation?  Should we put satellite companies in other 
parts of the country?  Should we ask our technicians, our young 
people, for participation and for ideas on the agency?  How do we 
promote the space agency even more than it is being promoted 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government has thought a lot about these 
things.  It just looks at it and says that it has another project 
in Quebec and it will make it work.  I think there is a future 
for our young people to be involved and it should be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the space agency bill is to pass the House, with which we all 
agree, I repeat once again that it is time the government 
understood that it cannot keep bringing bills like this one into 
the House expecting our agreement when bills with which we 
adamantly disagree are rammed through the House on time 
allocation.  I have no intention whatsoever any longer of living 
with the government's agenda, its timeframe.  If we disagree with 
or even if we agree with legislation it is highly likely that we 
will talk about it for a while, as in the case of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into issues like that of the space agency, I hope 
the House understands that all those involved should be prepared 
for questions and for longer debates.  If members on the other 
side do not have the courtesy to do that with an important bill 
which involves billions of dollars and affects the Nisga'a 
constitution, I think we will have to insist that they do it on 
all bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up.  We may yet move an amendment through one of our 
members to extend the debate, putting emphasis on the Nisga'a 
agreement which my colleagues have not yet had the opportunity to 
fully discuss.  We may have discussions about relevance in the 
House.  I am prepared for that and I am prepared for a long 
debate in that regard, but it is time we gave notice to the House 
that we will discuss what the official opposition wants to 
discuss.  I do not give two rats about the government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will agree with Bill C-4. 
We will discuss further Bill C-4.  I will bet that between now 
and Christmas we will be discussing the Nisga'a agreement for 
many more hours rather than the four hours and twelve minutes we 
were given up to yesterday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
really enjoyed the hon. member's speech and his notations about 
the freedom to speak on something that we can all read from the 
government press releases and not to concern ourselves with the 
real issues that matter in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a few notes from the office of the leader of the 
official opposition of British Columbia regarding the democratic 
process that the member alluded to.  He says “I am writing to 
note my extreme dismay over your government's motion to invoke 
closure on the Nisga'a treaty debate today.”  What is important 
is what he says next.  He says “This motion is an unacceptable 
slight to British Columbia and to all Canadians who deserve a 
full and open debate on this landmark treaty”.  This is in 
contrast with the free and open debate on Bill C-4 which everyone 
is in agreement with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say “On a matter of this critical importance to 
our province, our country and our constitution, every member of 
parliament deserves an opportunity to speak”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on what the B.C. premier had 
to say as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford takes the floor to respond to the 
question as presented by the member for Prince Albert, if we are 
going to stretch the rules of the House as far as relevance is 
concerned, it is going to take ingenuity on the part of the 
members doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is not going to control the debate.  In absence of 
protests opposite, it is not the Chair's intention to try and 
stifle debate.  However, if the opposition is going to use the 
rules of the House, then it must be done in the spirit of the 
rules of the House.  It is going to demand ingenuity so that 
members who wish to bring other issues to the table do so in a 
way that will not command the Chair to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, ingenuity we have and 
ingenuity we will use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that my colleague comments on the letter the 
premier has received in British Columbia.  The leader of the 
official opposition in British Columbia, Gordon Campbell, has 
somehow expressed the frustration we feel in the House.  We come 
here and talk about Bill C-4 and a space station.  It is fine to 
talk about the bill in the House.  We basically all agree with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would sit here for four days and talk about this 
and occupy what is not even much of an agenda.   The moment there 
is something contentious that comes to the House, after four and 
a half hours on something like the Nisga'a agreement, they call 
time allocation.  Go figure.  What is wrong with these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Don't look at me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Do not look at him, he says.  Well you 
put up your hand when you voted.  Talk about stupid, some of 
these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Please address each 
other, particularly when the occasion is a little heated, through 
the Chair.  We will refer to each other as hon. members or as 
persons representing a particular constituency and we do so 
through the Chair.

particular person stupid here.  The difficulty the opposition 
parties should have, the NDP included and the other fellows, we 
should all have the same problem in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a bill comes in that we basically agree on, like Bill C-4, it 
is okay.  The Liberals will have us discussing the thing for 
three or four days.  They would be happy with only two or three 
people in the House of Commons reading the newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In reference to 
other members presence or absence in the House, that will also 
require ingenuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, instead of me arguing with 
you, I did not say there were two or three people in the House of 
Commons.  I said that they would be happy with only two or three 
people in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is okay to come in here and talk about Bill C-4, the space 
station, for three or four days.  However, what opposition 
parties should be concerned about is that the moment we disagree 
with one of their bills, the Liberals call time allocation.  They 
call closure after four hours of debate.  While we are the only 
party fighting Nisga'a in the House, the next time it may be one 
other party or two other parties that disagree and they will do 
it again.  That is plainly unacceptable. We will take this any 
longer.  Myself, as House leader, and our whip, my colleague from 
Fraser Valley, have made up our mind that is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  That's two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Yes, that is two, but those are the two 
the hon. member should worry about.  The Liberals may want to 
travel.  Maybe we will not like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the leader of the Reform Party was pleased and very 
enthusiastic with respect to the space bill.  We appreciate his 
support and the support of the Reform House leader.  I know what 
the hon. member is driving at and everybody appreciates it, but 
if at the same time he could just zero in a little bit on the 
space bill and bring some relevance into it that would really add 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask all hon. 
members to be relevant and to keep in mind that we are discussing 
Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this is not relevant 
then we are in the wrong place.  This is more than relevant.  The 
hon. member does not seem to understand that I have said time and 
time again in this particular speech that we agree with Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not agree with is just exactly what is going on with 
the so-called democracy in this place.  It is okay if I stand 
here and agree with Bill C-4.  It is okay if I agree with the 
space station.  It is okay as long as we agree with the Liberal 
Party.  If any member on this side disagrees with the Liberal 
Party, we get time allocation and closure. That is what is wrong 
and that is what is relevant with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time bills like this, that we agree on, that we talk 
a long time on and everything else that comes into the House.  If 
the member thinks that is not relevant, he should just try us. It 
is more than relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a really bad habit as a majority government. 
We can count, as I already have, the number of bills it has 
called closure on after a number of hours.  It is coming up, in 
almost half the time, to surpassing Mr. Mulroney in the number of 
times he called closure or time allocation.  However, that is 
okay with the Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a sweet space station everybody agrees with, so the guys 
can talk here for a week if they want.  However, when we disagree 
or if my colleague's party, the NDP, disagree with a bill, just 
watch how long it takes the Liberals to call time allocation or 
closure.  It is okay if a member wants to stand up for the space 
station because everyone agrees with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  No, we oppose it now.  If there is no 
money for farmers, there is no money for space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  That is not a bad position.  If there is 
no money for farmers then there is no money for space.  How long 
have we been asking for money in the House for farmers?  We have 
been saying that the Nisga'a agreement is costing an enormous 
amount of money.  The Liberals do not want to talk about that 
because they called time allocation on that.  This is only $1.6 
billion or $1.3 billion on a space station.  The Liberals lose 
count after the billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have my message.  It is very clear.  We will be 
talking about these bills as long as we darn well feel like it. 
We will be talking about travel from now on.  We are not under 
any circumstances going to entertain these time 
allocation-closure bills henceforth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by saying that I too am wondering about the 
relevance of the remarks made by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  I find him incapable of ingenuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker suggested that he would have to be ingenious to be 
relevant.  His remarks had to do with the Nisga'a agreement, the 
implementing legislation being debated today.  I should say “his 
many remarks” because he spoke almost exclusively about this 
native treaty and not about the Civil International Space 
Station Agreement Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, ingenuity was possible. 
For instance, it could have been suggested that the Nisga'a 
treaty should have been debated in the House before it was 
signed, or before it was ratified by the Government of Canada or 
the Government of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a parallel to be drawn here between domestic treaties, 
those having to do with aboriginal matters, those described by 
the Supreme Court of Canada as <I>sui generis</I>, and international 
treaties, because the process for each is, in many regards, 
similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties are debated, discussed, negotiated by governments. 
However, to apply in domestic law, they also require 
implementing legislation, and sometimes legislation from both a 
provincial legislative assembly and the federal parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that this is not something a person can do unless he 
is really ingenious: when he does not want to really address a 
bill such as this one, when he wants to waste the precious time 
of the House on a debate that ought to be kept for the 
appropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak of this implementing legislation, indicating 
what lessons can be learned from it and the path it followed in 
order to get before this House, after the negotiations that led 
to the Civil International Space Station Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signature and implementation of treaties is an important 
issue.  It is one that involves us all, because treaties are 
playing an increasingly important role in international life. 
Their numbers are multiplying.  Hundreds of treaties are entered 
into yearly, and ratified by Canada and other countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This often requires parliaments to pass legislation to implement 
these treaties and to give them effect in Canadian internal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of this House and those who are listening to us, 
I would like to say a few words about the process, particularly 
since I just recently introduced Bill C-214. This bill is aimed 
at getting parliament more involved in the process of concluding 
treaties, at democratizing in a way the process whereby treaties 
are accepted by the state and subsequently lead to the passage 
of legislation in order to implement the international 
obligations negotiated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore give hon. members a short course in 
international law.  I am pleased that my colleague from 
Vancouver Quadra, who is also a professor of international law, 
is with us and will no doubt be able to add to my modest 
contribution.  He will, no doubt, wish to share with us his 
thoughts on these proposals for increasing parliament's 
involvement in the treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind hon. members that an international 
treaty is something that has first been negotiated. 
As a general rule, negotiations are conducted by governments 
represented by officials—in this case, officials from the 
Department of Foreign Affairs—or by diplomats, the ambassadors. 
When very important treaties are involved, ministers of the 
government are also involved, and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs in particular, since, under the Department of Foreign 
Affairs Act, it is he who is generally responsible for 
concluding international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties are negotiated with other countries usually. 
Negotiations may take place with international organizations. 
Often, these organizations provide the forum for such 
negotiations. 
There is the negotiation, for example, of treaties in the 
context of the United Nations, which often acts as a forum for 
conferences, where debates are held on the treaties and lead to 
their passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough, however, to negotiate a treaty, because 
treaties, depending on the constitutional law of the country, 
sometimes require action by parliament to permit their 
acceptance by the country, so that the country can agree to be 
bound by the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where practices differ significantly from one country to 
the next. 
For some countries, like Canada and most countries with a 
British style parliamentary system, treaties are concluded, and 
the countries agree to be bound by the provisions in them, such 
as in the one creating the international space station, without 
parliament's involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, a government can conclude a treaty and sign it 
after it has been adopted.  It can even ratify it without 
parliament's prior approval or agreement that the country will 
be bound under the international treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countries, however, that involve their parliament and 
can neither sign nor ratify—in most cases it is ratificationt— 
without the prior approval of parliament and the holding of a 
debate to give parliamentarians an opportunity to consider the 
text of the treaty and its provisions before the government 
commits internationally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In France, for example, parliament must adopt an act approving 
any treaty before the French authorities can ratify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practices are different, but they tend increasingly to 
involve parliament in the process leading to the conclusion of 
treaties and give it a say in the process, since the content of 
an increasing number of laws passed by parliaments depends on 
the treaties that were first negotiated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in parliamentary systems such as ours but also 
that of other countries, there is a real lack of democracy in 
that parliamentarians are asked, as we are today in the case of 
Bill C-4, to adopt laws whose content is largely determined by 
the content of treaties negotiated by the governments, even 
though their parliaments were not involved in the discussions on 
that content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I have introduced Bill C-214 which, I hope, will be 
the subject not only of a debate but also of a vote. This bill 
proposes that the House of Commons be involved in the conclusion 
of treaties by first approving a treaty and thus authorizing the 
government to ratify that treaty once the House has been 
informed of its content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some fear, however, that such a procedure might prevent the 
government from negotiating and accepting obligations pursuant 
to debates held between states.  The example of the United 
States is often referred to; two-thirds of the U.S. Senate has to 
support any treaty the government—in this case, the 
President—wishes to ratify on behalf of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula I am proposing is one where approval by the House 
would not necessarily be binding on the government, which would, 
ultimately decide whether or not to ratify a treaty.  This is 
not a procedure or formula that would paralyze a government, at 
least not in a system like ours where the government very often, 
almost always in fact, has a majority in the House and can get a 
resolution passed in favour of approval because of that 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My discussions, and some debates with the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, have led me to conclude that the minister has 
considerable misgivings about such a procedure. He should not 
have any.  This is a procedure aimed at making the process of 
ratifying treaties more democratic and involving MPs in the 
procedure for signing a type of document that is becoming more 
important in our societies and, I feel, will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are the debates and negotiations soon to 
begin at the World Trade Organization, leading to a number of 
treaties around the turn of the new millennium.  These treaties 
arising out of the WTO millennium round will—or at least should—be 
debated in this House before the government makes commitments 
that will be binding on this House when the time comes to enact 
legislation implementing them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We might also mention treaties pertaining to cultural diversity 
we want to negotiate with UNESCO and many other treaties that 
concern trade and cultural issues, individual rights and 
freedoms and information technology issues, since treaties 
concern all matters of interest to governments and to 
parliaments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe also that transparency would require—and this is the 
focus of other provisions in Bill C-214, which I tabled in this 
House—the government to agree to table treaties in the House so 
parliamentarians might be aware of their content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would thus agree to members of this House knowing our 
international obligations and to the enshrinement of a practice 
that was carried on for a number of years in this House.  It was 
abandoned for a number of years but, only a few months ago, it 
was revived after I lobbied increasingly in this forum and in 
other forums to have treaties tabled to properly inform this 
House of Canada's international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I wanted—and would like to convince my colleagues in 
the House of this—the government to do a better job than it is 
currently doing of making the content of treaties known, not 
only by tabling them in the House, but by publishing them in 
various forms, electronically for example, on an electronic site 
such as that of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is one 
of the rare sites of the departments of foreign affairs of 
developed countries where the country's treaties may be 
accessed, with a few rare exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also make sure they are published in the Canada Gazette, 
as are the laws, and that they are published in the Canada 
treaty series, as they currently are but at more reasonable 
intervals, since sometimes it takes months if not years for a 
treaty to appear in the series. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are changes in practice that, in my view, deserve to be 
adopted by this parliament. They would, in certain respects, 
modify the royal prerogative underlying the government's 
authority in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House, however, is empowered to abrogate part of this 
prerogative and adopt a much more transparent and more 
democratic procedure involving all elected representatives—not 
just those of the government party that sit in Cabinet—in 
important decisions having to do with treaties and the 
government's response to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I make this proposal, I am aware, and wish to inform the 
House, that, in other Commonwealth countries, and I am thinking 
of Australia and New Zealand, and even in the United Kingdom, 
the mother of all parliaments and some say of this parliament, 
recent practices for concluding treaties have been modified to 
introduce greater transparency. Treaties are tabled in the 
Houses, accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, and 
distributed much more widely, with much greater parliamentary 
participation than we are seeing here, in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no excuse for the resistance to these changes, 
certainly not the lack of willingness and transparency of a 
government that should realize, on the eve of the year 2000 and 
a new millennium, that changes are in order. 
These practices must be adapted to the new importance of 
treaties in the international as well as domestic order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, the Civil Space Station Agreement Implementation Act, 
was introduced in this House without our ever having been able 
to examine its contents, without any examination before the 
treaty was signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to my information, it was signed on January 29, 1998, 
and adopted on that same date.  Signing already commits 
signatory states to a certain extent because article 18 of the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates that a state 
is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object 
and purpose of a treaty before it consents to be bound by it and 
ratifies it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, by signing the treaty on January 29, 1998, Canada assumed 
a number of commitments, without this parliament having been 
consulted.  It is therefore necessary for a signatory state to 
agree to involve its parliament.  Parliament must be involved in 
examining the treaty itself, not just its implementation, 
because implementation legislation depends on the treaty 
contents.  This bill ought to have been introduced only after 
the House of Commons had examined the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to state that I feel it is important, and 
hope to have the opposition parties' support in this, even the 
government party as well, to ensure that Bill C-4 will be the 
last such bill, and that in future all treaties requiring 
implementing legislation will have initially been approved by 
the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the treaty we are being called upon to implement comes 
primarily if not exclusively under federal jurisdiction, only 
the federal parliament may intervene for purposes of legislative 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, if you want an answer to your question, there would be ways 
of involving the provinces in the conclusion of treaties, even 
in a federation like Canada. 
What is more, Quebec, with its Gérin-Lajoie doctrine, believes 
not only that it must be involved in the conclusion of treaties 
and approve treaties concluded by Canada in areas over which the 
Constitution gives it jurisdiction, but it believes and affirms, 
as all successive governments of Quebec have done, that, under 
the present Constitution, it even has authority to act 
autonomously in concluding treaties in areas that come under its 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the continual foot-dragging of the federal 
government—which has often sought to introduce umbrella 
agreements to limit Quebec's autonomy—that many Quebecers want 
sovereignty.  There is no excuse for this foot-dragging, even 
within a federal framework, and it will only stop when Quebec 
becomes a sovereign state with the authority to conclude its own 
treaties free of intervention by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second question, when treaties are not 
self-executing, they have to be implemented by legislation.  Here 
we have an example of a treaty that is not self-executing as far 
as all of its clauses are concerned, since the Civil 
International Space Station agreement requires the Parliament of 
Canada, and the House of Commons in particular, to pass 
amendments to the Criminal Code in order to implement section 22 
of the treaty, which the implementation bill does in clause 11. 
The treaty not being one hundred percent self-executing, it was 
therefore important for this House to adopt implementing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to emphasize in my speech, however, was that this 
legislation implements an international treaty which did not 
have the prior approval by this House that it ought to have had. 
It is necessary for the House of Commons to approve a treaty in 
order for it to have greater legitimacy.  Then parliament can 
move to pass implementing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally in response to the third question from my colleague, the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, concerning Australia, I 
realize that there is a great difference.  I would not like to 
see us with an arrangement similar to Australia's, one which is 
in my opinion contrary to the federal principle.  It is 
precisely because at one point we had a Privy Council judiciary 
committee that respected provincial jurisdictions that today we 
still have shared legislative jurisdiction over implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not enough to convince us to stay within Canada, 
however.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech of the member.  As I have done 
before, I would like to give special thanks to the people who do 
the interpretation.  I am one of those unfortunate people who 
speaks only English.  My knowledge of French is vastly limited. I 
am totally dependent on their good work in those booths.  I heard 
the speech secondhand, but I thank them for their excellent work 
in providing us with an instant interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a comment about the speech and I also have 
a quick question.  He made one comment that was resonant.  I hate 
saying it because I am one who loves the country, who believes in 
democracy, and who believes that a democratically elected 
parliament is the way to go.  It is superior, but quite clearly 
parliament is but an annoyance to the government and to the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the fact that the particular agreement was 
signed a year and a half ago, and here we are bringing in 
legislation to implement what has already been done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Yes, like the Nisga'a treaty.  Parliament 
has been made irrelevant by the same Prime Minister who keeps 
going around at election time saying that he will make parliament 
more meaningful and give MPs a greater role.  It is a sham.  The 
red book is a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How often have we passed bills to implement budgets?  I am on 
the finance committee and just before prorogation we passed a 
bill to implement some of the Income Tax Act that had already 
been in place and was being enforced.  In some cases guys were 
going to jail because they did not comply, and the bill was 
before the House to approve that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I sometimes hesitate to do this, I agree 
wholeheartedly with the member from the Bloc on this point.  This 
place is irrelevant.  What are we doing here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  I am committed and 
dedicated to keeping the country together.  No matter what the 
topic, they always talk about wanting to be their own country and 
breaking free.  In this case clause four of the bill says the act 
is binding on Her Majesty in the right of Canada or a province. I 
am amazed they are supporting the bill because they are really 
saying that the act is binding on Quebec.  It must be a violation 
of their desire to break free from the country, which I wish 
would not happen. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the interpreters.  I also want to thank the 
translators.  I often call on the translators of the House to 
translate my remarks from French to English or from English to 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay particular tribute to Elizabeth Cowan, a 
translator with the House, who does an exceptional job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to my colleague's question, I will say that the scope 
of section 4, which appears in a number of implementing acts is 
not very clear, especially since it is an implementing act that 
concerns federal jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something I would very much like to clarify and I will 
no doubt do so as professor of international law when I have 
more time to exercise this profession, which I have left 
temporarily to become a member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add, in closing, since I know my time is limited, that 
federalism could work very well with expanded powers for the 
provinces to conclude treaties.  This could be the case for 
Quebec, Alberta or British Columbia.  The formulae that apply in 
Belgium might even be used as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Belgian federalism, communities and regions are empowered 
to conclude treaties.  But this government is ignoring 
parliament and, I agree with the hon. member, it is ignoring the 
provinces as well by setting up and exercising a monopoly on 
foreign policy and on the conclusion of treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one reason why my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and 
many Quebecers want sovereignty, which will give them 
jurisdiction to approve and conclude treaties and to involve 
their parliament—the National Assembly—in their implementation. 
Having the National Assembly approve treaties before they are 
implemented— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, but the

is a pleasure for me to speak to the international space agency 
bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member of the Bloc who just spoke that during the 
course of my comments I will be addressing a couple of private 
members' bills the member has brought forward on the ratification 
of international treaties.  I know it is of interest to him, as 
it is to me. 
I look forward to supporting his bill, if it ever comes to the 
House for a vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another one of those strange coincidences on how a 
populist party will agree on some of the broad issues about the 
necessity of consulting parliament on issues of national and 
international concern.  The member of the Bloc and I may have 
disagreements about many things, but the priority of making the 
House relevant has to do with allowing us to deal with meaty 
issues, big important issues not after they are a fait accompli 
but during the ratification process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member to continue with his private member's 
initiative.  I look forward to one day debating and hopefully 
approving that private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are talking about today deals with the civil 
international space station, the funding required and the 
co-operative efforts of the Government of Japan, the Government 
of the Russian federation, the Government of the United States, 
the European Space Agency and ourselves to put together the space 
station in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to talk about the station and about five truths 
that we can get from this bill.  There are five principles that I 
think are true in the bill and are true in many of the bills we 
discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the truth of fiscal matters.  This bill involves the 
expenditure of well over a billion dollars.  It is a long range 
commitment of Canada to the international space agency.  It is 
not a one time budgetary expenditure.  If we are to be a serious 
player in the international space agency, we have to commit to it 
in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about numbers this large, over a billion dollars 
over the course of the next few years, it is important that we 
also say that government spending is about priorities.  It is 
about picking and choosing the things we can and should be 
involved in as a country and as parliament.  By doing that we 
also say there are some things we are not going to spend money 
on.  In other words, we cannot be all things to all people.  We 
have to pick the issues that we think governments can address. 
Once we make those choices, some things are approved and some 
things are rejected.  It is up to us to pick and choose between 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think this is going to be money well spent.  I 
hope that 10 years from now we will look back and, as what the 
Canadarm did for us in the aerospace industry, our participation 
in the space station will have brought awareness to Canadian 
talents and expertise in engineering and so on.  I hope it will 
be the next big boost to the Canadian aeronautical industry. This 
money will be seen as money well spent.  I hope that years from 
now people will thank this parliament for having approved this 
expenditure and for having made this international commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that a billion dollars is a lot of money.  It reminds 
me that many people in British Columbia are saying that we also 
made choices last night when we committed to the Nisga'a 
agreement.  We said there was a billion dollars.  We made a 
priority choice that the money spent not just by this parliament 
but by the B.C. legislature was a priority and it would be well 
spent.  This parliament and the government have said that we will 
look back years from now and be grateful that we spent it.  How 
can that be true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Nisga'a agreement, how can we say that we are 
going to perpetuate a system of treaties and separateness for one 
group of people over another group and treat them differently on 
things like property rights, the rights of women and the rights 
of people to vote for the government that taxes them?  How can we 
say that a billion dollars spent to perpetuate the current 
reserve system in Canada is money well spent?

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians will say that we should move forward on the space 
station.  It binds all the provinces.  It is a good project for 
the federal government.  It deals with international relations. 
We are going to get some other side benefits from it.  It affects 
all of us.  All of us are in favour of it, so let us move it 
forward.  I think we are going to find that that is basically 
going to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many people however, and in British Columbia at least where 
they understand the Nisga'a agreement, that is not the case. Once 
they know about the Nisga'a agreement, the majority of British 
Columbians say that they do not approve of the current 
expenditures on Nisga'a.  More important, they do not agree with 
the principle behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is that a system that has been proven to be a 
failure over the past 130 years has been enshrined in our 
constitution at the next level in the Nisga'a agreement.  Some 
money has been thrown at it in the hope that a giant collectivity 
called the Nisga'a government will somehow be all things to all 
people in that environment and it will somehow make life better 
for them for all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a good expenditure of money.  More important, it is 
not a sound principle to treat one group of people separately, to 
give them a different set of laws, a different set of privileges, 
a different set of rights, one from another and think it is a 
good thing for Canada.  It is almost the same amount of dollars 
we are talking about for the space agency but it takes us down a 
path I think most Canadians will not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how we can all rally around the flag on the 
space station idea.  We see the benefits for all Canadians, 
Nisga'a and non-Nisga'a, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, 
immigrants and non-immigrants.  Everyone will benefit from it. 
But the same amount of dollars being spent on the Nisga'a 
agreement is driving a wedge between people rather than bringing 
people together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first truth. The truth about fiscal matters is that 
each decision we make means not only that the taxpayer is footing 
the bill but that there is something else we cannot afford to do 
because we spent that billion dollars.  A billion here and a 
billion there and pretty soon we are talking real money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second truth is the truth about democracy that I get from 
the debate we are having today.  It is interesting.  The reason 
we are talking about the international space agency bill today is 
that last night the government rammed through the second reading 
stage of Nisga'a.  After four hours of debate it brought in time 
allocation which means that it is all over but the crying and the 
soft music by the end of the day.  That is what happened last 
night.  We had four hours of debate.  The B.C. legislature had 
four weeks of debate, the longest debate in the history of B.C., 
on the Nisga'a agreement.  But here we did not have a long 
debate.  We did not even have one week of debate.  We did not 
even approach a record of any kind except for a record number of 
times for the application of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can learn a lesson about democracy.  The truth is that we are 
only on this bill today because yesterday we saw what the B.C. 
Liberal leader called a reprehensible demonstration of 
undemocratic government.  It was a reprehensible example from 
over there.  The leader of the B.C. Liberal Party was appalled at 
what he saw going on here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on this bill today, rather than talking about having a 
big principled debate about the future role for aboriginal people 
within Canada, because democracy fell on its sword yesterday. 
That is an absolute truth. People who review what went on 
yesterday in the House will know that to be true.  For a record 
number of times the government has said: “If there is dissent, 
opposition or a problem, we will bring in closure and shut down 
the debate”.  The Liberals have done it more times now than 
Brian Mulroney did in his heyday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals brought it in on Bill C-78, the public servants 
pension fund.  They scooped the excess out of that fund.  We 
opposed the bill.  We debated it for one hour and they brought in 
closure and shut down the debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is on a kind of motherhood and apple pie issue. 
We all want the space station.  We all think it is a good idea 
which should move forward.  But it is bittersweet.  Instead of 
relishing the debate and being able to focus only on the space 
station, we are left with a bad taste in our mouths.  Yesterday 
was a travesty of justice and democracy and that is why we are on 
this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the truth about democracy in this place.  It does not 
happen like Canadians think it happens.  The government pushes 
through, rams through and shoves through anything it wants that 
is the least bit contentious.  That is where we are at today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member who has a private member's bill on the approval 
of international treaties will be pleased that at least this bill 
is before the House for ratification.  This is rare in 
international agreements. It does not happen very often.  Whether 
it is behind closed doors negotiations on the multilateral 
agreement on investment, the next phase of the WTO, the Kyoto 
agreement or other UN forums, time and again, it is just brought 
back to us here by fiat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minister will say “While I was away last weekend sunning 
myself wherever, I signed an agreement and it binds Canada for 
the rest of our lives”.  We will read about the details in the 
paper but we are not allowed to debate them, discuss them, amend 
them, propose alternatives, inform Canadians, travel the country 
or do any of the democratic things that Canadians assume are 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the Nisga'a agreement again.  We were delivered a 
document that said it is the enabling legislation.  It is just a 
few short pages, but there are also two thick books and we are 
not allowed to change, amend or alter in any way a dot, jot or a 
tittle in the entire Nisga'a agreement.  It came here as a done 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People think we come here to debate the issues.  They wonder 
whether the environmental part of that agreement is too strong or 
not strong enough.  What about the conflicting jurisdictions 
between the province, the feds and the Nisga'a governments? Could 
there be some better language?  No, it is brought forward as 
perfection.  The government says that a few people negotiated it 
behind closed doors and the 301 members of parliament are just 
window dressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government brings it here because it technically has to, but 
the truth is that the Liberals do not respect this place at all. 
They disrespect the opinions of members of parliament.  They 
disrespect the entire contingent of people in the official 
opposition who have concerns about it and who would like to see a 
different process that we would hope would clarify some of the 50 
unsettled sidebar agreements that have to go into the Nisga'a 
agreement.  We would like to see those clarified before we stick 
up our hands and vote yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals ignored all of that.  Any concerns we have are 
written off as sour grapes, bad attitude or whatever they want to 
chalk it up to, instead of saying that this place should be 
supreme and should have some pre-eminence in the political life 
of the country.  Instead, the Liberals defer to the backroom 
negotiations.  They defer to the behind the scenes stuff.  They 
defer to the courts.  They defer to the tribunals.  They defer to 
anything, except to the seat of democracy which is this place. It 
is discouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a young person who wanted to influence the future of the 
country were to ask me if he or she should follow in my footsteps 
in Fraser Valley, I would say, “Well, I suppose you could, but 
if I were you I would get a seat on the supreme court.  That is 
where it is happening”.  I might even tell that young person to 
get on as a delegate at the United Nations or at one of the NGOs 
because they negotiate and settle things that we as 
parliamentarians are not even allowed to debate. We are not even 
allowed to know what they are discussing.  It just comes back to 
us, pressed down and rolled over. 
We are expected to shrug our shoulders and say “Look what they 
negotiated for us today”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least in the space agency agreement we can see what was 
negotiated.  We may not have had a hand in the negotiations, but 
at least we can see what we are committed to in terms of money 
and what the structure of the management team will be.  We can 
talk about a lot of that stuff, and to me it looks pretty good. 
At least we get to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young people asked me today if this was the place where big 
changes will be made and big decisions will be made, I would have 
to say, under the current government, sadly, no.  They will have 
to wait for a change in government, because the attitude on that 
side of the House is “It is our way or the highway”.  The 
government's highway involves time allocation, closure, lack of 
consultation and bypassing parliamentarians in favour of special 
interest groups which government members say know more than the 
people who were elected to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the truth about democracy.  That is why we are debating 
this bill today.  All of those other things I mentioned are 
absolutely true.  People can look at what happened yesterday. 
Yesterday democracy took the fall for the expediency of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to talk about briefly is the truth 
about intellectual property rights, because a lot of what will be 
developed on this space station will become valuable.  There will 
be an exchange of information and there will be scientific data 
developed, which is key to the success of the project.  The 
reason all of these countries are getting together is to develop 
intellectual property which will be beneficial to those living on 
Earth.  It could be anything from the development of future 
medicines to things which are happening on Earth which can be 
observed from space.  All of that will become incredibly 
valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about intellectual property rights?  More important, what 
about property rights in general?  What about the property rights 
that the government has never recognized?  I think most Canadians 
watching would say “Yes, but I own my house.  That is my 
property.  It is mine”.  I am sorry to break the news to those 
people, but this government does not recognize property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Charlottetown accord debate one of the big problems 
in my area, and I cannot speak for the whole country, was that we 
wanted to include the right to own property and to develop 
intellectual property rights because the ability to have property 
rights is the cornerstone to the development of assets, wealth 
and prosperity for any people.  The fact that the government does 
not seem to be concerned about intellectual property rights and 
about property rights in general is a very alarming leftover from 
its socialist roots.  It just believes that property is 
communally owned.  We do not have to worry about property rights 
because we are all together.  What we have to do is hug one 
another.  If we hug one another and love one another things will 
be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the property rights, for example, for aboriginal women 
on Nisga'a reserves?  When there is a divorce, the property that 
people enjoyed during the years they were married has to be 
separated.  We have a long set of rules governing most of Canada 
which set out how the property will be divided, what the paternal 
and maternal rights will be, and rules governing the visitation 
of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person does not own anything personally, if it is all owned 
by the Nisga'a government, guess what?  The aboriginal women will 
get short shrift down the road because they do not own the houses 
they live in.  They are sitting on communal property which is 
owned by the Nisga'a.  The whole territory is owned communally. 
Rather than having individual property rights and being able to 
enhance the value of the property, to make sales, to use that 
land to develop wealth and opportunities, the Nisga'a agreement 
will unfortunately not allow that.

while I disagree with much of what the whip for the Reform Party

his kind words.  If I was eloquent it was mostly by accident, but 
I thank him for his kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who run a household know about setting priorities.  In 
Canada, the fact that the government takes more in taxes than 
people spend on food, clothing and shelter combined, means that a 
lot of their choices are taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want our government to do some things for us.  We find it a 
good way to pool our resources to look after those who are truly 
in need.  However, the debate is about choices.  When an average 
citizen, such as a millwright, makes around $4000 or $5000 a 
month, works overtime and does the job, and then finds out that 
fully half of his paycheque has gone to CPP, EI and all the 
global tax deductions, he says “I made $4000, but $2000 went to 
the government.  Now I have $2000.  My mortgage is $1000.  Now I 
am down to $1000 to feed and clothe my family, to provide for 
their education and to provide for my retirement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that government spending is about 
choosing priorities, but we should not have to choose a medicine 
that is so harsh and severe that it kills the patient.  We should 
have a better choice.  One of those better choices, which I hope 
we will hear when the finance minister speaks today, is a 
specific commitment to tax relief that is as specific as the many 
commitments that have been made to new spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitments to new spending seem to be ironclad.  They seem 
to be saying “We will spend money on the following”. 
Government departments came up with a wish list of $47 billion, 
which seems to be solid.  It seems to be a sure thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister says this afternoon that there is another 
sure thing, that taxes will be cut by 25% over the next three 
years, that EI premiums will be lowered to where the auditor 
general says they should be, not a tentative little nibble from 
$2.55 to $2.40, but a big chunk of tax relief down to $2.05 where 
the premiums need to be.  I hope the government will not just 
nibble a bit and hope that Canadians will benefit from one bit of 
tax blessing or another which it chooses to mete out.  I hope the 
minister will say that there will be broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should plagiarise a proposal of the Reform Party 
and say “We are going to give you 25% tax relief over three 
years.  Here is how it will be done.  It is a firm commitment, as 
firm as our spending commitments.  Canadians can take it to the 
bank, spend it on their mortgages, look after their kids and plan 
for the future.  It will be done.  The commitment is there 
because that is the choice the government has made”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that is what we are going to hear this afternoon, but 
there is not a collective holding of breath out in the 
hinterlands waiting for the finance minister to be that specific.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This civil international space station will cost the people of 
Canada over $1 billion, at the very least.  What bothers me is 
the government's lack of respect for the House of Commons and 
for democratically elected members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was around 1984 that talk of creating this civil space 
station first began.  The first negotiations took place between 
the United States and Spain and, over the years, many other 
countries joined in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What hurts a parliamentarian, however, is that Canada signed 
this agreement on January 29, 1998, almost 22 months before the 
government House leader deigned to introduce the bill for 
ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief whip of the Reform Party raised this major time lag, 
which is probably the reason for the poor attendance today, 
particularly by government members who, for some reason, perhaps 
to snub their own government, are taking very little part in a 
debate that could, in fact, be very constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what the Reform Party whip has to say about 
this lack of respect for Canada's elected representatives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Madam Speaker, what it shows Canadians 
and what it shows this place is that the Liberal government 
treats parliament as an afterthought rather than as a key player 
in the development of important policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many examples.  We have asked the Speaker to rule 
when a minister makes an announcement in the House about what is 
going to happen down the road as far as an expenditure of money, 
a millennium fund for students and various other things.  The 
government never comes to the House of Commons to ask for the 
money to be spent.  A minister just says “There are a couple of 
billion dollars involved in this and I held a press conference to 
make the announcement because I thought I would look good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are expenditures of money not supposed to be passed in this 
place?  Are we not supposed to kick them around and debate them? 
Time and again that has not been the case.  However, Canadians 
assume that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a travesty, whether it is announcements like the 
millennium fund or different things that the government has 
declared to be true, whether they have actually been passed or 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have a case like the space agency where, well after the 
fact, a couple of years down the road, the government is finally 
getting around to approving it.  The government often comes to us 
and says that it has known about something for two years, but it 
has to be completed by the end of the day because it is time 
sensitive.  In other words, when it is convenient for the 
government it is an emergency and it has to be done right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the government uses parliament as a rubber 
stamp.  Whether it is this bill or important things like the 
position we took at the Kyoto summit and the approval of the 
Nisga'a agreement in principle, the government comes to the House 
and says “This is a done deal”.  It is finished.  It is 
unwilling to accept a single amendment of any kind, small or 
large, about money, about principles, about details, about the 
purpose of the thing, the goal of the bill, none of it.  It will 
not accept a single amendment.  It is going to bring in the 
Nisga'a agreement and it will be agreed to.  If it is not, the 
government will push it through at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tells me that with a bill such as the space agency bill, 
international agreements like Kyoto and the Nisga'a agreement, 
the government cares little for this place and instead cares only 
for what it and the people in the back rooms have decided will be 
done for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-4.  It 
provides a unique opportunity for Canada to get involved or 
continue its involvement in space.  I am told that the space 
station is the largest science and technology project in the 
history of humanity.  We should well be proud of our involvement 
in that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a personal point of view, the fact that Canada is 
continuing its involvement in space is somewhat gratifying in the 
sense that my uncle is considered one of Canada's space pioneers. 
He conducted one of the first experiments in outer space that a 
Canadian scientist conducted.  He was one of the designers of the 
first satellite, Alouette I, and subsequent satellites which 
Canada sent up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a family point of view we are quite proud of my uncle, Dr. 
Andrew R. Molozzi, and his accomplishments are rather 
interesting.  My uncle was my mother's brother.  My grandmother 
was born in Poland.  She was lucky to get two or three years of 
schooling and that was all.  At the age of 15 she came to Canada, 
got married and raised a pack of kids, including my uncle who was 
the youngest.  He was fortunate that in his family my 
grandparents encouraged him to continue at school and achieve the 
kind of excellence in science that he eventually did achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a model for a lot of people to look at.  In many 
immigrant families in the country education has perhaps not been 
a priority to this point.  The kids leave school, not because of 
lack of ability but because for some reason their parents are not 
encouraging them to continue and fulfil their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking about Bill C-4 I would like to address it from the 
point of view of a Liberal.  I want to make a speech on this 
legislation which I think the Liberals should be making, given 
the fact that they pulled debate of the Nisga'a treaty from the 
agenda of the House yesterday.  As pointed out earlier by my 
colleague, this was a travesty.  It was pulled after only four 
hours of debate.  I would have liked to have spoken to that bill 
yesterday, but I was unable to because time allocation was used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we got this bill with which all of us agree.  I do not 
think there is a parliamentarian in the House who is not 
encouraged by Canada's involvement in outer space and very 
supportive of it, because we see it as a wonderful opportunity 
for our children.  There is probably very little interest in this 
debate out there in TV land, let alone in the House.  It is one 
of those motherhood and apple pie debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address this issue as a Liberal should in light of their 
commitment to the Nisga'a treaty and will discuss the issue of 
native involvement in the Canadian space station.  That may not 
be as much of a stretch as one might think.  It is certainly not 
much of a stretch in light of the recent Marshall decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just review that decision for a moment to show the House 
why the point I will make about guaranteed aboriginal involvement 
in the space project is reasonable from the supreme court's point 
of view, and certainly from the point of view of the Liberals, 
the NDP and the Conservatives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision was an interpretation of a 1760 treaty 
signed between the British crown, the Mi'kmaq people and the 
Malecite people of the maritime provinces of Canada.  In essence 
it was a peace treaty.  The British had been doing battle with 
the French and the French had been expelled from the area.  The 
Mi'kmaq had supported the French and the British thought it would 
be best to ensure that they would stay on side with them and 
would come to rely on them for some of the trade goods they had 
received through their dealings with the French, and so they 
signed a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of that treaty was the establishment of some truck houses. 
These truck houses were special trading posts that were to be 
constructed and manned to deal with Mi'kmaq people.  A list of 
goods that were to be traded was created.  It included the goods 
that the British would provide those truck houses.  It also 
showed the price that they would pay for the goods.  Among the 
trade items the Mi'kmaq had to offer the only things that were 
dealt with were furs, that they would trade furs for truck house 
items.  Fish were not mentioned as a trade item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Mi'kmaq people were required to place hostages at 
certain places to ensure that they lived up to the terms of the 
treaty.  Lunenburg was one place where there were supposed to be 
two hostages to guarantee this.  Fortunately that treaty was not 
long lived.  It operated probably for a couple of years. 
Certainly within 20 years things returned to normal.  That meant 
the Mi'kmaq people were to be treated as everyone else in the 
country.  They were to enjoy the same trade rights as everyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in effect until the supreme court decided to look at 
the issue of the 1760 treaty.  What brought the court into action 
was that Donald Marshall had gone fishing eels and said that he 
had an aboriginal right.  His first defence was based on a 1752 
treaty.  When it was clearly demonstrated that had no relevance, 
he switched horses and decided to base his comments on the 1760 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the court said then was that the treaty somehow gave this 
blanket right to fish.  That right was one that was to be enjoyed 
as a preferential right.  It was a right to be satisfied in 
advance of those of everyone else.  Currently we might say that 
we are negotiating whether non-aboriginal fishermen will have any 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this issue is that the court interpreted the 
1760 treaty with a view to protecting the honour of the crown. 
Also it suggested that the treaty was not stagnant, that it did 
not just affect times long ago but that it had to be viewed in 
light of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to view that treaty in light of today, why are we 
restricting the benefits of the treaty to goods and items that 
might have been traded 200 and some odd years ago?  Why is it 
that we have not taken the terms of that treaty, if it is being 
interpreted in today's terms and viewed in that regard?  If it is 
supposed to protect the honour and integrity of the crown, why 
are we not then interpreting it in terms of today's economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if we can give a priority right to fish, or in 
other treaties such as the Nisga'a guarantee access of 25% to 
Nass River fish, if we can guarantee that in that treaty, why are 
we not guaranteeing a place for aboriginal people in the space 
station?

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not follow?  The logic is there.  The court very clearly 
said that it could not interpret the terms of the treaty as 
things were back in 1760.  Somehow it had to give it a modern 
twist.  It had to interpret it in terms of today and had to 
consider the honour of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's economy does not really revolve around fish.  It 
certainly does in the maritime provinces in many of the 
communities affected by it.  I do not mean to downplay their 
interest, but what I intend to do and the point I really want to 
make is that if we want to talk about a treaty which reflected 
society in 1760, if we want to talk about a treaty that we are 
signing today, if we want to talk about a space station today, or 
if we want to talk about interpreting that treaty in today's 
terms, maybe we should be looking at the global economy that is 
operating today, the whole of the economy.  That means in my view 
an aboriginal component to the space station.  Like, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That question deserves an answer.  Why is it that when 
parliamentarians and the misfits at the Supreme Court of Canada 
interpret who is entitled to a job and who is not, the only 
people they go after is the people in the resource sector?  Why 
is it that they only tell fishermen to stand aside and allow 
somebody else to have their job?  Why is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not say that if there is to be a place for aboriginal people 
in the country it should be across the broad spectrum of jobs we 
all enjoy and have access to today?  Why are we saying that 
aboriginal people can only participate in the fishery and that 
they have a priority right to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the minister of northern affairs says that they have a 
priority right to forests and to mineral wealth.  Why not the 
technology of today as well?  Why not commerce today?  Why are 
they not guaranteed seats on the board of directors of the Royal 
Bank of Canada, for example?  Why not seats on Canadian Airlines 
and Air Canada?  Why are we not guaranteeing them a place in 
today's world economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put it in the context of the way I started my speech when 
I talked about my uncle and the fact that my grandmother came to 
Canada with very little education of probably no more than two or 
three years.  She had a great desire to see my mother, my aunts 
and my uncles be successful in a new society, in the new country 
she had come to.  She encouraged my uncle to seek an education, 
to continue his education and to develop to his full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the aboriginal community we should be placing in 
front of it the same kinds of challenges.  They can be anything 
they want to be.  Whether it be an astronaut, a banker, a 
television performer or whatever, the opportunity is there. 
Somehow it should not be inherent in their genes that the only 
jobs suitable to them would be jobs in the resource extraction 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one flaw in the government's argument today on the 
bill before us, I would say the flaw would be that it has 
completely ignored the rights of aboriginal people.   The 
government cut that discussion off last night so that we could 
not present a positive alternative or a critical but positive 
analysis of the Nisga'a treaty.  It is allowing this debate to 
continue today without any real reference to the welfare of the 
Nisga'a people or any other native in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other issue of Bill C-4, the space station bill, that I will 
talk about is the cost.  I am told that this will cost Canadian 
taxpayers something in the order of $1 billion.  That to me is a 
lot of money and I think it is to most people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area I grew up in as a kid those making $10,000 were 
doing pretty well.  I did not know too many millionaires.  I 
still do not know too many, Mr. Speaker, other than yourself of 
course, but that just shows you the circle I travel in, the 
ordinary folk and not the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at a billion dollars I consider that a lot of money. 
I find it hard to visualize a billion dollars let alone a million 
dollars, but a billion dollars is right out of my league.  I also 
think it is out of the government's league.  I would like to know 
just how hard and fast the numbers are here.  It is not that I 
object to spending money on this particular project. It is a good 
and worthwhile project that will provide opportunities for all 
Canadians who desire to get involved in the space agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the government's track record for spending money, 
I am a little bit concerned.  I would like to draw members' 
attention back to the Nisga'a treaty. When the treaty was first 
made public there was a huge fanfare. The federal Liberals had 
joined with probably the most disreputable government in the 
history of Canada, the NDP government in British Columbia, a 
government that has stolen money from cripples, kids and single 
mothers to advance its causes.  Overnight, it quickly found an 
agreement on the Nisga'a treaty and said that it would only cost 
the Canadian taxpayers something like $250 million.  It also said 
that the fast ferries were going to be $200 million and they are 
well over $400 million.  I could go on with the track record of 
the provincial NDP members and their inability to estimate costs, 
but I guess the same probably applies to their brothers across 
the way, the federal Liberals.  They also have very little value 
for dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the cost was made public, there were a number of people who 
pointed out various matters that had not been costed and very 
quickly both the federal Liberal government and its brothers in 
Victoria, the provincial NDP government, agreed that perhaps the 
cost of the treaty would be more in the neighbourhood of $485 
million.  That is the value that has now been put on the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of us in British Columbia who looked at that 
and thought the figure was not quite right either.  Early on, the 
B.C. Fisheries Survival Coalition conducted an independent study 
of the treaty.  We thought it was time to do that again.  A 
little over a year ago, I contracted with an economist to take a 
look at the Nisga'a treaty and give us a costing of it. I told 
him that when he got a range of values I wanted him to take the 
lower value, not the mid-value.  I told him to always lowball 
the numbers.  I told him I wanted an estimate of what he thought 
the treaty was going to cost British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have great respect for my colleague across the way and his 
knowledge on various pieces of legislation.  However, I also 
understand that there should be some relevance to the specific 
legislation that is on the floor of the House today.  His remarks 
should be addressing that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times they talk about wanting to debate, so let us debate 
the legislation that is on the floor of the House today.  We have 
given him sufficient time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for St. 
Catharines is quite right.  I am also interested in hearing how 
the member for Delta—South Richmond will bring his comments back 
into the debate at hand, which is Bill C-4.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly will bring it 
into hand. 
The point I am trying to make through example is that the dollar 
value the government puts on this treaty is questionable.  If I 
do not reference it to something else then I am simply expressing 
an opinion.  I am trying to solidify and give some substance to 
the agreement by describing another area where the government 
made an estimation of the value or the cost but did not live up 
to it.  I believe that is perfectly valid point, and I am sure 
you agree, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I made when I asked for a cost evaluation of the 
Nisga'a treaty was that the government lowballs the cost or this 
economist lowballs the cost because I did want not him to come 
out with an estimate that somebody could criticize and say that 
he estimated this while it was really down here.  A lowball 
estimate of the cost of the Nisga'a treaty is $1.5 billion not 
$485 million.  That leads me to wonder what the final cost is 
going to be on Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Once again I will 
admonish all members that if they are going to stretch the 
credibility of their argument on Bill C-4 by referring to other 
issues, which is certainly their privilege, it would be best to 
use some imagination and to be sure to continue to come to a 
touchstone and not to challenge the Chair by forcing the Chair to 
make a ruling.  Those are the rules. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate your fairness and willingness to explain 
the rules to us and to enforce the rules fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly interested in the member's comments about the 
space station bill.  It is my understanding that the space 
station will have some beneficial aspects for agriculture, for 
example, in being able to survey large tracts of agricultural 
land.  Will that surveillance also apply to other areas of the 
space station's abilities?  I am thinking, for example, about how 
government allows the uneven enforcement of laws. Would the space 
station be able to pick up things like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since being elected, I have heard a number of stories in my 
constituency relating to wildlife resources.  I am thinking of a 
rider looking after his cattle who comes across 16 slain deer. 
Out of those deer, four hind quarters are removed.  I wonder if a 
space station could see things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that this year in my part of the country, central 
British Columbia, for the first time there are limited entry 
moose hunting permits because the moose population is so 
depleted.  I have been told that the reason the moose population 
is so depleted is that there are actually reefers, refrigerated 
trucks that are parked, and people are loading these trucks with 
moose carcasses and hauling them out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aboriginal guide came to me and showed me the map of his 
territory, his guide licence, his hunting licence and the list of 
customers he had.  He said “There are so many moose being hauled 
out of the country that there is nothing left for my customers to 
admire and perhaps even to shoot and take home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that although the fish have been scarce this year on 
the Fraser River, in past years there have been truckloads of 
salmon hauled out and taken to Alberta while some have been taken 
down into the United States.  I have actually contacted the 
authorities about these things and have been told that there was 
nothing they could do about it.  They said that they were under 
orders from the government to not enforce those laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the uneven enforcement of the laws. I am 
not criticizing aboriginal people.  They are just doing what they 
are able to do.  It is the government that is allowing this to 
happen.  I wonder if the space station technology could see this 
and convince the authorities to enforce the laws evenly and 
fairly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too would like to 
acknowledge the Speaker for his very liberal viewpoints on many 
issues and also for his very conservative implementation of the 
rules of this place.  He does not allow much leeway and I 
recognize that.  That is why I try to stick as closely as I can 
to the rules as the Speaker sees them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues that were raised by my colleague are interesting.  He 
talked about the scientific benefits of the space station for 
Canada and our ability to monitor the Earth and study our 
environment, including monitoring agricultural crop and the 
Arctic ice pack, aiding in navigation for shipping and those 
sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises a good point.  Certainly, the space station 
may very well be an aid to agriculture and to farmers, that is if 
there are any farmers left after the government is done with 
them.  That is the real question.  The technology will benefit 
farmers, but whether there will be any farmers left to benefit 
from it, God only knows and the Liberal government only knows 
because I certainly do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station can play a role in monitoring.  Science and 
satellite technology can play a role in monitoring ships at sea 
off our coasts and so on.  That is certainly a possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Illegal immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Yes, illegal immigrants as well.  There 
is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential for the scientific community and the benefit to 
mankind are limitless through the technology and opportunity 
being created by this particular space station.  I look forward 
to enjoying the benefits and watching it as it progresses over 
the next decades.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we do 
believe in equality of all people in Canada so that they will be 
able to participate in programs like the space program in the 
various educational institutions.  It seems to me that all 
government legislation in this place should make people equal, 
not set them aside with special status.  As an example, that is 
what the Nisga'a agreement does not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another issue from the last question, in areas like Kashmir, 
Iraq, Iran or wherever, it seems to me that it would be very 
important, from an intelligence and peace standpoint, to use a 
facility like the space station for those observations.  Does he 
see a lot of implications of this development for that purpose as 
well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first comment the 
member made is an interesting one.  It has to do with the whole 
notion of equality of all Canadians.  The government appears to 
think it is important in this bill because it does not try to 
separate Canadians.  The implication is that there is equal 
opportunity for everyone.  Why it does not apply that to bills 
that reference the extraction and harvesting of natural resources 
is beyond me. 
Why it has only been the fishing industry on both coasts which 
have been required to bear the burden of treaties entered into 
long ago is beyond me.  It is beyond reason.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my remarks, if the government truly believes, as 
the supreme court seems to, that the supreme court was 
interpreting this treaty in its modern context, then it should 
have expanded that to include aboriginal access to the space 
station and to other government facilities, business and so on. 
Do not just identify one group, one industry and tell it to pay 
the bill for the rest of us.  If that fairness as the government 
sees it, that inequality as I see it, applies to the fishing 
industry, then that equality should be right across the board and 
we should be guaranteeing that kind of access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unlimited potential for the technology, the monitoring 
capabilities that will result from the space station, and which 
we currently have from satellites. As time goes by scientists 
will develop even more effective cameras and other systems that 
we can only dream about now.  It is a wonderful opportunity for 
this country to be involved in the station. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak about Bill C-4, which is an act to implement 
the agreement among the Government of Canada, the governments of 
member states of the European Space Agency, the Government of 
Japan, the Government of the Russian federation and the 
Government of the United States of America concerning 
co-operation on the civil international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that strikes me about this bill is that it 
concerns an agreement between many nations.  The order paper says 
that on the bill before us today there will be speeches of 20 
minutes which are subject to a period for questions and comments 
of 10 minutes for the first five hours of debate.  I am wondering 
if we will actually get five hours of debate.  Most bills in this 
House do not, as everyone is probably aware.  Usually closure is 
brought to bear long before we ever get to that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the last bill that was discussed in this House, 
the Nisga'a land claim, that was supposed to be the final deal 
with the Nisga'a.  That is a very erroneous title.  It certainly 
will not be the final deal.  I do see some similarities between 
what we are discussing today and the whole idea of the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The similarity is that there was a government to government 
discussion with the Nisga'a.  There is a government to government 
discussion with the international space agency.  In the case of 
the international space agency, I believe it is quite 
appropriate.  In the other instance, I think it was totally 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a land settlement claim that is supposed to be the 
final claim was never discussed at the grassroots level. Thank 
heaven for the pressure applied by the Reform Party because the 
committee will now travel to some parts of British Columbia 
during the week of November 14 to have hearings and perhaps get a 
little local and grassroots input on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some similarities between these two pieces of legislation. 
Both of them, as I have already touched on, were part of 
multiparty negotiations.  I am not too sure about the space 
agency negotiations, but I am pretty sure that most of the 
Nisga'a negotiations took place behind closed doors.  Perhaps 
some of the negotiations for the space station took place behind 
closed doors as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also draw a similarity in the projected cost of these 
agreements.  It is suggested that $1.5 billion or thereabouts, 
over $1 billion at least, will be needed to support the 
international space station. 
We are also going to have to come up with another $1 billion to 
support the Nisga'a treaty.  In the people's republic of British 
Columbia it was suggested that it is not going to cost the 
taxpayers of British Columbia much money, that federal taxpayer 
money would be used to seal the deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there is only one taxpayer.  It is impossible to 
line people up and say, “You people pay strictly provincial 
taxes and you people over here pay strictly federal taxes”. You 
know this, Mr. Speaker, because you pay a lot of taxes. It is one 
of the hazards of people in your income category.  There is no 
differentiation between whether you pay provincial or federal 
taxes.  You pay taxes.  There is only one taxpayer and that 
taxpayer is hit with all different levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international space station, as some of my colleagues have 
pointed out, has great potential.  One thing we look forward to 
is getting some information on climate change; whether 
civilization is having a tremendous impact on the climate, or 
whether the climate is having an impact on civilization.  I for 
one would be very interested in observations made by that 
international body as to which is the case. A great controversy 
is raging as to which is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that we have depleted our ozone layer through 
our activities here on Earth to the point where it is no longer 
safe to go out in the sunshine.  I wonder if we have come to the 
point where we can measure the thickness or the intensity of the 
ozone layer, and now having the method in which to measure those 
layers, if we are not just observing a natural phenomenon and 
leaping to the conclusion that civilization is to blame for what 
is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am under the impression that this is a done deal, that the 
Government of Canada is now saying, “Oh, by the way, we need 
$1.5 billion”.  That is entirely consistent with the way the 
Liberals do things.  It was the same with the Nisga'a deal.  The 
deal was cut.  It was passed through the provincial house in 
British Columbia and it was done so with closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be something about that bill which carries the desire 
to invoke closure on it because it certainly has had that effect 
on the House.  After four hours of debate, we have something that 
is going to create another level of government in the country and 
it is going to be entrenched in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing the constitution in this country is a very onerous 
task, as it should be.  It takes a great amount of consultation 
and agreement.  There is the 7-50 rule, seven provinces with 
better than 50% of the population voting in favour of changes to 
the constitution.  That was never done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal has made changes to the constitution.  That 
treaty has been entrenched in the constitution of Canada without 
ever having asked the citizens of Canada whether they wanted to 
have those changes made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the position that we as a party are taking on this 
certainly is not the mainstream sentiment. 
The position this party took on the Charlottetown accord was not 
the accepted position.  The establishment across Canada felt that 
the Charlottetown accord was the best invention since penicillin. 
The Reform Party and some other groups took the position that it 
was not.  It was fraught with flaws.  When the Charlottetown 
accord went to a referendum, we were vindicated in that 70% of 
Canadians who voted in that referendum voted against it.  It was 
a resounding defeat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The architects said that they would not be worried about that at 
all.  They said they had other ways of amending the constitution 
and that they would set about doing it through the back door. 
Apparently the back door is wide open.  Now we have a treaty that 
is entrenched in the constitution of Canada.  The laws of the 
people that this treaty covers now supersede those of the 
province and of the dominion, and if Canadians do not like it, 
too bad.  The Liberals know best. It is no longer father knows 
best; it is the Liberals know best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear time and time again from the members of the government 
that it is just a matter that they have to educate Canadians, 
that it is being done in Canadians' best interests. We will see 
about that.  I am quite confident that history will bear us out 
that we have taken the proper position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My information on the civil international space station 
agreement is that it more or less has been a done deal since 
January 29, 1998.  We are closing in on a year since the deal was 
signed.  Of course the government comes to us now and says, “Oh, 
by the way, we forgot one minor detail.  We need $1 billion or 
maybe $1.5 billion to finance this project”. It is not that I 
begrudge the financing of the international space station, but it 
is the way it was done, and $1 billion or $1.5 billion is a pile 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am invited to talk to school children from time to time.  They 
ask me questions about the difference between the deficit and the 
debt. I try my best to put $1 billion into perspective.  We bandy 
that word around like it was nothing, a billion here, a billion 
there. Mr. Speaker, pretty soon it runs into real money.  It 
could even deplete your bank account in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I try to explain it to the students. I think everybody can put 
$100 in perspective.  Even primary school children can put $100 
in perspective.  Ten $10 bills make $100.  One hundred $100 bills 
make $1,000.  They are all with me so far, even the primary 
students.  Then if we have a thousand $1,000 bills, we have $1 
million.  If we have one thousand million, we have $1 billion. Of 
course, as I do this I just keep adding zeros to the $10 bill. 
That puts $1 billion in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not register with them, I try this story. If we had 
$1 million and it was on the table and we decided to spend that 
at $1,000 a day, in about three years or a little less, it would 
be gone. 
Let us assume that it does not attract any interest rate.  It is 
just laying there on the table in thousand dollar bills.  If I 
spent one a day, in about three years it would all be gone.  If 
there were $1 billion dollars on the table, I would have to live 
about 3,000 years to spend it at $1,000 a day.  I think that puts 
$1 billion in perspective.  It is a lot of money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time we have a debt of about $580 billion.  We 
are paying out between $40 billion and $50 billion a year in 
interest.   That money has to come out of the pockets of families 
across the nation.  We have a duty to spend that money wisely and 
frugally.  Just because government has the ability to reach into 
people's pockets and extract their hard earned wages does not 
give it that right.  There is a huge difference between the 
ability and the right.  The government has given itself the 
ability to reach into the pockets of Canadians and take out any 
given amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the history of the country we realize that taxes 
have consistently risen.  They have never decreased and I think 
it is about time they did.  We were told in 1991 that the GST 
would replace the manufacturers sales tax, a 12% tax that applied 
to some items.  The items the manufacturers sales tax applied to 
were to be less expensive because the tax that would be applied 
to them would be a very reasonable 7% tax rather than the rather 
onerous 12% manufacturers sales tax.  That has not happened.  As 
a result about $15 billion a year comes into the federal coffers 
through the GST, and still the country was running $42 billion 
deficits as late as 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject at hand, we want to ensure that intellectual 
property rights are protected.  If a company or an individual 
working on some aspect of the space station were to come up with 
some leading edge technology, some kind of ground breaking work 
discovery, how would that intellectual property be protected? Are 
we talking about a communal effort, the same aspect as the 
Hutterite colony where nobody owns anything and everything is 
owned collectively?  Is that the way this process works, or will 
individual intellectual rights be protected?  I am not at all 
sure of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about collective rights versus individual 
rights, I am again reminded of the bill we were discussing, the 
Nisga'a so-called final agreement.  Collective rights in the 
Nisga'a agreement supersede individual rights.  I do not think 
that is the Canadian way of doing things.  Individual rights in 
the country are of paramount importance and should always take 
precedence over collective rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One year my wife and I took a holiday to enjoy the beaches of 
Cuba.  One thing which was extremely apparent there was that 
individuals had no rights.  They might have a form of security 
but they had no rights. 
A policeman can stand on the street corner.  When people are 
driving by in their dilapidated old cars, he simply blows his 
whistle and points to whomever he wants to stop, and they bloody 
well stop right away.  They know that if they do not they could 
have their old car all shot to pieces, and themselves besides.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an ultimate example of where collective rights supersede 
individual rights.  I talked to the people in Cuba and discovered 
there were two kinds of people: those involved in the regime and 
great supporters of it, and those who were governed by the regime 
and did not support it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I know we have been advised this morning that the Indian 
affairs committee refused to allow anybody but witnesses friendly 
to the Liberal government at the Nisga'a hearings in B.C.  I know 
we have heard that and I know it is difficult for my colleague— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In fairness to the 
hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley, explain to the 
Chair how this could possibly be a point of order relevant to the 
debate that is taking place right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was about to do 
that.  I was explaining that because Liberal members of the 
Indian affairs committee have refused to let hostile— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the hon. member 
knows, what goes on it committee goes on in committee. Committees 
are their own masters.  That does not have a direct relevance to 
the House.  It is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see quite a few 
parallels in the bill in the way it came to us as a fait 
accompli.  Our caucus is very anxious to speak to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not surprise me in the slightest to see that it too 
becomes the subject of closure yet again.  If we look at the 
government's agenda we wonder what is the urgency.  What does it 
have on the agenda that is so urgent that it has to shut down 
debate after four hours?  Those who look at the agenda just 
scratch their heads because there is nothing there but thin soup. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise with 
some trepidation on Bill C-4.  It is not particularly 
controversial; in fact it is anything but.  The reason I am 
concerned is that the Liberal government is making this place 
completely irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call them the green foreheads over there.  We look at the 
chairs over there and we see that they are green.  I am speaking 
to many green foreheads over there, the green party over there 
which maybe we should call the brown party because there is as 
much brown over there too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Bill C-4 is important.  It shows the priorities of the 
government both in spending money and in using the time of the 
House for debate.  I guess it is good because it is an indicator. 
It is like a red light on the dash.  I wish every Canadian would 
wake up right now, look at the red light on the dash and realize 
that the red light or the red book is giving them big problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask for an opportunity to debate an issue of terrible 
importance to the people of British Columbia, of immense 
importance to all Canadians across the country at the present 
time and of increasing importance for generations to come, when 
we ask that we in the House and throughout the country have ample 
time to debate such an issue, the Liberals invoke closure and say 
no. They will not talk about that.  They want to talk about Bill 
C-4, an agreement on an international space agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That tells us something.  I do not want to be disrespectful.  I 
think the technological advancements we are participating in as 
Canadians are wonderful, but this shows that the government is 
totally spaced out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is right out of it when it comes to evaluating what is 
important to Canadians.  It is right out of it when it comes to 
trying to figure out how to spend money.  It is right out of it 
when it sets the agenda for what is debated in the House and what 
is debated among Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from coast to coast would like to engage in a debate 
on the future of the country.  Right now we have a government 
with its dictatorial powers and its majority that it uses so 
blatantly.  Where does the government stand on the issues that 
are important to Canadians?  It is pulling the strings of its 
members and getting them to vote the way they are told on all 
sorts of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Bill C-4 today.  It is a very small bill.  The Liberal 
government has chosen to debate this bill today instead of the 
Nisga'a one.  It is an agreement between Canada and a number of 
other countries.  It is an agreement to co-operate on building an 
international space station and operating it.  A number of 
elements are involved.  A number of elements require co-operation 
among different countries.  It is probably a job that is too 
large for one country to bear.  The two elements of greatest 
importance to us are our contribution of personnel and our 
contribution of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is an act to implement the agreement among the 
Government of Canada, governments of member states of the 
European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of 
the Russian Federation and the Government of the United States of 
America concerning co-operation on the civil international space 
station and to make related amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the more detailed list a number of countries in 
the European Union are involved.  When I saw the bill I was 
absolutely amazed.  The government hammered out an agreement 
behind closed doors and signed it on January 29, 1998.  This is 
almost the end of 1999.  We are approaching two years since 
Canada signed the agreement.  To show its total disdain for 
parliament, having signed the agreement almost two years ago, it 
now has the gall to say that it would like parliament to ratify 
the agreement.  It would like parliament to give its consent to 
an agreement that it has already signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of things come to my mind when I hear that.  One is how 
Canadians through their parliament and perhaps directly in debate 
were not involved previously.  Why were they not informed that 
the agreement was being considered?  It is a tremendous 
expenditure of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a strange coincidence that the cost of this program, $1.4 
billion, is pretty well the cost of the immediate implementation 
of the Nisga'a agreement, although that agreement has the 
potential with its spin-offs across the country to cost the 
country in excess of $200 billion or more than the annual budget 
of the Government of Canada right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is willing to cut off debate on the Nisga'a 
agreement and deal with Bill C-4, which shows that it does not 
want to deal in any real or substantial way with anything of any 
relevance to Canadians.  Government members want to sweep the big 
problems under the rug and try to get them jammed through before 
anyone wakes up and realizes what they are doing.  I guess they 
learned from the Charlottetown accord that they could not trust 
Canadians to be totally ignorant. 
They want to keep them ignorant by ramming through those things 
really fast so that no one has the time to become informed and 
react.  They want to do it quickly and let the consequences of 
the future be as they may.

have in Canada, once we have debated an issue and have come to an 
agreement it would have been because of the fact that we were 
promoting a sensible idea.  When people consent to it, of course, 
they would support it and our country would remain strong and 
unified.  That is not so with this government.  It will not 
debate an issue which has the potential of costing $200 billion, 
but it will talk about this, which will cost about $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught mathematics for a number of years.  I have with me a 
trusty calculator which I always have with me as my auxiliary 
brain.  I will give a perspective on what $1.5 billion means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have approximately 15 million taxpayers in the country.  That 
$1.5 billion means that every taxpayer will be contributing $100 
to this project.  That is an immense amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not have admitted that I had to use my calculator for 
that division, but I was not thinking that these numbers were the 
same.  I am now a little red faced and embarrassed. However, it 
is a lot of money.  Taxpayers are being pushed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, do we have $1 billion to support Canadian farmers? 
No.  Instead what we get from the government is the hauling out 
of a bunch of statistics which show that the government has no 
interest at all in western Canadian farmers.  It has let them go 
down the tube. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the advantages of the space station is that we should be 
able to send more people up there.  When we look at our planet 
from space, I think it would give us a perspective on what is 
important down here.  We as Canadians, and the Liberal people as 
parliamentarians, should value Canadian society and Canadian 
farmers.  That might come to our minds if we looked at it from a 
different perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this agreement the government has made some unilateral 
decisions and is now coming to parliament for approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a lot of bills there is a great deal more power being 
attributed to the minister.  That is also true of this bill. 
This is amazing.  Clause 7 gives a lot of power to the minister. 
It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may send a notice to any person that the Minister 
believes, on reasonable grounds, has information or documents 
relevant to the administration or enforcement of this Act, 
requesting the person to provide, within any reasonable period 
that the Minister specifies, that information or those documents 
to the Minister or any person that the Minister designates. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty scary stuff, which is actually standard in a lot 
of the bills the government brings in.  Basically the minister 
has the power to do anything he wants.  If he believe it is the 
right thing to do, the bill will give the minister the ability to 
do it.  If the person objects to providing or fails to provide the 
information, then the minister can take the person to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has anyone had a fight with a schoolyard bully?  I have not 
because I was always so cuddly.  I did not pick fights a lot.  I 
was the brunt of a lot of teasing and every once in a while 
people would attack me, but I would not call those fights. 
However, when we take an individual and put the weight of the 
government behind a lawsuit, I do not think that individual has a 
chance of winning.  All of the resources of the government would 
go behind the lawsuit and the funds of the poor individual, who 
is usually limited to whatever he can borrow against his house, 
if the government permits that, would be eaten up very quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an agreement.  I like the concept of agreement.  It says 
in the schedule of this bill that this is an agreement among the 
government and all of these different countries.  It adds the 
Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the French Republic, 
the Federal Republic of Germany, the Italian Republic, the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of 
Spain, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation, and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Add to 
that the list of all of the parties I read before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a multilateral agreement.  Is it not interesting that 
the government is willing to go through the work of arranging an 
agreement that these different parties can agree to?  When it 
comes to an element as important as Nisga'a, does it make sure 
the parties come together?   No.  It totally fails to do that. 
It has not recognized that when it comes to an agreement like the 
Nisga'a agreement there are two parties to it.  Sure it has the 
Nisga'a people, but it also has all of the non-native people who 
are a party to that agreement.  The only difference is that this 
Liberal government does not even want to discuss it with the 
other members of the agreement.  It wants to unilaterally impose 
it on them and hopefully keep them in the dark and ignorant about 
the terms and issues in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating the space station when we should be 
debating the importance and the relevance of probably the most 
important piece of legislation to hit this country in the last 30 
years.  Instead the Liberal government is saying “That is the 
end of that debate.  We cannot let members talk for more than 
fours on that, but go ahead and talk all day on the international 
space agreement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have an example of an agreement which was reached among 
all the parties, but the government is imposing on Canadians an 
agreement with the Nisga'a in which one party to the agreement is 
not allowed to be involved.  The terms and conditions are being 
dictated to them.  They are not allowed to have any input.  If 
anything, the government would like for them to have no 
understanding of it.  That is atrocious.   As far as I am 
concerned that is a serious aberration of what we call democracy. 
With this kind of contempt for the House of Commons and the 
people of Canada, I do not believe the Liberal government has the 
moral authority to stand in governance over us.  It has failed 
us.  It continues to fail us because of the fact that it does not 
want to engage in democratic debate, democratic give and take, on 
an agreement which will so vitally affect both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are in principle in favour of Bill C-4, because it 
ratifies an agreement, we think it should have been done in 
advance of the agreement's being signed.  It is arrogant of the 
government to go ahead and sign the agreement and say that it can 
get it through parliament.  All sorts of things could prevent 
this from happening.  For example, the government may simply not 
be re-elected.  It could well be that the next government would 
have something else on its agenda besides this agreement and that 
it would not necessarily pass.  I am not predicting this because 
I do not think that is my role.  I am not able to see the future 
that way, but I think it is going to happen.  For the sake of 
Canadians, the sooner it happens the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure that Canadians are represented and that the 
wishes and will of Canadians are represented in this parliament. 
Without that we are not going to be successful as a democratic 
society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one more item to talk about which relates to Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are very pleased at how relevant I am 
remaining.  By the way, I should add in passing that it has 
become a practice in this House that wide ranging debate be 
permitted.  As the Speaker ruled a couple of days ago, when we 
have wide ranging consensus and practice over a period of time, 
then that sort of becomes the operating method of the House, and 
I appreciate that freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 16 of the bill we have article 12.  It has to do with 
transportation.  It says that every country which is a party to 
this agreement shall have right of access to the space station. 
That is sort of cool.  It means that I can go, maybe with some of 
my friends, up to the space station if I happen to be selected 
and trained.  It indicates once again some of the countries. 
Then it states that there is an obligation on the part of the 
participating countries to provide launch and return 
transportation services for the space station and, in addition, 
other space transportation systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but remember something that happened in my 
riding a couple of years ago.  Because of a very weak showing by 
the Liberal Party in Alberta, it decided to make some changes. 
Without a great deal of thought from a military point of view, it 
decided to move the air base from Namao to never-never land and 
to bring in the army to that base instead.  The result is that 
the longest and strongest runways in North America, which were at 
the Namao air base, have been changed into streets leading up to 
warehouses for the army.  There was not even the foresight to 
keep the buildings far enough away so that in an emergency that 
airstrip could still be used.  It has often been said that this 
was one of the collateral runways that was available to 
spacecraft returning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to provide and to do our share in 
providing transportation to and from the space station, which in 
an emergency would necessitate the use of those long runways, but 
we have disabled them.  Again it shows a total lack of foresight 
on the part of this government.  I am absolutely disgusted that 
those decisions are so often clouded with political ramifications 
instead of being made on a rational basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to questions from the green foreheads. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not qualify for the category my hon. colleague mentioned, but 
seeing none of the green foreheads standing I thought I would 
ask a question of my colleague from Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the critic for industry, I want to say that the Reform 
Party is very supportive of Bill C-4 and the Canadian Space 
Agency.  I know that my colleague had many good comments about 
the work that space station will do to help in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is a keen follower of new technologies and the 
ability of the space station to monitor Earth.  The good that it 
will do for crop monitoring for farmers and the monitoring of the 
ice pack to aid in the navigation of shipping in our Arctic are 
all things that I think my colleague from Elk Island would agree 
are important factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things that we take for granted in Canadian society, 
such as individual property rights, are not available under the 
constitution and yet we have fee simple use of our land.  We have 
fee simple title to our land, whether it be a lot, a house or a 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intellectual property rights and patent rights are being 
protected for Canadian companies and the Canadian government when 
doing research on the international space station.  The fact that 
there are going to be eight different countries involved makes it 
important to protect intellectual property and patent rights. 
Yet we see in the Nisga'a agreement things that we take for 
granted in our Canadian law through intellectual property rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Nisga'a agreement property rights are not protected for 
Canadian Nisga'a women in terms of a marriage breakup.  They are 
not protected in terms of fee simple land for the Nisga'a. 
Individuals will not be able to own a piece of property.  They 
are going down that road of communal property which is a failed 
policy.  Even the east bloc countries in eastern Europe finally 
had to admit that it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague's comments.  What does he think of the 
comparison between the need for intellectual property rights on 
the space station and doing it here at home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased with this 
question.  We do not expect any questions from the green 
foreheads because they have difficulty standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to answer the question with respect to property rights. 
One of the best kept secrets in the world is that I have a little 
company called Epp Software.  What I used to do, and still do 
except it has become rather rusty now, is write computer 
programs.  I used to have a small business and I sold some custom 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the owner of that intellectual property.  When I purchased 
a blank disk it had a value of $1 or $1.50.  After I added my 
program to it, I was able to sell it for $25 or $30. I added some 
value to it and it was my right to do that.  I was hoping that I 
would have a copyright that would prevent other people from 
copying my disks and giving them to other people without penalty. 
That is what copyright acts are all about.  They are to preserve 
the property of the person who actually made the invention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become a tough situation.  The Liberal government has 
completely failed on this issue.  We now have the tax on blank 
cassettes.  In other words, it assumes that people are going to 
break copyright laws, so they pay a penalty whether or not they 
break the law.  It is the same as giving people speeding tickets 
in advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled that there are agreements in Bill C-4 that will 
protect the intellectual rights of the participants in that 
program, but the Nisga'a people do not even have the simplest of 
rights.  That the government has failed to address that is even a 
greater travesty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am somewhat amazed at what is going on in the House at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see only Reform Party members speaking.  One of them, a member 
of the Standing Committee on Industry, has just said that they 
were in agreement with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that this gives my hon. colleague another 
chance to speak about his former company and the cassettes it 
sold, but it seems to me that the House's time is valuable.  The 
Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with this bill.  Having visited 
the space agency in Saint-Hubert, there is much I could say and, 
being a member of the industry committee, I am somewhat aware of 
the various facets of this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless there is an objective of negotiation, if there is 
agreement, why stretch out the discussion, especially if 
everyone is already in agreement?  I would like my colleague to 
explain this to me, then perhaps I will understand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that the member believes

</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is here to debate the issues of the day.  As he and 
others have observed, our right to debate in depth the full 
implications of the Nisga'a agreement was cut off by the Liberal 
government yesterday.  Therefore, we are going to use the time 
today to debate not only this bill, but the bills that we think 
we should be able to debate in this place. That is my reason and 
it stands on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Of course, on the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly it 
is my privilege to speak to Bill C-4 on the space station and 
what it means to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start off by talking about the provincial co-operation 
that needs to go on whenever we put any kind of legislation 
forward.  Certainly Bill C-4 would be an example of that. I would 
like to know from government members just how much consultation 
went on in talking to the premiers about the implications for 
Canadians of a space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have not heard answers from the Liberals, all I can 
do is try to project how much consultation they might have done. 
What I would have to do is look at the most recent bill we 
discussed in this House.  Yesterday we talked about Nisga'a.  Let 
us examine that and compare it to Bill C-4 and how much 
provincial consultation went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba came to try to 
consult on the agricultural issue. What kind of consultation 
happened and what were the results? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine that first in the context of Bill C-4. Let us ask 
government members, did they consult with the provinces?  That is 
the question.  Let us look at the examples of their consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start off by looking at the Nisga'a agreement.  In the 
Nisga'a agreement which involves the people of British Columbia, 
the consultation was extremely limited.  Closure was used on that 
bill in the parliament in British Columbia. Yesterday's press 
release by the leader of the opposition in British Columbia puts 
it into perspective: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion this morning by the federal government to invoke 
closure on the Nisga'a treaty debate is a reprehensible abuse of 
the democratic process, said Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This is an egregious abuse of the democratic process, and 
shows flagrant contempt for all British Columbians,” said 
Campbell. “It's an unacceptable slap in the face to our 
province, and to all Canadians who deserve a full and open debate 
on the landmark treaty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“On a matter of this critical importance to our country, to our 
province and to our constitution, every member of parliament 
deserves the right to speak.  Every Canadian should demand the 
right of their MP to speak.  To put this in context, we would not 
for a moment dream of shutting off debate on a change to the 
constitution affecting Quebec, but that's exactly what the 
government's doing to B.C.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's closure motion, introduced at 
11.30 a.m. EST, will shut down all debate on the treaty this afternoon 
at 6.30 p.m. EST.  At the time the motion was introduced, there 
had been less than 10 hours of debate on the treaty, of which 
only four hours [and 12 minutes] had been allocated to the 
official opposition. In that time, the official opposition was 
able to field just 16 speakers out of a caucus of 58 members. 
There are 24 Reform opposition MPs in B.C. alone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the example of the co-operation the B.C. politicians 
feel this federal government gives them.  I wonder what the B.C. 
government would say about the consultation on the space station 
and its involvement for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to Alberta.  There is a longstanding tradition 
that most Alberta politicians feel toward the federal government 
and its lack of consulting them on most issues. 
There are so many examples we would not have time to deal with 
all of them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the Alberta politicians would say about the 
consultation on Bill C-4, the space station and the implications 
for the people of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Representatives from 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba came here last week to consult with the 
federal government.  They wanted to talk about the most important 
issue they had before them which is the agricultural issue. The 
farmers are hurting.  They are losing their farms.  Young farmers 
are leaving simply because there is no future for them in 
agriculture.  That is our food supply.  I wonder how much 
consultation the premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba would say 
the federal government has had with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the space station and the implications to 
agriculture which one member spoke about earlier.  It could be a 
boon to the agricultural community regarding production.  I 
wonder if they have been consulted, if they know what is involved 
and if they want taxpayers' money to go toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder as well if Ontario and Quebec have been consulted. Mr. 
Bouchard makes many, many speeches on the topic of consultation 
with the federal government and the lack of it.  It does not 
matter which party it is in Quebec, we hear the same thing.  Mr. 
Harris in Ontario does not feel he has been consulted on the many 
issues that affect the great province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask Atlantic Canadians if they have been consulted about 
the space station, they would say, “No, agreements come out and 
we get no support at all from the federal government.  We have 
all kinds of fishing agreements.  We have the supreme court 
setting the laws for us and that has opened a time bomb for 
Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A race based policy has been set up in this country.  This race 
based policy is going to cause a great many problems in the 
future for my children and grandchildren.  They are going to have 
problems because we have set aside special rights for different 
people.  I would hope that the consultation necessary between 
provinces would go on and would involve everything from space 
stations to Nisga'a to any other agreements the federal 
government might enter into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first items to identify in this severe problem is the 
co-operation between the provinces and the federal government. 
It just is not there.  It should be there whether it is on the 
space station or Nisga'a.  It should be there. It must be there. 
We should be here to fight for that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the effects on Canadians of legislation that 
happens here.  Let us talk about the space station and what it 
will do for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there will be a pride among Canadians when they hear 
that Canada is playing a role in developing a space station.  We 
are playing a scientific role.  We are co-operating with the 
United States, Japan and countries of the European Union. There 
will be pride that we are part of this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be influence created by our involvement in the space 
station.  We will have influence in terms of our marketing and 
sales and what we do around the world.  Our trade will be helped 
because of the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about co-operation and what we will learn by 
co-operating with these other countries.  The prestige and 
position of Canada in the world will be improved by the space 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the effects on Canadians.  Let us compare the 
space station and all of the good things we have gone through to 
Nisga'a and the message that sends to the world.  Let us compare 
the two.  We have pride and co-operation, prestige and influence 
in the world because of a space station, but the Nisga'a 
agreement sends the message that we are persecuting a group of 
people, that we have a race based policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all Canadians believe in the equality of all people, but 
we have a government that is putting forward a race based policy 
in the House.  The government is afraid to debate the policy 
because it knows it is onerous to the people of the country.  It 
allows four hours and twelve minutes to debate an issue like that 
and expects us all to be happy and say “Isn't democracy a 
wonderful thing”.  We are sick and tired of that kind of 
presentation to the world.  The world is looking at us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN has condemned us for our treatment of our native people. 
The UN has said that it is time we talked about the grassroots 
people of the country.  We do not need to be spending time in 
here talking about a sophisticated space station.  We need to be 
talking about the grassroots people who really count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening to those people?  They are living in poverty. 
They have problems with crime and alcoholism.  What has caused 
that?  The race based policy of governments in the country over 
the years have caused the problems.  They have created a 
situation where they think they can solve the problems by 
throwing money at them and by signing these agreements which no 
one is happy with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the people on the reserves are contacting some of our 
members.  The member for Wild Rose and a number of other members 
have done extensive work with the natives.  The member for Prince 
Albert has also done extensive work with them.  They have done a 
lot of talking to the grassroots people.  That is the message we 
are sending to the world as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one side, we have the great Bill C-4, the space station 
bill, that gives us pride in our country.  On the other side, we 
have another piece of legislation that makes us absolutely sick 
to our stomach and we cannot let the people of Canada know about 
it because the government is afraid to let it be debated in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have no courage at all.  They do not stand by their 
convictions.  They should be embarrassed to go out in public.  I 
think that is why so many of them moved to Ottawa and live here. 
They are afraid to go back to their own constituencies.  They 
should be afraid because of the image they are sending to the 
people of Canada.  One day it will come to haunt the hundreds of 
people sitting across the way who are listening so attentively. 
It shows how much interest there is in this kind of issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk further about the constitutional changes and the 
loss of rights.  We are here to talk about the space station.  We 
have said what that does for us and the pride it gives to us. 
However, what we should be talking about is the loss of rights 
and the loss of democracy in the country?  That should be part of 
what is happening here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What rights have we lost?  I feel I have lost rights by the use 
of closure in the House.  When closure is used we do not have the 
right to debate the issues and let Canadians knows about them. It 
used to be that closure could be used once in a session and the 
government would worry about whether it would be defeated. It now 
uses closure on every single bill.  I expect it will use closure 
on the space bill.  Why would it not on something as great as 
that?  That will send a great message to the world as well:  We 
had to use closure on the space station that every party agreed 
with.  It is a great idea.  We are proud of it and we want to be 
involved but the government has to use closure on it because that 
is how its democracy works and that is how democracy exists in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost our rights.  We lose our rights every day in the 
House.  Whether it is on closure, Bill C-68, the committee 
approach to things, satellite TV or whatever it is, the 
government operates like a dictatorship.  It is time the 
government changed its attitude and started to think about the 
people who really count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government throws out fancy bills like Bill C-4 and says 
that everyone will agree with it because they are a bunch of 
patsies who are just going to go along with it.  It knows we will 
put up one more speaker and it will then ram the bill through 
because it is a good bill. 
This is an opportunity for us as opposition members to at least 
let the government and the Canadian people know how the 
government is operating.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about Bill C-4 and the space station.  We are for 
that.  We think it is great and we are proud of it. This is about 
democracy and the total abuse of democracy in this place.  That 
is why all of us need to stand on our feet and be counted with 
regard to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people would want us to stand and talk as well, even 
if they are opposed to what we are saying.  In a democracy, one 
has the opportunity to speak and that is what it is all about. We 
go around the world peddling democracy.  We say that we are the 
example of a democratic state.  How can we say that when closure 
is used at the drop of a hat?  It does not matter what bill it 
is, closure is used on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are setting up a group of people who are going to run a 
socialist state, where the chief and council will have the rights 
to land and the rights to everything. The individual person will 
have no property rights.  We cannot have a race based policy like 
that.  We cannot have a top-down government like that.  My God, 
if that worked then the east bloc countries would be leading the 
world.  They would be the only super powers around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in all the east bloc countries.  They are 
collapsing.  They are being destroyed because of their type of 
government.  This government is doing exactly the same thing to 
Canada, to this great country, a country that should be on top of 
the world.  It is destroying it by destroying democracy and 
destroying the sorts of things that all of us grew up to believe 
Canada was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to examine that and to stand up and be counted. It is 
shameful that the other parties are not standing up to hold the 
government accountable.  I am proud to be part of a group that is 
standing up, that is getting that message out and is saying what 
it is really all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we travel internationally and involve the international 
community, and as foreign affairs critic I have been able to do 
that in lots of places, I want to be proud of the country that I 
come from.  I want to be proud of the country that has a 
democratic process where every member of parliament has an 
opportunity to stand up and speak.  I do not want to be part of a 
country that uses closure at the drop of a hat and allows four 
hours and twelve minutes of debate on something that will affect 
the rest of our lives, the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren.  It is a shameful example of what we have seen in 
the House in the past day or so and, for that matter, over the 
last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of the space station but we are not proud of the 
other things the government has done.  We cannot stand in pride 
and also have shame in our eyes because of what the government 
has done.  In the last 24 hours, it has just committed probably 
one of the most shameful things that we have seen since we have 
been in the House and something that will affect us for so many 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am embarrassed for the government members of the House.  They 
should hang their heads in shame, as 10 or 20 of them are doing 
over there right now.  In fact their heads are so low I cannot 
even see them because they are under their seats with 
embarrassment, which is exactly where they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station, yes; the Nisga'a agreement, no. Let the 
government take notice of just how many more speeches we have to 
give and how many more comments we will have about the lack of 
democracy that has been displayed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I understand we have had quite a morning. We

the hon. member take it from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately you were not 
here for most of my speech, but I did talk about the connection 
between the negotiations with the provinces and the federal 
government with regard to agreements.  I used, as an example, the 
space station, which was an agreement that I hoped the federal 
government had consulted with the provincial governments. I had 
to use examples of where the federal government had not consulted 
with the provinces, like the Nisga'a agreement and many of the 
other agreements that have come forward like the student loan 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tradition for the federal government to not consult with 
the provinces about these issues.  It is just how it does 
business.  It just rams legislation through, which is the 
unfortunate, but I am very aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am most concerned about is that not only is that an abuse 
of democracy, but when the government starts to say “We'll take 
this witness, but not that witness.  We'll pick them”, that goes 
absolutely to the ultimate end in lack of democracy, which was 
the point I was trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to cut this off because I 
thought that was quite interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yes.  Any time the opposition House leader 
stands I know it is going to be interesting.  However, it is 
almost two o'clock and I want to save as much time as I can for 
the hon. member.  The hon. member will have about seven and a 
half minutes left for questions and comments after question

equality begins with the truth.  The truth is that the decision 
handed down in the Marshall case and supported by the Liberal 
government will cost non-Indian fishermen their jobs and their 
way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response tells the untold truth.  A race based 
fishery will deprive fishermen across Canada of equal access to a 
resource they have shared with Indians for generations.  The 
government talks of native rights but says nothing about the 
rights of non-Indian fishermen who must feed their families and 
make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals hope that by throwing money at the problem it will 
go away.  While the government and its fisheries minister 
continue to dilly-dally over what to do, Indian leaders are 
already exploiting the Marshall decision and expanding their 
Indian only policy into mining, forestry and crab fishing off the 
coast of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the Liberal government and the supreme court 
are responsible for pitting Indians against non-Indians and 
status against non-status Indians.  As a consequence the equality 
rights of all Canadians have been crushed.

shared between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total Nortel expects to invest $210 million in Ottawa and an

So far, however, most companies are not labelling their 
genetically modified foods.

have the capacity to assess the safety of genetically modified

all genetically altered foods mandatory because Canadians want to 
know what is and what is not genetically modified.

<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister has a spending problem.  Someone has to help 
him work through it before taxpayers have to turn all of their 
income over to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is planning a $47 billion shopping spree based on a projected 
surplus that could, might, may reach $90 billion.  Someone should 
remind him though that, unlike his shopping list, the surplus is 
projected and expected, not confirmed, meaning that tax relief is 
doomed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the Prime Minister's shopping sprees always set in 
concrete while his tax relief is merely set in quicksand? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we predicted at the time of the last election that there 
would be a surplus for the first time in 50 years.  We said that 
the surplus would be divided 50:50, 50% for the debt and tax 
reduction and 50% for social and economic programs.  That is 
exactly what we are doing at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to know that the Reform Party is beginning to 
realize that we have provided Canadian people with very good 
government, because we have a big surplus now compared to the $42 
billion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Calgary Southeast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister is absolutely right.  We do recognize that he 
has provided us with big government and that he is keeping his 
promise.  Yesterday the finance minister denied the $47 billion 
in new spending and the Prime Minister just took credit for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If everybody was as fabulously wealthy as the Prime Minister 
perhaps they would not care so much about tax relief.  But for 
middle income families that are losing up to half of their income 
to government, it does matter a lot and it matters that the 
government is planning a nearly $50 billion spending spree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A surplus is a surplus, and the answer to a surplus is to 
collect less, not spend more.  Why will the Prime Minister not 
abandon his $47 billion spending— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, these are the people who yesterday asked for more money 
to spend on agriculture.  We are doing that.  We are spending 
$900 million more on agriculture this year than last year.  The 
Reform Party has asked us to put in more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have said is that the rational thing to do is to divide 
it 50:50.  Even Premier Harris used the red book at the meeting 
of the first ministers in Quebec City in August and said it was 
the right policy for Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Premier Harris has demonstrated how to grow an economy by letting 
people keep more of what they earn through real tax relief.  He 
has done that by being responsible in terms of spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Harris has not blown $47 billion of Ontario taxpayers' 
money out the window like the Prime Minister plans to do.  Why 
does he not listen to the growing demands among working Canadian 
families for tax relief, instead of planning a back to the 
seventies spending binge?  Why does he not stop his 
retro-seventies fiscal policy and give people tax relief for the 
21st century? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have already started to reduce taxes.  Most of these 
people voted for the Tories in the past.  The Tories gave us a 3% 
surtax, which we took away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I gave the example of a family of four, with two 
people working, making $60,000.  They will have a 10% reduction 
in their income tax and a 20% reduction— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, we want to hear the question 
and the answer.  The hon. Prime Minister has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have reduced 
taxes and we will keep reducing taxes because we offer the 
Canadian people a good government which has, for the first time 
in 50 years, put us in the position of having three surpluses in 
a row.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast was posing

your stuff, John?”, referring obviously to child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that member was imputing that the member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast was in possession of child pornography.

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Roderick Webb, 
a name synonymous with leadership and patriotism, a man who put 
his hometown of Norwood on the map, passed away on October 1, 
1999.  Mr. Webb, the former Conservative MP for the 
Hastings—Frontenac riding, was a man said to bring water to 
Norwood homes in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Married on June 12, 1941, Mr. Webb poured out his life as an 
example in love, marriage and family, along with his wife Roxie 
and son Fred.  He devoted his life to the people of Norwood who 
frequented his small town business, Rod Webb Electric, for 15 
years.  He gave to his friends in a most typical small town 
Canadian way through the making of stained glass lamps and 
through the repairs of their household appliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Webb poured out himself to his town and his country in the 
same way.  He served 13 years on Norwood council, 11 as a 
councillor and the last 2 as a reeve.  He was president of the 
East Peterborough Agriculture Society, the Travellers Association 
and numerous other community organizations that typified his 
desire to give back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rod did not know how to give anything less than his best effort. 
Too often in politics superlatives are used loosely and 
generously, but make no mistake.  Rod Webb was legitimately “an 
inspiration” through his kind disposition and strong leadership. 
In many ways he typified what it meant to be a constituency MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courage and patriotism he displayed by serving in the Royal 
Canadian Air Force in the second world war remained with him. 
These attributes were witnessed time and time again by my former 
colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his time in the House of Commons he was fortunate enough 
to serve in both government and opposition.  Mr. Webb was first 
elected to the House of Commons on October 5, 1959, where he 
served under Prime Minister Diefenbaker.  He was re-elected in 
1962.  He then successfully held his seat in the subsequent 
Pearson victories in 1963 and 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we remember and salute Mr. Webb, we say thank you.  Thank you 
for your commitment.  Thank you for your patriotism.  Thank you 
for pouring out your life to your hometown and the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as a man who held true to the ideals of Sir John A. 
Macdonald, those of us in my party thank you for contributing to 
the history and tradition of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
We are stronger because of you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we honour you today, Roderick Webb, the collective prayer of 
the House where you once served is a simple one.  May the Lord's 
peace be with your family.

Hastings—Frontenac, Roderick Arthur Ennis Webb, who at 89 years 
passed away on October 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not have the privilege of knowing Mr. Webb personally, but 
I know the high regard held for him by members of his community 
of Norwood and throughout the riding.  It is through the 
affectionate stories of many of his friends, colleagues and 
family that I have come to appreciate his life, one that was more 
complete than many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rod Webb was an athlete, a war veteran, a small businessman, an 
electrician, a community builder, a politician and a family man. 
In his youth Mr. Webb was a Trent Valley hockey league star 
defenceman.  During World War II he served as a master mechanic 
with the 407 Demon Squadron in the RCAF and continued his 
relationship with the military long after.  Out of great respect 
for his commitment and advocacy, Royal Canadian Legion Branch 300 
gave him a rare life membership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Webb was known as a natural leader whose love of his community 
and church was evidenced by his actions.  He took every 
opportunity to promote his community.  He was an encyclopedia of 
his town's history and knew people for miles around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Webb's involvement in community organizations included the 
Masonic Lodge, the Trent Valley Shriners and the Travellers 
Association.  He had a hand in numerous initiatives at St. 
Andrew's Presbyterian Church.  A past-president of the Norwood 
Agriculture Society, he was also an enthusiastic key member on 
the Norwood Fair Board.  He left his mark on infrastructure 
projects ranging from bringing water to town in 1949, to the GA 
Brethen Coliseum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A man who loved to talk with people, Rod Webb's energy, sense of 
humour and generous nature attracted many friends.  It also 
helped lay the groundwork for his career in politics.  Rod Webb 
cherished political life.  He served as councillor and as reeve 
of the village of Norwood for 13 years.  In 1959 he ran 
successfully as a Progressive Conservative for a seat in Canada's 
parliament.  Webb enjoyed three consecutive re-elections, 
faithfully serving his constituents as the member for 
Hastings—Frontenac until his retirement in 1968. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My heartfelt best wishes go out to his wife Roxie Webb, his son

From his career in the RCAF during World War II from 1940 to 1945 
to his long standing career on the Norwood council and as a 
parliamentarian in this place from 1959 to 1968, he was always a 
helpful individual who got involved in causes he believed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Reform Party caucus I would like to extend our

Webb Electric, for 15 years in Norwood.  Throughout his life, 
Mr. Webb was involved in his community of Norwood and 
contributed to its economic and social development.  Among other 
things, he sat on the Norwood town council for 13 years.  His 
friends have described him as a natural leader, whose political

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the approach of Remembrance Day, I would mention that, in 
the second world war, Mr. Webb served his country in the 
Canadian air force, as a master mechanic, from 1940 to 1945.  I

to defend the democratic values we all hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They, like Roderick Webb, keep our democracy alive. 
Mr. Webb was never one to seek honour and glory, preferring to be 
involved in a thousand different ways within his community, 
working for change and improving society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He left the business world to devote himself to public life, 
serving his constituents of Hastings Frontenac to the best of 
his abilities.  To my knowledge, he was never a minister, nor 
did he aspire to high places in government.  Like most MPs of 
the past, the present and the future, his work was often done on

who was elected 40 years ago this fall in a byelection in 
Hastings—Frontenac to represent that constituency.  Mr. Webb was 
re-elected in 1962, 1963 and 1965 and retired in 1968 undefeated, 
which is a feat in and of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a political decade Roderick Webb lived through.  When 
historians write about the century that is just ending and about 
the political scene in Canada, they will probably single out the 
1960s as one of the most, if not the most, turbulent decades. Mr. 
Diefenbaker's huge majority after 1958 was reduced to a minority 
in 1962.  Mr. Pearson was unable to secure a majority in 1963 and 
again in 1965.  It was an extremely fascinating time. Roderick 
Webb was here and was very much a part of that decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people have spoken very eloquently in the House about Mr. 
Webb and his background.  I would simply like to conclude by 
noting what a friend of Mr. Webb said upon his passing:  “He 
enjoyed politics and life, was a community leader and just a nice 
person”.  Would not all of us like to be remembered that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus our sincere 
condolences to Mrs. Webb, Mr. Webb's son Fred and grandchildren.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CIVIL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-4, an 
act to implement the agreement among the Government of Canada, 
governments of member states of the European Space Agency, the 
Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, 
and the Government of the United States of America concerning 
co-operation on the civil international space station and to make 
related amendments to other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  When the House broke 
for question period the hon. member for Red Deer was answering 
questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my colleague from Red Deer has considerable experience as a 
result of being on the foreign affairs standing committee for the 
last six years and as the foreign affairs critic for the Reform 
Party.  He knows something about the way Canada handles 
international treaties and the signing of international treaties 
and agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station agreement made with the United States, Japan, 
the European Union and Russia is one such agreement Canada signed 
two years ago.  It is now before the House to be ratified.  We 
have had considerable difficulty with the process of not having 
any input and essentially rubber stamping that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he would compare what is happening with the Nisga'a 
agreement, the signing of a treaty again and expecting the House 
to rubber stamp it with no amendments, and the approach the 
government is using on the international scheme of things which 
does not seem to adequately consult members of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of the member for Peace River.  He is very right.  Numerous 
letters from Canadians constantly remind us that we had input 
into the treaty that was signed at a UN conference somewhere in 
the world.  We could talk about Kyoto.  We could talk about 
Cairo.  We could talk about many international agreements that 
have been signed, including the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements are done in secret.  Canadians are never 
consulted about them until after the fact when they are asked to 
ratify them.  We have some that do not really represent the 
Canadian interest.  Yet they are signed, sealed and delivered on 
behalf of Canadians.  I guess the big concern is about how much 
negotiation went on for the space station.  We do not know 
anything about that.  It was all done behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was something, as the member mentioned, that put 
doubt in our minds, the Nisga'a agreement.  That is just the tip 
of the iceberg of how the government treats its citizens when it 
thinks it can ram through with four hours and 12 minutes of 
debate something that will affect not only the people here but 
our children and our grandchildren and will result in a 
disruption in the country like we have never seen before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we take a race based policy, one that is not based on 
equality of people, entrench it in the constitution and create a 
future for us that will be just what we are seeing in Atlantic 
Canada now, what we have seen in B.C. and the comments we are 
hearing in our constituencies?  Why would we create something 
like that without clearly opening it up to the public?  What is 
the government afraid of that it has to use closure and shut 
things down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is despicable.  B.C. had four months of debate and then used 
closure.  Here we had four hours.  How can that be called 
democracy?  How can the Liberals say it is even a semblance of 
democracy?  Perception is everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They expect us to stand and rubber stamp an agreement.  Whether 
we rubber stamp the space agency agreement or the Nisga'a 
agreement they will use closure.  They use closure like they 
change their socks.  It is just the way they run this place.  It 
is a dictatorship and the perception out there is that there is a 
level of arrogance.  They will not even open the House and let us 
debate, let people hear what are the issues, and let us look at 
them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just like the last parliament with the Tories running 
things:  close shop, shut the door, use closure, do not listen to 
people, do not consult anyone and control the witnesses who come 
forward.  That is exactly how the government is operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear that as the committees travel they will not be able 
to call the witnesses they want.  It will be a select group, a 
closed door.  They will just hear from witnesses that are 
friendly to government policy.  What kind of democracy is that? I 
hope Canadians will demand the government to change the way it 
treats its citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
did not want to let the hon. member get away with suggesting that 
the Nisga'a treaty would be ratified by the House with only four 
hours of debate.  We dealt with time allocation on second reading 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member concede that we have completed second reading 
debate at this point and the matter is referred to committee? 
There are over 50 or 60 witnesses currently being considered for 
the committee hearings.  That will involve undoubtedly many hours 
of consideration by members of parliament.  It will come back to 
the House for report stage.  I am sure there will be 
consideration of some amendments and there will be a third 
reading debate.  It is very clear that we are not dealing with 
closure at this point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is suggesting that we will only debate the issue 
for four hours, I hope he will acknowledge to us that is 
incorrect and that we have many hours of debate still to go on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly it will come back 
to the House.  The committee will be a controlled process with 
controlled witnesses.  I would like the assurance of that member 
that closure will not be used at every stage from here on in, 
that we will not have closure, closure, closure; four hours, four 
hours, and that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to treat democracy.  That is not the way to 
treat the people of Canada.  They should be upset with the way 
the government is operating.  It is a total abuse of democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we are 
debating Bill C-4.  It is fascinating to watch how we can move 
from Bill C-4 to another topic.  I will do the same and I will 
explain to the Canadian public why I am doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is formalizing our commitment to the space station, 
something that every Canadian should be proud of.  Every Canadian 
would expect the bill to be unanimously approved.  Of course I 
approve of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S., Japan, Europe, Russia and Canada are the countries 
involved in the space station.  These are countries with vastly 
different political systems, vastly different cultures and 
different monetary systems.  What did they end up doing?  Did 
they end up dwelling on those differences, unable to co-operate, 
and fighting among one another?  No.  The scientists joined 
forces.  The engineers got together and divided up the tasks. The 
astronauts trained for complementary roles.  The politicians set 
aside their own agendas and they co-operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was the Canadarm, something which most Canadians have 
seen and are proud of; Julie Payette; and high tech wizardry in 
Canada.  Good solid employment trickled down to our universities. 
Professors are proud of our involvement in the space station. 
Students had a goal to strive for.  There was co-operation, give 
and take, sharing, interchange, dependence upon one another and 
looking after common goals.  That is what the space station has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we in the House like when it comes to co-operation? Let 
me talk about a brand new historic agreement, a treaty for a 
native group in the Nass Valley in British Columbia, a treaty 
that is complex, thick and difficult to understand.  What an 
occasion.  All the world was to co-operate.  We had to get the 
information out and explain to everybody in the country what it 
was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  The co-operation has been so dreadful on 
this issue that I as a member of parliament from southern Alberta 
with the largest native reserve in Canada, the Blood reserve, was 
denied the ability to speak on the treaty in the House by a 
government so intent on stopping co-operation that after four 
hours and 12 minutes time allocation was brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those Canadians watching that means debate was stifled, 
choked, smothered, shut down.  I have to take my time on Bill C-4 
to tell my constituents and Canadians— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think it would be appropriate if debate were returned 
to the bill and the topic at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty to ask 
the hon. member to try to keep his debate pertinent to the bill 
being debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  I will get as close as I can, Madam 
Speaker.  I was talking about the co-operation on the space 
station and I am talking about the lack of co-operation here.  I 
will talk about that for the rest of my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were obstruction and broken promises.  We were promised 
full debate on the issue.  I listened to the Prime Minister 
promise that. 
Is this important?  Oh, it is so important.  Full and thorough 
debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in B.C. after 11 of the 22 clauses were discussed 
and debated?  There was closure.  Why would the NDP government in 
B.C. shut down debate on this issue? Here is the reason. When the 
bill came before the B.C. public, support was pretty strong. 
Sixty per cent said they supported it.  As they learned more and 
more about the bill, what has happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Householders were sent to 534,000 homes in B.C., most of them in 
ridings held by Liberal MPs.  In one riding 81.5% said not to 
vote for the bill.  In another, 94% said not to vote for the 
bill.  Then the Liberals tried to stop travel.  They tried to 
stop committees from going to B.C. to let the public know.  At 
that point a huge fight broke out in the House.  It was a 
childish fight in my view with Reform members doing childish 
things because they were driven to do those childish things by a 
government bent on preventing that travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am embarrassed by some of the things that go on here.  I have 
to explain to high school students at home why we would do a 
childish thing like debating over and over again, preventing the 
finance committee from travelling so that we could get the 
aboriginal committee to travel.  I wish I could explain that 
other than to say that that crew does not want the true 
information about Nisga'a to come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said no to debate.  They said no to travel.  They 
said no to public input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss this issue from a narrow perspective, 
from the intergovernmental affairs perspective.  That is my 
portfolio in the House.  Just from the narrow intergovernmental 
affairs perspective, what does the Nisga'a treaty do?  What does 
this big document that had four hours and twelve minutes of 
debate do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sets up a new order of government that was unheard of when 
our constitution was put in place.  It is a third order of 
government.  It is so specific in the agreement that it gives the 
Nisga'a supremacy over federal and provincial laws in 14 new 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that in health, the Nisga'a will have 
supremacy on the issue of the delivery of health services.  That 
is a totally provincial responsibility in our constitution.  That 
responsibility is being given to the Nisga'a.  It is being given 
by the use of a phrase that is very legal.  I am going to quote 
it.  I believe these debates will go down in history as 
important.  I am going to quote the phrase that gives the Nisga'a 
that supremacy:  “In the event of an inconsistency or conflict 
between a Nisga'a law under this paragraph”—relating to 14 
different areas, health in particular—“and a federal or 
provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails to the extent of the 
inconsistency or conflict”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sets up a new form of sovereignty.  That sets up a new form 
of partnership.  That sets up in my view a sovereignty 
association.  This treaty can be used as an excellent debating 
position by those who would want to split up our country for a 
sovereignty association. On sovereignty this treaty is a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area in which the treaty makes a mistake is on race. On 
the issue of race, the non-Nisga'a, those living on the reserve 
that are not natives, will be disenfranchised or unable to vote. 
Their right to vote in elections or to hold office will be taken 
from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to my colleagues say that that is no big deal, 
that they can still be consulted.  They can be consulted all 
right, on things like the health board. 
But when the Nisga'a government taxes them, and the provision is 
in the agreement to allow it to tax those non-Nisga'a citizens, 
they will be taxed without the right to vote for those who are 
taxing them.  That is against every rule of democracy that I 
understand.  This is a new order, a non-constitutional order, a 
third order. On the issue of race, this treaty is a mistake.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and most basic area in which this treaty is a mistake 
is on the issue of the charter of rights and freedoms.  This is a 
truly debatable point.  It says right in the treaty that the 
charter will apply, clearly, plainly and specifically.  But the 
charter itself says that it should not be interpreted so “as to 
abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal treaty or other rights” 
of native peoples; abrogate or derogate, take away from, any of 
those native rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a treaty which says that the charter applies and we 
have in the charter a section that says that it does not apply. 
That is debatable and I am not sure where that would come down in 
a court of law being no lawyer myself.  This treaty is a mistake 
as it relates to the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians are great at coming to conclusions and arguing those 
conclusions until they are blue in the face.  We can hear that in 
the House.  We have complete disagreement on this issue of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote someone who I think is fairly balanced in 
perspective.  This is a journalist I personally have faith in.  I 
find this individual able to come to conclusions that are 
defensible.  He says that the treaty would accord the Nisga'a 
status and rights far surpassing those of other native bands, nor 
is that the end of it.  He also said that the premier of B.C. may 
no longer boast that the treaty would serve as a template for 
settling the province's sixty-odd outstanding land claims, but it 
is hard to believe that native negotiators in any future treaty 
would settle for less. If this treaty, as he says and as I agree 
with him, sets out a brand new order of government unheard of 
before with far greater rights for our native brothers, it will 
be used as a template and to break these agreements that were put 
in place years and years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that was a diatribe on the co-operation we have had in the 
House.  What would improve the process in the future for natives? 
Surely they do not deserve the treaty system we have given them. 
Surely they do not deserve the reservations we have given them. 
Surely they do not deserve the health problems, the drug and 
alcohol problems and the employment problems that I saw in my 
practice as a medical doctor.  I treated people from the reserves 
in my own riding who came to the hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could we have done better?  We could have looked at the 
position of how we could gain equality under the law for every 
single Canadian.  Some of the things in this treaty move in baby 
steps toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of taxation we will end up with natives who will 
pay income tax but they do not have the economic levers they need 
to become individually self-sufficient.  They do not have the 
ability to own their own property in fee simple.  They do not 
have the ability to use that to guarantee them a mortgage.  They 
do not have the ability to do the things other Canadians can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this treaty becomes a template for the future of our native 
brothers, it will be a grave error.  It is an error on those big 
principles I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking about the problems with this treaty. I will 
slip back to Bill C-4 and what I think could have happened with 
this treaty. There is co-operation among the countries on the 
space station.  They have put aside their differences and have 
really looked for common solutions. 
That could have and should have happened on this agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been an embarrassment to have to use this time on Bill 
C-4 to talk about the Nisga'a treaty.  I say to every 
Canadian that I would have stood in my place and I would have 
talked even if it was for half as much time on the Nisga'a treaty 
if I had been allowed to.  I was blocked from the ability to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to those who wanted to hear about Bill C-4.  I 
know I did not talk about it in a way that was appropriate to the 
space station, but the Nisga'a treaty will go down in history as 
a mistake.  I want 
to say that so plainly and so clearly to every single Canadian 
who is listening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was very enlightened by the remarks of the member 
for Macleod on the bill with respect to the Canadian 
space station. He drew a very effective analogy between that 
bill and the Nisga'a bill which we dispatched from this place 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think 
that if the Liberal Party of Canada were in opposition its 
members would 
have supported the invocation of time limitation on a bill of 
that importance?  Does he think the Liberals would have supported 
the Mulroney government for instance in its frequent invocation 
of closure and time allocation?  Could the member comment on 
whether he believes that the government is doing what it said it 
would do when in opposition with respect to allowing full and 
free debate and allowing opposition parties to express dissenting 
opinions on matters of important legislation such as that before 
us today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is an issue I 
would enjoy greatly commenting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did have an opportunity to review <I>Hansard</I> on that very 
subject.  I found quotations from my Liberal colleagues when they 
sat in these very benches.  The quotations were vicious and 
ferocious on the issue of time allocation and 
closure.  They called it the most egregious and worst thing that 
could happen.  In fact, from a medical man's perspective, I 
thought that high blood pressure might have 
caused mortal harm to some of them they were so upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting and fascinating process seems to 
happen when a party crosses the floor from opposition to the 
government benches.  It is a fascinating process.  Some would 
call it the brain drain.  I would not be so unkind as to say that 
none of my colleagues opposite have lost their marbles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when opposition parties obstruct the 
process.  I recognize that is why time allocation is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a 
bill that important, the attempt to obstruct travel, which failed 
and the attempt to obstruct debate, which will fail, that bill 
will be known to the Canadian public by the time we are through 
with it, I guarantee that.  It is too important to allow a 
government bound and determined to shut down debate to be 
successful.  I thank my colleague for that opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce discussion on the bill 
before the House, that is to say the intergovernmental agreement 
which is listed on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tribute to endeavours made during the cold war and which 
to some extent if adopted at the time might have put us another 
quarter century in advance of where we are now.  It is often 
forgotten that when President Nixon and Secretary Brezhnev met in 
Moscow in 1972, they did initial an agreement on co-operation in 
space research, space exploration and space science. 
It was originally devoted to the development of co-operation in 
international telecommunications satellites and their utilization 
in broadcasting.  The initial proposal was for co-operation 
between the western organization, which is essentially managed by 
an American consortium.  INTELSAT was the western organization 
and Intersputnik was the Russian organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With President Nixon's departure and changes in the Soviet 
Union, to some extent those plans for co-operation and formation 
of a single international space agency were put on ice.  What 
remained, however, was a tradition of co-operation.  We saw that 
reach fruition as the cold war ebbed and détente expanded in 
co-operative U.S. and Soviet, or in the broader sense, western 
and Soviet explorations or participation in common space 
missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spinoff from all this is of course that Canada was one of 
the pioneers in space research in scientific principles and in 
administration.  I was director of a space law institute in 
Montreal and one could see the beginnings of what may now be the 
newest developments in Canadian scientific industrial 
partnerships to take us into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could note that it is an important source of research, job 
creation and the development of export markets for industries in 
British Columbia and in other parts of Canada.  I take pride in 
noting that in British Columbia we are at the leading edge of 
applied space engineering.  Everybody knows about the space arm, 
which was developed and used in space rescue operations.  But in 
other areas of pure science and its application in the finest 
forms of communication, British Columbia industry has made a 
major contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance of this bill is that it heralds and 
institutionalizes co-operation across what used to be the old 
political ideological boundaries in co-operation with the 
countries that are most advanced in space research, space science 
and space engineering.  We have them in the preamble to this bill 
and we notice the United States, Japan, Russia and Canada as key 
parts of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our work in this area has involved allocations of 150 contracts 
to Canadian firms and universities since 1987 for automation and 
robotics technology development projects.  There has been 
approximately $2 million invested in Canadian firms for this 
particular year, 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note that a B.C. firm developed the first automated 
robotic refuelling station in partnership with Shell. 
Newfoundland has done interesting work here on a sensitive skin 
developed for space robotic manipulators and it is being applied 
in the technology on prosthetics and bumpers of cars to control 
the deployment of air bags.  We can see the spinoff from the most 
refined and esoteric form of engineering to common, everyday 
application in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Sainte-Foy, Quebec company has developed space robotic 
expertise to produce a digital imaging system for medical 
radiology.  It provides real time x-ray images and eliminates the 
need for photographic film. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, Canada's participation in this venture entitles us to 
what is called a “one rack” or one laboratory shelf per year 
for science and technological experiments and this in a station 
that has an estimated 10 year lifespan.  It will let us expand 
the work we are already doing in the microgravity field and it is 
an area for which the potential application includes direct 
connections to the medical relief of osteoporosis. 
Protein crystallisation in space provides tangible solutions for 
problems here on Earth.  The spinoff is in the direct application 
to contemporary local medicine, the spinoff in terms of 
companies.  EMS Technologies of Ottawa recently won a $9.5 
million contract from Mitsubishi of Japan to supply the 
electronics to Japan's contribution to the international space 
station.  It expects $24 million in additional orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the promise to invest in science, technology and pure 
research.  It is not ivory tower work.  In the end there is a 
concrete application in industry leading-edge technology and the 
spinoff is direct.  There was the investment we made six years 
ago in TRIUMF funding at the University of British Columbia, pure 
research with the spinoff we noted there.  In industry there has 
been the creation of advanced technological jobs for skilled 
Canadians.  It is all there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In voting on this bill we signal our co-operation and we signal 
that it is something in which we have as much to gain as we 
contribute.  We can be very proud of Canada's role in 
contributing to the science and technology of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some references have been made, in part by my good friend, the 
hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who raised what is a 
favourite constitutional project of his for reform in, as he sees 
it, the foreign affairs power.  I think that deserves discussion 
at another time and in another place.  I would simply note, 
however, that in this particular area and in this particular 
treaty I believe there has been exhaustive consultation with all 
the Canadian scientific community from Quebec, Ontario and all 
the other provinces.  As to the umbrella agreement, which I am 
not sure was used in this case, the input from scientists in all 
Canadian universities and research centres was there.  This is a 
non-self-executing treaty.  By its nature it requires federal 
legislation and the opportunity there is to present contributions 
on the specific subject of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, I have not heard any criticism of the 
substantive content of the treaty or what it proposes, which is I 
think a tribute to the prior extensive consultation with the 
scientific community.  Be not afraid, I would say to members of 
the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry conceded this in his 
response to my question this morning.  The Australian analogy 
simply does not apply.  Under the Australian treaty power, as 
interpreted, the mere fact of making a treaty gives the federal 
government power to implement that treaty notwithstanding 
provincial or state power.  To the contrary, in Canada, as a 
result of the privy council's decision in the Labour Conventions 
case of 1937, which the member opposite rightly saluted, we 
cannot by making a federal treaty impinge on provincial 
law-making power under the constitution.  We need to co-operate 
and speak to the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see no conflict here.  I heard none suggested by my friend the 
hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry.  If it were to arise, 
then the courts would properly recognize, if it was challenged, 
the area of provincial power.  However, it would necessitate what 
is going on anyway because the imperative of co-operation is 
there in the common interest, close continuing consultation 
between federal and provincial governments in implementing this 
treaty and in making sure that everybody in Canada shares from 
its benefits.

envelope a bit on this question, however, the hon. member does 
mention how all Canadians are very proud of the aerospace 
industry and what we do in terms of working with other countries. 
The Canadarm is a great example of that.  As he knows, we sold 
the Canadarm through the Spar agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What assurance can the hon. member or his government give that 
we as a country will cease to sell our industries which are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that extremely interesting question.  I do not believe that 
research has any frontiers.  The hon. member is, I believe, a 
former British Columbian.  I would invite him to return and if I 
am in town I will take him out to the TRIUMF facility.  On my 
first visit there six years ago I saw Russians, Israelis, 
Austrians, Indians and Pakistanis all working together.  They 
share the knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowledge cannot be given frontiers.  In my view, what is wrong 
with selling products that we produce or selling knowledge? We 
benefit from it.  We get into new research.  The funding we 
obtain from the sale enables us to take the research further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are ahead of most countries in space research.  It is one of 
the astonishing achievements, the acquired achievement of 
Canadian science in recent years.  It is not trumpeted abroad, 
but in British Columbia, where perhaps there has been too 
excessive reliance in the past on primary resource industries, it 
is a way into the new century.  We are ahead and we have nothing 
to fear from other people buying our research riches.  We will 
continue to do further work and go beyond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, first I 
would like to give the hon. member opposite a little lesson on 
electronic feedback.  He should not put his earphone close to his 
microphone because it blasts a hole into our ears.  That is 
lesson number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask is very simple.  Bill C-4 obviously 
draws attention to the fact that negotiations have proceeded 
successfully with a whole bunch of different countries.  He, of 
course, is an expert in international law, in agreements, in 
constitutional things and in all of those various things that a 
professor of his stature is an expert on.  Does he believe that 
the Nisga'a deal in British Columbia has been very one-sided in 
its negotiations and has totally avoided the other half of the 
equation; that is, all the people who will be affected by this 
agreement, namely the non-natives, who have been ignored?  Does 
he feel that in comparison with what happened in the negotiations 
on Bill C-4 that was an adequate procedure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am satisfied with the 
process of consultation.  I was not one of those who voyaged to 
the signing ceremony in the Nisga'a territory 15 or 16 months ago 
because I wanted to study the treaty in depth.  I wanted to get 
the actual text, the 400 pages, and I did not get it until two 
days before the signing ceremony.  I also wanted to consult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent those 15 or 16 months talking to people and 
consulting with people.  I think there has been an astonishing 
amount of input into this, including potential adversary 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about Nisga'a that may not be true in 
subsequent treaties was the absence of countervailing interests 
in concrete cases proven to those investigating the matter.  I 
get an enormous amount of mail on just about everything.  On this 
particular issue, strangely enough, we have very little concrete 
opposition.  In later treaties that I can see coming, I see the 
strong possibility of conflicts in a substantive sense between 
different types of rights and I may have to give a different 
response then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, as the consultations developed, I felt that the treaty 
could have been ratified, that is to say legislated by this 
parliament, even 12 months ago.  The government has included 
though, as a result of representations made by British Columbian 
members and senators, the special provision in the federal 
enacting legislation which replicates what is in the treaty 
itself.  However, what people do not notice in 400 pages is that 
it is subject to the constitution and to the charter, which will 
allow a judicial review and, if necessary, legal challenge if 
further points of conflict should arise that were not for any 
reason foreseen in the actual treaty negotiation itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member has spoken quite eloquently about the 
economic and side benefits that are going to Ontario, Quebec and 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to represent a riding in the province of Manitoba.  I 
am sure the member can prepare an answer for me as to what the 
economic benefits are that will accrue to Manitoba, if any, in a 
direct sense as opposed to an indirect sense in that we are all 
Canadians and we know that we will receive an indirect benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have six members from the Liberal government in Manitoba. I 
have not heard them asking what benefit Manitoba will get from 
this.  Possibly the member for Vancouver Quadra could tell the 
House and Canadians just where Manitobans fit in to the space 
agency program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is an excellent 
question. It directs attention to the regional character of the 
federal system and the fact that some regions are strong in 
certain areas and not in others.  There is a certain balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the TRIUMF project I was trying to negotiate a $167.5 million 
grant at a period when the inherited budget deficit we had was 
$42.8 billion.  One canvassed all the provinces and although 
Manitoba was not a governing member of the TRIUMF complex, there 
were four universities in British Columbia and Alberta, there was 
a spin-off to Manitoba because the University of Manitoba had 
expertise in the area and was able to offer co-operation and 
direct benefits flowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the space issue my understanding at the present time is that 
the concentration of work is in British Columbia and Quebec but 
we noted Newfoundland which has its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians benefit by keeping advanced skills scientists 
here. We find their work, for example, in osteoporosis which will 
be a spin-off activity, has a strong Manitoba component because 
the University of Manitoba is very strong in medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do find that Manitoba is not one of the leading players 
here, it will be in other areas.  Since I got Manitoba support 
for TRIUMF, I will pledge Manitoba my support in equivalent 
scientific projects there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as we approach the end of the millennium and the 
beginning of the next, there is one novel aspect of this 
legislation I would like the hon. member to comment on, 
especially since he is very well known in Canada as an expert in 
many aspects of the law, constitutional law among them.  It is 
the fact that possibly for the first time we are making the 
provision for applying the criminal code and other statutes out 
of this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I simply add as a 
matter of personal pride that I did a good deal of work on the 
substance of space research, not simply the law, and particularly 
on international telecommunications satellites.  I was involved 
in the negotiations which were ultimately unsuccessful between 
Intersputnik and Intelsat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this particular issue, law follows the flag, and a spaceship 
has a nationality, in this case multinationality. There is no 
problem in principle in applying national law to it in the same 
way that one applies national law to an aircraft crossing the 
Atlantic.  The ship's flag, the country of nationality of the 
aircraft applies its criminal law, and also those who have 
passengers of their own nationality can attach it too. Plurality 
of jurisdiction is not a problem.  It is not novel.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues, I too will certainly make reference to the 
bill that was closed down very deliberately by the Liberal 
government.  Debate was stifled on the Nisga'a agreement. I do 
not know what the reason was, apart from the fact that the 
Liberal government did not want a sound debate on that bill.  The 
Liberals did not want Canadians to hear the true contents of that 
bill and its ramifications throughout the province of B.C. in 
particular, and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement bill impacts not only the province of 
British Columbia, but right across the country.  Its potential in 
land claim settlements is quite phenomenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the space station.  I had the privilege of walking 
through the model of the space station outside of Houston, Texas. 
It was housed in a very large building as one can imagine.  It 
is several hundred feet long and several hundred feet wide. I had 
the opportunity for a hands-on examination of the station.  It 
was very, very impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about the beginnings of the space program in the 
United States of America, the roots were very much associated 
with Canada. I recall the scrapping of the Avro Arrow project in 
Canada. Some phenomenal engineering and technological 
achievements ended up south of the border. Unfortunately right 
now we do not possess the same qualities of research and support 
on a government level as we did back then. When we look at the 
history of NASA, the space race and the space industry, it very 
much has its roots here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still many Canadian hands-on personnel down there. It 
just so happened that when I was down there, a number of Canadian 
scientists and engineers were working on different processes in 
reference to the robotic arm, the technology which was developed 
here in Canada.  I saw how that arm is going to work on the space 
station. It is quite amazing.  That arm can move like a giant 
spider from one end of the space station and attach itself to the 
other end.  It can perform significant maintenance and 
construction feats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of my family works on the medical team in NASA, Dr. 
Douglas Hamilton.  He is known as Hammy down there.  Dr. Hamilton 
has two degrees in engineering and a medical degree. 
Unfortunately he is part of the brain drain out of Canada.  He 
was educated and received his degrees in Calgary.  After he 
earned his medical degree he was looking around for a job and lo 
and behold, NASA snapped him up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another one of Hammy's credentials which should be 
mentioned.  He was in line to be an astronaut and was picked as 
one of the Canadian astronauts for the future.  He was one of the 
five that was slated to go. Unfortunately it never happened. The 
race slowed down and a number of Canadians did not have the 
opportunity but he knows many of this country's present 
astronauts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at a diagram of the space station.  As I was 
walking through the station I had a good opportunity to look 
inside each capsule that will be made by various countries. 
There is no question about the importance of this space station 
and Canada's involvement in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be Canadians not so much in the station when it is up 
there but there certainly will be a lot of them on the ground. 
Canada's role in the station is going to be vital and ultra 
important.  It will provide spin-off jobs in Canada as Canada 
contributes more and more toward that endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I walked through all of the modules.  There is a co-operative 
effort on the part of these countries. Some of them were at odds 
with one another.  Russia was at odds with the United States and 
the free world.  Japan at one time was at odds with Europe and 
certainly North America.  The United Kingdom and Europe are 
contributing to this effort with a substantial amount of 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed that it is a Russian escape module, if there are 
problems in the station itself, that will allow those inside the 
capsules to exit safely hopefully back to Earth should some major 
problem occur.  Co-operation was the key to this whole affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ties are being built through efforts like the space station. 
Bonds are being built among the scientific community and among 
those in the diplomatic areas of governments.  Some barriers are 
falling down which is so vital to world peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to our own country and I see other things happening which 
reflect the opposite.  I am coming back now to another 
comparison, when we talk about co-operation and what can actually 
be accomplished when matters come before the House that are 
divisive to our country and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of the Nisga'a agreement.  Many people in the country 
would like to know the truth of the matter when it comes to that 
agreement. They are not being allowed to do that.  They are being 
denied a debate here in parliament on that very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose to invoke time allocation after four hours 
and 12 minutes of debate.  In so doing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam 
Speaker.  The member had an excellent speech that was right on 
topic and all on this side were listening raptly.  But I must 
protest if he does steer the speech away to a subject that is not 
relevant to the matter at hand.  Would he please return to the 
excellent speech that he was conducting previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure that the 
hon. member is just about to come back to the subject being 
discussed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, as to the hon. member's 
point, I am and will be speaking on the whole issue of 
co-operation.  It is important to recognize what co-operation can 
do when there is a common cause and a common purpose.  A space 
station can be developed in four or five different countries and 
be assembled in space after being transported up there. 
Co-operation is the key point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different for the people of this country. They need to 
know where we stand on issues that are important to them. They 
need to know that the parliamentary process will allow that 
adequate debate, will allow input from the opposition, will allow 
their opinions to be heard, not shut down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if that happened in the space program or at 
the international space station?  I would not want to go into 
space and put myself in that mechanical device.  I would not know 
if I was going to live or die because there was no co-operation 
on the part of the engineers, the politicians and the medical 
teams involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will flip back over to the Nisga'a agreement where it is very 
clear that co-operation is at the centre of the whole affair.  At 
no time did we state that aboriginal people should not have 
self-government of some form.  We are not denying 
self-government.  Co-operation is the key:  all levels of 
government working together, just like in the space station; and 
all levels of those planning divisions working together to 
accomplish one goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the particular case of the Nisga'a agreement, we have a form 
of government that is apart from all other governments.  Who is 
accountable to whom?  What government is going to act 
independently?  We are talking about co-operation in a space 
station.  We are talking about co-operation by different levels 
of government.  The Nisga'a government is one such level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the government is actually afraid to 
debate the Nisga'a agreement to its nth degree?  It should be 
proud of being able to do that.  I would suggest that is the 
democratic process.  I do not know why the government is so 
nervous about discussing the particulars of the treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find rather unsettling is this tendency to label its 
opponents, or those with an opposing point of view to this 
treaty, in the cowardly manner in which it does.  It all showed 
up when closure was invoked, which, in my humble opinion, was 
undemocratic, cowardly and a desperate act to attempt to smother 
a good and sound free speech debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the government, its action is no different than 
the B.C. government that rammed through the Nisga'a treaty in the 
provincial legislature against huge opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
This is an historic piece of legislation before us.  It is 
legislation that has never been seen in the House before.  It is 
legislation of the millennium.  Would the member please address 
the legislation at hand and leave politics behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must agree with the 
member that the current speaker should stay on the bill being 
discussed before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Historic legislation is important.  The 
Canadian space station is an historic occurrence. There is no 
question that the development, the co-operation and the resulting 
influence from the research that will be done up there will be 
historic.  It is going to be a preparation for greater things to 
come in space, including a trip to Mars.  Speaking with those in 
the area of research focused on that particular station, I know 
that is a very close agenda.  Maybe with some exceptions, 
probably most of us here will be alive to see that happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is another historic piece of legislation that was 
never debated in the House and that was the Nisga'a agreement. 
The government shut it down before we could get to the 
nitty-gritty, the nub of the matter. There are tens of thousands 
if not hundreds of thousands of people who are unhappy with that 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an agreement here that everyone agrees with but we are 
still debating it.  We can laud all the possibilities that the 
space station will bring to the country, if not to the world, but 
let us talk about the country because we are the ones who are 
contributing to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also contributing to the Nisga'a agreement as to what may 
come of it in the end.  As members of the opposition party, we 
have a responsibility to deal with that very complicated issue 
and complicated bill.  I do not know if most people realize this, 
but there are two books that deal only with the Nisga'a 
agreement.  It is very significant in scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember who the speaker was, but he or she identified 
the Nisga'a treaty as the balkanization of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
The hon. member speaking right now keeps debating off a very 
good bill, Bill C-4, which I believe reaches a lot of consensus 
among all political parties here.  It is a worldwide agreement 
and something that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised he is not talking about taxation, or sports or 
anything of that nature.  I wish that you, Madam Speaker, would 
instruct the hon. member to stick to the subject at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member realizes that it is the duty of the Chair to try to keep 
the debate on the subject at hand.  I would again remind the hon. 
member of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly I intend to do 
that as I do come back to the issue during my debate.  I think it 
is important to compare and compare I will do.  I know, Madam 
Speaker, that you will not disagree with that particular point so 
I will try to keep my comparisons very relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the treaty struck for the space station among 
these different countries was certainly an historic treaty. 
However, I do not recall just how much debate there was in the 
House over that particular issue or how much consultation there 
was here.  The only thing I recall over this particular treaty, 
and it is a treaty, is that the space station agreement was 
brought here for rubber-stamping.  It is all over, finished and 
done.  All the government wants is the House's approval.  That is 
no different than the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement was done by the government in the same 
way.  It was compiled with little consultation with those who 
really mattered.  That is an important issue when we talk about 
an agreement that has such an impact on the lives of people in 
British Columbia and, for that matter, across the country.  It is 
the taxpayer who is footing the bill.  It is no different than on 
the space station issue where the taxpayer will also be footing 
the bill, although with the space station there is certainly 
going to be a different spinoff in the country than there will be 
with the Nisga'a agreement.  It will be the balkanization of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I really do regret that the member for Calgary Northeast 
spoiled what could have been an excellent speech, which began as 
an excellent speech, on a historic piece of legislation by toeing 
his party line and obeying his whip to divert the debate to a 
discussion of time allocation on the Nisga'a treaty. The member 
for Calgary Northeast is well known for his interest in the law 
and legal matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a piece of legislation that truly is very 
historic in ways that go far beyond just the recitation of 
technology or the recitation of advancements in science.  We have 
legislation before us that is an advancement in human 
organization, the advancement in democracy and the advancement in 
law.  We have legislation that for the first time ever applies 
the laws of Canada not just outside of Canada but out of this 
world.  For the first time ever, the law applies not just on the 
space capsule and among the spacemen, but the law applies to any 
vehicle that separates from the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is so significant is because it takes the human 
spirit that is represented in our political institutions, and 
more than that in our legal institutions, and for the first time 
ever it has taken the law out of this world.  That may sound 
trivial to some members but it is an enormous step. Symbolically, 
it means that the human spirit has passed the boundaries of 
geography, has passed the boundaries of city states, of the 
political states of the world and has actually entered into 
interplanetary space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1,000 years or 500 years from now, humanity will look back at 
this moment and this piece of legislation, where it moves the law 
and mankind outside of the world, as a turning point in the 
history of all humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not disagree with the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington with respect to what the 
technology and the space station program will create.  I agree 
wholeheartedly.  I certainly laud the program.  It is marvellous. 
I would like to see greater opportunities in Canada to develop 
our young people in the whole area of space technology which we 
lack in many respects.  We have made some strides over the last 
few years but with no credit necessary to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that was not the point I was making with my comparison 
of this treaty to the treaty that was just drafted on the Nisga'a 
agreement.  I was also not following the party line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about what happens in the House, like any 
opposition member should be.  We have a responsibility to ensure 
that debate does take place and that there is no other hidden 
agenda on any bill that may come forward.  If the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington would dig into the short path, he would 
clearly see that there have been hidden agendas in other bills 
that have come before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the space station bill that I have any quarrel with in 
that regard.  I think it is a marvellous opportunity for our 
country.  However, when the government of the day decides that it 
is acting as God and decides to shut down debate on a bill that 
will have a greater impact on people in our country in a negative 
way than the space station will have in a positive way, then I 
have a problem with that.  I and I know my colleagues will take 
every opportunity to voice that particular opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member for Wentworth—Burlington accused our member of toeing 
the party's line in speaking to Bill C-9 at this point in time 
after his government and he toed the party line by voting to shut 
down debate in the House.  That is shameful and ought not to be 
done by a person who believes in democracy, as I am sure he did 
before he was elected to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our whip said that we would begin to discuss Bill C-4 when we 
had finished discussing Bill C-9, and that has not happened yet. 
My colleague was entirely correct in his answer to the member on 
the other side.  I would like to add my amen to what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would certainly like to 
thank my colleague for his support.  The time is opportune for 
the Liberal government and certain members, I might add, to make 
mention of issues that are democratic.  It is convenient and 
should be brought to the attention of the world because somebody 
all of a sudden is taking a right or a privilege away, and not to 
say that it should not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that applies on this side too because there are rights 
and privileges being taken away from others as a result of the 
Nisga'a agreement.  We as the opposition have every 
responsibility to bring that to the attention of others in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I continue to be throwing pearls on barren ground.  What 
we are taking about here is a historic moment, a historic debate, 
a historic piece of legislation.  We are applying the law off 
this planet for the first time ever.  It is going to go to the 
moon, to Mars, to planets all across the solar system as mankind 
advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member not see for one moment the historical 
significance of what is before the House?  It is not a matter of 
partisan politics.  Surely the member can appreciate the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have no quarrel with the 
whole issue of what may happen and is happening with the space 
program and the space station.  I do not think a person on this 
side of the House has any quarrel with the member in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cannot seem to get it through his thick skull that the space 
station is not in question here but rather the Nisga'a agreement. 
That is why I am using that as a comparison.  On one side we have 
a treaty that we find co-operation and benefit from.  On the 
other side they shut down individual rights, which has a negative 
impact on society.  The member across the way cannot get that 
through his head. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will ask a simple question.  Does Bill C-4, the space 
agency bill, deal with the constitution of Canada?  If not, could 
he tell us other bills that in fact deal with the constitution of 
Canada where the Liberal government is trying to railroad and 
wreck democracy in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a very good 
question from my colleague.  No, the agreement or treaty that was 
struck in reference to the space station is not a constitutional 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way may say there is a Canadian law 
involved here.  Maybe there is something in that reflection, but 
specifically on that treaty, no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Nisga'a agreement we cannot impact more 
seriously on the constitution than what this agreement has done. 
It is worthy of much debate in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I had no plan of speaking to this particular bill as I 
came to the House this afternoon, but I have witnessed the way 
members opposite have taken what should have been a debate in 
celebration of one of the most significant pieces of legislation 
to come before the House in this century instead of celebrating 
that legislation by an informed debate.  What they have done is 
that they have diverted the discussion to cheap and partisan 
political opportunism.  They have changed a debate that should 
have been about the advancement of mankind.  They have turned it 
into a debate about time allocation, about a piece of legislation 
that they disagree with that was debated on another occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have missed an incredible opportunity.  Is it true 
therefore that the people on the opposite side have no sense of 
the historic context in which we live as human beings, much less 
as Canadians?  Do they have no romantic souls to appreciate that, 
when we discuss legislation that is actually taking the most 
fundamental rules of organized society off the planet, that is 
the most mind enlarging concept I can imagine?  It is the type of 
thing one would expect to read.  In fact it is the type of thing 
that I did read in the fiction of my youth when pulp magazines 
and science fiction were very new on the newsstands and we could 
buy them for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member has repeatedly reminded the Chair that we are 
discussing the space station bill, yet his remarks are entirely 
directed to his opinion of interventions by other members.  I 
would suggest that the member live by his own advice and actually 
address the bill in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member will be speaking to the bill very shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I do not want to sully this debate any 
further by cheap reflection on the type of debate I have heard 
here already from the opposite party.  No, Madam Speaker.  I will 
confine my remarks entirely to the legislation at hand, because I 
think it is turning point legislation.  I think it is probably 
some of the most significant, maybe not the most important, that 
we have seen before the House certainly since I have been a 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest it really is a piece of legislation of the 
century because it talks about taking the law off this planet. It 
talks about that one giant step, not just for moving mankind 
physically into space but moving the best of humankind into outer 
space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liken it to ancient Greece where one of the things we remember 
about the time of Plato is the fact that the Greeks, in their 
city states, not only discovered and developed democracy as we 
have come to know it.  The most important thing about the Greeks 
and why they have a special place in history is that the Greeks 
discovered the law.  They were known for mathematics and for 
advancements in science, but the most important contribution of 
the Greeks was a respect for law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we could have democracy we had to have and understand the 
need for law.  From the Greeks came the European society that we 
knew in the 19th century and the medieval years, which developed 
into the modern states as we know it.  We still hearken back to 
our debt to the ancient Greeks for introducing mankind to the 
concepts of law for all people which has to go before democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we could talk as long as we want about the 
space arm, the advancements in technology and the various 
technological spin-offs.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can ever match in significance the fact that 
for the first time in this legislation we are actually talking 
about applying the laws of the land in a space vehicle that is 
moving around the planet, and indeed about all the subcomponents 
of that vehicle.  If they want to send from the space station a 
moon lander, the laws of Canada, the criminal code and all other 
relevant laws will apply to the human beings on those vehicles. 
This is the beginning, as I see it, for the application of the 
laws and democracy as we know them to all of mankind's 
explorations in space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note another incredibly significant thing.  When we talk about 
applying the law in this space station, this island of humanity 
in the voyage, we are talking about the law applying to human 
beings from different countries.  It is not just Canadians.  It 
is all of those people from Russia, Japan or whatever other 
country that might find themselves together on that space 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that I cannot name the film, but I can remember my very 
first moon movie.  I am sure older members of the House might 
remember one of the very early films where they were landing on 
the moon.  There was conflict among the space crew because they 
ran out of water, or something like that, and of course there was 
tension.  I think we have to appreciate that wherever mankind 
does go in the millennium ahead of us conflict will follow.  The 
one thing that identifies us as human beings and not animals in 
our conflicts is that we resolve our conflicts by the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this is probably one of the most significant 
aspects of the bill.  We are, shall we say, not only sending 
hardware into space.  We are not only sending human beings into 
space.  We are sending our very spirit into space, and that 
spirit is not just our respect for democracy but that spirit is 
mankind's respect for the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
respond to one thing the member said several times, that Bill C-4 
is the most important bill parliament will have passed—what did 
he say—this year, this century or this millennium.  I do not 
know what he was saying but he gave it great importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member really believe it is more important than 
rejigging the relationship that we have as Canadians one to 
another?  Even though this space station is of great consequence, 
and undoubtedly it is a wonderful technological masterpiece, is 
it more important than legislation that is pitting Canadians 
against Canadians, that is dividing up rights based on personal 
characteristics and racial origin rather than treating everyone 
equally as Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he really believe that Bill C-4 is so much more important 
than Bill C-9 which we would have loved to have been able to 
debate today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we really are throwing 
pearls on barren ground around here.  If the member had listened 
carefully, I did not say it was the most important legislation. I 
said it was the most significant legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that there are other bills and have been other 
bills including the constitution which are more important that 
have appeared before the House, but it is the significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and what it contains expands the bounds of the 
imagination.  It expands humanity and the spirit of humanity in a 
way in which no other bill before the House could ever have done 
because it goes beyond this country.  It touches all of humankind 
and it takes us off this very planet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to suggest to my colleague opposite that when 
he is no longer in politics he can certainly become the poet 
laureate of Canada. 
I would be surprised if too many human spirits in Canada have 
taken flight because of the space station going up, but if the 
member would like to enrich his personal life by believing that I 
guess he can.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more concerned about the human spirit in Canada, 
particularly the spirit of aboriginal women who are not able to 
have the protection in cases of spousal abuse and marriage 
breakdown that other women have.  This is certainly very 
debilitating to the human spirit, in particular the spirit of 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadian women, when these circumstances arise, can request 
an order to have the matrimonial home for themselves and their 
children, as well as a division of matrimonial property. 
However, aboriginal women have brought forward time and time 
again their concern that they do not have this kind of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my poetic colleague would like to comment for the 
benefit of aboriginal women and suggest how their spirit can be 
enriched by the kind of inequality his government is forcing upon 
them through the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have commented often and 
elaborately on that issue before committee.  I would be happy to 
comment when the Nisga'a bill comes back to the House on the 
issues the member raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member illustrates that when it comes to talking about the 
human spirit and trying to get this other party involved we are 
really dealing with a four-wheel drive vehicle going gangbusters 
with the brakes on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am certainly as proud as anyone about the 
international space station and I am very enthusiastic about the 
use of space and how it can affect our daily lives.  One of the 
greatest uses of space to date has been the global positioning 
system.  RADARSAT has been of great benefit to us with respect to 
to ice conditions and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member for Wentworth—Burlington concerns the 
fact that the boundaries for the Nisga'a people in the Nisga'a 
area have to be determined on a scientific basis.  I want to know 
if this member can explain how space can help set those 
boundaries.  I would like him to also explain how these 
boundaries can be set so as to avoid any conflict with 
neighbouring aboriginal people who are claiming the same land. 
Is there some kind of magical outer space area that will settle 
these problems here on Earth, for example through the use of the 
GPS?  I think he understands the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in a sense it is a very 
good question because global positioning, which is what he means 
by GPS, and also the various remote sensing capabilities, not 
only of the space station but also of other rocketry we have in 
space, enable the finest imaginable calculation of boundaries. We 
can calculate boundaries from outer space down to the very last 
metre, if not millimetre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right.  When it comes to settling 
disputes among us, when it comes to having those fences that 
separate us as neighbours, in the end it is not hardware or space 
stations that matter, but the law.  That is why I see it as so 
significant that we have before us legislation that takes the 
law, one of the best products of the human spirit, one step 
further, one step forward for mankind, one step into space. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member explained the GPS 
system in terms of global positioning and what it has done for 
our navigators and seafarers worldwide.  However, I would remind 
him that it is still controlled by the Americans.  What assurance 
can he or his government give that the new treaty on the space 
station will not be absolutely controlled by one nation, for 
example the United States?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at last we have a question 
that we should be dealing with.  That is precisely the core of 
this legislation.  What it defines is the parameters of the laws 
that apply to all members who are on the space platform at any 
given time.  The legislation we have before us is echoed in other 
countries, or by the other partners shall we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end there is one thing that goes beyond the law and that 
is the trust we share among us.  What we are seeing in this 
historic piece of legislation is a moment in time at the end of 
this century when countries with competing interests will have to 
work together in order to save and preserve the very lives in the 
ultimate hostile environment.  They are going to have to have 
faith in one another.  I admit that is probably a step of the 
human spirit that actually transcends respect for the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty to 
inform the House that from this moment forward debate will be 10 
minutes with no questions or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
are you suggesting that I have been time limited on the debate on 
Bill C-4?  That is quite ironic.  It gives me an interesting 
angle to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by saying how touched I was to hear my hon. and 
eloquent colleague from Wentworth—Burlington speak in such 
glowing terms about his romantic soul and the expanding human 
spirit.  He really does seem to want to go where no man has gone 
before.  I was expecting that at any moment during his speech he 
would be beamed up out of the Chamber.  Perhaps I could suggest 
to that colleague that we could volunteer him to be one of the 
first Canadian trial astronauts in the new space station. I 
suspect his constituents would rather have him in space than here 
representing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise to debate this important bill, an act to 
implement the agreement among the Government of Canada, 
Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the 
Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, 
and the Government of the United States of America concerning 
co-operation on the civil international space station and to make 
related amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's statutory summary states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment relates to the implementation of Canada's 
obligations under the agreement concerning co-operation on the 
Civil International Space Station.  The parties to the agreement 
undertake to establish a framework for mutual international 
co-operation in the long term in relation to the detailed design, 
development, operation and utilization of a permanently inhabited 
civil international space station for peaceful purposes.  The 
agreement provides for mechanisms and arrangements to ensure the 
fulfilment of these objectives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indeed an important bill before us.  It is so important 
that I am distressed to learn that because of the rules of this 
place and the government's distaste for expansive debate on 
important statutes I will be limited to 10 minutes.  In my 
remarks— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member knows that after five hours of debate any piece 
of legislation is dropped down to 10 minutes without questions 
and comments.  There is no limit on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That was not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that being the case, I 
wonder if I could seek the unanimous consent of the House that my 
colleague, who had prepared for a 20 minute speech, be allowed 
the 20 minutes for his speech, to reflect exactly what that 
member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there we have it.  They 
always blame it on the rules, but when it comes to an option to 
expand debate and to listen to the diverse voices of a 
pluralistic society, government members say no, no, no every 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member, in his specious point of order, suggested that this 
was simply an automatic limitation of debate.  He realizes that 
this parliament governs itself through the standing orders and if 
we had a majority of members of this place truly dedicated to 
fulsome democratic debate on items like Bill C-4, the one before 
us today, then we could amend those standing orders to allow 
members to express fully their remarks in 20 minutes, plus 
questions and comments on any matter.  We could extend the 
sitting hours of this place.  We would not have to invoke time 
allocation and closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is remarkable that this should come up because just yesterday 
at this time I was sitting here in my seat on behalf of my 
constituents, having spent much of the day preparing remarks to 
address another bill that had come before us, Bill C-9, a bill 
with respect to the Nisga'a treaty.  I was enthusiastically 
waiting, having read dozens of articles and background documents, 
to enter my comments on behalf of my 130,000 some constituents on 
that piece of legislation.  However, I was denied the opportunity 
because as I sat in this place my right to stand and speak on 
that treaty was stolen from me by that member and his colleagues 
in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Your right to 
participate in that debate was not stolen by that member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not deign to 
suggest that member is a thief.  He voted with his colleagues to 
take from me the right to speak on that bill by limiting debate 
through time allocation.  I do think that is pertinent because we 
are talking about an important treaty which I would like, 
obviously, to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty for Canada's participation in the international civil 
space station ultimately is the legal culmination of a 15 year 
process which began in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington spoke of his enthusiasm for 
the human spirit.  There was a great leader, probably the 
greatest leader of the free world in the post-war period, who in 
1984 proposed this vision of an international space station.  His 
name was President Ronald Reagan.  He was the man who proposed 
the international space station as a way for humankind to work 
together across national boundaries, to co-operate by bringing 
together the strengths of technology to further the endeavours of 
human science and the expansion of man's reach into space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how proud I am to have an opportunity to stand and 
speak to an initiative that was begun by that great leader and 
defender of freedom in this century.  I would furthermore say 
that members of the Liberal Party mocked that great leader back 
in the mid-1980s when Ronald Reagan was proposing that the world 
reach farther into space to expand our frontiers of science, 
research and travel.  They called it star wars when Ronald Reagan 
suggested that perhaps the western nations of the world should 
co-operate to find means of strategic defence through space, 
using technology like that being developed in the space station, 
to defend the western countries, the free countries of the world 
from the enormous strategic threat posed by the intercontinental 
ballistic missiles of the evil empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They mocked him, but now they stand and applaud that man's 
vision.  I want to put that on the record, that whatever benefit 
comes to mankind from this kind of bold scientific venture, which 
we in the official opposition support, ultimately came from the 
vision of a man who was mocked and vilified by members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty will give Canada certain opportunities.  We are only 
funding about 2.5% of the cost of this space station. 
We will of course have the prominent use of the Canadarm which 
will be employing an entirely new generation of robotics 
technologies, one of the very few areas of high technology where 
Canada has an edge. I hope this funding will have a spin-off in 
terms of private sector investment and development in the high 
technology field.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if we in Canada really wanted to take full 
advantage of the private sector opportunities afforded by the 
development of this technology in the space station, we would 
create a fiscal and economic environment where those scientists 
and the people who want to invest in that kind of science would 
stay in this country.  Instead what do we have?  A job killing 
tax burden which is driving away the people who would invest, the 
entrepreneurs who would finance the kind of real private sector 
development of technology represented by the Canadarm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, we are prepared to provide seed funding for this sort of 
technology through government, but when it comes to allowing the 
private sector to take over, we end up sending those people south 
of the border through high taxes.  It is exactly what the Prime 
Minister said yesterday.  The millionaire Prime Minister was 
speaking to his group of impoverished Liberal friends who paid 
$350 a plate at last night's dinner.  He said that productive 
Canadians can just leave the country if they do not like staying 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event I am pleased to see that the Canadarm will be used. 
Canada will be able to take advantage of the monitoring of the 
earth, the monitoring of crop conditions, the monitoring of the 
environment.  We will be able to measure climate and the Arctic 
ice pack which will assist navigation for the transportation 
industry.  We will be engaged in various sorts of experiments 
relating to longevity, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I want to emphasize that it is important that parliament 
ratifies treaties after debate. Yesterday we had before us a 
treaty which we did not have a chance to debate fully.  The 
official opposition, the only party opposing that treaty, had 
only four hours to debate it in principle on second reading. Now 
it has been shunted off to committee and the government hopes 
that the public will not notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because public debate on treaties such as 
those in Bills C-4 and C-9 is a very important part of 
parliamentary accountability. That is why I was quite surprised 
to see the remarks of a man I know and respect, Gordon Campbell, 
the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, speaking on 
another treaty that was before this place.  He called the closure 
of debate yesterday “a reprehensible abuse of democracy that is 
an egregious abuse of democratic process and shows flagrant 
contempt for all British Columbians”.  He said that the 
limitation of debate on that treaty was “an unacceptable slap in 
the face of all Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support Bill C-4 and this treaty, we want real debate 
on all treaties.  We did not have it yesterday and we will demand 
that in the future we have that kind of debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a rather interesting debate today.  One theme that 
keeps repeating itself and which is clearly emerging is the 
undemocratic nature in which the Liberal government is bent on 
ruling in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out, the debate on a bill which essentially 
has unanimous agreement among parliamentarians is allowed to go 
on without any opposition by the Liberals in having that debate 
continue. However, yesterday, in a very undemocratic, dictatorial 
fashion, the Liberal government shut down debate on a treaty that 
is being thrust upon the citizens of Canada in a very 
undemocratic and unjust way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional ramifications of the Nisga'a treaty are 
extensive.  However, despite the lasting repercussions that the 
agreement will have, both the B.C. and federal governments have 
refused to allow a referendum on the terms of the Nisga'a final 
agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would that be?  If it is a good agreement, why would we not 
engage in a full open public consultation followed by a 
referendum?  Why not let the people decide the issue? It follows 
that the answer is for the same reason the Liberals shut down 
debate yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is running this country like a dictator.  The 
three main lawmaking institutions of our country are the House of 
Commons, the Senate and the supreme court.  The Senate is 
unelected and unaccountable.  The supreme court justices are 
appointed by the Prime Minister and are there to exercise his 
will.  The parliamentarians on the Liberal side of the House are 
under his direct control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt will forgive me, I wanted to reiterate 
the ground rules that I laid out for this debate when I was in 
the Chair.  They are these.  Considerable latitude has been 
allowed in this debate on Bill C-4 which has to do with the the 
international space station.  There has been quite a bit of 
linkage between that and Bill C-9 but the linkage must be there. 
That is the challenge for those who would wish to use the rules 
of the House to bring other issues to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the Chair not be challenged to find the link. 
Make sure that the link exists so that relevance is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just getting to the 
link.  I first wanted to establish the method in which the Prime 
Minister governs the country and that is as a dictator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The link is that with the bill before us, because there is no 
opposition, the Prime Minister is quite content to let opposition 
members of parliament speak in favour of the bill and in essence 
commend the government.  If we are speaking in favour of the bill 
we are not being critical of an initiative of the government.  I 
was just pointing out that only exists in the instance where we 
are supportive of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of the Nisga'a agreement there is 
widespread discontent and unhappiness not only with the agreement 
but with the manner in which the agreement is being thrust upon 
the citizens of British Columbia in particular but indeed upon 
all the citizens of our country.  That is something that needs to 
be discussed.  It is not acceptable.  People need to be made 
aware of how this place is being governed.  They need to be made 
aware that solutions exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party proposes referendums for such major legislation 
as the Nisga'a agreement.  On legislation which is before the 
House today, we are proposing free votes in the House of Commons 
in which members are not under the hard iron fist of a dictator 
but rather are free to vote according to the wishes of their 
constituents.  If a member can demonstrate that his or her 
constituents are in favour or opposed to any particular bill, 
such as the space station before us, the member should be free to 
exercise that right and actually represent the people who elected 
him or her.  Free votes is an answer to improving the democracy 
of this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Senate.  We all know how badly we need Senate 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, before I leave this point, there is member recall.  The 
Reform Party has been very strong in advocating the right of 
constituents to recall their member of parliament if he or she 
does not represent their wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of an elected effective Senate, the lack of 
accountability of politicians to the people who elect them and 
the lack of free votes are all part and parcel of the 
undemocratic nature by which this government is ruling 
parliament.  It explains why with Bill C-4 because there is no 
opposition, none of these are real issues. 
It is not an issue.  But in the case of the Nisga'a agreement 
which was before the House yesterday, all of these democratic 
principles and concepts were quashed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Nisga'a final agreement, I would like to 
point out that the form of apartheid which has failed in the past 
has been used as a template for the Nisga'a and therefore future 
treaty negotiations.  To prove that point I would like to quote 
from the <I>Oxford Dictionary</I> which defines apartheid as a 
policy or system of segregation or discrimination on the grounds 
of race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement permanently entrenches the same 
essential elements as the reserve system in a modern treaty.  It 
creates permanent inequality, disenfranchising non-Nisga'a people 
and providing for a system of taxation without representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-Nisga'a people who reside in the affected area will be able 
to vote for federal and provincial representatives, but they will 
not be able to vote for or run as council members.  Band councils 
will hold most of the power in the Nisga'a territory and will be 
responsible for local tax issues.  Non-Nisga'a people will have 
no say in how those tax policies affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
have a lot of respect for my colleague but he has been referring 
to the Nisga'a bill and I thought we were debating Bill C-4.  I 
would suggest that perhaps the member is a bit out of whack in 
terms of his presentation. He may want to go back to the bill we 
are discussing at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The admonition of 
the member for Ottawa Centre is accurate and correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
would like to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that a scant two sitting 
days ago the Speaker of the House made a ruling that the long 
term practice of the House becomes the rules and we have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  And when that 
Speaker is in the Chair that is the ruling.  This Speaker is in 
the Chair and this Speaker will tell members exactly what is 
going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to discuss 
the Nisga'a treaty today because Bill C-4 which deals with the 
space station is also based on a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we discuss in parliament how these treaties 
are coming into existence and the irrelevance that parliament has 
with respect to these treaties.  It is insulting for these 
treaties to be signed and sealed as a done deal and then brought 
before parliament to receive a rubber stamp.  This warrants 
looking at the details of the treaties, in particular the Nisga'a 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement is going to build barriers and widen 
the gulf between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in British 
Columbia.  It strongly contradicts one of the key founding 
principles of the Reform Party which is that we believe in true 
equality of Canadian citizens with equal rights and 
responsibilities for all. That statement is a direct word for 
word extract from the blue book of the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-4.  I want everybody 
to understand that we support the broad thrust of the bill. 
However, we have some concerns and I have some particular 
concerns with regard to the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the priorizing of spending.  We are looking at 
approximately $1 billion.  Another concern is that we do not know 
what the actual cost will be to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that kind of money I think we should have at least had some 
consultation with regard to the spending of it with perhaps some 
of the poorer people, the working poor of Canada.  Instead the 
government said that it would be done, what it would spend, and 
that it would be coming out of the pockets of taxpayers, for we 
all know the government does not have money of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my concerns with respect to Bill C-4 is the lack of 
consultation.  Speaking of consultation kind of brings up another 
sore point with me.  The other day debate was closed on Bill C-9, 
an area in which we are looking at reshaping Canada to a large 
extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the consultation on that?  It was about the same as it 
was for Bill C-4.  Actually we are getting more on Bill C-4, at 
least on debate.  On Bill C-9, the Nisga'a agreement, we had only 
four hours and 12 minutes before closure was brought in on 
debate.  At least on Bill C-4 we seem to be able to talk all day 
because we all seem to be in agreement on it.  The dictatorial 
might and hand of the government has allowed us to carry on this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what it did on Bill C-9 in reference to Bill C-4 
and consultation.  The government signed the agreement in Bill 
C-4 on January 29, 1998.  Yet at no time did it come before 
parliament until now.  I have to wonder how much consultation was 
done there with regard to Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly on Bill C-9, the Nisga'a claims, we have had far less. 
We are saying now that we actually forced the government from 
this side to grant committee hearings in the great province of 
British Columbia, the province that will be directly impacted by 
the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we got agreement from the government on consultation 
through committee hearings, it put a bit of a codicil at the 
bottom with regard to who would speak there and what their 
concerns would be.  If they are not rubber stamped by the 
government they cannot come forward as witnesses with regard to 
Bill C-9 and the concerns in British Columbia over the Nisga'a 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying to the Canadian public that it will 
send out a committee for some hearings.  It will pick and choose 
which cities it will go to for the hearings and exactly who will 
be heard from.  If this is consultation, I have real concerns 
about where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this matter because one person who should have been 
looked at very closely with regard to the committee hearings and 
what is happening in the province of British Columbia, everybody 
in the House must agree, would have to be an ex-premier of that 
province, one who sat in government for years and was the premier 
of British Columbia.  His name is Bill Vander Zalm.  Yet the 
committee has absolutely stamped not a good witness upon Mr. 
Vander Zalm and he will not be able to go before committee. I 
think a great atrocity has been done there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for Bill C-4.  When we look at Bill C-4 and what 
property rights are protected in it, we have no answer.  In the 
same way we do not have an answer in the Nisga'a agreement with 
regard to property rights.  One of the big concerns in the 
Nisga'a agreement was for private property rights given to the 
individual Nisga'a people, particularly with regard to any 
spousal disagreement or break up of marriage.  In most cases it 
is usually the woman who takes the hardest blow.  In the Nisga'a 
agreement there is no protection there.  I have to wonder why 
there were no property rights put into that agreement.  It 
creates grave concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same in Bill C-4.  We looked at intellectual property 
rights.  We do not see where they are protected in Bill C-4 
either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started out that we would have five hours of open debate in 
the House, 20 minute speeches.  Then all of a sudden we were cut 
down to 10 minute speeches with no questions and comments.  The 
Nisga'a agreement was cut to even less than that, which is 
something that will have far greater impact upon the country than 
a space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to some government members who said that these were 
the rules.  When we were elected to the House of Commons we were 
originally sent here to help make and shape the rules so that 
they would apply equally to everyone.  Unfortunately members on 
the other side of the House still do not have this through their 
heads yet.  They have rules for some that differ greatly from 
rules for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, most people in Canada fall under property rights 
and that aspect of marriage.  There are some rights for both 
spouses in case of marriage break up.  In the Nisga'a agreement 
that is not the case.  There is no protection.  There is one 
right for one part of society and another right for another part 
of society.  I do not understand why the government which says 
that it has a caring, sharing nature has not looked very closely 
at this matter, allowed the debate to continue, and at least had 
a broad discussion with the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only the people of British Columbia should have concerns 
about the Nisga'a agreement.  It should be all Canadians.  It 
will be all of them.  It will be everyone.  It will be the people 
of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec.  They 
will pick up the tab for this.  It will not just be the people of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to say that it will pick up the tab.  The 
government has no money.  It only has the money that it can rip 
off working people.  That is the only money it has.  The 
government knows that and I think the working people of Canada 
are starting to realize that is the case.  All they have to do is 
look at their paycheques to see how much in taxes are being 
ripped off by this caring, sharing government in Ottawa.  There 
is absolutely no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the Nisga'a agreement.  Let us just see 
how caring and sharing the government is.  How concerned is it 
really?  This agreement is being put in place basically in the 
northwest part of British Columbia, but where is the government 
to hold some of the hearings?  It will hold some of them in 
Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia.  I have news for 
Liberal members.  That is a long way from Nisga'a country.  It is 
a long way from a lot of the concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked if the government would not hold some hearings in 
another part of British Columbia, in the Okanagan Valley where we 
will feel an impact from the agreement.  The answer was no. The 
government absolutely refused to do that.  I would like to see 
the committee at least spend more than four days in the great 
province of British Columbia.  I do not know if the government 
thinks that it is only the size of Prince Edward Island or if it 
the size of a smaller area.  I do not think it fully understands 
that the size of British Columbia, as the third largest province 
in Canada, is extensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For something that will forever impact the people of Canada for 
generations, the government will only allow three or four days. I 
have concerns about that.  It goes to show us in the west that we 
have the right attitude.  Once they get to Ottawa representatives 
from other parts of the country have absolutely no idea where 
British Columbia is.  They have no idea of what are the problems 
in British Columbia.  They have no idea about what the impact 
will be upon the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact I will pre-warn my staff that perhaps we 
should get a bunch of maps and draw British Columbia on them in a 
different colour so that government members will at least know 
where it is.  I have news for them.  It is just over on the other 
side of the Rocky Mountains.  They should know it well.  They 
have ripped the people off there for their money for years and 
years.  They should at least get to know the province and get to 
know that it is a large area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who say that they can accomplish what they are trying 
to accomplish in three or four days I think they should give, and 
we like to talk about space stations, the empty space between 
their ears a shake.

recognized the hon. member for Surrey Central.  I will be very 
happy to recognize the member afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very interested 
in participating in this very interesting debate that has been 
going on here on Bill C-4, a bill committing Canada to implement 
its obligations for an international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House are very proud of the contribution of the 
Canadian Space Agency.  We are very proud of the research and of 
the Canadian robotic arm.  All of us are very proud of the 
contribution of Julie Payette and other scientists.  It is a very 
interesting bill from one angle.  All of us in the official 
opposition support the broad thrust of the bill.  However we do 
have some reservations and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that intellectual property rights are 
protected.  If a company is working in space or on the space 
station, we are concerned about how that intellectual property 
will be protected.  Those issues are not properly addressed in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All companies that are doing research and development need a 
long time to do their research.  According to the World Trade 
Organization agreement that was signed by member countries, 
Canada being one of them, there is a limit of 25 years.  I think 
that is a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other issues such as whether the scientists and 
researchers will be getting a fair reward for the innovations 
they will be making.  I am interested in publishing some of my 
research as well as some of the discoveries and inventions which 
I have made.  I know how important intellectual properties are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is whether all the benefits from the space 
station will be dispersed equally in Canada.  We know that $430 
million per year will be spent for the Canadian Space Agency that 
is based in St. Hubert, Quebec.  I do not know what contributions 
or benefits that space agency will create for people in British 
Columbia or Nova Scotia, whether we will be seeing any benefits 
or jobs created in other parts of the country, or whether those 
will be focused only on the main station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area we are concerned about is transparency.  When the 
bill was brought to the House there was absolutely no 
consultation with parliament and absolutely no input from 
parliament before the treaty was signed.  When the treaty was 
signed it was brought here to be ratified.  We are here to debate 
and ratify it without making any amendments.  That is another 
major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day we all debated the Nisga'a bill in the House.  We 
were not allowed to participate in making any amendments or 
making any contributions from parliament.  That is the kind of 
transparency we see from the government in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important point about the space contribution bill we are 
debating today is regarding the mission of the international 
space station.  It is to enable long term exploration of space 
and to provide benefits to people on Earth.  What we are doing is 
for the benefit of the people living on Earth.  That means that 
the international space station is all about life on Earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about life on Earth.  Life on Earth is so important 
that all of us are talking about it.  The other day when we 
debated the Nisga'a bill in the House we saw how the government 
invoked closure and did not let us raise a voice on it.  That is 
the life we are talking about.  That is the lack of understanding 
we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing wrong with what we want to debate. 
We are saying that all Canadians are equal and that all Canadians 
should be treated equally.  Is there anything wrong with that? 
Absolutely not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to say that there should be a new start for aboriginal 
people in Canada.  We want aboriginal people to be full and equal 
participants in Canadian society. There is nothing wrong in that. 
We want aboriginal women to be full and equal partners both on 
reserve and off reserve.  There is nothing wrong in that.  We 
want aboriginal families to be protected by the same law that 
governs non-aboriginal families. Is there anything wrong in that? 
There is nothing wrong in that.  That is the life in Canada we 
are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want aboriginal people to have the same rights and 
protections that every Canadian enjoys.  We want to eliminate the 
discriminatory barriers that have widened the gulf between 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people for a long long time.  We 
want to ensure that the native governments are fully accountable 
to grassroots natives.  We want to ensure that a bright future is 
there for all Canadians regardless of the colour of their skin or 
their origin.  Is there anything wrong in that? That is the life 
in Canada we are talking about.  That is the life on this planet 
we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members invoked closure on the bill.  They did 
not let us raise our voice.  If I look at the record of how 
debate was shut down in parliament by the Tory government, it 
took eight years for it to reach the level of 50 closures on 
debate.  It took only five years for the Liberal government to 
reach the level of 50 closures on debate, up until March 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how the government can shut down debate on 
an important issue.  The Nisga'a treaty is the most important 
treaty the government has signed in this century and it invoked 
closure on it.  It did not let us debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some important statements made by members on the 
other side concerning closure when they were the official 
opposition.  When in opposition the current government House 
leader spoke differently about time allocation.  He said:  “I am 
shocked. Perhaps I should not be shocked.  This government has 
used closure on dozens of occasions.  This is just terrible. This 
time we are talking about a major piece of legislation”. He was 
talking about a particular debate in the House on November 16, 
1992.  This is recorded in <I>Hansard</I> on page 13,451. He said: 
“Shame on those Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the present government House leader said when he 
was in the official opposition. If I repeat his comments back to 
him, what would he say now?  Is he not ashamed of himself when he 
invokes time allocation on the debate of these important issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about another prominent member who is now the 
foreign affairs minister.  He said this in reference to closure 
in a Toronto <I>Star</I> article on April 1, 1993:  “It displays 
the utter disdain with which the government treats the Canadian 
people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the present Deputy Speaker was in opposition he said: “The 
government is using time allocation once again on this bill. Just 
to remind the House and the Canadian public of the draconian 
approach this government takes to dealing with legislation in the 
House, closure has been used 15 times in parliament since—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  With the greatest of respect for the Chair, I came in 
here with great interest to hear about the most revolutionary 
technically advanced project human beings have ever seen.  I 
understand the member tries to draw certain parallels but for the 
last 10 minutes he has been drawing upon closure as opposed to 
telling us about this project or some of the concerns he might 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
hon. member, and I believe the Speaker who was here earlier today 
used the word ingenuity, to link whatever the member wants to say 
to the bill now before the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am debating the bill 
before the House, Bill C-4.  It is an important bill because we 
are signing a treaty dealing with the international space 
station.  We want to make sure that we put forward our 
commitments and meet them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had absolutely no input on the treaty.  The people of Canada, 
through their elected representatives, were shut down by the 
government.  That is why I have to talk about it.  The Liberals 
shut down the debate on the Nisga'a treaty which was another 
important bill.  We are dealing with the most important issues of 
the century and we are not allowed to talk about them.  When the 
treaty was to be debated in the British Columbia legislature, the 
government did not let the members talk.  The NDP rammed the 
treaty through.  That is why we are debating this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who sits on the other side of the House, when 
his party was in opposition, knew about closure.  Why is his 
party doing it again? 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I do 
not want to take the 10 minutes.  I will only take two or three 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament who studied and practised in the field 
of engineering, it is absolutely fantastic that Canada is 
participating in such a venture.  It speaks volumes for the kind 
of leadership the Department of Industry and its minister have 
provided in the House, across Canada and on the international 
scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a historic moment for all Canadians to see the 
co-operation between two previous arch enemies, the United States 
and Russia, as well as Japan and other countries, in order to 
advance the best interests of mankind and womankind.  We should 
be celebrating.  We should be talking about all of the positive 
things that will come out of such a terrific co-operative 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing my colleagues from the opposition speak one after 
the other, they are in support of the bill because none of them 
spoke against the bill per se.  That is very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has some concerns about consultation.  My 
understanding is this bill, like every other bill, will go to a 
committee.  At that time anybody can make positive or negative 
suggestions about the bill. In the same kind of spirit, when the 
government introduces a bill it receives those recommendations 
and comments at the committee level, where the proper 
consultation and discussion will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, to trash a bill that is an implementation of an 
agreement between different partners who are going to outer space 
for the benefit of this planet is highly unfair. It is not 
serving the purpose of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that we will let this bill pass as quickly as 
possible so we can show our partners how serious we are about 
ensuring that the best interests of not only our planet, but of 
outer space are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The question is on 
the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK227">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me 
to have the opportunity to speak at second reading on Bill C-5, 
an act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House builds on success and will ensure the 
continued high performance of one of the government's most 
successful initiatives.  Bill C-5, an act to make the Canadian 
Tourism Commission a crown corporation, is a natural and a 
necessary evolution of the tourism commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 when the commission was first established, the 
government had very high hopes for it.  Those hopes have not only 
been met, they have been exceeded.  On every measure the 
commission has performed exceptionally well.  It is a superb 
example of the benefits that can result when there is a genuine 
partnership between government and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission has developed and sustained effective 
co-operation among federal, provincial, territorial and business 
partners.  It shows how well national and regional policy 
objectives can be harmonized with business goals to the benefit 
of all participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 confirms the government's willingness and desire to 
work in partnership with different sectors of Canadian society 
and the economy as well.  Our government sees the creation of a 
harmonious co-operative relationship among these partners as an 
excellent way for us to work together as a nation to address 
social, cultural and economic issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the House can attest to the fact that every 
region of our country benefits from tourism.  Let me say it has a 
pan-Canadian flavour and has immediate impact on most of the 
economies in terms of financial gain from coast to coast to 
coast, to the northern part of our country and among Canada's 
first nations people as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as producing direct local and regional economic 
benefits, tourism is important to the national economy as a 
whole.  In 1998 it generated more than $19 billion to Canada's 
GDP.  It contributes significantly to employment in parts of the 
country where other jobs are often scarce.  It has come to 
generate both employment and spin-off economic benefits for first 
nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the industry consists mainly of small and medium size 
businesses, the legislation will further the government's 
commitment to encourage the small business sector, 
entrepreneurial development and of course, job creation.  Tourism 
by and large is an environmentally friendly industry and operates 
in a manner that is consistent with the government's commitment 
to a clean and safe environment.  An industry that provides so 
much on so many fronts deserves the attention and support of this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are at another juncture in the evolution of the course 
that was set by the Prime Minister and the cabinet in 1995 when 
the tourism commission was first established.  Its current status 
as a special operating agency of the Department of Industry 
imposes legal and administrative restrictions which now prevent 
it from achieving its maximum potential and effectiveness. 
Establishing the commission as a special operating agency was a 
necessary first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the country's tourism industry has matured, so has the 
commission. The time has come for parliament to create a 
corporation with the authority and the tools at its disposal to 
be fully responsive to the needs of this diverse growing and 
dynamic sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years it has become apparent that the 
commission should function as a fully integrated business entity 
with the capacity to make its own decisions, set its own business 
priorities and move more quickly to implement them.  Making the 
commission a crown corporation will give it the legal, financial, 
managerial, administrative and policy-making flexibility it needs 
to work with its partners more adequately and more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the creation of the Canadian Tourism Commission, Canadian 
efforts to market Canada as a tourist destination were fragmented 
among many players: the federal government, provincial and 
territorial governments, and the tourism industry itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal activities were divided among the tourism branch of the 
Department of Industry, the three regional agencies of Western 
Economic Diversification, Canada Economic Development for the 
Regions of Quebec and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, 
and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of the Prime Minister in 1994, the Hon. Judd 
Buchanan studied the industry and its administrative structure. 
Mr. Buchanan recommended the creation of the commission on which 
tourism industry leaders as well as senior officials from the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments would be 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Established by order in council, the CTC board was given broad 
authority to plan, direct, manage and implement programs to 
generate and promote tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's first business plan recognized the absolute 
necessity of bringing together the very wide range of the 
organizations, groups and individuals involved in tourism. The 
key to success, which has been achieved, was to facilitate 
partnering and co-ordination among the various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-ordination of the various interests was brought about by 
ensuring that all stakeholders were represented on the board. The 
CTC then set up a structure of partnering committees.  These 
committees are led by the private sector and are responsible for 
individual program areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are committees for the Canadian market, the U.S. leisure 
and travel market, business travel, European, Asia-Pacific and 
Latin American markets.  There is also a committee on products 
and on research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's marketing programs include the development and 
maintenance of data on markets of opportunity, advertising, 
public relations, promotional projects, media relations, travel 
trade development and co-operative buy-in initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the CTC has a number of industry competitiveness 
programs.  These include industry assessment on the structure and 
performance of the tourism industry and its subsectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the CTC offers program development services such as 
how-to manuals, seminars, consultations and advice, study and 
interpretation of developments in the domestic and international 
markets.  Analysis of this information is provided to members of 
the industry who also receive information on industry activity, 
revenues, capacity and tourism consumption on specific products 
and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across the country and members in the House may be 
asking themselves the question as to why the CTC should be turned 
into a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the member, and rightly so because he asked the 
question, that the commission's work is so closely tied into the 
private sector that it is necessary for it to be able to operate 
in a more businesslike way, I emphasize, and that it have the 
administrative flexibility to function more effectively as a 
partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its unique public-private collaboration has delivered valuable 
tourism marketing and information sharing initiatives that have 
helped rejuvenate the tourism sector and indeed Canada's appeal 
as a tourism destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond more adequately to the needs of its private sector 
partners, the commission now needs the independence of an 
organization that can operate at arm's length from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its new structure as a crown corporation will improve the 
Canadian Tourism Commission's ability to work with the provinces 
and the tourism ministry and allow it to attract professional 
staff from the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While an arm's length relationship would be created, members of 
the House should understand that oversight and the ultimate 
accountability will rest with the government, as it does with any 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, the Minister of Industry would have the power of 
direction and would retain policy responsibility for tourism. 
Also, the minister would be able to exercise an appropriate 
degree of influence over the corporation through the annual 
appropriations process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the bill attempts to balance two factors.  On 
the one hand, the agency needs to be, and seen to be, at arm's 
length from the government.  On the other hand, the government's 
right to insist on meaningful reporting and accountability for 
the current expenditure of more than $65 million in federal 
appropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be aware that the proposed legislation ensures, 
and I emphasize ensures, that the mandate of the new corporation 
continues to be explicitly focused on research and marketing. The 
bill also makes it very clear that the corporation would have no 
power to engage in any tourism development activities.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prohibition on getting involved in tourism development 
activities ensures that the corporation does not overstep the 
jurisdiction of its provincial and territorial government 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prohibition also keeps in the public sector, where it 
properly belongs, the use of government authority for such things 
as investment incentives and the managing of infrastructure 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's overall operations will continue to be funded 
through a mix of federal appropriations and spending by other 
partners.  The commission will explore revenue generating 
opportunities and will receive increased funds year after year 
from its partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the government currently provides $65 
million in appropriations.  Contributions from its partners in 
dollars and services were valued at $85 million in 1998-99.  This 
is another illustration of the success of the commission because 
the government's original goal over the medium term was to have 
the commission partners contribute $50 million per year to 
sustain a joint marketing budget of approximately $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know that the bill is a result of extensive 
consultation with all the participants, and that includes the 
staff and unions.  With the changeover to crown corporation 
status, the employees would come under the Canada Labour Code and 
the corporation would administer its own pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the appropriate measures will be taken to to ensure the 
transfer the cumulative public service pension contributions by 
employees who will not be affected negatively in their transfer 
to the crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to assure hon. members that the corporation will be 
subject to the usual federal statutes such as the Official 
Languages Act, the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that although we are proposing the creation 
of a new crown corporation, we are not creating a new and large 
bureaucracy.  In fact, the current staff complement of 
approximately 140 would not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take this opportunity to point out the professional and 
highly dedicated staff that have contributed so significantly to 
the success of the work of the commission over the last five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the commission was established, Canada has steadily moved 
up in the global rankings as a tourism destination, and now ranks 
eight.  The benefits of this increased number of visitors have 
affected every region of our country, each of which has 
experienced significant revenue growth over the last five years. 
In Canada, tourism is definitely considered big business 
nowadays. It injected more than $47 billion into the economy last 
year. That is up 7% from 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry is also a great job generator.  From 1994 to 1998, 
direct employment in this industry has grown faster than the 
national average.  Some 44,000 direct jobs have been created and 
the employment of more than 500,000 persons is linked to this 
specific sector. Forecasts for job growth in this sector are very 
impressive.  Between 120,000 and 130,000 new jobs are expected as 
a result of tourism between now and the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission is a success story in every 
respect.  Its current evolution to a crown corporation will 
strengthen it.  If the international tourism industry continues 
to grow at current rates, Canada's goal to grow with it is very 
realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is an industry on the move, both in Canada and around 
the world.  More people than ever before are travelling both 
domestically and abroad, from affluent baby boomers in North 
America and Europe to the growing middle classes in developing 
regions like southeast Asia and Latin America, are spending more 
money on leisure activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, tourism is one of the world's fastest growing 
industries, accounting for $444 billion U.S. internationally in 
annual revenues.  This figure is expected to grow at an annual 
rate of 7% over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada achieves just a 1% increase in the share of 
international arrivals, it would mean:  6 million more visitors 
to Canada; $5 billion more in revenues; and 158,000 new jobs.

striking the right public and private balance, government and 
industry can work together to improve the performance of a sector 
of our economy.  The legislation will allow the commission to 
really take the reins and move forward with its leadership in 
Canada's tourism sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, we have a winner on our hands. The bill 
before us is designed to capitalize on this success and ensure an 
even greater degree of success of the Canadian Tourism Commission 
over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all members of the House to give their 
enthusiastic support to the legislation and help make Canada a 
destination of first choice for all travellers.  Let us make 
Canada not only the place to be but the place to visit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy today to debate Bill C-5, a bill that was first 
introduced in the last session.  It is entitled an act to 
establish the Canadian Tourism Commission.  If the bill passes it 
will take the existing Canadian Tourism Commission, which is part 
of Industry Canada at the moment, and give it crown corporation 
status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that arises immediately, and I think the 
parliamentary secretary raised it as well, is whether a crown 
corporation is necessary for the Canadian Tourism Commission.  I 
will attempt to make the case in my speech that it is not 
necessary and is more probably a case of empire building than 
real need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question we have to ask is where is this real need 
coming from.  Who is expressing it?  The Canadian Tourism 
Commission was created in 1995 to promote Canadian tourism.  It 
establishes partnerships with the private sector, the provinces 
and the federal tourism partners.  It uses the money it receives 
from the various sectors to do research and to market Canada as a 
travel destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC receives an appropriation of approximately $65 million 
annually.  Of that amount, $12 million goes to salaries and 
overhead and approximately $52 million goes to provide promotion 
and product development.  The industry matches the amount, so 
that a total of $140 million is spent annually. The CTC has 62 
employees in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC has a 26 member decision making board of directors which 
functions as a special operating agency in delivering the tourism 
mandate of the federal government.  The board of directors is 
comprised mainly of private sector companies with direct interest 
in establishing Canada as a preferred tourism destination.  My 
understanding is that the two big proponents of this are the 
airline industry and the Hotel Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I received a briefing on the bill from the CTC, I was told 
the commission wants to become a crown corporation because it 
feels constrained and cannot operate effectively within the 
government.  It says that it cannot move quickly enough.  The 
parliamentary secretary referred to the fact that because it is 
operating in a private sector environment maybe it needs to 
become a crown corporation.  I would suggest, if that is the 
case, that maybe it should just be in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience with crown corporations since coming here in 1993 
is that they can get away with a lot, but I did not realize, and 
still do not realize, that they can actually move more quickly. I 
do not think that is the case.  I think they are more 
bureaucratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a problem with crown corporations in 
general.  We believe that the ownership and control of 
corporations should be placed in the sector that can perform the 
task most cost effectively, with the greatest accountability to 
the owners and the least likelihood of incurring public debt.  We 
believe there is overwhelming evidence that this would be the 
private sector in the vast majority of cases.  Therefore, we 
believe that many of them should be either privatized or go back 
to the departments which spawned them originally.  This 
particular one wants to spawn out of the Department of Industry 
and become a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the privatization of a number of crown corporations 
in the past, including CN Rail, Air Canada, Petro-Canada and many 
others.  Quite frankly, I do not think that the public has 
noticed that there is any huge problem with those privatizations. 
CN Rail used to lose about $2 billion or $3 billion a year on 
average and was a drain on the public treasury.  A crown 
corporation that contributed to the national debt of some $575 
billion that we still have is now doing very well in the private 
sector. 
We hear about the merging of two airlines, and they are also 
making money.  PetroCan, no longer constrained by being an agency 
of government, is also doing a lot of work and doing well at the 
oil field in Hibernia.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no good reason to have crown corporations.  They should 
be converted to private sector institutions or left with the 
department they are currently in so we would have better 
accountability to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be opposing this bill.  We feel there is no good reason 
to give the Canadian Tourism Commission crown corporation status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Department of Industry issued a paper which 
supports the rapid divestiture of crown assets.  This makes me 
wonder why the department is sponsoring this bill in the first 
place.  It seems to be in direct contradiction to the way the 
Department of Industry is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer listeners to a paper entitled “Canada in the 21st 
Century—Institutions and Growth—Framework Policy as a Tool of 
Competitive Advantage for Canada” by Ronald Daniels of the 
University of Toronto.  The author argues that a key component of 
competitive policy and institutional environment is the 
minimization of state ownership in a productive sector of the 
economy.  Is that not a direct contradiction to what the 
government wants to do with this tourism agency by turning it 
into a crown corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comparison to other OECD countries, Canada has had 
historically high levels of state ownership.  I know this goes 
back a few years, but I think it is still very relevant.  In 1986 
the Economic Council of Canada reported that government-owned and 
controlled companies accounted for 26% of the net fixed assets of 
all Canadian corporations in 1983.  Yet, these firms accounted 
for less than 5% of the total employment of the country.  That 
does not say very much for the employment creation capabilities 
of government-owned companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations are often unaccountable.  My experience since 
1993, being the critic for our party for international trade and 
having to deal with the Export Development Corporation, for 
example, has not been good.  I would suggest they have been 
basically bad experiences.  I feel that accountability is simply 
not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we try to get information about how taxpayers' money is 
being spent we get the runaround.  It is a vicious circle.  If we 
ask the minister, he says that the entity is at arm's length from 
him.  He is not responsible.  If we try to go to the crown 
corporation, it will plead that the confidentiality of its 
private or commercial stakeholders will be compromised if 
specific monetary information is released.  Getting information 
from crown corporations ends up being an exercise in futility.  I 
suggest this would be no different.  There is no reason to 
believe it would be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a division within Industry Canada, the CTC is accountable 
directly to the minister and the minister is accountable to 
parliament.  That is the way it should be.  Either that or the 
commission should be privatized.  It should not become a crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suspect that the cost of running the CTC as a crown 
corporation is going to be higher than it is now.  The briefing I 
received suggested that moving the operation to Toronto is a 
possibility.  I can just picture it.  Instead of taking up a 
floor in the C.D. Howe Building at Industry Canada, which is 
across the street, the commission will need some prominent 
downtown real estate in Toronto at top dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salaries will have to go up.  To buy a house in Toronto costs 
twice as much as anywhere else, and then there is the matter of 
moving and relocating costs for 62 people.  It is empire building 
and it certainly will not be cheap.  I am sure the emotional cost 
to all families involved will also be a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that empire building is what tends to happen within 
crown corporations.  In my view and in the view of our party we 
should be getting rid of the few crown corporations that are left 
rather than adding more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is a very important industry.  Canada is a spectacular 
tourist destination and the Reform Party believes that we should 
promote Canada as a travel destination.  Tourism is a big 
industry for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A trip through Jasper or Banff national parks in my home 
province of Alberta in the summertime, or anytime for that 
matter, is an experience in itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very busy areas.  It is hard to get hotel rooms. 
People from all over the country want to come to visit the 
majesty that is ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact Canada is the 12th largest tourist destination.  Last 
year tourism generated jobs at twice the pace of most Canadian 
businesses.  It also generated $44 billion in revenue for the 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A press release issued by the CTC states that international 
travel numbers for the first three months of 1999 indicate that 
this year may well be another record-breaking year for the 
Canadian tourism industry.  Compared with the same period in 
1998, international tourists have made 11% more trips to Canada 
of more than one night's stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the low Canadian dollar is probably responsible 
for a big part of that, but we need all the help we can get to 
balance the service sector because a lot of Canadians also travel 
outside Canada, especially in the winter months when the 
snowbirds head to Florida and Arizona.  However, I am happy to 
report that there are a lot of tourists coming to Canada, for 
whatever reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada needs tourism and that we should market 
our wonderful country abroad, but it is not clear that we need a 
crown corporation to carry out that activity.  Therefore, my 
colleagues and I in the Reform Party will be voting against this 
bill.  We will be voting for Canada as a tourist destination.  We 
see no compelling need for a crown corporation.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK234">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-5, an 
act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is now my turn to speak to Bill C-5.  I do not think 
I will have time to finish before members are called in for the 
vote, but I would like to say that the Bloc Quebecois, for 
different reasons from those of the Reform Party—and I think the 
Reform Party will probably vote against this bill unless things 
change during consideration in committee—will vote against this 
bill.  I will try to explain our reasons for opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining our position, I would like to draw a 
comparison with other bills now before the House—the first one 
that comes to mind is the one on the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the government decides to indicate a direction without 
even legislating.  In other cases, as we saw this morning, the 
House is not consulted until many years later, sometimes after 
an international treaty had been signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that people are very clear, in this case, the Canadian 
Tourism Commission—because there is one—was established in 1995, 
and the purpose of this bill is to consolidate, as it were, 
something that already exists, something that was established by 
ministerial order a few years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an odd way of going about things to ask us to pass 
legislation after a number of things have already been done with 
respect to tourism.  The question that comes to mind is this: 
why on earth use a bill now to create this crown corporation in 
order to make official what already exists? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the bill and examine the difference between the 
mandate the government wants to give the future Canadian Tourism 
Commission and the mandate of the former Canadian Tourism 
Commission, it becomes clear that this is a visibility 
operation.  It is an opportunity for the government to promote 
Canadian unity by talking about Canadian unity and the integrity 
of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of the previous commission was clear.  It was short, 
but it was clear. The mission statement read “Canada's tourism 
industry will deliver world-class cultural and leisure 
experiences year-round, while preserving and sharing Canada's 
clean, safe and natural environments. The industry will be 
guided by the values of respect, integrity and empathy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also mention of promoting the growth and profitability 
of the Canadian tourist industry.  That makes sense, since we 
are talking about promoting tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the mission of the new commission?  The bill says it 
all.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identify and integrity of Canada; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrific.  There is a huge difference.  There is no more talk of 
promoting tourism or organizing activities.  There is nothing of 
the sort.  There is no talk of profitability either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little further along, it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas it is desirable to strengthen Canada's commitment to 
Canadian tourism by establishing a Tourism Commission that would 
work with the governments of the provinces and the territories 
and the Canadian tourism industry to promote the interests of 
that industry and to market Canada as a desirable tourist 
destination— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall the first paragraph, which provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identity and integrity of Canada; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to use tourism for political ends, to 
make political propaganda.  That is the intent of this bill.  It 
is consistent with a certain view.  We can see the reactions of 
the Liberal members opposite.  They are beginning to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague spoke a bit about this government's 
approach.  It creates government agencies to control the 
information it intends to give us elected representatives.  We 
have a mandate here in the House to question the Minister of 
Industry, who will be responsible for this commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can guess in advance what the answer will be. The minister 
will say “This commission must report to me.  Unfortunately, 
before we can answer your question, you must wait for the end of 
the fiscal year, in a few months, after the commission has 
tabled its annual report.  I encourage you to contact the 
commission directly.  Perhaps it will supply you with some 
answers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are familiar with this kind of commission.  As soon as 
economic activity is involved, the answer is “Given the 
commercial aspect, it may be our duty not to disclose all the 
findings of marketing and feasibility studies and so on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite naturally, this commission will hide behind the secrecy 
relating to commercial practices.  We are familiar with that. 
It has been going on as long as we have had this government, and 
the Department of Industry specializes in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are grounds for concern.  We are not always in agreement 
with the Reformers, even if we share the same side of the House. 
We are in agreement with them on this, however.  We are 
concerned about this, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The are other examples.  The millennium scholarship foundation 
is not over with yet.  When the government cannot do what it 
wants directly, when it wants to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions, then it sets up an agency, a foundation, to try 
and give scholarships directly to students.  For what purpose? 
To hand out nice cheques with a maple leaf on them, to mark the 
millennium.  We must never forget that maple leaf.  People need 
to know that the money came from the federal government.  That 
is one of the goals: visibility, seeking a high profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also created the society for health research and 
innovation. 
Same thing again.  Health is a provincial jurisdiction.  Because 
it cannot interfere too directly, the federal government does so 
through a foundation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The universities, which normally come under provincial 
jurisdiction, are invited to apply for subsidies. Once again, 
the government is doing indirectly what it cannot do directly. 
More and more, it is interfering in provincial jurisdictions. 
Why? Because the government is looking for visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has confirmed that he has even more 
money than he thought he would.  Money is flowing in from 
everywhere and has to be distributed.  If only this money could 
be returned to the provinces through transfer payments. This is 
how it could be done. 
No; the government continues to cut, or maintain cuts—it is all 
in the wording and is developing new programs.  This bill is 
more of the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is trying to replace the old commission 
with a new one, with a stronger mandate for purposes of 
visibility and political propaganda, what is it doing?  It is 
taking back money earmarked—I am not inventing this, it is to be 
found in the budget—for a subsidiary tourism agreement with the 
Government of Quebec. The amount involved is $700,000. This 
year, not a red cent is earmarked for that agreement; everything 
has been cut.  Why?  Beacause the Minister of Industry, through 
the minister responsible for economic development for the Quebec 
regions, told the House that the federal government had its own 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we can understand better why it does not want to reach an 
agreement with the Government of Quebec on tourism. 
It wants to keep the money and spend it itself.  Why?  To 
improve its visibility.  The same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And are we sure that the money the new Canadian Tourism 
Commission might distribute will be consistent with the 
strategic plans approved by regional stakeholders in Quebec, for 
example by regional development councils, by local development 
councils, by regional tourism associations? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Jonquière was talking about this very issue; it 
is the same in her riding.  The member for Louis-Hébert has run 
into the same problem.  The dreadful to-do over the aquarium at 
the Charlesbourg zoo is common knowledge.  We are told that they 
cannot get involved in that.  Yet this is a priority clearly 
expressed by the people in that region. 
So the question is “Is the aquarium in Quebec City really 
international?”.  Well, I have seen international projects, and 
I will give an example of one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against the people in Gatineau, who have a fine 
hot air balloon festival, but an argument for the federal 
government's giving more in the area of tourism is an 
opportunity to fly the federal balloon.  And it is not far, just 
in Gatineau.  They cross the Ottawa river and reach Ottawa.  So 
it goes beyond Quebec's jurisdictions and therefore money can go 
to it because the Canadian maple leaf can be seen floating in 
the air, and suddenly the thing becomes an international event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You think I am joking?  This is very serious.  In the activity 
report of the former Canadian tourism commission, in an effort 
to get more federal government money, there was a place where 
they reported having stylized the fine federal maple leaf and 
that it had been flown as many times as possible and that, with 
a little more money, it could be flown even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Visibility is what this is about.  The government is seeking 
visibility.  But there are other aspects of this bill that 
concern us.  It talks of 26 directors.  That is quite a lot of 
people. 
When we look at the representation decided upon for the 
provinces, out of the seven board members, there is only one 
representing Quebec.  For the private sector, the same 
distribution: seven people, just one for Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in the sector not associated with the government or 
designated by the minister, still only one person.  Out of 26, 
three will be officially designated by Quebec stakeholders or by 
the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pretty far away from the concept of two founding 
peoples.  Granted, in 1867, Quebec accounted for about 50% of 
the Canadian population, and now only about 24%. 
Normally, we ought to expect to have about a 25% representation 
still. And twenty-six divided by four is at least six, if we drop 
the decimals.  But we are down to three, and even these three 
are not a certainty, because at least one of the three is to be 
appointed directly by the minister.  It is highly unlikely that 
person would be a friend of the Quebec sovereignist regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot be opposed to the idea of a Canadian Tourism 
Commission.  What is tourism?  I have looked in various 
dictionaries, and it boils down to an activity with an economic, 
a commercial, tinge.  In the Constitution—which I look at far 
more often than the little catechism book my mother left to me—it 
is stated that all commercial activity is a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that sometimes a commercial activity can be 
interprovincial. 
I can understand outside promotion.  But there are organizations 
that already do that very well.  There is a commission that 
spends a great deal of money on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again—and I will conclude on this because time is passing 
and I know people want to vote, because Tuesday is voting day—the 
fundamental goal of this government in this bill is, yet again, 
to seek out visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of identity, what government is in a better 
position to promote Quebec's cultural tourist events, such as 
the festivals in Montreal, the Festival de Jazz, the Festival de 
l'humour, the Festival d'été de Québec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The Festival mondial de la culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> The Festival mondial de la culture and so 
forth. 
Which government is in a better position to support these 
activities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> My colleagues are giving me a number of 
examples, clearly the festivals are expanding.  In Quebec, we 
want to promote our cultural identity through tourism. 
Education and culture are important for Quebec.  Why not let 
Quebec try its luck in this regard?  Instead, as I said earlier, 
the federal government cuts funds to the Government of Quebec in 
subsidiary agreements, and creates a new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister looks very relaxed.  He is reading documents, 
perhaps his paper.  He will wash his hands of it when a member 
from Quebec puts questions to him, saying “You know, it is the 
commission we created”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will watch this closely, obviously, on the Standing Committee 
on Industry, which I sit on. 
We have many questions: How will it operate? Who will really 
make appointments? Will there be consultation with the 
provinces, and what form will it take, because this is a very 
important sector, representing $44 billion in economic activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> We are not talking peanuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B>  We are not talking peanuts, as the member for 
Louis-Hébert has pointed out.  She is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative member for Chicoutimi surely agrees 
with me that tourism is very important for Quebec, including in 
his region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important that we want to run it our way.  But it is 
not too clear whether Quebec will really have a say, because its 
participation will be reduced to a minimum. 
Obviously, we are going to try to negotiate improvements.

when we return after committee study, unless there is a miracle 
and the government occasionally dares to accept amendments moved 
by the opposition parties, whether the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Progressive Conservative Party or the Reform Party, to improve 
this bill.  But this government has a lot of trouble with 
this members need only remember the case of shipbuilding, when it 
did not let even one comma be changed.  The minister said he 
could not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to get the government to change its mind, 
even with 160,000 postcards asking it to do something to help 
the shipbuilding sector.  This government is convinced that it 
must always be right about everything, on every occasion and in 
every setting, and especially in this parliament.  Nevertheless, 
we will continue to remain optimistic and try to get the 
government to change its mind, at least on the issue of tourism, 
for the good of this important economic sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as tourism spokesperson for the the New Democratic 
Party I am very pleased to rise in the House this evening to 
speak to Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian Tourism 
Commission.  I note that we may have only four or five minutes 
before I can resume my debate tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start off by talking to members present and to the folks 
watching at home about how important tourism is to our country 
and how necessary it is for Canadians to understand that this is 
an industry which employees literally tens of thousands of 
individuals and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission was actually founded in 1992 
after an extensive consultation with the tourism industry. 
However, because it was desirable at the time to get it up and 
running quickly, both government and industry agreed that the 
Canadian Tourism Commission should be created as a special 
operational agency rather than a crown corporation.  A special 
operational agency is bureaucratise for all the responsibility 
but none of the authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission, the CTC, was responsible for 
running the programs, but the deputy minister of tourism was 
responsible for the administration.  Basically marketing 
operations had to sit around for months and go through the 
federal bureaucratic sign-off process of 13 signatures, or 
thereabouts, by which time circumstances had almost always 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could just see the potential for problems because government 
contract issuance processes are painfully slow for a fast moving 
industry like tourism, like waiting a year to improve an 
advertising contract for an Asian-Pacific campaign and meanwhile 
the Asian economies go into the tank.  Then we have to look for 
new sources of visitors, but it takes another year to approve the 
marketing plan for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very bureaucratic system.  I not suggesting it was a 
failure, but it was a very slow process.  When someone is in 
business as I have been in business, decisions have to be made on 
a moment's notice after looking at all the inputs that are very 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that it is almost 6.30 p.m. and almost time to call the 
vote.  With your permission I will resume the debate at a later 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member will 
have approximately 18 minutes when we resume debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on September 21 of this year a terrible earthquake 
struck the island of Taiwan.  That earthquake left more than 
10,000 people either killed or injured and over 100,000 people 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately following the earthquake many countries sent rescue 
teams to assist in the process of search and rescue.  Those 
countries included Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Singapore, 
Israel and many others. Sadly, Canada was not one of those 
countries that responded with a search and rescue team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually have an outstanding search and rescue team in 
Canada.  It is based in Vancouver, the Vancouver Urban Search and 
Rescue Team.  The Government of Canada did not see fit to send 
that team to Taiwan to assist in the rescue process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of China interfered in an outrageous 
way with the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of 
Taiwan at this very difficult time.  It interfered in a number of 
ways. 
It rejected the request of the Russian rescue team to enter 
Chinese airspace, which resulted in a lengthy delay of some eight 
to twelve hours.  It insisted that all relief had to be 
channelled through the International Red Cross of China. Finally, 
in a very insulting way, the Government of China thanked the 
world community on behalf of Taiwan for the very generous 
response that many countries had made.  This was an unacceptable 
insult to the people of Taiwan and indeed to the Government of 
Taiwan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only the Taiwanese Canadian community but many others were 
outraged at the failure of our government to respond.  The 
Taiwanese Canadian Cultural Society, for example, sent a very 
strongly worded letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs stating 
on behalf of the society its great disappointment and anger at 
the failure of the Canadian government to put the value of human 
lives and dignity above relations with the Government of China, 
particularly trade relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note as well that when I raised this question in the 
House of Commons on October 18 the Minister for International 
Co-operation stated that aid to Taiwan was not affected at all by 
China.  That statement is totally false.  In fact, as I have 
demonstrated already, China did blatantly interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling today on the Government of Canada to acknowledge 
that our search and rescue team should have been sent at that 
time to ensure this mistake is never repeated, to call on the 
Chinese government to stop its interference in circumstances such 
as this, and to review more generally our policy with respect to 
Taiwan's participation internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taiwan has applied to join the World Health Organization and yet 
I have received a letter from our Minister of Foreign Affairs 
stating that only if China agrees, only if Beijing agrees, would 
Canada be prepared to support Taiwan's involvement in the World 
Health Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre and my colleagues 
generally from the New Democratic caucus have called on the 
Government of Canada to facilitate Taiwan's participation in the 
World Health Organization.  We support full participation, but at 
the very least Taiwan should be permitted to participate as 
observers initially in that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to show leadership to recognize Taiwan 
within the World Health Organization, to ensure that the search 
and rescue team of Canada is dispatched in the future and finally 
to show far more leadership in recognizing—

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Canada has a 
long tradition of responding to humanitarian emergencies 
resulting from natural disasters throughout the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is done, depending on the nature of the disaster, through a 
variety of channels.  These include financial assistance, 
emergency food aid, relief supplies and the deployment of 
disaster response teams from the Department of National Defence. 
For example, CIDA today approved $150,000 for shelter materials, 
emergency medical supplies and basic supplies for the victims of 
the cyclone in Orissa, India. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the capacity for search and rescue is being developed 
within Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency is 
interested in exploring the notion that Canada further develop 
its international search and rescue capability as another way we 
can respond to humanitarian disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, CIDA officials discussed the feasibility of future 
international deployments of the Vancouver search and rescue team 
with members of the team, the city of Vancouver and the 
Government of British Columbia. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Vancouver indicated its intention to put together a 
proposal.  The Government of British Columbia undertook to 
prepare a memorandum of understanding.  We hope to receive these 
documents shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as part of these efforts, the Government of British 
Columbia indicated that it would prepare, in co-operation with 
CIDA, Emergency Preparedness Canada, and the United Nations, a 
plan for the purpose of holding a simulation exercise to assess 
the Vancouver team.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
taking part in the debate this evening because of the conflicting 
signals that are being dispatched across the way by government 
officials, ministers, and the Prime Minister surrounding the 
agricultural income disaster assistance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One movie I enjoyed was called <I>Cool Hand Luke</I>.  There is a 
great line in that movie when the warden says to Paul Newman: 
“What we have here is a failure to communicate”.  Truer words 
were never spoken when it comes to this program.  I would like to 
give a few examples to support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister of agriculture was in the province of 
Saskatchewan at Prince Albert last July, he refused to meet in 
any meaningful way with the farmers of Saskatchewan who had very 
grave concerns about the AIDA program.  When the Prime Minister 
was asked by my leader to go out and inspect the flooded regions 
of Saskatchewan and Manitoba last July, he declined that 
invitation.  So far as I know he has never gone there or flown 
over it to inspect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premiers and the farm lobby from Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba came last week to meet with officials in Ottawa, they 
were what can only be politely described as sandbagged by 
government officials.  All of a sudden there were new numbers. 
They would not release the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those numbers have been released as of today.  For the record, 
it says that Saskatchewan remains significantly below the 
previous five year average and is expected to remain 
significantly below the previous five year average in the year 
2000.  Nevertheless that was reason enough to say that they could 
not give them any more money at this point because the numbers 
did not jibe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I had an opportunity to meet with alfalfa dehydrators from 
Alberta and Saskatchewan.  These folks are diversifying.  They 
are doing value added, primarily in the two western prairie 
provinces.  They are doing exactly what the government wanted 
producers to do, to diversify, to do value added and to have more 
folks working in that part of the world, rural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International prices on alfalfa have dropped far below their 
cost of production.  The Europeans are subsidizing to such an 
extent that our folks cannot compete.  Once again there is no 
additional money for an industry that is not yet mature but has 
been growing and has had a strong track record.  We simply cannot 
compete with European subsidies.  It is another example of a 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA deadline was extended yesterday for farmers in four 
provinces, including Manitoba and Saskatchewan, who had 
significantly expanded their operations.  My office had a call 
this morning from a farm family who did not even know there was a 
program under AIDA for significant expansion.  We were running 
around frantically yesterday because the deadline was November 1, 
only to find out after they got the forms in the mail that it has 
now been extended to December 31.  They were running around 
literally like chickens with their heads cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are half a dozen examples of glaring failures to 
communicate effectively with the western Canadian agriculture 
sector.  My point is that unless this is rectified immediately it 
will result in a very large problem in western Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like 
to confine my discussion tonight to the question that was asked 
on October 19.  I know a lot of things have happened since then 
to which the member for Palliser has alluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned.  I know he is very concerned about 
farmers in his home province of Saskatchewan.  That concern is 
shared by the government.  The government understands that we 
need a national approach.  We are looking to all shareholders to 
work together to decide on the best course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food want to work in partnership with all provincial 
governments to address the income situation facing farmers in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture continues to work with concerned 
farmer organizations and is listening to their advice on program 
design issues for existing programs as well as for the long term 
direction of safety nets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has programs in place that have helped and 
continue to help farmers across Canada and particularly those on 
the prairies. The NISA and AIDA programs put money in the hands 
of farmers who are in need.  For example, in Saskatchewan 55,900 
producers have about $1.1 billion in their NISA accounts.  To 
date, over 12,300 producers in Saskatchewan have withdrawn $113 
million from NISA this year.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
estimates that AIDA will provide approximately $170 million in 
Saskatchewan for the first year of the program.  Across Canada we 
have been providing this kind of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see that when the NISA withdrawals are combined with 
the AIDA payments, the government is helping farmers through 
these difficult times.
