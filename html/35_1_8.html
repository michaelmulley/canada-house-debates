<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATEG.CAMPBELLEATON">THE LATE G. CAMPBELL EATON</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a distinguished Newfoundlander, G. 
Campbell Eaton. Mr. Eaton passed away yesterday in St. John's.
<P>
	He served with distinction in the 166th Newfoundland Field 
Regiment Royal Artillery during the Second World War and 
received the Military Cross for conspicuous bravery, coolness 
and outstanding conduct under fire during action in Italy. After 
the war, Mr. Eaton served as commanding officer of the 
regiment and later was honorary colonel of the Royal 
Newfoundland Regiment.
<P>
	He was a prominent and respected business executive and an 
energetic and devoted leader in community life in our province, 
particularly in the fields of health, housing and education. He 
was made Doctor of Laws by Memorial University, and as well 
in recognition of his outstanding and distinguished service he 
was installed as an officer of the Order of Canada in 1978.
<P>
	I would describe Cam Eaton as a gentleman in every sense of 
the word. He was a man who stood above the crowd with a quiet 
dignity formed by wisdom and sound judgment. He was a rare 
man and therefore leaves a void not easily filled.
<P>
	I offer his widow, Betty, and his family deepest sympathy.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
opposition to the distribution and sales of the serial killer board 
game has become widespread across this country.
<P>
	Parents and grandparents are asking to have this game, which 
is manufactured in Seattle, banned from the Canadian market.
<P>
	The game contains a body bag, 25 babies and four figures 
representing the killers. The player who kills the largest number 
of babies wins.
<P>
	The council of commissioners of the Châteauguay School 
Board, in the riding of Châteauguay, recently passed a 
resolution to condemn products like these where the purpose is 
to commit murders.
<P>
	These products, which promote violence as a way of life, 
should be banned at all costs. The federal government must act 
to get rid of these products.

	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate 
you on your election to the chair.
<P>
	I would also like to inform the House that presently there are 
over 500 interprovincial trade barriers which cost Canadians 
over $6.5 billion annually. These barriers make it easier to trade 
with Mexico and the United States than within our own borders.
<P>
	Creating a single economic market in Canada would help 
counter the nation's current regional drift and would allow 
Canadians to work where they choose.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments signed an agreement 
last week for the removal of many of the 500 barriers. This is 
extremely encouraging.
<P>
	The Reform Party caucus is supportive of these efforts and 
applauds the provincial and federal governments for providing a 
clear definition of interprovincial trade barriers. As well the 
commitment of these governments to the June 30, 1994 time line 
is most commendable.

<P>
	The speech from the throne set out the government's 
ambitious two-year schedule to complete the modernization of 
our national social security system and to make it more 
responsive to the economic and social realities of the 1990s and 
beyond.
<P>
	Our system was first put in place decades ago. It has served us 
well but times have changed. Canadians will not accept and we 
must not accept double digit levels of unemployment, signs of a 
lost generation of youth and rising levels of child poverty. 
Canadians realize that reforms are necessary. They also want 
hope for a better future for themselves and their children.
<P>
	I have already heard many excellent ideas from my 
constituents and I hope others will come forward. I know the 
minister has been consulting widely with provincial 
representatives, social policy organizations, business and 
labour representatives, academics and Canadians from all walks 
of life.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on September 13, 1993 a declaration in principle on interim 
self-government between the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization and the state of Israel was signed. It marked an 
historic moment for both politics and the people of the Middle 
East. It ushered in a new sense of hope to a region of the world 
where bloodshed and despair continue to dominate the lives of 
so many people.
<P>
	The agreement was the direct result of efforts made by two 
courageous individuals. They managed to overcome 
insurmountable pressures from those groups that continued to 
choose violence instead of peace.
<P>
	Today I wish to inform my hon. colleagues that on January 20, 
1994 I submitted a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize 
Committee nominating both Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister 
of Israel, and Mr. Yasser Arafat, PLO Chairman, for the 1994 
Nobel Peace Prize.
<P>
	As Canadians we must continue to play a leading role in 
seeking peace and promoting peace. In so doing we advance the 
efforts of men such as the late Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to join hon. members and all Canadians in marking 
International Customs Day. As hon. members know our more 
than 5,000 Revenue Canada customs officers are the first people 
that visitors to our country and returning Canadians meet.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	This is the International Year of the Family. Revenue Canada 
customs officers help reunite families by locating and returning 
to parents or lawful guardians missing or abducted children. 
They went above and beyond the call of duty all the while doing 
their jobs inspecting commercial shipments, processing more 
than 122 million travellers and seizing more than $1.3 billion 
worth of illegal drugs last year.
<P>
	I assure all members of the House and all Canadians that the 
government is committed to maintaining and strengthening all 
components of national revenue so it may be more responsive to 
the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	I call on all hon. members to join me in saluting our customs 
officers on this 41st anniversary of International Customs Day.

and one-third of these Canadians are women.
<P>
	I am very proud to announce that this weekend the Manitoba 
Women's Scott Tournament of Hearts will be played in my home 
town of Verdun, Manitoba. Of the 16 teams registered 7 of the 
competing skips are former Manitoba provincial women's 
champions and among them they hold 16 provincial, 3 Canadian 
and 3 world titles.
<P>
	There is no reason to doubt that this year's lead up

partners who joined forces to develop and establish a 
multimedia transaction network that will offer consumers direct 
access to a wide range of services, 24 hours a day, from the 
comfort of their own homes.
<P>
	The project is known as UBI, which stands for Universal, 
Bi-directional and Interactive. The consortium includes the 
National Bank of Canada, Hydro-Québec, Loto Québec, Canada 
Post Corporation and Videoway's classified ads services. The 
consortium will offer a variety of goods and services that are 
typical of the potential of an electronic information highway.

fellow members know, Canada has the great honour of hosting 
the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations for a 
summit in 1995.
<P>
	It has come to my attention that the exact location in Canada 
for the G-7 meeting has not as yet been chosen. As the site 
selection process is scheduled to get under way shortly, Premier 
Ralph Klein of Alberta and I would like to recommend the 
Calgary-Banff-Canmore area as an excellent choice for the 
summit. This region has gained international recognition in 
hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics.
<P>
	Alberta can also provide a vibrant backdrop to the meeting. 
On September 1, 1995 Alberta will celebrate its 90th 
anniversary as a partner in Confederation. To celebrate this 
celebration with the prestige of an international summit could 
only serve to highlight the country's strength. I encourage the 
Prime Minister to accept the invitation of Albertans.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Mr. Speaker, an issue I 
wish to highlight is research and development. In my riding we 
have an industrial research park, the University of Western 
Ontario and University Hospital.
<P>
	Long-term economic growth cannot be founded only upon the 
exploitation of natural resources. The competitiveness of our 
nation in today's global economy is influenced by its capability 
to develop and apply new technology. This requires long-term 
stable investment in R and D and strategic knowledge based 
sectors.
<P>
	Over the past decade spending on R and D in Canada as 
percentage of gross domestic product was less than nearly all 
other G-7 countries.
<P>
	I encourage members of the House to support R and D 
initiatives which will enable industry to compete effectively and 
ensure future employment for Canadians.

will remember that, yesterday, we talked several times about 
cigarette smuggling in Quebec and eastern Canada, particularly 
in Saint-Eustache and in the Mohawk territories of Kanesatake, 
Kahnewake and Akwesasne.
<P>
	I would like to point out in this House that the vast majority of 
the Mohawk people in these territories, as well as Mohawks 
living elsewhere in Quebec, Ontario and eastern New York, are 
peaceful people who are also concerned about increased 
cigarette smuggling and the violence associated with it.
<P>
	The problem is caused by a small number of smugglers who 
take advantage of the laxness of police forces, especially the 
RCMP, in the Cornwall area and the Mohawk territory of 
Akwesasne.

	This successful young cowboy hails from the heart of 
Yellowhead country, the town of Mayerthorpe. His parents, Fred

professional trick rider and is performing in Las Vegas. His 
brother, Denny, also rides saddle bronc and their father led the

Order of Nurses Week.
<P>
	For nearly 100 years the Victorian Order of Nurses has 
provided primary health care to Canadians in the home and the 
community. The Victorian Order of Nurses is a unique nursing 
agency in that it is national and a registered charitable 
organization.
<P>
	In 1992-93 the VON's 74 branches in all provinces 
contributed to improved quality of life and health for over 
250,000 Canadians and their families. VON registered nurses 
are specially trained for complex, technological home care, 
gerontological nursing, palliative care, rehabilitation and foot 
care.
<P>
	VON registered nursing assistants and home support workers 
are critically important to the visiting nursing teams. Over 8,700 
volunteers give willingly of their time and talents to VON 
services.
<P>
	I am sure all members of the House would want to 
congratulate the Victorian Order of Nurses for its contributions 
to the health of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if I might put a very small suggestion 
to my colleagues.
<P>
	I know I have a very difficult time when I have to read quickly. 
Could hon. members, if they have the time before they make 
their statements under Standing Order 31, give the standing 
order statements, if they are written, to our interpreters. It might 
help a bit in the interpretation. If they would consider that I 
would appreciate it.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CIGARETTESMUGGLING">CIGARETTE SMUGGLING</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. While 
governments are hesitating and passing the buck on this issue, 
the revolt among shopkeepers is spreading to all regions in 
Quebec. In the meantime, the implicit, albeit fundamental social 
contract whereby citizens agree to pay taxes to the state is 
unravelling. Shaken by the size of the movement, the Prime 
Minister seemed prepared for the first time yesterday to act to 
fight cigarette smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	My question is this: If he truly intends to take action, could he 
tell this House today exactly what concrete measures he intends 
to take to improve surveillance at the borders, an area over 
which the government has exclusive jurisdiction and where it 
does not need to wait for the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Solicitor General stated clearly in this House that for many 
weeks now, the RCMP have been under orders to carry out their 
duty across Canada and ensure that all Canadians obey the law. 
That is the course of action we intend to follow. There is no need 
for us to issue any additional instructions at this time. If any new 
problems arise, we will give them the resources they need. But 
for the time being, the RCMP are under orders to enforce the 
law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister indicated yesterday that after 
consulting with the provinces, he would be prepared to lower 
taxes. In light of the urgency of the situation, does he really 
intend to wait for Mr. Johnson to return from Europe before 
proceeding? What is the government waiting for to take the 
action warranted, namely issuing an immediate ministerial 
statement calling for lower federal taxes on cigarettes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone agrees that it would be much more effective if all 
governments would co-operate.
<P>
	We are presently holding discussions with several provincial 
governments. The Minister of Finance broached the subject last 
Friday at a meeting of finance ministers and we will try to find a 
solution that will please everyone. When we are ready, we will 
take action. I am very pleased to hear that the Premier of Quebec 
said he would act as soon as he got back. The federal government 
is examining its options and as I said, we want to act in this 
matter in concert with the provincial governments.
<P>
	Mr. Johnson and I have discussed this subject several times, 
even at a federal-provincial meeting prior to his becoming 
premier. We talked about ways of solving this problem quickly 
and permanently. It is better to act cautiously and methodically 
than to rush in and make a rash decision.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand these honourable intentions stem from a 
normal reflex to exercise caution, but we are not dealing with a 
normal situation. Every evening, we see on television acts of 
open deliberate defiance which foster bad feelings and entice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="383"> 383 </A></B>
<P>
other taxpayers to take similar action. The problem here is not 
just tobacco taxes. It has to do with all of the other taxes.
<P>
	Since it has not always been made very clear what orders that 
have been or will be given to the RCMP, could the Prime 
Minister tell this House clearly once and for all and give us the 
assurance that he has personally instructed the RCMP to lay 
charges immediately against smugglers when it has the evidence 
to do so?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> It is not up to 
me to tell the RCMP what its job is. This police force has earned 
an international reputation and when it has compiled valid 
evidence, it takes quick action, as it must. I do not think the 
Solicitor General needs to tell RCMP officers how to do their 
job. They already know how to do it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
beginning of the week, the Official Opposition has been 
questioning the government about the very serious events that 
took place in Kanesatake last Friday.
<P>
	The minister of defence answered that the matter was under 
investigation by the Sûreté du Québec but, as we later found out, 
this was incorrect. The Prime Minister trivialized the incident, 
saying there were no bullet holes found in the helicopter. He 
mentioned the use of a slingshot, as you probably remember. At 
the same time, we are receiving very serious information from 
reliable sources and we are concerned because it looks like the 
government wants to keep the whole thing quiet.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Now that five days 
have gone by since the events took place, can he tell us whether 
or not bullet holes were found on the CC-130 Hercules No. 
130310 which took part in the operation over Kanesatake?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
direct response to the hon. member, there are no bullet holes in 
either the Labrador helicopter or the Hercules that were 
involved in this incident.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Prime Minister agree to table in this House the journey log book 
as well as the trip reports of the aircraft involved in the operation 
over Kanesatake?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member should know that that kind of information is not 
routinely available publicly.
<P>
	I want to clarify one thing that was raised yesterday about the 
involvement of the Sûreté du Quebec. They were involved last 
Friday with search and rescue after the electronic emission 
occurred.
<P>
	Our people landed, conducted a search and determined there 
was not an aircraft downed in the area. Just before they were 
about to leave they were approached by the individual-I have 
stated this in the House-who alleged that shots may have been 
fired. They left because they did not want a confrontation and 
were reasonably assured there was no downed aircraft in the 
area. The Sûreté is not involved today but they were involved 
last Friday.

direct federal and ministerial control over the projects.

the Minister of Finance has so far refused to respond to the

does not hesitate to make statements outside Parliament; in 
particular, he said that Quebecers and Canadians told him 
yesterday that they were willing to pay more taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance: Did Quebecers 
and Canadians also tell him that they were fed up with unfair 
taxes and expected him to eliminate the family trust system and 
tax loopholes benefiting the very rich?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development - Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may 
be referring to yesterday's conference. Canadians made it very 
clear to us that they wanted to examine the whole tax base and 
loophole issue and that they wanted jobs, as we said in our red 
book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
out of respect for this House, for the neediest of Quebecers and

<P>
	It was reported in the <I>Gazette</I> on January 22, 1994 that a 
government member for Newfoundland had approached the 
minister to ask him to change the Income Tax Act in order to 
have the Governor General pay income tax.
<P>
	I have received a number of angry phone calls in North 
Vancouver concerning this report, in particular one from Mrs. 
Elinor Ryan who was shocked that not only did the Governor 
General not pay income tax but he could possibly be eligible for 
a GST rebate cheque since he has no taxable income.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister what steps he is taking to 
encourage the Governor General to pay income tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the salary of 
the Governor General is set taking into account the fact that he 
does not pay income tax. There is no net loss to fisc.
<P>
	I would tell the hon. member that I have not discussed this 
with the Governor General. I have not seen him since I was 
sworn in and I did not think that the time was particularly 
propitious at that moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
understand the minister's reticence in approaching this matter.
<P>
	Last year, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth began voluntarily 
paying income taxes. It does seem quite contradictory that the 
Queen is paying income taxes and her representative in Canada 
is not doing so.
<P>
	Will the minister approach the Governor General with a view 
to his voluntarily paying income taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

question to the Prime Minister. The Quebec Minister 
responsible for Native Affairs, Mr. Christos Sirros, said two 
days ago that native self-government could be achieved by 
administrative agreement, that is, with no constitutional 
amendment.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Prime Minister if he still shares the 
Quebec minister's opinion that native self-government can be 
recognized through administrative agreements alone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I said in the House last week was that we can do it without 
amending the Constitution. It is evident that Mr. Sirros has come 
to the same conclusion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a recommendation that was made by the commission of 
inquiry on native rights chaired by two people, a judge from 
Quebec and Mr. Erasmus, who said that we could achieve the 
same goals without changing the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister was at one time minister of Indian affairs. Does he not 
agree that establishing native self-government on a sound 
foundation requires amending the Constitution, as the chief of 
the First Nations, Mr. Ovide Mercredi, maintains and asserts?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think that there is a mood at this time to hold 
constitutional conferences on any subject whatsoever. I think 
that it would be very prudent to have a system of Indian 
self-government; after several years, we would know exactly 
how it operates and that it is working well. If we had to entrench 
it in the Constitution at that time, we could do so.

inspired by Mr. Bryan Dale of Willowdale, Ontario.
<P>
	In Tuesday's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the minister is reported as 
saying that: ``an 18-year old dropout has as much right under the 
rules of fairness to get access to a good secure job over time as 
does the Queen's University economist who is working for a 
stock firm''.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that promising a job irrespective of 
training is the wrong message to send to teenage students who 
are considering dropping out of school?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am in full agreement with the 
idea that offering that kind of job opportunity without training is 
not the proper way to approach it.
<P>
	That is exactly the reason the government is committed to a 
major apprenticeship program, a major youth service program, a 
major revision and restructuring of our employment, training, 
social assistance programs so we can get to all young people 
regardless of their status in life real hope for the future. That was 
the intent of my statement, to make sure everybody in this

things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an instructor in a 
technical institute for many years, I too value the concept of 
fairness for students of all ability levels.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister how he proposes to ensure that 
there is an incentive for 18-year old dropouts to return to school 
and upgrade their skills and thereby assure that fairness?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly look forward to 
drawing on the hon. member's experience in the educational

	It will be very important as this Parliament addresses the 
fundamental question of redesigning our training and 
educational programs to eliminate the disincentives, the 
problems and the barriers which now exist in many of our 
income security programs. These barriers provide disincentives 
to young people to get back into the work force and to get into 
training programs.
<P>
	I look forward to that member's and to all members'

<P>
	The business plan calls for a reconversion from military 
contracts to civilian contracts provides, among other things, the 
awarding of the contract to build the ferry for the Magdalen

<P>
	This plan received the support of all the business stakeholders 
in the Quebec City region, as well as of all the Liberal 
candidates of Quebec City during the last election campaign, 
including that of Mr. Jean Pelletier, the defeated candidate in the 
riding of Québec and the current chief of staff of the Prime

<P>
	Therefore, I would like to know when and how the Minister of 
Transport will fulfil the promises made by the Liberal Party, 
which claims to support the business plan developed by MIL 
Davie.

the issue of the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>, which concerns my 
department, has been pending for a very long time. Of course, 
the Leader of the Opposition is aware of that since he was a 
minister under the Conservative government when the <I>Lucy 
Maud Montgomery</I> was to be replaced.
<P>
	As for us, our responsibility is very clear. The <I>Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I> will have to be replaced, either through buying a 
ship built at the MIL Davie shipyard or elsewhere, renting one, 
restoring the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>, or buying another ship 
overseas. My department is currently reviewing all these 
options.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
Minister of Transport still try to delay the review of this 
important issue after just stating in answer to the previous 
question that the federal government has been studying the 
matter for two years already and that the Liberal government has 
made a commitment to create jobs, while at the same time 
shipyard workers in Lévis are very concerned about the 
impending closure of their shipyard which should happen in a 
few months, given the fact that preparations have to be made 
before construction of the ferry gets under way. Given all those 
facts, how can the minister explain why it is taking so much time 
to reach a decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is of course very difficult to explain any delay in making a 
decision. It is true that we have only been in power now for two

<P>
	What action will the government take to enforce compliance 
with written undertakings given to Investment Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

are reviewed, very frequently undertakings or assurances in 
writing are sought from the firms entering Canada usually with 
respect to reinvestment, business employment levels, 
performance of research and development, and so on.
<P>
	The procedure followed is that usually about 18 months to two 
years after the investment is completed, Investment Canada 
officials meet with the company concerned and review the 
performance of the undertakings.
<P>
	Where there is non-compliance for reasons which may be 
beyond the control of the company, efforts are made to redirect

have not matched the decreases in the bank rate with similar 
decreases in their prime lending rates. The banks say they are 
reluctant to do so because of this government's lack of 
commitment to specific deficit reduction targets.

1994-95 to help alleviate this problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all this government has definite 
deficit reduction targets. Second, the banks did not say that. 
Third, what the banks said is that they were waiting to see what 
was going to happen in the United States. Fourth, the differential 
between the bank rate and the prime rate today is not by 
historical standards out of line. Fifth, the fact is that as a result 
of what this government has done the Bank of Canada is now

that was the cost of the trip.
<P>

<P>
	However, I think we have to clarify something to be just 
toward everybody. These planes have been there for a long time. 
We are trying to spread the capital costs on every trip. The cost 
was to go there and come back. When the plane is in the hangar 
not being used the capital cost is there anyway.
<P>
	It is just as if somebody were to get up in this House today and

and wanted to travel on a commercial flight. I was told that for 
security reasons I had to take a government plane. The headlines 
in <I>Le Nouvelliste</I> were that I had spent half a million dollars to 
go on holiday. That is very unfair because it is not true. If the 
plane had been in Ottawa it would have cost exactly the same 
amount of money.
<P>
	We have to tell the truth to the Canadian people. When you 
extrapolate like what has been done with the Auditor General's 
report you come to that crazy type of opinion that for example 
the cost to go to Vancouver is half a million dollars and you can 
do it with a rented plane for $20,000. Something is not working

<P>
	In light of the survey results released in the last few days

information which the member is seeking is indeed critical.
<P>
	With respect to gathering more information about the 
appropriate use of gear to conserve our cod stocks, I in 
conjunction with the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced a pilot project just before Christmas.
<P>
	We have hired and we have trained a number of fishermen 
who have been displaced from the fishery, who are currently 
carrying out a survey of their peers. Initially the pilot project, up 
to 70 of them, was to call upon the experience and knowledge of 
the fishermen themselves about gear, gear selectivity, and their 
experience in the Atlantic.
<P>
	That pilot project is now being assessed. In the middle of

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	It was reported in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> on Saturday and again 
today that the Department of National Defence has a staff of 
over 100 military people to administer the household moves of 
its personnel, yet the department pays more for its moves than 
do private corporations. Furthermore, private companies exist 
which say they can provide this administrative service at no cost 
to the government and that the government would save 10 per 
cent to 25 per cent on rates over those currently being paid.
<P>
	What is the minister doing to investigate these cost-saving 
opportunities at a time of deficit reduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> My colleague 
from Cambridge posed this very same question last Friday and I 
gave a pretty detailed answer. Perhaps the hon. member was not 
here.
<P>
	I do have some concerns that we are not getting the best deal. I 
have asked my officials to make sure that the concerns of the 
hon. member who just asked the question and my colleague from 
Cambridge are addressed very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> I would like to ask a 
supplementary question of the minister. Would he at least give 
the reassurance that he would reinstate the pilot project that 
looked into cost savings which was set up in the last days of the 
last administration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> First of all, my 
colleague is from Waterloo. I hope I did not upset my colleague 
from Cambridge, who may disagree.
<P>
	The pilot project the hon. member refers to was one-and I 
addressed this last Friday-that was established by three 
ministers of the previous Conservative government without 
authorization. One of the first things we did when we took over 
was cancel the pilot project.
<P>
	I am not opposed to looking into the matter to try and get some 
resolution to the situation to get the cheapest price possible 
because the federal government does move, I believe, and is 
responsible for 35 per cent of all moves in Canada. Therefore we 
are talking about big business, more than $100 million.
<P>
	We will certainly look into it, but the way it was done by the 
previous government was totally unacceptable. As I said last 
Friday we do not do business that way.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Human rights 
are still being violated in El Salvador, in spite of the 1992 peace 
agreements. Even the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada 
recognized it on December 17 last when he talked about the 
re-emergence of political violence in El Salvador. In spite of the 
prevailing alarming situation, the Immigration and Refugee 
Board rejected the request for asylum of about 50 Salvadoran 
individuals who now face expulsion from Canada. My question 
is this: Does the minister intend to do something about these 
expulsion decisions which could endanger the lives of these 
Salvadoran refugees if they were forced to go back to their 
country?
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

for his question and to congratulate him on having been chosen 
by his party to be critic for citizenship and immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In regard to the 30 or 50 individuals from El Salvador, I 
should mention a fact that he knows and appreciates I am sure, 
the privacy laws prevent me from going into the specific details.
<P>
	These individuals went through a refugee board 
determination hearing, had full appeal to the Federal Court, 
have had reviews conducted. They wrote my office seeking a 
meeting and officials in my department are currently in the 
process of meeting with these individuals in Montreal-they 
just provided us with the names a few days ago-in order to 
receive the proposal they wish to make to us.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> I would like to ask a

<P>
	Why has government suspended all deportations of Chinese, 
Haitian and Somali nationals and why will they not commit to 
doing the same for Salvadorans?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning El Salvador, it is the 
immigration refugee board that has the full right to make a 
determination on who is not and who is a refugee. It is true that 
individuals from the Republic of China and Iraq are not 
returned.

<P>
	We have information, from external affairs, from our mission 
in El Salvador and from the UNHCR, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, that individuals are being returned 
to El Salvador.
<P>
	Yes, there has been increased sporadic violence in the lead-up 
to the March elections. Our officials are monitoring the 
situation. If the situation deteriorates to the point that we 
believe it is unfair, unhelpful and dangerous to return those 
individuals to that country we will not fear on this side to make 
that determination.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	It is reported that the justice department has ordered Canada 
Customs to allow counterfeit documents found entering Canada 
through the mail, including phony Canadian passports, to be 
sent on to their destination. The reason given for this is that the 
seizure of fake documents found during routine searches might 
be violating the protection against unreasonable search or 
seizure contained in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is 
an outrageous use of the charter.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to this House today what must be 
done to authorize Canada Customs to seize phony documents 
entering Canada and vigorously pursue the prosecution of those 
responsible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only have we also read the 
same article but the officials of my department as well as the 
department of revenue have been seized with an opinion from 
the justice department, which we respect, concerning the letter 
of the law.
<P>
	Let me say quite clearly that despite the fact that we respect 
the law, the impact of the circumstances is clearly unacceptable 
to me and to my officials. I will seek, hopefully with the 
co-operation of his party as well, among the officials of justice, 
revenue and immigration at the earliest possible moment 
amendments to both the customs and immigration acts so we can 
protect Canadian borders to the fullest. In the meantime we will 
work within the law to ensure that protection.
<P>
	I might add to my answer to the member's question that any 
one individual caught crossing the border with fraudulent 
documentation, be it visa or passport, certainly is apprehended 
and charged.

<P>
	The petitioners state that those individuals convicted of first

for parole for 25 years, and further, that section 745 of the 
Criminal Code allows murderers to apply for a reduction in the 
number of years of imprisonment notwithstanding having been 
tried, convicted and sentenced in a court of law; that those 
individuals convicted of first degree murder or second degree 
murder and sentenced to life imprisonment can be become 
eligible for parole after serving only 15 years by virtue of

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, recognizing that a bilateral Umbrella Agreement for Weapons 
Testing exists between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United 
States, take note of the domestic, international and bilateral aspects of allowing the</BLOCKQUOTE>
Government of the United States of America to conduct cruise missile tests within 
Canadian territorial boundaries, and in particular, two cruise missile tests during the 
first quarter of 1994.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, following yesterday's highly successful 
debate on peacekeeping this debate today will be crucial for the 
government to help it in its decision-making process as to 
whether or not we should continue cruise missile testing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made a commitment during the election 
that Parliament would be more frequently consulted in matters 
of this nature, general policy matters.
<P>
	The minister of human resources when in opposition was 
quite forthright in questioning the former defence minister to 
say that these tests under the renegotiated agreement of 1993 
should not occur before the matter was discussed in the House of 
Commons. We are discussing that today.
<P>
	One of the members opposite will waive the word ``hearing'' 
and will try to say that what we are going to do today, perhaps 
until midnight again, is not a hearing. What better hearing than 
to have all the members of the House of Commons participate 
live on national television.
<P>
	Let us not get caught on words. This is a hearing. It is a full 
parliamentary debate on a very sensitive matter. I am sure the 
minister of human resources, who led our party in foreign policy 
in opposition, agrees, by his presence here today, with the 
procedure we are undertaking.
<P>
	Again, as with the debate yesterday there is no whip in our 
party. The members have not been told what to say. I do not want 
to prejudge any outcome.
<P>
	The government has to take its own responsibilities and will 
take those responsibilities in due course. The government wants 
it fully understood that the views of the members of this House 
will help it make up its mind when the final decision is taken.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give a little bit of background for some of the 
members who have not been in the House for many years. I had 
the misfortune of not being here for the last number of years but 
was here when the agreement was first negotiated by the Liberal 
government of Mr. Trudeau.
<P>
	A cruise missile test is essentially a small, pilotless aircraft 
powered by a jet engine. Modern long range cruise missiles like 
those the United States tested in Canada over the past number of 
years have sophisticated guidance systems which enable them to 
fly predetermined routes at various altitudes. Indeed, the tests of 
the cruise missile in Canada have been designed mainly to prove 
the accuracy of the missile's guidance system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="393"> 393 </A></B>
<P>
	Cruise missiles can carry either conventional or nuclear 
weapons but I want to emphasize that none of the missiles tested 
in Canada has in any way been armed in a nuclear fashion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unarmed cruise missile tests are conducted under a 
Canada-U.S. agreement called the Test and Evaluation 
Program. The agreement, signed in 1983, originally covered a 
10-year period. It allowed the United States to test and evaluate 
their weapon systems and other types of equipment on Canadian 
soil.
<P>
	The agreement was renegotiated by the previous government 
in February 1993 and extended for another 10 years.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	For the first time the agreement is reciprocal and that is 
something new. Canada has obtained parallel access to 
American military test facilities. Furthermore, the same 
incremental cost recovery procedures now apply to both 
countries potentially yielding substantial savings for Canada.
<P>
	Last spring the United States submitted its routine annual test 
forecast to the previous Canadian government asking 
permission for two cruise missile tests in the early part of 1994 
within Canada.
<P>
	It is very crucial to understand the sequence of events. In 
August 1993 the previous government advised American 
officials that the two tests were approved in principle and that 
they could proceed with planning. The planning did continue 
after our government took office.
<P>
	However, before Christmas an official of the Department of 
National Defence conveyed to his opposite number in 
Washington that there could be a problem because of the 
commitments our party had made previously. The debate today 
reflects that caution that we gave to the United States.
<P>
	The U.S. has sought to test unarmed cruise missiles over 
Canadian territory because our test corridor provides the most 
challenging operational environment for these systems. Our 
territory as we all know provides a unique set of conditions for 
testing not available in the United States. These include high 
latitude and Arctic temperatures as well as the range and 
topography needed to fully test the navigation system. 
Consequently the U.S. has attached a great importance to these 
tests as well as to the overall testing regime provided by the test 
and evaluation agreement.
<P>
	The United States is mindful that a new government is in 
office in Ottawa that could indeed want to do things differently. 
All members of this House will recognize that cruise missile 
testing has always been a controversial issue for Canadians and I 
am sure some of that controversy will surface today in the 
House.
<P>
	I would like to go back a little bit to retrace some of the recent 
history to give a better sense of how it has evolved in the last 10 
years. When the government first agreed in 1983 to test these 
missiles, the context was quite different than that of today.
<P>
	First, the cruise missile test was a cold war issue. It was in the 
early 1980s that east-west relations were at a low ebb. It was 
characterized by such things as the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan, the downing of the Korean airlines flight 007 and 
the controversy over the deployment of medium range missiles 
in Europe. In this context the Government of Canada justified at 
the time cruise missile testing as an important contribution to 
collective defence against the Soviet threat.
<P>
	Second, cruise missile testing was a nuclear issue. I 
emphasize that it was a nuclear issue. The air launched cruise 
missile that was being tested in our air space, AGM-86B was its 
code name, was a nuclear weapons system, unarmed of course, 
during the testing within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Testing then had to be within a context of Canadian policy, not 
only with respect to deterrents in defence, but also arms control 
and disarmament. Over time the context of the cruise missile 
testing has begun to change or it did change most notably when 
the cold war came to an end. Confrontation evolved into detente, 
which in itself was rapidly transformed into east-west 
co-operation on a full range of issues. We have witnessed one of 
the most remarkable political transformations in modern 
history. In the space of two short years revolutions in central and 
eastern Europe gave way to the collapse of the Warsaw pact, 
German unification and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
<P>
	We also saw remarkable progress in arms control. Certainly 
the state of U.S.-Soviet nuclear balance has improved 
dramatically with the signing of the strategic arms reduction 
agreements which mandate deep cuts in these arsenals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, the changes made in the last 10 years were not all 
so positive.
<P>
	The end of the cold war resulted in new security problems, 
including ethnic conflicts and disputes over the appropriation of 
resources which were unheard of during the cold war.
<P>
	Moreover, throughout the last 10 years, hostile governments, 
in Libya, Iraq and North Korea for example, regularly 
challenged the international community.
<P>
	As the situation evolved, so did the test program as well as the 
reasons justifying its very existence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="394"> 394 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1989 the government agreed to test a new variant of the 
cruise, which was the advanced cruise missile. This missile 
represents a refinement of the original system. It is more 
accurate, able to fly farther and harder to detect by radar. In 
addition, cruise missiles have become significant as part of the 
conventional weapons inventory of many countries. I will take 
us back a couple of years to conflicts such as the gulf war. There 
is an illustration that conventionally armed weapons may be 
more important in terms of weapons systems than their nuclear 
counterparts. As we can see, cruise missile testing has never 
been a static issue.
<P>
	In case one thinks that in the remarks I have made this 
afternoon I am justifying the future testing of the cruise missile, 
that is wrong. What I am trying to do is to put squarely before 
you-I understand I am supposed to talk to you, Mr. Speaker, 
and that was always the practice so please do not take 
offence-how we are trying to underscore the reasons why the 
cruise has been tested in the past. We want to underscore why the 
United States would seek to test cruise missiles again.
<P>
	However, my remarks will in no way reflect upon our 
government's decision to deal with the specific matter of cruise 
tests in 1994 in the context of the test and evaluation agreement. 
In other words, whether or not these tests may proceed in the 
first quarter of 1984 will be a decision that cabinet will take after 
the deliberation today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I wonder if 
the hon. minister would be willing to accept a very brief 
question on this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would require 
unanimous consent from the House. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue being debated today concerns one of the most 
significant aspects of relations between Canada and the United 
States. It concretely involves the framework in which we have 
developed a system of co-operation for our common security, 
but it also raises questions related to peace and disarmament.
<P>
	These questions of peace and disarmament are more current 
than ever. The world is now painfully torn between the hope for 
lasting peace and the horror of atrocious massacres, even in 
Europe, the cradle of civilization. Nevertheless, real hope has 
been raised by the new order which has seemed to emerge. This 
hope was fed mainly by the efforts and successes, albeit partial 
but encouraging, it must be said, in disarmament achieved by 
the United States and the former Soviet Union, later confirmed 
by Russia.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	All peoples earnestly hope that this effort will intensify. It 
will go even better and more surely if it is done in an orderly 
fashion, with each gain consolidated by realistic measures that 
can assure everyone's security. Disarmament must go together 
with security, which must still be maintained with a minimum of 
deterrence.
<P>
	There is first of all the question of the many solid 
long-standing ties between Canadians and Americans. Along 
with the United States, Canada has been a member of NATO 
since 1949 and of NORAD since 1958. Our mutual 
commitments therefore bind us both to an integrated defence of 
North America and of other countries in the North Atlantic 
region. Under these treaties, our air force, navy and army have 
for a long time had common modes of operation. Military 
equipment is often interchangeable and the officers of the 
various armed services have close working and even personal 
relations. Training, testing, exercises and manoeuvres go on all 
the time, and they are all done jointly, as a rule. In short, no two 
military organizations in the world are closer to each other, so 
much so that other countries often have difficulty breaking 
through this close embrace when it comes to selling military 
equipment to Canada, for example.
<P>
	In this spirit, a Liberal government in 1983 concluded a 
10-year agreement with the United States called CANUSTEP in 
their awful jargon. It allowed the United States to test weapons 
on Canadian territory. Each series of tests had to receive 
permission from the Canadian government to go ahead.
<P>
	Canada's commitments to strategic deterrence are basically a 
part of co-operation between allies. Canada has no strategic 
weapons in its forces. However, in that its defence is based on 
the agreement among allies and it benefits from collective 
security, it must voluntarily co-operate in implementing this 
strategic deterrent force if required. This is an integral part of 
the national defence policy as found in the 1971 and 1987 white 
papers on defence and the 1992 defence policy statement.
<P>
	The arms in question include cruise missiles that, in 
practically every year between 1983 and 1993, were tested many 
times in the Canadian north, more precisely inside a 2,200 
kilometre corridor including parts of the Northwest Territories, 
British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These missiles, 
that have a 3,000 kilometre range, are launched from bombers 
and guided to their target by a sophisticated homing device. 
Because of its size and topography, Canada was and is the only 
place in the world where the Americans can conduct these tests.
<P>
	In 1983, the reasons behind the Canadian government's 
acquiescence obviously had to do with the cold war between the 
American and Soviet superpowers. It was the era of the nuclear 
dissuasion strategy in a bipolar world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="395"> 395 </A></B>
<P>
	The cruise missile met all the requirements of the time as it 
could carry either a nuclear or a conventional head, thus offering 
the advantage of flexibility. However, the 1983 agreement 
formally excluded any possibility of testing missiles equipped 
with nuclear heads.
<P>
	As we know, the geopolitical environment went through 
substantial changes after 1989. The dismantling of the Warsaw 
pact, set up against NATO, deeply altered the strategic map.
<P>
	Of the two organizations, only NATO survived. But the 
political thaw gave new life to the disarmament movement so 
that the START I and START II treaties negotiated in 1991 and 
1992 imposed cuts in the number of missiles and nuclear heads 
deployed by the United States and Russia. Since then, the ceiling 
imposed on both parties rules out the production of new cruise 
missiles, except to compensate for attrition. They can only 
improve the missiles' performance by making guidance systems 
more precise and reliable.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	That is why, in 1993, the United States asked the Canadian 
government to renew the 1983 agreement for another 10 years, 
to 2013. The Canadian government agreed to do so.
<P>
	Last year, in its policy statement on security, Canada took a 
slightly different stand on strategic issues stating that it no 
longer viewed the strategic scene as bipolar. Since the new 
nuclear powers were considered unstable by nature, it was 
becoming problematic for Canada and its allies to dissociate 
themselves from nuclear deterrence, so nuclear deterrence was 
dropped from the new policy statement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One might therefore wonder why the government has opened 
up the discussion today as Canada, after assessing the 
circumstances prevailing at the time, has made a commitment in 
principle which binds it until the year 2003.
<P>
	What has happened is that the United States, pursuant to the 
recently renewed agreement, is requesting the Canadian 
government for authorization to proceed with the testing of an 
improved guidance system with which they intend to equip the 
cruise missiles. Now several senior members of the Liberal 
Party have already attacked those tests.
<P>
	Is the government trying today to find allies in the House in 
order to support its refusal which it is already preparing in 
response to the American request? As a matter of fact certain 
remarks in the minister's aseptic speech might provoke the 
prognosis that it will be so.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois for its part considers it imperative to 
examine closely and with objectivity setting aside all abstract 
theory and preconceived judgments where the real interests and 
responsibilities of Canada lie in this matter.
<P>
	Those who are opposed to the resumption of the tests base 
their argument mainly upon the danger of proliferation of this 
type of missile, particularly at a time when the nuclear deterrent 
can no longer be justified. It is true that the basic technology for 
manufacturing these weapons could conceivably become 
available to many countries. The Russians have already 
produced their own version of this weapon, the AS-15 missile, 
and they do not have to ask permission from anybody when they 
want to perfect the system because they can carry out their tests 
over the vast Siberian steppes.
<P>
	Professor Kosta Tsipis of MIT drew attention in 1992 in the 
New York <I>Times</I> to the risk involved in the proliferation of this 
weapon. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any country capable of manufacturing an elementary airplane can construct a 
cruise missile able to transport a charge of one ton over a distance of at least 300 
miles and to plant it within 30 feet of its target.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the threat of proliferation does not come from 
American testing in Canada. It should be stressed that the tests 
the American government is requesting permission to conduct 
do not involve any new nuclear technology. These tests 
contravene neither the letter nor the spirit of the START treaties, 
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or the missile technology 
control regime; thus, they do not contribute to the build up of 
strategic nuclear forces. In July 1993, the manufacturing of new 
air-launched stealth cruise missiles was restricted to 460 units, 
that is 1,000 fewer than initially planned. It is also important to 
note that, for the past few years, tests have been related to 
detection, interception and missile guidance. In that sense, any 
test that enhances the target-acquisition and interception 
capability of these weapons helps to limit the threat posed by the 
manufacturing and use of other types of cruise missiles 
developed in other countries. The capability to detect and 
destroy such weapons in flight is the only effective means of 
retaliation.
<P>
	It should be noted in that respect that the Americans are not 
the only ones to benefit from any improvement in guidance 
technology flowing from this testing. Canada also benefits from 
it since our pilots take part in monitoring and detection 
operations.
<P>
	The changes on the international scene were not all positive. 
For one thing, the political climate in Russia by no means 
guarantees stability. The recent election revealed the rapid 
emergence of a strong right-wing movement. Statements made 
by the Russian leader, Mr. Vladimir Jirinovski, do not bode well 
for the future of detente in the event of a return to power of the 
military.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	This would not be the first time an opposition party formed 
the government following an election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="396"> 396 </A></B>
<P>
	While the break-up of the U.S.S.R. may have helped to ease 
international tensions, it has also had a secondary, more 
worrisome effect. With the crumbling of the Soviet empire, new 
nuclear powers have emerged. The resistance of the Ukraine is 
telling in this regard, although it has shown some signs of 
co-operation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there have been doubts about how effectively the 
weapons stockpiles inherited by these republics are controlled 
and how they are used. As well, a number of other countries 
either have nuclear weapons or are doing everything they can to 
become nuclear powers. China, India and Pakistan already have 
nuclear arms. Newspapers regularly report on the efforts of 
several other countries, including Iraq, to develop nuclear 
weapons. We should not dismiss the potential threat of all of 
these countries deploying short-range cruise missiles armed 
with nuclear warheads.
<P>
	The best way to counter this threat is still to refine detection 
and interception methods and this is one of the positive aspects 
of the testing process we are discussing here today.
<P>
	You may recall that the cruise missile can be used as a 
conventional load delivery vehicle. The focus should be on 
developing it for this purpose. The planned tests are particularly 
interesting since, according to the information supplied by the 
Americans, they will focus on a new guidance system designed 
to improve strike reliability and accuracy. There is hardly a need 
to improve the accuracy of weapons of mass destruction such as 
nuclear arms. To the extent the new geopolitical reality demands 
alternatives to nuclear strikes, there is a greater need to develop 
more effective conventional arms.
<P>
	In that field, to perform better means to be more accurate. 
Strategists are doing more and more to provide their armies with 
the means to intervene safely but firmly from a distance. This is 
the only way to hit a limited but strategic target while sparing 
the neighbouring civilian populations. The cruise missile is the 
perfect weapon for the job. During the gulf war, we were able to 
see the dramatic results obtained with the Tomahawks, those 
cruise missiles carrying conventional weaponry. Any test aimed 
at improving this very accurate weapon is therefore part of a 
strategy especially suited to post-cold war requirements, and I 
do mean post-cold war.
<P>
	Moreover, there are practically no direct economic costs 
related to the cruise missile tests conducted within Canadian 
territorial boundaries. If such costs exist, they are met by the 
American government under existing agreements. Conversely, 
these tests help, at least indirectly, the Canadian Department of 
National Defence to have access to facilities where military 
technologies developed here in Canada can be tested.
<P>
	What about environmental costs? Those costs are, for all 
intents and purposes, non-existent if one considers the very low 
frequency of the flights, merely a few over the  course of one 
year, and over 3,000 kilometres of a nearly empty territory.
<P>
	But we must also take into consideration of the political side 
of the issue. Who is asking us to conduct these tests? We must 
not forget that the United States is Canada's best friend, its only 
neighbour, its safest ally, its major trading partner, and a great 
nation which speaks the same language as that of most 
Canadians. Let us not forget that the United States is the pillar of 
NATO and NORAD, the two pacts which ensure our security. If 
there ever was a nuclear threat to Canada, something we hope 
will not happen and probably never will happen, though there is 
a risk, to whom would Canadians and Quebecers turn? I do not 
even have to give the answer, because that answer is so obvious. 
Should such a situation occur, we would be quite relieved to be 
able to rely on an ally equipped with cruise missiles which it 
would have developed at its own expense.
<P>
	Moreover, abrubtly ending the long sequence of tests 
conducted since 1983 would adversely affect the value of our 
commitments. I wonder how the Prime Minister would explain 
this change of attitude to our old friends the next time he goes to 
Washington. Even if he were accompanied by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, I think he would have a hard time to provide an 
explanation.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I can understand and share this will to distance ourselves from 
the Americans when it is in our interest to do so, but that is not 
the case in this instance. Quite the contrary, we have everything 
to gain by co-operating with the United States to ensure our own 
protection at no cost to us.
<P>
	I respect the arguments put forward by those who oppose 
these tests on the grounds that detente is here to stay, but I do not 
agree with them. I hope they are right, but I would like to be sure 
of that. And since no one can be sure, we must consider the issue 
of security. In any case, I do hope that whatever decision the 
government makes, it is a decision based on rational and 
well-thought out motives. Many would be concerned if the 
government simply tried to say no to those tests, to please an 
anti-American lobby which still has some roots in certain parts 
of the country.
<P>
	More importantly, to decide to oppose the tests would be a 
sudden and inconsistent move.
<P>
	We are still waiting for the white book on our defence policy 
which the government promised to table. Where is this review of 
our military and international role? What will be the duties 
assigned to our air force? What will be the role of the navy? 
What will be the mandate of our army? What will be the nature 
and the level of our involvement with NATO and NORAD? What 
will be the level of our commitment in Europe? Are we going to 
maintain our peacekeeping operations? If so, under what 
conditions, with what equipment and by which criteria? What 
contribution are we going to ask of the United  States regarding 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="397"> 397 </A></B>
<P>
protection of our security? Are we going to continue to stay 
under its protection?
<P>
	All these questions and many others are still without an 
answer. So, why make an isolated and hurried decision which, 
by breaking the continuity of our commitments and by being 
totally out of character, would look like a sudden impulse and 
would be considered as such.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc feels that under the present 
circumstances, there is no need to put an end to the co-operation 
which characterizes our relations with our neighbours. A review 
of all those issues will have to be undertaken, a detailed and 
comprehensive exercise which, I hope, will also include a large 
public consultation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Question and comment, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to allow the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway to 
ask a question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Since there is no 
unanimous consent, we will resume debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the spirit of fairness and co-operation in the House, the 
Chair will ask members of the Reform Party who will speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was our understanding that the 
next period is to go to the Liberal Party. Do you wish us to speak 
at this point?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not want to reiterate a lot of what has been said because it is 
covering old ground. However I would point out that this 
agreement was signed originally in 1983. It was renewed for five 
years in 1988 and was renewed in February of last year for a 
further ten years. This is an agreement in support of a mutual 
defence pact which is of great value to Canada. It means a lot to 
our stability.
<P>
	The U.S.S.R. by and large has disappeared and is no longer an 
obvious threat. The area is certainly not under control. There is a 
lot of volatility there. When we think back to the Russians 
having constructed a very similar weapon to the one that is 
proposed to be tested over Canada, we have to consider that 
there are many countries in that region which have cash balance 
problems, foreign exchange problems. They are very vulnerable 
to offers from various agencies that are willing to pay large sums 
to gather the ability to threaten or to create terror.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact that the weapons were used with great effect in the 
gulf war is indicative of what they can do. I refer to what the 
leader of the opposition has said, that any country with the 
ability to build a simple airplane can construct one of these 
weapons which will carry a tonne of dynamite or explosives for 
a distance of at least 300 miles and explode with great accuracy.
<P>
	There is another spin-off benefit from the testing taking place 
in Canada. It provides a platform for our air crews to practice 
their technology, their interception against this type of threat. 
This could be invaluable not only within Canada but should we 
find our forces committed in some other theatre in the future.
<P>
	There is a spin-off. Ancillary to this agreement, Canada is 
able to benefit from mutual testing programs with the United 
States. It pays dividends in information exchanged. It is a 
productive program.
<P>
	To my knowledge our constituencies, many of which lie in the 
path of the overflights, have received no complaints from the 
constituents who reside there. There are people who are 
concerned about the overflights and have complained about 
them but we have not in our constituencies received any direct 
input on this matter. I believe there is minimal, if any, 
environmental impact caused by these missiles overflying the 
country.
<P>
	If I may go back to my personal experience when I was base 
operations officer at Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake, I was in 
charge of the range there. It was a rectangular area some 100 by 
60 miles.
<P>
	On that range live an awful lot of animals: moose, caribou, 
grizzly bears and so on. I overflew it regularly and I have seen 
moose in my flight path that stood with its head in the water and 
completely ignored my overflight. In fact, he was more bothered 
by a helicopter when I went up to check what was going on than 
he was by the jets flying over. The jets were flying at an altitude 
of 50 feet at speeds exceeding 600 knots, over 700 miles an hour. 
Animals do adapt.
<P>
	To further exemplify the fact that animals adapt, when I went 
there in 1976 a herd of eight buffalo were living within the 
range. By the time I left in 1979 the herd had grown to 13 
animals.
<P>
	In this instance there is a limited window within which these 
tests can be conducted. It is my understanding that the tethered 
flights, that is with the missile attached to the wing of a B-52, 
are conducted in the period between October and December.
<P>
	Only two of the free flights that we are now discussing take 
place between January and the end of March. The reason for this, 
as I understand it, is in case of an accident and the missile 
crashes. The missile might start a forest fire if it happened 
outside that timeframe when the snow was off the ground.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="398"> 398 </A></B>
<P>
	It is of great concern to the United States military that wishes 
to conduct the test that we are procrastinating and delaying 
approval. These tests are in Canada's best interests and should 
be allowed to proceed.
<P>
	The agreement was signed in good faith. Canada should 
honour the agreement to which we have committed and should 
allow the tests to proceed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I take the 
parliamentary secretary's point of order, I would like to ask the 
assistance of the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands. Is the 
Chair to understand that members of the Reform Party will be 
splitting their times to ten and five?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is correct. I apologize for not 
having made that point earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. It is our intention 
on this side of the House to split our time into 10 minute 
speeches with five minute question and answer segments 
because there are so many speakers who want to get on. It is my 
humble suggestion and I regret I have not had time to consult 
with the other side of the House. We know where the Reform is 
coming from.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest that if there is agreement, consideration be 
given for all sides of the House to go immediately to 10 and 5 
which would allow considerable discussion and more speakers 
who feel quite strongly on both sides of this issue and that would 
be facilitated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, does the parliamentary 
secretary speak on behalf of all parties when he proposes a 10-5 
split until 10 o'clock or midnight, depending on whether the 
sitting is extended or not?
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, we have no objection to the other 
parties proceeding that way, but our first three speakers will 
make 20 minute speeches that will each be followed by a 10 
minute question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will say to the hon. 
member for Richelieu that the Bloc Quebecois can certainly 
proceed any way it chooses.
<P>
	On the government side, the parliamentary secretary tells us 
that the length of speeches will be 10 minutes, followed by a 5 
minute question and comment period and I think the Reform 
Party will proceed in the same manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson: </B>Mr. Speaker, since it is very clear that, in the 
opposition, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of 
cruise missile testing and so is the Reform Party, I hope that the 
NDP will be heard early in the debate, otherwise we will hear 
only from those who say yes to the Americans and yes to cruise 
missile testing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not believe that is a 
point of order. I believe that is more a matter of debate.
<P>
	If I could resume now with questions and comments for five 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for his presentation.
<P>
	I have two questions to raise. First, a number of people have 
been telling me that the original rationale for cruise missile 
testing is now passe. I wonder if he would care to comment on 
that.
<P>
	The other question I want to raise, which is equally important, 
is with respect to complaints. I must confess that I do not have 
the whole picture necessarily but I was led to believe that there 
had been some concerns voiced by the Government of the 
Northwest Territories and some people in the territories. There 
may have been others.
<P>
	If that were the case and recognizing that the Reform Party is 
unusually sensitive, according to their spokespersons, in 
listening to the people, how would he react to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. I very much appreciate it.
<P>
	He is probably fairly accurate in saying that the original 
reasons for which the missile was conceived are now passe. 
However, I think the experience in the gulf war demonstrated a 
very valid and useful purpose for this type of weapon. It enables 
the intrusion of the weapon into the area in question. There is 
reasonable assurance of destruction and it does the job without 
risking a pilot. If it is necessary for the missile to be committed 
that is a good reason for having it in the arsenal.
<P>
	With regard to complaints I take very much to heart what the 
member is saying. When I made my comments about no 
complaints from constituents I was referring to constituents 
which are represented by Reform Party members of Parliament.
<P>
	I understand there are complaints from the Northwest 
Territories and I am already on record as saying that if the people 
who are complaining about the missile test wish to present their 
complaints to a parliamentary committee I would be more than 
willing to participate in such a hearing so that I could hear both 
sides of the story directly from the people concerned. We should 
take their complaints and concerns into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason originally for the cruise missile testing in western and 
northern Canada was because the terrain of that particular part 
of Canada closely resembled that of the Soviet Union.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="399"> 399 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the Soviet Union no longer exists and since the war 
areas in the world have been comparable to that of Iraq, being 
deserts, would it not be more appropriate for cruise missile 
testing, rather than being in Canada to be in areas comparable to 
that in Nevada.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that in addition to areas 
like the Persian Gulf there is also the danger of threats from 
people who have snow on the ground for a reasonable portion of 
the year. I mentioned earlier the volatility of areas in the former 
U.S.S.R. I do not in any way claim they are contemplating attack 
on the west but it is possible that by some aberration this could 
happen.
<P>
	I think that the testing, both in desert conditions and in the 
north in snow conditions, is a valid project.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue which is 
certainly one that affects all of us in Canada. More specifically, 
it affects the constituency which I represent, Beaver River, 
which includes CFB Cold Lake where the cruise missile lands 
when it completes its flight.
<P>
	I have witnessed this first hand from the very beginning in my 
teaching career when the testing first started in the early 
eighties.
<P>
	Let us all realize that an extremely important function of any 
government is to provide for security for the state and its people. 
Security for Canadians is determined by several geopolitical 
factors, the principal one being our close proximity to the 
United States. The deterrence of future threats, no matter how 
remote they may now appear, can best be accomplished with the 
help of allies and Canada must be seen as a reliable, effective 
team player in such alliances.
<P>
	In short, our security remains bound up with that of our 
alliance partners. No matter what anyone may say or think, it is 
essential that we keep the bond we have with the United States.
<P>
	While the end of the cold war and of the east-west 
confrontation may offer us unique opportunities to move toward 
a more peaceful world, regional conflicts and violent 
nationalism should cause us to pause and reflect.
<P>
	Let us talk about the actual cruise itself for a few minutes. 
This is an unmanned self-guided aerodynamic vehicle, 
continuously powered by air breathing jet engines. This is a 
vehicle which can travel all on its own. I had a student who saw 
it come over the trees and came to me and said: ``Miss Grey, you 
can't imagine what I just saw''. It was an incredibly moving 
experience for him. This was several years ago when he was still 
in high school.
<P>
	Flying at low altitude, the cruise missile is difficult for radar 
to spot in ground clutter. The detection requires expensive 
systems with sophisticated processing capabilities. This 
complicates developing an effective defence against the cruise 
missile, which is one of its greatest strengths.
<P>
	Conventionally armed cruise missiles are equipped with 
terminal homing systems to achieve even greater accuracy. It is 
important that we note that because the cruise can employ radar 
or laser returns to fix on the target. Terminal homing provides 
improved guidance  where the nature of the target or warhead is 
delivered very accurately wherever it is aimed. Future versions 
of the cruise missile can be expected to display higher speeds, 
greater manoeuvrability, longer range, lower radar and other 
signatures, and penetration aids such as electronic counter 
measures.
<P>
	We see there has been a life and a history to the cruise missile. 
Even though the cold war is officially over, I think we realize 
there are still some hot spots, which we touched on yesterday, 
around the world. We have not achieved peace world wide.
<P>
	Cruise missiles appeal to the military because they have an 
incredibly broad range of application. Its possible deployment 
in large numbers is something that makes it very effective as 
does its potential to combine quality and quantity in one weapon 
system and its ability to be modified. So you see it is not just a 
one-system vehicle, it has all kinds of assets of which military 
analysts speak highly.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence listed the following 
objectives for this particular project, and I name some of them.
<P>
	``They could fly this over a route of realistic length and width 
with a representative standoff launch distance to the landfall. 
Also they could fly the cruise over relatively smooth terrain 
with various types of surface cover to include snow and ice.''
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague addressed this earlier in questions and 
comments. They need to be able to look at the terrain and they 
need to fly the cruise missile in winter over ice-covered and 
snow-covered lakes. They need to fly the cruise missile and test 
it in operationally realistic weather conditions.
<P>
	Let me assure all hon. members in this House that during the 
period of January 1 to March 31 in northeastern Alberta, Beaver 
River in fact, they will find realistic weather conditions. I live 
exactly one hour south of CFB Cold Lake where the cruise lands. 
I can guarantee that when they evaluate their missile radar 
altimeter operation over snow, trees, and ice-covered lakes, that 
is exactly what they get in Beaver River.
<P>
	The flight path, as was mentioned earlier perhaps, includes a 
corridor that is 2,600 kilometres long through the Northwest 
Territories down through the Mackenzie Valley and through the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="400"> 400 </A></B>
<P>
northeastern corner of B.C., across Alberta and into 
Saskatchewan over the Cold Lake-Primrose air weapons range.
<P>
	I have just mentioned the timing of it but I will stipulate 
between the two. When it is launched from a B-52 and goes into 
its free flight and is operating strictly on its own, the cruise 
missile has to operate within that time element of January 1 and 
March 31. Captive-carries, that cruise missile which flies all the 
way attached to the B-52 bomber, is not restricted to that 
timeframe so it can  take place at other times without that narrow 
window of January 1 to March 31.
<P>
	They are allowed six flights per year. So when people say the 
cruise missile is always flying over northern Canada that is 
simply not true. Under this particular agreement of Canada and 
the U.S. they are only allowed six per year.
<P>
	Let us take a couple of minutes and talk about the chronology 
of this. The first flight was in March 1984. To date 23 cruise 
missile tests have been conducted in Canada. In February 1986, 
a couple of years after this program got started, a cruise missile 
crashed immediately after launch from a B-52. The engine did 
not start. The federal government imposed a temporary halt to 
the cruise missile testing program.
<P>
	In January 1990 a test was designed to test the capability of 
the Canadian F-18 aircraft to intercept cruise missiles, certainly 
an important part of the test regime. Also the American U.S. 
F-15s and F-16s were involved in this. Unfortunately as 
probably most members in this House will recall, in January 
1990 upon take off one of the Canadian F-18s exploded causing 
critics again to renew their calls for an end to cruise testing in 
Canada. I remember that well because of course that CF-18 had 
taken off from CFB Cold Lake to do the intercept. It certainly 
was a tragedy.
<P>
	As with all things and of course with the debate we had 
yesterday, do we cancel these projects because one tragedy 
occurs?
<P>
	Again, as was mentioned earlier, in January 1991 there were 
several cruise missiles used and deployed in the gulf war. The 
Iraqi conflict demonstrated that guided weapons were very 
precise and damage to civilian structures was much less than in 
previous conflicts. We need to realize very strongly that just 
because the cold war has ended does not mean that peace has 
broken out across the world. I think we need to be preventive in 
realizing that some of these hot spots do still occur and therefore 
we need to realize that testing is essential.
<P>
	We could ask the rhetorical question: Can this cruise missile 
be used without testing it at all? I think not. I would like to pay 
tribute to the communities of the tri-towns of Cold Lake, Grand 
Centre and specifically CFB Cold Lake. They work hand in hand 
with the Americans regularly. We have a military procedure in 
the spring called maple flag where any number of Americans 
come up and participate in a rendezvous or military exercises at 
CFB Cold Lake. We have experienced good relations with the 
Americans. It is also good for our area's local economy.
<P>
	Further as a member of the G-7, Canada is obligated to take 
part in some of these things. We need to realize that as a member 
of the G-7 we cannot simply slide in under the arm of the 
Americans and say we will let them do everything, that we will 
take no part and no responsibility.
<P>
	Again may I re-emphasize in closing how important it is for 
our Canadian pilots to be involved in this testing of the cruise 
missile and that it is essential for the proficiency of our intercept 
systems in our F-18s.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally I would just like to pay tribute to Colonel Dave 
Bartram, the base commander, and the members of 4 Wing at 
CFB Cold Lake for a job they do well. We must understand how 
important our military is and so we take our hats off to them. I 
think it would be wise for the government to continue this good 
relationship which we have with the Americans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to read for the hon. member for Beaver River an argument 
the defence minister of the day made in April 1993 in a letter to 
Project Ploughshares. As an extract it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If collective security is to work. . ..the international community must have 
effective. . ..military means at its disposal in order to dissuade potential 
aggressors and, should the use of force be necessary, to ensure that it is effective 
and that the risks to allied military personnel are minimal. Over the past three 
years, our support for collective security has taken Canadian forces personnel 
into harm's way. It is likely that they will continue to be deployed in dangerous 
situations which cannot always be predicted in advance and, due to the spread of 
sophisticated weaponry, our personnel will continue to be at risk as they try to 
prevent war or restore peace to unstable parts of the world-.Given these 
circumstances, the renewal of the Canada-United States Test and Evaluation 
Agreement serves Canadian interests. Cruise missile testing, part of our 
long-standing tradition of defence co-operation with the United States, is a 
contribution that Canada can make towards ensuring that the international 
community has at its disposal the military means to support collective security. 
Testing in Canada provides a unique set of conditions and will help to ensure that 
these weapons are effective and reliable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest to the member that this is an extraordinary statement 
which clearly implied that the Canadian government was willing 
to envisage the possible use or at least the threat of use of 
nuclear weapons against states that in most cases do not even 
possess nuclear weapons. This would be a blatant contradiction 
of Canada's official nuclear non-proliferation policy which 
includes support for negative security assurances, that is, 
international commitments not to use nuclear weapons against 
non-nuclear states.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="401"> 401 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the member for Beaver River would care to 
comment on that position.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a better memory so that 
I could remember all that the member said, but I did take a few 
notes.
<P>
	It is important for us each to realize in this House that Canada 
is not going to be in the business of firing off the cruise missile. 
Canada is offering its unique terrain, the ice, bush, and 
snow-covered lakes, to be able to give assistance to the 
Americans so that they can test these things.
<P>
	Yes, there have been a couple of dreadful crashes in the 
history of the cruise missile. But when we think about that, how 
much safer is it to happen in a very sparsely populated area in 
northern Canada than to have it happen in a very densely 
populated area where there may be risk of life?
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned that Canadian personnel are 
in danger. There is not one person in Canada's military today 
who does not realize that his life is always in danger. When one 
is in the military one prepares for that risk. Many of our military 
members are far too young to remember World War II, but when 
they got a chance to participate in the gulf war it came home to 
them very quickly, very soundly that their lives always hung in 
the balance. Our Canadian military are absolutely prepared and 
know that there is a risk involved in anything.
<P>
	I do not think the member's argument holds true that we 
should just completely negate any relationship we do have with 
the United States. Canada is not going to be taking a forward or 
aggressive role in this but we are helping as a member of G-7 
with our allied countries so that we can work together on their 
behalf.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member and I must say that her 
reasoning seems rational to me, just as rational as the reasoning 
of my leader, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. In a certain 
perspective, they seem to make a lot of sense.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	It is difficult to argue against what was said in either speech. 
Given the military capabilities of Canada, its striking power, it 
is clear that should we come under attack we would require 
American support. We do have agreements with the American 
defence and an almost perfect co-operation with them, and I am 
pleased about that.
<P>
	However, there is a moral side to war, and that is what bothers 
me a little. Clearly, from a technical point of view, given our 
mutual agreements, our defence capability in co-operation with 
the United States, it is logical, defensible and coherent.
<P>
	However, when I consider that the cold war has recently 
ended, that we are entering a period of disarmament, that we 
should strive to achieve peace, I have some doubts about 
allowing the tests we are talking about today, and that will be 
conducted over the Northwest Territories. Before I can be 
convinced that we should accept those tests, I will need to hear 
more arguments.
<P>
	There is also the environmental side which remains an 
unknown quantity to me. When will we deal with the 
environmental aspect of this issue? You are asking me to hurry 
up, Mr. Speaker. I would like the hon. member to  comment on 
the environmental issue and on the cost of airplane crashes and 
losses of military personnel.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is very little time 
left in the question and comment period, so I will ask the hon. 
member for Beaver River to be brief.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked for my 
response. Unfortunately, he took all the time for my response.
<P>
	Let me just finish this up by saying that if we are going to 
achieve peace we must be prepared for war. This almost seems 
like an anachronism sometimes but it is very, very true that we 
must be prepared. The enemy is world-wide.
<P>
	As we heard last night in our debate we realize that it is not 
just conflict from state to state. There are internal rumblings. In 
fact, my friend is causing internal rumblings within this country. 
So we see that the enemy perhaps is from within. Let us make 
sure that we are ready for conflict thereby hoping that we never 
have to engage in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I rise to debate this issue of the cruise missiles I find 
myself in some senses caught in a historical time warp. The 
cruise missiles almost never existed. They were discussed 
during the Nixon-Brezhnev Moscow exchanges in 1972. You 
will find them covered in detail in the Vladivostok summit 
discussions between President Ford and Mr. Brezhnev in 1974. 
They are included in the unratified SALT II treaty which, signed 
by the United States and the then Soviet Union, has probably 
entered into customary international law, even though not 
ratified.
<P>
	I mention the almost or what might have been simply because 
the proposal then was to trade the cruise missile in which the 
Americans had advanced testing skills, against the Soviet 
Backfire bomber in which the Soviets had a considerable 
advance over comparable American weapons. In fact 
modifications were made on both sides and under the SALT II 
treaty the cruise missiles were limited to missiles not having a 
range in excess of 600 kilometres and launched from land-based 
and sea-based launch devices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="402"> 402 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue came as you may remember, before the Supreme 
Court of Canada in 1985. The Supreme Court ruled in essence 
though on procedural grounds rather than substantive grounds 
that cruise missile testing was not unconstitutional. It is back 
again now and it comes against a backdrop of Canada's 
achievement as a world leader in disarmament. There has been a 
move since World War II when the use of nuclear weapons 
clearly was not illegal, was licit under the rules then existing to a 
situation where to a very large extent many jurors feel that the 
use of nuclear weapons is unconstitutional.
<P>
	There is a law case that is sought to be raised by a group of 
American lawyers, graduates of President  Clinton's law school, 
testing this issue before the World Court and the Canadian 
government, I believe the previous government, was asked if it 
would intervene in the case if it should develop.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I am mentioning simply the background, which is the world 
movement for the progressive development of international law 
achieved through UN general assembly declarations in which 
Canada led through a series of multilateral conventions such as 
the Moscow test ban treaty, the non-proliferation treaty and the 
moon treaty and outer space treaty which Canada contributed to 
signally, as well as a series of bilateral treaties between the 
United States and the then Soviet Union. SALT I is one of these, 
of course, but most recently there was the intermediate range 
nuclear forces agreement of 1987 between President Reagan and 
Secretary Gorbachev.
<P>
	It reached the stage where, in a work published in 1989 by me 
and my distinguished friend the then president of the World 
Court, Nagendra Singh, we posed the question whether the user 
of nuclear weapons was illegal per se. That is an issue that may 
come before the World Court shortly.
<P>
	This is simply a preface to the fact that the present American 
President has made massive steps since his election to fill in the 
uncompleted gaps in the outlawing of nuclear weapons. He is 
moving to extend the IMF treaty to short range nuclear weapons 
and to the intercontinental ones which are only covered to a 
certain extent laterally by SALT I and its interim agreement on 
protocols limiting the numbers of strategic warheads. President 
Clinton is a man of peace and committed to nuclear 
disarmament.
<P>
	This brings me to the present issue that nuclear warheads are 
not involved in the testing of the cruise missiles in Canada's 
northern territories. Clearly there is no violation of international 
law involved.
<P>
	The issues of political choice and wisdom are what is 
involved here. I hesitate to draw on my experience as a 19-year 
old airman and flyer. I have always understood that the tests 
were authorized in Canada simply because we replicated the 
northern approaches to the then Soviet city of Leningrad. I have 
flown over these northern approaches from Archangel to 
Leningrad in a civilian capacity. The comparison to northern 
Canada is very close.
<P>
	However, that is all gone. The cold war is gone. What we have 
is an agreement entered into in good faith with a friend and ally 
whose fulfilment is being asked by that friend and ally at this 
stage. There is a case, the strongest of cases, for observing 
agreements if one has entered into them: pacta sunt servanda.
<P>
	On that basis, unless there were an issue of violation of 
international law or some other high policy reason, I would say 
one should observe international agreements. I would hope that 
our government will speak to President Clinton, would 
encourage him in his move towards  completing nuclear 
disarmament and raise the questions about whether the tests are 
necessary.
<P>
	I would warn against any temptation to a unilateral 
repudiation of an engagement made because it invites unilateral 
reactions of the same nature. There are American senators who 
wish to make changes in American law to cut down on 
obligations that the United States and Canada have entered into 
in trade and other matters. Retaliation in these sorts of unilateral 
actions is something one has to bear in mind.
<P>
	There is a case for the Canadian government to speak candidly 
to its friend, the United States, and say: ``Do you really need 
these? We will go along nevertheless in good faith if you do''.
<P>
	I am persuaded by two further arguments. One is the 
dependence, the settled expectations, of communities in the 
north that have built local economies and local employment on 
the continuance of these testings. There is a concept of due 
process that settled expectations should not suddenly be 
displaced unless there is a good reason to the contrary. I do take 
note of the economic interests and concerns of people in those 
northern regions who are represented by some of the members 
opposite.
<P>
	I also take note of the views of our colleague, the member for 
Western Arctic, whose views as published I have read. It is clear 
that there objections by native communities to these tests and on 
the usque ad coelum principle. To translate simply, if they own 
part of the terrain below then they own the air space above. To 
that extent the tests, as an unnatural user without the prior 
courtesy of asking permission, are something to be avoided at 
all costs.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest strongly that if the tests continue the 
Canadian government should consider asking the United States 
to provide compensation for the infringement of the property 
rights of the native people through whose territory it passes. I 
understand the objections of the native people. It may not have 
been relevant in 1983 but the juridical conscience of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="403"> 403 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian people and others has evolved and I think we should be 
respectful of property rights of this sort.
<P>
	My message is very clear on this. We are committed. It has 
been one of the main points in Canadian foreign policy formed 
by a succession of Canadian foreign ministers and distinguished 
ambassadors for disarmament. I recall General Burns, Doug 
Roche from the Conservative side and Alan Beesley, my friend 
who is a career civil servant. We led in nuclear disarmament. We 
should lead. We should encourage the American president who 
has a forward looking and constructive view there.
<P>
	On the cruise missile test, I do not think it is a major issue. For 
nuclear disarmament groups I would recommend attention to the 
potential World Court project launched by the Ileana group. I 
would  recommend attention to the concerns of our native 
peoples and on that basis I am prepared to continue to support 
the continuance of the missile tests at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to commend the hon. member opposite for a very well 
crafted and informative presentation. I do not have a question. I 
merely wanted to rise and tell him it was a very illuminating and 
very well crafted presentation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> I listened 
carefully to the speech by my colleague, the member for 
Vancouver Quadra. He gave a partial answer to my question but I 
still do not know if he is for or against those tests. Since he is 
from the Vancouver region, I would like him to tell us if his 
constituents gave him their opinion on that issue. Did he speak 
with them, did he get any information, can he tell us if yes or no 
his constituents agree with such testing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> I spoke about this very often with my 
constituents. On that point, I can tell you that I had agreed, 
before I was elected as member of Parliament, to be legal 
counsel before the International Court of Justice of The Hague if 
ever there were legal proceedings on that issue. And that does 
not go against what I just said. I tried to bring a balanced 
contribution to the debate; yes or no is too radical. Under the 
present circumstances, I think we should be allowed to say: 
``Yes, respect the agreement with the United States; it does not 
violate international law and does not go against our foreign 
policy objectives.'' If we want to change the international policy 
on disarmament, I believe there are better, more efficient ways 
of doing so. And I still hope Canada would take legal steps 
before the International Court of Justice of The Hague, and enter 
into what would be the case of the next century, to determine if 
nuclear testing is legal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his speech 
and I would like to point out first of all that while I welcome this 
parliamentary debate, I think that certainly what the member for 
Winnipeg South Centre promised one year ago and committed 
the Liberal Party to and called on the Conservative Party to 
implement was in fact public hearings to enable members of the 
public to be heard, whether it was peace groups, aboriginal 
peoples or northerners, on this important issue. While it is 
important that politicians be heard, I would have hoped that the 
Liberal government would have given an opportunity to 
ordinary Canadians to be heard.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	There is a more fundamental issue here and I want to put the 
question directly to the member for Vancouver Quadra. It is a 
question about political integrity and political honesty.
<P>
	I have a document which was sent out by the Liberal Party of 
Canada dated September 15, 1993. It is a document which is in 
response to a questionnaire from End the Arms Race. In this 
document is this question: ``Canada is allowing the United 
States to test its nuclear capable cruise missiles in Alberta as 
well as low level flight training by NATO in Labrador. Will your 
party cancel further testing of the cruise missile and low level 
flight training in Canada?'' The answer of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, presumably including the member for Vancouver 
Quadra, was as follows: ``Liberals have opposed further testing 
of the cruise missile since 1987. We will bring this testing 
program to an end''.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Vancouver Quadra what 
happened to that promise?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know very well that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of 
cruise missile testing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What happened to that promise of the Liberal Party of Canada 
to bring an end to these tests and what happened to the integrity 
and the honesty of the Liberal Party of Canada in making that 
commitment to the people of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see no contradiction there. It 
may be an issue of tactic, including diplomatic usage. It would 
be in my view a voie de fait, or tort unilaterally to denounce an 
agreement duly made and continued by predecessor 
governments with a foreign government.
<P>
	I place great stress as my party does on friendly persuasion. 
We are not faced with George Bush as the president of the United 
States. We are faced with a president who had the same teachers 
I had and who is committed to nuclear disarmament and with all 
due speed. We will use friendly persuasion in Washington. We 
have a new relationship with Washington that is not one of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="404"> 404 </A></B>
<P>
subservience or of following the line. We will be the candid 
friend as we were in the days of Lester Pearson.
<P>
	My answer is that while honouring the obligation, duly 
established and conserving international law in that respect, we 
will use friendly persuasion with the United States and I think 
we will have a friendly reception.
<P>
	The nuclear weapon tests in my view are anachronistic in 
military terms. They are out of date. They are not armed with 
nuclear warheads. I respect that there are consequences for local 
populations. I have tried to ascertain the views of the native 
peoples. I have suggested correcting what I think was a 
deliberate oversight, a discourtesy to them, by the providing of 
compensation.
<P>
	Let us face it. There is a new wind in Washington. It is not 
George Bush, it is not the revived cold war. Let us go to work and 
ask them to change and using friendly persuasion in the Lester 
Pearson way I think we can achieve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I believe 
there is still time remaining in the period for questions and 
comments. I would like a very brief supplementary question to 
the member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time has expired. The 
members on the government side are splitting their questions 
into 10 and 5. I realize for all members that 5 minutes is not a 
lengthy time but we have certainly exhausted that 5 minutes of 
questions and comments relative to the last speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with some 
pride that I rise for the first time in this House. I would like to 
thank the electors of Rosedale for confiding in me the 
responsibility for speaking in this House and for this first time 
on such an important motion. I will not take the liberty of the 
traditional introductory speech for members to speak of the 
characteristics of my riding. I hope my constituents will forgive 
me that liberty, but I understand that the rules of this debate are 
that we are to restrict ourselves to the question at hand.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying it is clear from all the debate, 
from everyone in this House, that we are all concerned with the 
same matter. That is to say the peace and security of this country 
and the security of Canadians wherever they may be in a world 
which is becoming increasingly interdependent and in many 
ways more complicated and in some ways more threatening.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In that context it seems to me we have two debates before us 
today. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra referred to a time 
warp. I would say there is an element of a time warp here. There 
is the old debate about the cruise missile, the one with which we 
are all familiar. That debate is about whether we will allow 
territory of our country to be used to further the development of 
a nuclear weapon for our neighbours to the south.
<P>
	Many of us were very troubled by such a concept. With what 
we can seriously call the end of the cold war we saw no need to 
pursue such an agenda. I personally would not argue in favour of 
such an agenda even if it were to support the position taken by 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra in terms of respecting 
international agreements. The hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra is a sophisticated international lawyer. He knows that 
agreements may be interpreted and discussed.
<P>
	I would put it on a somewhat different ground. I would 
suggest there are new considerations we must look at. There is a 
new agenda. There are new issues which we must examine in the 
House to decide whether it is opportune today to permit 
continued cruise missile testing. I would like to review those 
considerations.
<P>
	For me the end of the cold war has not made an easier, simpler, 
safer world in which to live. Various members have referred to 
that in their speeches today. I see a  world in which we have new 
forms of dangers to our country and to our citizens.
<P>
	Let me put it in terms of our country. There are new countries. 
There are new threats. There are the Libyas and the North 
Koreas which have been mentioned before today. In addition 
there are whole groups of people, I would suggest, in this new 
technological age who have access to sophisticated weaponry 
which in previous times was restricted almost exclusively to the 
great powers. It was mentioned by one former speaker in this 
debate that many smaller groups with less sophistication and 
with less money can have access to technology which could 
represent a serious threat to the integrity of Canada and, I would 
suggest, to our soldiers who may be serving in conflicts around 
the world.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the debate yesterday on 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. One clear point from that debate was that 
Canadian troops, men and women, would be engaged in world 
enterprises for a long time in the future. The United Nations is 
developing its format for the way in which we will continue to 
participate in peacekeeping activities. We owe it to those men 
and women to ensure that they have the best training and the best 
technological information available to them to defend 
themselves.
<P>
	That raises the question which I think is really the one we 
must have before us today. In the new environment in which we 
live where threats are different from what they were before, in 
this time when there are threats from new forms of enemies, will 
the testing of this unusual and very sophisticated weapon, which 
is no longer restricted to nuclear capacity but to conventional 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="405"> 405 </A></B>
<P>
capacity, enable Canadians to defend themselves better from the 
threat of the use of such weapons against them in the future?
<P>
	From the reading I have been able to do there is a double 
reason for these tests. One is directed toward enabling the 
United States to perfect this weapon. The other equally 
important one about which we must ask ourselves or draw 
attention to today is to enable us to understand how these 
weapons work and to provide adequate defences to them.
<P>
	All of us in the House watched the gulf war, saw the defence of 
Tel Aviv against the Scud missiles and watched the Patriot 
missiles work. If by watching this missile work and 
participating in these tests we would enable Canadian forces 
either in this country or elsewhere in the world to defend 
themselves against a similar attack by a similar missile, would 
not the test of such a missile have been worth while? That is the 
question that I ask myself. That is the question I would direct to 
the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I urge the government, the minister of defence and cabinet to 
consider this matter. The minister of defence has clearly said 
that they are considering the matter. If they can assure the House 
and assure themselves on the best technological and military 
advice they have that as a  result of these tests we will be 
obtaining information that will enable us to defend ourselves in 
this country or our troops to defend themselves elsewhere in the 
world, we should allow this testing to go forward.
<P>
	It seems to me that would be in the spirit of what I would call 
the new agenda of defence that is necessary in a world where 
new threats are evolving with which we are not yet familiar from 
sectors with which we are not familiar and from technologies 
that are being developed and falling into the hands of many 
disparate groups about which we have no idea in today's 
context.
<P>
	That is the new agenda of the debate. It is no longer a debate in 
respect of the cold war and the testing of a missile device which, 
in the sort of star wars concept, is to deliver a knockout blow to 
the Soviet Union. It is the testing of a sophisticated weapon in 
order to determine our own ability to defend ourselves against it.
<P>
	It is my personal belief that testing will enable us to do that. I 
believe it would be in our interest as Canadians both in our own 
country and in respect of our troops serving in the United 
Nations or other capacities abroad.
<P>
	Finally I would like to leave members of the House with one 
last thought. As other members have pointed out this is a global 
issue. It is a matter of geopolitics and our relationships with our 
American neighbour to the south. I will cite the member for 
Western Arctic, the hon. Secretary of State for Training and 
Youth. In 1989 she said: ``What Canada needs is a defence 
policy, not in terms of cruise missile tests or nuclear submarines 
but in service of an overall security strategy emphasizing 
economic, environmental and non-military elements of 
security''?
<P>
	It seems we have an opportunity, if we expect to allow the 
Americans to continue these tests, of recognizing that we will 
get benefits from them. Let us press them as part of that package 
to participate in the Arctic council proposed by the government, 
by this party. Let us propose to the Americans, who are the ones 
presently blocking it, the development of an Arctic council that 
will recognize the participation of the peoples in the north who 
must live with northern developments. They should participate 
in their future and have a say and thereby enable this as a 
peacemaking, as a defensive measure to go forward and 
enabling Canada to participate more fully in a area of the world 
where we are fortunate enough to have an important border and 
important neighbours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the hon. member for his remarks with which 
I generally agree. I think he is right in saying that there are two 
debates: the old one and the new one in the context in which we 
now find ourselves.
<P>
	I must admit that, in the old debate, I was personally and 
completely opposed to cruise missile testing because, at the 
time, they were only adding to a nuclear arsenal already horrible 
and terrifying for the whole planet.
<P>
	In those days, in that old debate, as soon as something new 
happened in the area of armament, there was always someone in 
the intelligentsia, in Quebec as well as in the rest of Canada, who 
rose in disgust claiming that we should stop pouring huge 
amounts of money into armament. That was part of the old 
debate and at that time, you would have found me on the 
barricades or marching to protest against cruise missile testing.
<P>
	In this new debate, with the end of the cold war, there still 
remain areas of the world which pose a threat for democratic 
nations like ours. There are countries that rule through 
terrorism, choking off democracy. We saw an example of this 
during the gulf war and we saw that with the kind of 
interventions called for by the UN, we can avoid massive killing 
of civilian populations. This kind of equipment and its 
sophisticated guiding mechanism makes it possible to hit a 
target dead on, with a minimum of civilian casualties.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I now think, in this new debate, that to protect democracy as 
such, in our country and everywhere else, it is important to be 
equipped with the proper tools, no longer aimed at massive 
destruction, but at delicate surgery to excise those threats to 
democracy.
<P>
	My question is this: After what I have said, do you agree that 
some countries should increase their activities against terrorism 
on the international level by using this type of surgical tool to 
strike down those anti-democratic offenders? Do you think that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="406"> 406 </A></B>
<P>
such a tool could be more useful rather than less useful in the 
present debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hesitate to say how much I am 
glad of the support that the member of the Bloc has given my 
argument, but I can tell him that he is following my own line of 
thought.
<P>
	I was rather of the same opinion. In the old debate, I was 
completely against the tests but the situation has now become 
much more delicate and complex. One of the complexities that 
must be taken into account is precisely the element of terrorism 
linked to the multiplication, the proliferation of sophisticated 
weapons, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred in his 
speech before the House.
<P>
	So I come back to my proposition: Can the government give 
members of this House in the present debate the assurance that 
the tests in question will improve that type of defence against 
those weapons? If the government can give us this assurance, I 
think it would be our duty to accept its explanation and to carry 
on with the tests until we have the best possible defence in a 
world which has become more complex, more difficult and to a 
certain point much more dangerous.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With less than two 
minutes remaining for questions and comments, I recognize the 
hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had hoped to be able to take a bit more than two 
minutes, but I will not abuse the rights of the Chair and will 
summarize a letter I received today.
<P>
	My riding is in northwest Saskatchewan on the border with 
Alberta and contains the Saskatchewan side of the Primrose 
Lake weapons range, as well as the home of the Canoe Lake 
Indian Band which some years ago placed a claim on the lands 
now occupied by the Department of National Defence for the 
testing of various weapons and training systems.
<P>
	The member talked about involving northerners and I assume 
aboriginals in the decision making, et cetera. Therefore I would 
like to ask him a question relating to a letter sent to the Prime 
Minister of Canada yesterday by the Chief of the Canoe Lake 
Band.
<P>
	The chief indicated that the Government of Canada rejected 
the claim of the band to those lands but that the Indian Claims 
Commission established to inquire into this claim and others 
had recommended the acceptance of the Canoe Lake claim on 
the Primrose Lake land.
<P>
	The letter to the Prime Minister today asks the government, in 
addition to considering the testing of the cruise missile, to 
consider the report and recommendations of the claims 
commission that the claim be accepted. The chief of the Canoe 
Lake Band indicates that as in similar situations in Canada the 
Primrose Lake air weapons range testing program has been very 
detrimental to the people who live nearby the Primrose Lake air 
weapons range and therefore this program is quite detrimental to 
them.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Would the member indicate whether he is prepared to accept 
the invitation, put on the table by the Canoe Lake Band, to 
approach the Prime Minister to discuss as participants in this 
process the acceptance of their claim?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two elements to the 
member's question and I would like to start by going back to the 
finish of my talk which, given the time constraints, I did not 
have time to address properly.
<P>
	The thrust of what I was trying to say about the Arctic 
Council-and I would recommend this to the hon. member 
because it does not directly relate to the Canoe Lake Band to 
which he refers-is that it is a proposal which has been espoused 
in Canada for a long time. It would involve the Soviet Union, 
Alaska and all the countries and participants in the Arctic 
Circle. It would enable the peoples of that area, including the 
aboriginal peoples of the Soviet Union and other countries in the 
Arctic area, to get together and co-operate.
<P>
	As a backbencher what I was urging on the government was 
that if the testing was to go forward an opportunity might be 
seized to say to our American counterparts that if they proceed 
with these tests we would like to see some movement on the 
development of the Arctic Council. This might go some way 
toward  addressing the concerns of the member for Western 
Arctic to which I referred in my talk.
<P>
	Forgive me but I am not familiar with the specific concerns of 
the Canoe Lake Band and the facts to which the member 
referred. Therefore just in the light of what he told me, it would 
seem that the position is more than reasonable to say that we 
should pursue with all vigour an examination of the legitimacy 
of the claims and do our best to make sure of the result in the 
light of the debate and see if we can make sure that anybody 
living in the area where the missile might or might not be tested 
would be ensured of the full preservation of their rights as was 
suggested by my hon. friend, the member for Vancouver Quadra, 
in his intervention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> On my first formal 
speech in this House, I am pleased to extend to you, Mr. Speaker, 
my most sincere congratulations on your election to this 
distinguished position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="407"> 407 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those who 
have been appointed to be your substitute in the Chair. I can 
assure you all of my full support and co-operation as well as that 
of the other members from my party.
<P>
	Allow me to also take this opportunity to pay my respects to 
the constituents of the federal riding of Verchères who, by 
putting their trust in me on October 25, have given me the 
privilege of representing them in this House.
<P>
	I have been a fervent sovereigntist since I was 15-and as we 
saw earlier, sovereigntist is used by the hon. member for Beaver 
River as a synonym for ``enemy within''. In those days, I never 
imagined that some day I would be representing my fellow 
citizens in the House of Commons, the symbol par excellence of 
the Canadian federal system. But I have the pleasure of 
belonging to a political party, namely the Bloc Quebecois, 
whose raison d'être happens to be to advance the cause of 
Quebec sovereignty in this House.
<P>
	Of course, Quebec has not achieved the status of sovereign 
state yet. It is still part of this vast country we call Canada. And 
if I start my speech on cruise missile testing by emphasizing this 
concept of sovereignty so dear to my heart, it is simply because 
in certain spheres the testing issue is viewed as an attack on the 
sovereignty of Canada.
<P>
	There are people who claim that renewing the Canada-U.S.A. 
umbrella agreement and periodic authorization regarding cruise 
missile testing within Canadian territorial boundaries is akin to 
an unacceptable surrender to the imperatives of the foreign and 
defence policy of our neighbours to the south, an infringement 
upon the political sovereignty of Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Exactly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> But since any sovereign state must be able to 
protect its borders, we must recognize that  Canada's political 
and territorial sovereignty depends to a large extent on its 
participation in the collective security system provided under 
NATO and NORAD.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	We must recognize that Canada does not have the resources 
required to defend its huge territory by itself.
<P>
	Canada has been a member of NATO since 1949 and of 
NORAD since 1958. Cruise missile tests are not strategically 
tied to NORAD since this organization's mandate, namely the 
surveillance of North America, is essentially defensive in 
nature. The use of the cruise missile must be seen in that context 
mainly as a counter-offensive measure. However, cruise missile 
tests improve detection and interception techniques that fall 
under NORAD's mandate.
<P>
	Since Canada does not stockpile strategic arms and bases its 
defence policy on the collective security system put in place 
under NATO, it must volunteer to co-operate with its allies in 
putting in place a strategic deterrent force if necessary.
<P>
	Under this approach, Canada was asked in 1983 to approve 
cruise missile tests on its territory despite the fact that this 
nuclear deterrence strategy was not directed linked to NATO's 
strategy. This was aimed at maintaining a strategic balance 
between the two superpowers in a then bipolar world.
<P>
	The international situation has changed since the dismantling 
of the Warsaw pact and the Eastern Bloc. Nevertheless, the 
nuclear threat has remained and become even more complex 
with the arrival of new nuclear powers. I am thinking of Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan, for example. In its 1992 defence policy, 
Canada recognized that the geopolitical environment had 
changed considerably and that the global balance of power was 
no longer based on a bipolar structure. We have witnessed the 
gradual emergence of new nuclear powers, which are often very 
politically unstable. Under such circumstances, it was risky for 
Canada and its allies to question the collective security system 
their defence policy had been built on since the days of the cold 
war. The cruise missile is a weapon perfectly suited to the new 
strategic context and illustrates our current collective security 
system.
<P>
	The tests requested by the U.S. administration are not 
designed to encourage the escalation of new nuclear 
technologies. The START I and START II treaties already limit 
the number of deployed missiles. This ceiling cannot be 
exceeded either in terms of the number of missiles deployed or 
in terms of striking force, that is the size of nuclear heads.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that this type of missile can be used for 
conventional-type missions, which is certainly not without 
importance. Even though nuclear weapons were not used in the 
Persian Gulf, that conflict demonstrated the effectiveness of 
very localized attacks on well-defined targets. We saw cruise 
missiles used to destroy armed command posts, conventional or 
chemical  weapons storage sites and even conventional, 
chemical and nuclear, or should I say potentially nuclear, 
weapons manufacturing plants. Had it not been for these 
missiles, massive bombing strikes would undoubtedly have 
been undertaken to destroy these targets. Heavy conventional 
bombing strikes would have exacted a very high toll in human 
lives since the majority of the sites destroyed were located in 
densely populated areas. Because this type of weapon was used, 
the heavy bombardment which could have resulted in a great 
many civilian casualties was not necessary.
<P>
	Although some cruise missiles launched during the Persian 
gulf war did in fact miss their targets, there is no question that 
they proved to be an effective weapon. But the fact remains that 
certain flaws inherent in the design of the cruise missile resulted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="408"> 408 </A></B>
<P>
in targeting errors. New technologies have been developed to 
correct these design flaws and the United States now needs to 
conduct tests, and hence extend new missile development 
programs. The purpose of the testing over Canadian soil is to 
improve and perfect the cruise missile guidance system.
<P>
	These tests are conducted no more than two or three times a 
year over sparsely populated areas. The impact on the ecosystem 
and on local populations is therefore minimal.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out that these tests do not involve any 
outlay of Canadian public funds, since under the terms of the 
umbrella agreement, the United States covers all costs 
associated with tests of this nature. Therefore, the testing would 
not lead to any increase in our national defence budget.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, while firmly opposing the continuation 
of the arms race, cannot ignore the unstable international 
environment since the dismantling of the former U.S.S.R. and 
the potential threats now facing the world. NATO recently 
wanted to show this spirit of co-operation which should 
normally exist in the aftermath of the cold war, by making a 
gesture of openness to the countries of eastern Europe. Mr. 
Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in 
Russia, replied that admitting these countries to NATO could 
only lead to a third world war. The rise of the extreme right in 
Russia and the growing number of nuclear powers mean that it 
would be imprudent and irresponsible to lower our guard and not 
to follow global strategic developments closely.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, Canada cannot afford to call into 
question its defence commitments to its allies. Its international 
credibility would be greatly affected as would its special 
relationship with the United States. A deterioration in political 
relations between Canada and the United States could have 
negative economic and trade consequences, at a time when it is 
already rather difficult for us to have the spirit of the free trade 
agreement respected and its various provisions enforced.
<P>
	The present international environment therefore requires us 
to maintain the collective security system structures to which 
we belong and as a result Canada must keep its commitments in 
this regard. Nevertheless, we should follow international 
developments and adapt our defence policy to new global 
realities if necessary. On the basis of these new realities, we 
might even be called upon to review our international defence 
commitments. It is therefore essential that the government make 
a formal commitment to repeat annually the exercise in which 
we are participating today and to submit the question of cruise 
missile testing to Parliament for discussion and approval every 
year.
<P>
	In closing, I wonder about the government's intentions for 
Canada's defence policy. The speech from the throne announced 
that Canada's defence policy would be redefined. Barely a week 
after the speech from the throne was read, even before the 
government's defence policy has been defined and a public 
debate has begun on this new defence policy, the government is 
asking Parliament to deal with two issues that directly concern 
Canada's defence policy, namely the presence of Canadian UN 
troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia and the authorization 
of cruise missile tests on Canadian territory. Does the 
government intend to make a decision on these two important 
questions before defining a new defence policy or is it just 
trying to sound out the opinion of the House of Commons on two 
fundamental aspects of this defence policy before it says where 
it stands? Although we are glad that the government is 
consulting parliamentarians on these two important issues, we 
can well wonder why this exercise is going on at this particular 
time. This government initiative smells of improvisation and 
seems like a diversionary tactic.
<P>
	This debate on cruise missiles is only meaningful to the extent 
that it is directly related to the Canadian government's defence 
policy. Since we do not know what the government intends to 
propose for redefining Canada's defence policy, we think that no 
real debate can take place and no final decision on cruise missile 
testing on Canadian territory can be made until the government 
tables its white paper on defence policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
commend the member of the Bloc Quebecois for the remarks 
that he just gave. I have a few comments on the back part of the 
speech and perhaps a question or two.
<P>
	The member has indicated clearly his position and the 
position of his party as enunciated a little earlier by the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois, the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	However he asked a question at the end of it. Specifically he 
said: ``Why are we going through this exercise now? Why the 
consultation at this period of time?'' It is fairly clear that during 
the election campaign the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party, 
which is now  the government, indicated that this would be a 
different type of Parliament.
<P>
	I have been here since 1988. This is only my second term, but 
I can certainly tell the members that the type of consultative 
approach that has been taken in just the first 10 days of this 
Parliament is vastly different than what this place has seen in the 
past. This is an effort by this government to try to change the 
way this place does business.

<P>
	Yesterday we had a debate in this House concerning the role of 
Canada's peacekeepers specifically in Bosnia-Hercegovina. I 
think it was extremely productive.
<P>
	The first item on the news last night was that this place, which 
had been far too partisan in the past, far too pro forma in just 
rubber stamping government policy that was decided in the 
PMO and in that inner circle of the cabinet, was going to be a 
little different now.
<P>
	The consultative process which started yesterday and allows 
members from this side of the House, backbenchers who are not 
members of the cabinet to voice differences of opinion on key 
policy areas is refreshing.
<P>
	We are having this debate today because the Prime Minister 
has indicated that as we develop our policy on issues such as this 
and put our legislative framework together, members from all 
sides of this House will have a right to input. That is vastly 
different from what I have seen in my last five years in this 
place.
<P>
	I conclude by indicating that the comments the hon. member 
and others in this House made today will go a long way in 
deciding the process by which we develop a long-term policy.
<P>
	The comments the member made that perhaps we should have 
a defence white paper is an issue that has seized members of this 
House and the Canadian public in the past. I believe that the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence have 
indicated that in these matters of defence policy it is not good 
enough to wait until the entire review is done. Some time early 
in the session we must ask the members of this House for some 
input.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the hon. member believes in the 
consultative process. I look forward to his comments as the 
government gets under way with committees on the 
comprehensive review of national defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I simply want to say that I understand the enthusiasm 
of my colleague regarding the fact that the Prime Minister has 
allowed this House to speak on an issue before the government 
policy is announced. I understand that the member has been here 
for a few years and this is the first time he has an opportunity to 
speak freely on a government policy before such a policy  is 
made public. Consequently, I can certainly understand his 
enthusiasm.
<P>
	However, what I object to is not this opportunity to express 
our views in the House on this issue, but rather the chronological 
process involved. To use a common expression, I feel that the 
government has &quot;put the cart before the horse&quot; to the extent that 
we start this debate without even knowing where the 
government is headed with its defence policy.
<P>
	You will agree with me that if the government decides that the 
collective security system which has been in place since the late 
forties is no longer adequate and that we must withdraw from it, 
such a decision will have a major impact on the continuation of 
the cruise missile tests conducted over the Canadian territory. 
Consequently, we cannot discuss this issue without first 
undertaking a comprehensive review of the Canadian defence 
policy.
<P>
	Therefore, the chronology of events is not perfectly logical. I 
agree that a debate had to be held, that it should be held, and I 
have no objection to that. However, this debate should take place 
once we know the general outline of the national defence policy.
<P>
	Moreover, we are asked to participate in this debate with only 
a few days notice, and without any opportunity to have access to 
documents from the Department of National Defence. 
Consequently, we parliamentarians are not well prepared for 
this exercise. I hope that it was not the deliberate intention of the 
government to announce a debate at the last minute and to give 
instructions to the Department of National Defence to not 
provide us with documents which might be necessary for the 
purpose of the debate.
<P>
	This is what I object to. I certainly have nothing against a 
debate as such. It is a good thing to allow members to express 
their views on a government policy, but we have to know what 
the general outline of that policy is, so as to see if what we are 
debating will still be part of the policy in a few weeks or a few 
months.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too wish to thank the hon. member, my colleague and I hope, my 
friend, for his very fine maiden speech. Although he indicates 
that he did not have much time to be made ready, he certainly did 
a good job, especially on some of the technical details.
<P>
	I have a hypothetical question to put to the member, Mr. 
Speaker, and if I could be forgiven for a hypothetical question I 
would be happy to accept a hypothetical answer. That is, if this 
test were to be taking place in northern Quebec rather than in the 
northwestern part of Canada, would the hon. member's 
comments, concerns and questions be the same?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> I want to thank the hon. member for his 
hypothetical question, and I will try to be as specific as I can in 
my answer.
<P>
	The question is hypothetical to the extent that these tests are 
not scheduled to take place over Quebec territory. If that were 
the case, however, we would have to ensure, as has been done in 
the case of cruise missile testing since 1983, that the tests are 
carried out under the best possible conditions, which means, as I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="410"> 410 </A></B>
<P>
pointed out earlier, within a corridor away from populated areas, 
where there would be very little impact on the environment.
<P>
	If these conditions were met, I think that our answer would be 
the same as the one we give today for tests in western Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is a very sad day for thousands of Quebecers who 
support the peace movement.
<P>
	Personally, I am quite frankly disappointed, and I am even 
amazed at the position the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, and 
other members of the Bloc, have taken on this issue. The Bloc 
had a chance to say yes to a new era and no to the cold war. 
Unfortunately, the voices of Quebec that are very loud in the 
peace movement in Quebec are not reflected in the Bloc's 
comments.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. I heard 
one of his colleagues who disagreed with the very conservative 
position taken by the Bloc Quebecois. I have the following 
question for my Bloc colleague. We are talking about nuclear 
missiles. Would he agree that this would be very destabilizing, 
as was even suggested by the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, now Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
when in 1988 he mentioned the destabilizing effect of cruise 
missile technology on the international strategic balance. And 
he was right.
<P>
	Today, we have Mr. Zhirinovsky who is a threat in Russia. 
This would give Mr. Zhirinovsky a very important argument: 
``Look, they are testing cruise missiles in Canada!''
<P>
	Why does the Bloc Quebecois not consider the peace 
movement's position on these changes and recognize the 
significance of a new strategy that would reject cruise missile 
testing in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Again I want to thank the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway for his question which seems to be about 
the conservative position of the Bloc Quebecois on the issue of 
cruise missile testing.
<P>
	First of all, I get the impression that he did not listen properly 
to what I said, because we do not want to go back to the context 
of the cold war and use that as the basis for our policy. I made it 
quite clear in my speech that the Bloc's response to this 
particular question was based on a new global context, and I 
referred to the presence of Zhirinovsky in Russia and to the 
existence of new nuclear powers to justify continuing the tests.
<P>
	I also pointed out that the purpose of the tests was basically to 
improve and refine the missile's remote control system and that 
consequently the tests had no direct impact on the nuclear arms 
race.
<P>
	I would also like to say to the hon. member that if the hon. 
member for Papineau-Saint-Michel makes contradictory 
remarks, that is his problem, not mine.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> It is a pleasure to rise on 
debate today. Yesterday when we had the first day of debate on 
national defence issues I was not able to formally get on debate. 
I was up and down like a jack-in-the-box on questions and 
comments so I think I got most of my comments in yesterday.
<P>
	This is an important debate. As I just said to my hon. 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois and the Official Opposition, 
this is a different House. We started off this term in government 
with this Liberal government trying to uphold the rhetoric we 
had spouted while in opposition. That was that this House had to 
act differently and if we wanted to put some respect back into the 
way this place worked, we had to recognize that the 295 men and 
women who were elected to be here had the right to speak on 
issues that affect them and convey wherever possible the 
interests and points of view of the people they are here to 
represent.
<P>
	It is quite clear that today's debate on cruise missile testing is 
another example of the commitment given during the campaign. 
The issue of cruise missile testing, as my colleague from 
Rosedale indicated earlier, is a new debate. Many people who 
would have been getting up during the course of the day to 
support at least in the short term the continued testing of U.S. 
cruise missiles over Canadian soil, just a few short years ago 
may have been getting up and saying something quite different 
in debate.
<P>
	We have to recognize that the world has changed dramatically 
in the last five years. We have seen the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. The cold war has ended. I remember just a few short 
years ago listening to many of my colleagues, mostly from the 
New Democratic Party, who time and time again were preaching 
about a peace dividend and how the government of the day 
should withdraw, downsize, even do away with whole aspects of 
the defence establishment.
<P>
	I wish that their comments had borne fruit. But the reality is 
that the world has changed. The cold war is over, but the world 
today probably is even a less safe place than it was during the 
cold war.
<P>
	Previous debates that the public and parliamentarians have 
been seized with dealing with cruise missile testing in Canada 
are quite different from the debate today. The debate was 
whether or not the Canadian government by allowing cruise 
missile testing over Canadian soil was adding to or aiding in the 
escalation of the nuclear  armament between the two 
superpowers. Indeed, it was a consideration and a concern we all 
shared, even though we had different points of view on it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="411"> 411 </A></B>
<P>
	However, today's debate is not on that at all. We saw just two 
years ago in the gulf war that the U.S. technology, the cruise 
missile technology, can also be used in delivering strategic 
surgical, very precise blows to the arsenals of the opposing 
forces, in that particular case the Iraqis. I dare say that the 
technology that was developed yes, initially to deliver tactical 
nuclear weapons was used with conventional weapons in a way 
that minimized the loss of life and probably decreased the length 
of that war.
<P>
	The reality is that as Canadians, as parliamentarians, we are 
now facing a crisis in Canada. We are trying to develop, and we 
are inviting input from all members from all sides, a national 
defence policy, not just for this year or next, but for the future.
<P>
	The reality is that for a long period of time we have relied on 
our membership in international organizations like NORAD and 
NATO to provide us with collective security as a nation. I would 
go so far as to say that as a nation we probably spend very, very 
little on a per capita basis for our defence in comparison to other 
countries that are in the NATO alliance or NORAD.
<P>
	As part of a team, there is give and take. Yesterday we heard a 
lot about the give. Canada has given to the world a thing called 
peacekeeping in the great Pearson tradition. We debated that 
yesterday. We are the country with a small population which has 
excelled around the world and has gained support and credibility 
from our neighbours through the United Nations for our military 
efforts, not at making war or being an aggressor state, but as 
peacekeepers. That is the contribution we have made through 
the international community and through our NATO and 
NORAD agreements to peace and security. Let us be fair. The 
Americans, the giant that lives next door provides us, because it 
is in their strategic interest, with most of our national defence. 
We have to give something in return for that. What they have 
asked for in the past, and which has caused great concern among 
Canadians, was that we allow them to test the cruise missile on 
Canadian soil.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	What we are being asked to debate is whether it is the opinion 
of members of this House that the 10-year agreement which was 
renewed last year by the previous government should be upheld. 
Indeed we should try to stimulate debate in this place about what 
type of defence policy we do want.
<P>
	It is fairly clear. It was the Leader of the Opposition who 
quoted physicist Kosta Tsipis. The quote he used is important. It 
deals with the available technology that is used in the cruise 
missile itself. Mr. Tsipis indicated that any country that can 
manufacture simple aircraft can construct a cruise missile that 
can carry a ton of cargo at  least 300 miles and land no more than 
30 feet from its target.
<P>
	It is clear that we are dealing with the second generation of 
testing of cruise technology by the United States. We know that 
other countries have the technology to develop cruise type 
missiles. We know that some of those countries which have the 
technology to have cruise type missiles are not friendly or stable 
countries.
<P>
	We know with the collapse of the Soviet Union that much of 
the arsenal which was at least protected by the former 
communist government through force is now or perhaps will be 
up for sale. It would be foolhardy in seeking to maintain some 
type of international peace for the Canadian government not to 
at least in the interim until the defence policy is fully fleshed out 
through a review to uphold the commitment to allow the 
American government to come in and further test the cruise 
missile.
<P>
	What are they testing it for? Are they testing it because they 
want to put a nuclear warhead on it? No. That is not why they are 
doing it. From all I read this round of testing is basically to 
ensure that the United States will be able to develop some 
methods to better detect cruise missiles and similar technology 
from other countries.
<P>
	Is that a valid observation? I think it is and it is something that 
we have to agree to. If we look at where our Canadian troops are 
currently serving, we do not know if in a year, six months, or two 
years time that we are not going to see an aggressor force or 
some radical group in a civil war somewhere where our troops 
are using cruise technology against us.
<P>
	In this case the best defence is an offence, to look and see what 
it is we can do to aid the Americans in developing the second tier 
of technology in order to be able to detect low-level cruise type 
missiles that are coming from other countries.
<P>
	It is also important to look at what is going on today as a 
prelude to a much larger and much more necessary debate that 
will take place in this House.
<P>
	During the course of the campaign, the military and military 
expenditures became a major issue. One question kept being 
asked. I represent an area where we have all kinds of people that 
work in the Canadian military, probably over 10,000 or maybe 
15,000. We have the Canadian navy. We have CFB Shearwater. 
There are lots of individuals who are in the Canadian military.
<P>
	With the changing geopolitical situation, the Canadian 
government must seize the initiative and ensure that we have a 
modern defence policy. What we said during the campaign is 
that as a government we would initiate and conclude through 
broad consultation, not just the parliamentarians but all 
Canadians, what it is we should be doing through the United 
Nations in the interests of global peace and security and also in 
the interests of protecting our national sovereignty.
<P>
	Until that review is completed I would submit to the House 
that it is in the interests of international peace and  security and 
it is in the interest of Canada's standing in the world community 
through its adherence to international agreements that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="412"> 412 </A></B>
<P>
decision made by the previous government to continue to allow 
the American forces to test cruise missiles on Canadian soil be 
upheld. The decision to uphold it should be subject to the results 
of a comprehensive cross-Canada debate on what we want for 
our Canadian forces as a national policy in the future.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member just gave a speech with which I am in agreement for the 
most part. However, shortly before him, the hon. member for 
Rosedale, who is seated a few rows behind, used an expression 
with which I disagree, and I will ask his opinion on that.
<P>
	The hon. member for Rosedale was talking about the testing 
of a new weapon. I disagree with that, because this is not a 
weapon, at least that is what I understand from the hon. 
member's speech: It is not a weapon, it is a delivery system. In 
fact, it could probably deliver anything, even the mail for 
Canada Post. I can already see the name ``cruisolator''.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is that it could lead to civilian 
applications of the guidance system. Let us look at that element. 
It is a computer that knows the ground and can therefore find its 
way across land.
<P>
	We are already talking about cars that could follow a given 
itinerary with the help of automated guidance systems. We are 
told that the systems could even work within cities, not just in 
the countryside. This would be very convenient to come to the 
House every morning; we would not have to watch all this traffic 
on the bridges. I mentioned bridges because, as you might know, 
I live on the other side of the river.
<P>
	My point is: Has the hon. member considered the civilian 
applications that could possibly result from these cruise missile 
tests?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
raises some very interesting observations about the technology. 
I think he is right. We are talking about the testing of technology 
as it is embodied in the cruise missile, a jet-propelled unmanned 
rocket, with a guidance system on board.
<P>
	I am sure he would agree that most of the innovative 
technologies developed by the defence establishment have most 
times found applications within the civilian industrial complex.
<P>
	I am pleased he raised that. One of the things the Liberal 
Party, which is now the government, clearly indicated during the 
campaign is that we would have a program of defence 
conversion. Many of the industries that relied during the cold 
war on defence procurement and research and development on 
defence will get the  necessary government assistance now that 
there is a change in the geopolitical situation around the world. 
We will give some assistance to those industries to take new and 
innovative technologies that have been developed for a military 
purpose and help find applications for a civilian purpose.
<P>
	We on this side of the House believe by doing that we will 
ensure that the technologies that have been developed will not 
be lost as a result in the changing political situation around the 
world and that jobs for Canadians will be found with 
government assistance in bridging the gap between defence 
industries and civilian industries using defence technology.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I agree 
with his conclusion that we should continue within the 
framework of this agreement as passed by the previous 
government, he seems to be contradicting himself when he says: 
``Let us continue until we review it''. The agreement is supposed 
to be in place until 2003.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that we just agree to it for a 
year or two, or for six months? Do we have to go through this 
debate again in another 10 months to make another decision 
about whether or not we should continue? Are we putting this to 
rest for the whole term or are we just putting it to rest until the 
government gets a chance to review it further?
<P>
	I do not think the Americans would appreciate that kind of a 
decision.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will make it very clear. The 
debate today is about policy direction. We have a legal 
agreement with the United States but I am quite certain that a 
sovereign Government of Canada, if it felt it was the will of the 
Canadian public or part of an overall framework on defence 
policy that they could not fulfil a commitment, our neighbours 
to the south would understand and hopefully allow us to 
abrogate it.
<P>
	I am saying I support this agreement. However I do not want 
to prejudice the debate that will follow. It has to be an 
unencumbered debate that will take place during the defence 
review. I do not think you walk into a defence review saying we 
have decided ahead of time that 14 of these things are sacred 
cows so they cannot be touched, that 22 bases cannot be touched 
and you cannot talk about cruise missile testing in Canada.
<P>
	We want to engage parliamentarians and Canadians, both 
inside and outside the defence establishment, to develop a 
defence policy which first and foremost looks after the 
sovereign needs of Canada. I would hope that defence policy 
would focus quite heavily on things such as fisheries patrol, on 
drug interdiction in our coastal waters and on our commitment 
to the international community through the UN on 
peacekeeping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="413"> 413 </A></B>
<P>
	From my view what we have to do is say that the agreement 
that is in place is one we will uphold but let our American 
counterparts know there will be an open  and free debate in this 
country about what it is we want to do as a nation with our 
defence policy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by thanking the residents of Mississauga 
West for seeing fit to honour me by electing me to come to the 
House. Mississauga West is the second largest riding in the 
country and I am beginning to feel as though winning over 
140,000 residents was probably a lot easier than winning over 
my colleagues in the House. I feel like a dove among a lot of 
hawks.
<P>
	I am speaking today on a matter which I believe to be of great 
importance not only to the people of Canada but to Canada's 
enviable reputation in the world of international relations. I am 
speaking from my heart today rather than from a position of 
profound technical detail.
<P>
	As we know, for many years the American government has 
had ready access to Canadian airspace to test cruise missiles. 
Testing has been ongoing and evidently without conclusion. 
Every year we and our American neighbours continue to 
co-operate in this project despite the fact that hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians are fundamentally and vehemently 
opposed to our participation in the arms race.
<P>
	I congratulate the Prime Minister on his openness and 
willingness to discuss this important issue in the House of 
Commons. Canadians everywhere are watching this process and 
judging us on our commitment to parliamentary reform.
<P>
	The cruise missile testing question, despite some of the 
concerns, is an excellent example of this new process because I 
am, in fact, speaking against the majority of my party, from what 
I can gather.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to carefully consider the 
facts, the implications and the future possibilities associated 
with cruise missile testing. In the 10 years since the testing 
agreement was signed, the world is a profoundly changed place. 
It is hard to imagine even as recently as five years ago the fall of 
the Soviet empire, the return to democracy of much of eastern 
Europe or the new freedoms finally beginning in South Africa.
<P>
	Nearly everywhere there is a sense of excitement and hope 
and a belief in a future which is finally free from the prospect of 
global war. Against this backdrop the American and former 
Soviet governments have pulled back from mutual mistrust and 
the daily brink of confrontation. The Americans have a elected a 
new president, a president committed to world peace, the 
reduction of the military and the pursuit of domestic 
improvements in health, infrastructure and education. The 
resulting peace dividend will likely finance these new, more 
human programs in the United States.
<P>
	At no time in the recent past have both the governments of the 
United States and Canada been so similar in their stated goals of 
improvements in health, infrastructure and education. Our 
government must  support these objectives which are the 
dividends of peace and real global security.
<P>
	The cruise missile and other related nuclear weapons belong 
to a bygone time in world politics. It is doubtful that they ever 
really belonged in our nation. Since the beginning of such 
testing Canadians have been wary if not opposed outright to all 
forms of nuclear weapons and warmongering. Previous Liberal 
and Conservative governments have refused to accept nuclear 
warheads on Canadian soil.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Since the end of World War II Canada has been an 
independent, sensible and trusted middle power nation with an 
unassailable record for fairness and participation in world 
peacekeeping. At a time when Americans were busily hunting 
down suspected communists, destroying reputations and lives in 
the process, Canadians were serving in the middle east working 
toward a peaceful settlement in the Suez. In the 1960s Canada 
led the world in opening trade with China and the Soviet Union 
at a time when Americans were embroiled in the Vietnam war.
<P>
	Throughout our history Canadians have cherished our 
reputation and our independence. Right now we need once again 
to assert that independence and sovereignty over our domestic 
affairs and over our territory. It is time to cancel the cruise 
missile testing agreement with America. It is time to send a 
positive message of support and solidarity to people of such 
fragile democracies as Russia and Ukraine, nations which need 
positive reinforcement in their struggles to establish a 
democracy.
<P>
	We ask the members of the former Soviet Union to dismantle 
their nuclear weapons. We ask them to work toward peace and 
democracy. Yet we continue to send very mixed messages when 
we continue to allow missiles to be tested over our territory.
<P>
	Cruise missiles are designed to be used against the nations of 
the former Soviet bloc. That is why they are being tested over 
our land which is supposedly similar in terrain and weather to 
the former Soviet Union.
<P>
	The hypocrisy of preaching peace and demanding universal 
disarmament while continuing to test fundamentally offensive 
nuclear weapons is unacceptable to many Canadians. At a time 
when we should be leading by example we are instead blindly 
following the policies and practices of another time and another 
political reality.
<P>
	It is time to set a better example, to answer a higher call and to 
extend a hand of peace and friendship to our global neighbours. 
There are no winable nuclear wars. There are no good wars. 
There is no such thing as them and us. We are all part of an 
ever-shrinking world where weapons of the past and the policies 
of hate, mistrust and propaganda must now be put to rest forever. 
Canada has always been a world leader in peace. We must not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="414"> 414 </A></B>
<P>
lose this opportunity to make a fresh commitment to a safer 
future.
<P>
	We have all seen the terrible pictures from Bosnia and 
Ethiopia. We have heard the stories of torture and hate. 
Canadian peacekeepers are routinely caught in difficult 
situations where their lives and safety are in jeopardy. Who 
knows from day to day when the goodwill of foreign powers will 
run out? Who can predict when Canadian peacekeepers will 
suddenly not be welcome on that foreign soil? We need to do 
everything possible to ensure the overall safety of our soldiers 
no matter where they serve.
<P>
	The banning of cruise missile testing sends a strong message 
of disarmament and peace. In the eyes of the world we will be 
asserting our sovereignty and our commitment to global peace.
<P>
	In addition, our native people who have been overlooked 
during the past testing will finally enjoy the peace of mind that 
comes with not worrying about a missile buzzing overhead. Past 
governments have ignored native leaders. Their complaints 
have been trivialized and their legitimate environmental and 
safety concerns have been overlooked. We talked loftily about 
native self-government. We pat each other on the back 
whenever a dispute is settled with indigenous peoples. Yet we 
destroy whatever goodwill has been established by routinely 
violating their airspace with foreign aircraft and missiles. Over 
the Mackenzie Valley and delta and Beaufort Sea and over the 
lands of the Dene, Inuit and Métis cruise missiles fly at low 
levels in outrageous military war games.
<P>
	I wonder how long Americans could test missiles over the 
cities of southern Ontario. Can one imagine the outrage? Of 
course it is an unfair example but it does illustrate my point. 
Native people despite being vastly dispersed have a right to 
enjoy their lives and their environment without the potential of a 
disaster. We should be applying the same principles across all of 
Canada for all of our people.
<P>
	I ask that all members of this House carefully weigh the 
arguments put forward in this debate, consider the current global 
situation and weigh the concerns of environmentalists, native 
Canadians and others who have a vital interest in peace. The 
world is watching and we should be providing a strong 
leadership now and not some time in the future when everything 
is tested and perfect and we are fully armed.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I agree 
with the member who spoke before me and who mentioned the 
sovereignty and independence of our territory. I think that in the 
Bloc Quebecois we all accept this.
<P>
	Canada's primary mission in the world is peacemaking, 
peacebuilding or peacekeeping.
<P>
	May I first mention that before today's debate on missiles, we 
had yesterday, in this House, an extensive  special debate on 
Bosnia and the peacekeepers' mandate in that country. The 
purpose of that debate, which lasted over 14 hours, was to find 
out whether Canada should extend the peacekeepers' mandate in 
Bosnia after March 31, 1994, in spite of the tremendous cost of 
such a mission. Are we going to listen to our heart or our wallet?
<P>
	I think that we will listen to our heart for the following 
reasons: to protect senior citizens who are defenceless; to 
protect fathers and mothers whose role is to provide food and 
shelter to millions of children; and also to protect millions of 
children who are in danger.
<P>
	Regarding cruise missile testing, will we listen to our heart or 
our wallet? Maybe our heart, but then again maybe our wallet. 
Testing on Canadian territory is done at no cost to Quebec or 
Canadian taxpayers. Canada cannot afford an army the size of 
the United States' or Russia's.
<P>
	Should Canada be unfortunately dragged into war, its main 
ally would certainly be the United States. For a reason close to 
our heart, the cruise missiles are being refined to render them 
more efficient and to weaken the enemy with greater precision, 
without costing thousands of human lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I think the 
member should have the floor following the Bloc member. She 
had the floor for 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, I believe the 
hon. member is right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Madam Speaker, my difficulty is that I am only 
conversant in English so you will have to be patient with me.
<P>
	There was talk of protecting millions of children and families 
and about the Americans as our protector. I believe if there is a 
real war that involves Canada and the United States then nothing 
will protect us. I believe the Americans have an enormous army 
and an enormous capacity to be the traditional peacekeepers for 
the free world. They have done so and I am very grateful to them 
for this.
<P>
	I believe it is time we changed. I think to protect the millions 
of people and children and the next generation and the 
environment that we have to begin the business of not having 
standing armies and not having war and not threatening each 
other with weapons. The true protection, whether it costs money 
or does not cost money, is complete disarmament. I do not mean 
what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="415"> 415 </A></B>
<P>
looks like disarmament but in fact is the laying down of all arms 
in this world for the next generation.

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Madam Speaker, as this is

speakers. I am sure your  jobs will be challenging and rewarding 
and I pledge my full co-operation with the House rules and 
proceedings.
<P>
	My congratulations also to all members on their election or 
re-election to this Parliament. I look forward to meeting and 
debating with them on the important issues concerning Canada 
in a civil and productive manner.
<P>
	Also I would like to thank the constituents of my riding of 
Athabasca for entrusting me with this most important job during 
this most important and changing time in Canadian political 
history. I truly feel honoured by the great responsibility with 
which they have entrusted me and they can be assured that I do 
not take this responsibility lightly. I will do my best to represent 
their needs and Canada's needs in this new Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to send a special thank you to my wife, Evelyn, 
who has provided so much support and encouragement to me in 
meeting and accepting the challenges in this new role as member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	I became involved in politics and became a member of 
Parliament because of a great concern I have for the future of our 
country, the greatest country in the world to live in. Also I have a 
great concern for this country because of the apparent out of 
control public spending and spiralling debt at a time of declining 
of natural resources and high unemployment.
<P>
	Although this is my maiden speech, I wish to focus on the 
proposed cruise missile testing by the U.S. Although the 
Primrose Lake air weapons range, which will be the final 
destination for these exercises, is not in my riding, the flight 
corridor over which these missiles fly is in fact in my riding. 
Therefore these tests are of concern to my constituents and 
anything that could affect my constituents affects me as their 
representative in this House.
<P>
	I would like to commend the government for allowing this 
debate on such an important topic. I hope that this government 
will have the same open forum in the future when this 
government reviews its defence policy as promised.
<P>
	Before I speak to this issue let me tell a bit about my riding. 
The riding of Athabasca is in the northeastern part of Alberta 
and is approximately 196,000 square kilometres which makes it 
one of the largest ridings in Canada. To put this in perspective, if 
one combines the area of the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia and Prince Edward Island then the area of the riding of 
Athabasca would still be larger. These provinces have 25 
representatives between them in this House compared to one for 
Athabasca. You can imagine the enormity of my task in 
representing the constituents of Athabasca, however, I am ready 
and eager to accept all the challenges that await me.
<P>
	The principal industries of Athabasca are agriculture, 
forestry, mining, oil and gas and tourism. More specifically, the 
diversity of my riding includes ALPAC, the largest bleach kraft 
pulp mill in the world. It will  soon include a paper mill. Also, 
some of the most productive conventional oil and gas fields in 
Canada are located through Slave Lake and High Prairie in the 
northern areas of my riding. The Fort McMurray tar sands 
projects are in the northeast corner of my riding. These 
companies add enormously to the economic viability of the 
country.
<P>
	For example, the companies that work the tar sands make a 
huge contribution to both the federal and provincial 
governments. These companies employ thousands of people, all 
of whom pay taxes to support this government's programs. 
Syncrude, which is only one of the consortiums working the tar 
sands projects, employs 10,500 people directly or indirectly 
from which $1.5 billion has been paid out in corporate and 
personal income taxes. These tar sands deposits are very 
significant to the energy needs of Canada. In fact, it is estimated 
that there are enough oil reserves in my riding to provide 
self-sufficiency for Canada's oil needs, given the current 
consumption of 1.5 million barrels per day, for centuries to 
come.
<P>
	For example, the four known oil sands deposits are located in 
Alberta, two of which are in my riding. The total estimated 
bitumen contained in these four deposits is 1.7 trillion barrels. 
Of that, 307 billion barrels of bitumen recoverable with today's 
technology from the tar sands alone could supply Canada's 
energy needs for 475 years.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	My riding of Athabasca also has a large aboriginal population 
with 12 bands, about 50 reserves and a number of Métis 
settlements. This large population has led to my interest in 
native self-government and it is why I sit on my party's 
aboriginal committee.
<P>
	My riding also contains some of the most productive 
agricultural areas in Canada. The Westlock-Athabasca area has 
well known producers and exporters of high quality grain, 
oilseeds, pork and beef. I have been involved for many years in 
beef ranching and am proud to say that this is one of the least 
subsidized sectors in agriculture. It should be a model of free 
enterprise and free market operation for other areas of 
agriculture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="416"> 416 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with the comment my hon colleague from 
Essex-Windsor made in the House this past Monday when she 
said that a country that cannot feed itself is soon not a country 
and is at the mercy of every other nation.
<P>
	Taking this one step further, I also believe and history proves 
that a nation that cannot protect its sovereignty cannot long 
survive. This brings me to the topic of discussion before the 
House today.
<P>
	In 1983 the current Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Western Economic Diversification, who was 
then minister of defence, signed the original test evaluation 
agreement with the U.S.
<P>
	Recently this minister claims that Canada no longer needs 
these tests because the cold war is over. The cold war may be 
over but this world is still if not more unstable than during the 
cold war period.
<P>
	Instead of having one major threat, we now have many 
smaller threats. Although the Iron Curtain has fallen and they 
have opened their arms to us, this does not mean we live in a 
Utopian world. The recent gulf conflict in which both the 
Canadian Armed Forces and the cruise missile took part in made 
us astutely aware of that fact.
<P>
	Canadian participation in these tests enables us to fulfil our 
obligations under the NORAD alliance but also to keep abreast 
of the latest developments in defence technologies. By 
participating in these tests our forces gain valuable operational 
experience that would otherwise not be available.
<P>
	Also, if Canada is to be a member of such organizations as 
NORAD and NATO, my constituents and I believe we must be 
willing to participate in these organizations simply because we 
currently do not have the capacity without the support of our 
allies to defend our national sovereignty. I am not only speaking 
for myself but also for my constituents who are in the flight path 
of these exercises.
<P>
	The records which I have researched do not contain one 
complaint, one petition or one letter opposing these exercises 
from the constituents of Athabasca. My constituents are also 
aware that there is no environmental threat to them.
<P>
	The missiles used in these exercises are not armed. In fact, 
section 8 of the original Test and Evaluation Agreement states: 
``In no case shall nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare 
material be brought into Canada, and that the Cruise Missiles 
shall be unarmed''.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Department of National Defence has 
informed me that an extensive initial environmental assessment 
was conducted in 1983 and reviewed in 1989 and 1992. These 
studies showed that the cruise missile testing has no significant 
or adverse environmental impact.
<P>
	Furthermore, section 13 of this same agreement states that the 
flight corridors in Canada which are used for testing cruise 
missiles shall be selected in consultation with Canadians to 
ensure minimum disruption to civil aircraft operations and 
minimum disturbances to people on the ground.
<P>
	If this government were to rescind this agreement, an 
agreement that was signed by the Conservative government only 
last year, Canada as a participant in organizations such as 
NORAD would lose credibility as a nation that can be depended 
upon by our allies to co-operate in the preservation of peace and 
sovereignty in North America and the free world.
<P>
	As I stated earlier in my speech, I have consulted with my 
constituents. They are willing to accept their responsibility as a 
member of NORAD. I believe Canada should do the same.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member on his first speech. I 
know this is a productive House that we are working in.
<P>
	I want to make the general comment that continued cruise 
missile testing in Canada will contribute neither to the 
prevention of nuclear war nor to the further limitation of nuclear 
arsenals. Those were the reasons why this agreement was 
renewed in February 1993 by the previous government. In fact, 
this continued testing will instead serve only to undermine 
Canada's nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
<P>
	Under our present policy for nuclear proliferation, the 
Canadian government supports negative security assurances 
which means that we have international commitments not to use 
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states.
<P>
	On December 16, 1993 this government, of which I am a 
member, reaffirmed its support for negative security assurances 
when it voted to support the UN General Assembly resolution 
4873.
<P>
	Would the member care to consider whether or not this 
agreement, which in fact is a 10-year agreement and requires 12 
months notice to cancel, should continue to be supported given 
the developments over the last few years? Ten years seems to be 
an inordinate amount of time for this government to have an 
agreement. Would the member consider amending this 
agreement or shortening its terms by direction of this House 
now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe the debate in the 
House today is not about nuclear weapons. It is about the testing 
of a specific weapon known as the cruise missile which is quite 
capable of carrying non-nuclear weapons as was demonstrated 
quite effectively during the gulf war, in particular the guidance 
system of that particular weapon. Therefore, I do not think it in 
any way affects our commitments of non-proliferation of nu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="417"> 417 </A></B>
<P>
clear weaponry. I support the continued testing of the cruise 
missile and the guidance system thereof.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
particularly appreciated the speech by the member for 
Athabasca. Several points he raised are also concerns of mine. I 
am all the more happy as the member for Mississauga West, who 
spoke before him, mentioned that she would rather see the world 
disarm than go on with the testing.
<P>
	I would like to share a thought with the member for Athabasca 
and ask his comment on the matter. Let us compare the present 
situation to a car with a safety belt. I know I am a cautious driver 
but I know as well that  other cars could skid and bang into mine. 
That is why, even though I am a careful driver, I buckle up and I 
am awfully happy to know that this device underwent the 
appropriate testing.
<P>
	This is my question to the member for Athabasca: Would he 
agree that, in the present context, this testing is giving us a better 
guaranty of safety, even if we know that we will never live in a 
perfect world?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, I very much agree with the 
hon. member that in a perfect world there would be no need for 
armed forces and there would be no need for weaponry. 
Unfortunately, we are in a far from perfect world and as long as 
there are greedy people in this world with aspirations to conquer 
other countries and take over territories we will always need a 
means of defending ourselves. I support the testing on this basis.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, as this 
is my first speech in this House, I would like to take the 
opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his election and as 
well, to you, Madam Speaker, on your appointment.
<P>
	I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate all 
members who have just been elected to this 35th Parliament of 
Canada. It is a historic time for all of us and a new era. I am 
certainly looking forward to the opportunity to participate with 
some humility.
<P>
	I certainly want to thank the constituents of the Peace River 
riding for their confidence in me and also my family who has 
given me a great deal of support in the two years it has taken to 
achieve the goal of becoming a member of Parliament. I would 
also like to thank a number of friends in the riding.
<P>
	I would just like to relate the story of when I was home at 
Christmas. Somebody asked me how I was making out and I said 
I was starting to feel a little bit more comfortable in the House. 
However, they reminded me that I should not really get to feel 
too comfortable here. I think that is a good piece of advice.
<P>
	I just want to tell the House a little bit about the Peace River 
riding. My colleague from Athabasca has told us about his 
riding. We share a boundary. Together we represent sort of the 
northern half of Alberta. It is an extremely big riding, one of the 
largest ridings in Canada. The border on the west is the British 
Columbia border and on the north the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	Just a little bit of history about the Peace River riding: Some 
200 years ago there were two warring Indian tribes. They had 
gathered on the banks of the Peace River, a river that was not 
named at that point, for peace negotiations and therefore the 
name came about as the Peace River.
<P>
	It was an area that was a main artery to opening up western 
Canada. Alexander Mackenzie used that route to the Pacific 
Ocean in 1793, some 200 years ago.
<P>
	The area in general was settled in the early 1900s by 
immigrants from Europe, the United States, as well as people 
from eastern Canada developing a new territory. They were 
looking for new opportunities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> All maritimers out there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Some from the Ottawa area I believe as well.
<P>
	They were very innovative people. As a result of living in the 
northern climates they have had to be. Agriculture is probably 
the main industry, oil and gas is the second and forestry is very 
important to the riding as well.
<P>
	The city of Grand Prairie is the biggest centre in the riding. It 
is a city of some 30,000 people.
<P>
	The discussion today is very pertinent to my riding in that the 
cruise missile test does take place over a major corridor within 
the riding. Although, as somebody said earlier, the northern area 
is sparsely populated this is the most populated area along the 
cruise missile test route.
<P>
	I also want to say that this area is very similar to the area that 
the Americans were looking at in their test, It has a similar 
climate to that of Russia, particularly Moscow. We are on the 
same latitude.
<P>
	I just want to remind hon. members that I read the other day 
that Canada has the coldest capital of anywhere in the world so 
although I live in northern Alberta and we have a climate similar 
to Moscow that still makes it warmer than the climate here in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	The terrain is very similar as well.
<P>
	I would just like to say that the major debate over the cruise 
missile testing really took place 10 years ago. I really think to 
some degree this is a bit redundant today. The matter was raised 
and discussed to a great degree in 1983 before the testing took 
place and I do not think things have changed significantly since 
that time. As a matter of fact when the treaty was renewed in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="418"> 418 </A></B>
<P>
February 1993 the debate should have taken place at that time if 
it were that important.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	I do not hear any complaints or any concerns from people in 
my riding. I just came through an election campaign where I 
campaigned extensively and this issue was not raised on one 
single occasion. I do not know anyone who is opposed to the 
testing. There was little support in the riding for the ban of 
testing in 1983 and I think there is even less now.
<P>
	I do want to say that I welcome the review of defence policy 
that is coming up. We certainly encourage the government to do 
that, but we do have commitments that have to be met in the 
meantime. We have to honour those commitments. We signed a 
renewal in February and I believe we are bound by it.
<P>
	We heard yesterday in the peacekeeping debate that there still 
are trouble spots in the world, trouble spots that could develop 
into something major. The former Yugoslavian republic was the 
area where World War I  started and that is a trouble spot again. 
We know it has the potential for growing.
<P>
	We know there is some potential for problems in Russia 
although we certainly hope that democracy has taken firm root 
there and is going to continue to develop. However I do believe 
we have to be prepared.
<P>
	I wanted to say as well that we have relied heavily on our 
neighbours and friends to the south for help with our defences in 
the past. We need to continue to do that. We do have partners in 
NATO that we rely on. We are part of greater defence 
organizations and I believe we have to honour these 
commitments.
<P>
	It is my view the people of the Peace River riding support 
cruise missile testing in our area and in Canada. It is part of our 
defence. It is a deterrent. We have seen that deterrent used in 
Iraq very effectively. The UN had a mandate to go in and Canada 
was part of that UN mandate in that situation. The cruise missile 
was a big part of that deterrent.
<P>
	I support the continuation of the cruise missile testing in the 
riding. In my view that is backed up by the people in the Peace 
River riding as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have been dealing with the concept of sovereignty on the 
opposition side for some time now and obviously we are in a 
good position to place the debate in the context of protecting 
Canadian sovereignty. Our concept of sovereignty is not, 
however, fragile or timid, but open to the world. Our vision of 
sovereignty would allow us to get along with our neighbours and 
friends, and particularly in this instance, with the United States.
<P>
	Because we have a great deal in common with the United 
States, Quebec sovereigntists can easily understand why the 
Americans did what they did two centuries ago. We too will soon 
be taking similar action, that is clear. We also understand that 
the defence of a country cannot be confined to geopolitical 
boundaries that begin at a certain parallel. The issue here is the 
defence of a continent which we share with the United States of 
America and we will continue to defend it and be good friends 
with the U.S. when we achieve sovereignty.
<P>
	This being said, I have a question for the hon. member for 
Peace River. I did not quite understand the thrust of his remarks 
in support of cruise missile testing. I got the impression that he 
was in favour of allowing testing to continue simply because we 
have already signed an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Can the hon. member for Peace River tell me if he agrees with 
some of the substantive arguments put forward in support of 
continued testing or if he simply feels bound by the legal and 
technical aspects of the question and believes we must respect 
the existing agreement with the United States?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. It is a good question. I want to leave with him the 
reassurance that I believe strongly in the reasons for the testing. 
It is part of a deterrent that we need to continue to develop in 
terms of our own sovereignty and of peacekeeping roles we as 
Canadians undertake throughout the world.
<P>
	I also believe in it because we signed a commitment in good 
faith and I think we need to honour it. I very strongly want to say 
that I believe it is an important part of our defence. It is 
something that should be part of the overall review when 
defence is reviewed. I would make the case that I support it on 
the basis of a strong defence of Canada and a need for 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Madam Speaker, when 
this proposition surfaced for the first time in 1981 within the 
restrictions imposed by cabinet solidarity I opposed it tooth and 
nail. I still oppose it. I appreciate very much the opportunity the 
government is offering us to debate the matter on the floor of the 
House today.
<P>
	The reason for opposing comes from two beliefs. One is that 
Canada is committed to arms control, to disarmament, and as a 
peace loving and peace promoting nation it should not lend its 
territory for the testing of weapons which could carry nuclear 
warheads and which could launch a disarming nuclear strike 
against another country.
<P>
	We all know that Canada has a fine record in the world for 
opposing any form of nuclear warfare. We voluntarily refrained 
from using nuclear weapons. We eliminated from Canadian 
territory the stationing of nuclear weapons. Canada was among 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="419"> 419 </A></B>
<P>
the first nations to sign the non-proliferation treaty and the 
nuclear testing ban treaty.
<P>
	Considering this record how can Canada lend itself to 
allowing the testing of a weapon which could be used to deliver 
nuclear warheads? In addition, now that the cold war is over the 
question must be asked who is the enemy, as I asked earlier the 
member for Beaver River. Why should such a weapon be used?
<P>
	It is somehow ironic this debate should take place today when 
last night President Clinton said in his speech: ``Russia's 
strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the 
United States. Nor will we point ours at them''. He went on to 
say: ``Instead of building weapons in space Russian scientists 
will help us build the international space station''. Mr. Clinton 
stressed last night that ultimately the best strategy to ensure 
security and to build a durable peace was to support the advance 
of democracy elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	I submit that cruise missile testing is a relic of the past. It is a 
relic of the cold war. It is from the days when there were 
potential threats to security from nuclear weapons in other 
countries, when Canada's terrain was  considered a facsimile of 
Soviet Union geography. However today the political situation 
has changed considerably as other speakers have said before me.
<P>
	My second reason relates to security in the nineties. The 
concept of security must change from an exclusive stress on 
national security to a much greater stress on the concept of 
people security as was indicated in the 1993 UNDP report on 
human development.
<P>
	I suggest the real threat to security comes from other quarters. 
It comes from unsustainable management of natural resources, 
fisheries, forestry, water shortages, desertification, climate 
change, ozone layer deterioration, decrease of arable land and 
reduction of forest covers.
<P>
	It comes from population explosion in some parts of the world 
at the total rate of 92 million people per year, with resulting 
pressures on finite resources coupled with increased insecurity 
of food production. It comes from lack of support for 
international proposed legislation such as the Law of the Sea. It 
comes from megaprojects in parts of the world which are 
launched without proper environmental impact assessment. Last 
but not least, it comes from chronic poverty in Africa, Central 
America, South America and so on.
<P>
	It seems that rather than spending time and resources on 
testing missiles in 1994 national governments should devote 
energies to the agenda of our times, namely how to apply our 
energies against hunger, ignorance and poverty on planet earth.
<P>
	Peace is not threatened by the lack of cruise missiles. Today 
global peace is threatened when governments pay attention to 
the wrong agenda, and this item today is part of that wrong 
agenda.
<P>
	The agenda we should be paying attention to consists of how 
to achieve food security, how to achieve family planning in the 
developing world, how to achieve sustainable natural resources 
exploitation, how to achieve safe management of toxic waste, 
how to achieve the prevention of climate change and the 
concomitant consequences in many regions of the world, how to 
achieve the restoration of water quality, how to achieve the 
protection of biodiversity, and how to achieve the elimination of 
poverty in many nations of the world community and a better 
distribution of wealth. All these factors together could lead or 
contribute to global insecurity, to global instability, and 
possibly to conflict.
<P>
	I repeat that global peace is not threatened by the lack of 
updated cruise missiles. That is not the issue. We must worry 
about the threats I mentioned a moment ago. In that report on 
human development of 1993 by the UNDP, you will find a 
quotation which I think is quite relevant to this overall 
discussion: ``That preventive diplomacy is needed to defuse 
tensions around the globe before there are blow-ups''.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	It means that instead of lending support to archaic solutions 
and outdated agendas, the developed industrial world should 
instead invest its time and energies in eradicating the causes of 
potential conflict.
<P>
	Therefore, in conclusion, I urge the Government of Canada to 
deal with the potential threats to peace. They have nothing to do 
with military hardware, but everything to do with environmental 
damage and social economic disorders which stem from 
increasing poverty, increasing dislocation and which could lead 
increasingly to threats to global security.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for the passion with which he spoke. 
He talked a lot about the environment and certainly his goals are 
admirable. I commend him for that.
<P>
	I would like to touch on some of the points he made respecting 
the possibility of nuclear war. Who is the enemy? Why should 
we be testing a weapon that can carry a nuclear warhead? Is it 
not better to support the advance of democracy than it is to 
prepare for war? In many respects I believe the gentleman is 
right. Certainly liberal democracies do not fight wars against 
one another.
<P>
	It is also a sad truth that many of the countries in the world are 
not liberal democracies. We still have many countries that are 
ruled by men who have no compunction about killing people and 
invading other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="420"> 420 </A></B>
<P>
	In trying to answer some of those questions I think we have to 
test weapons that can carry nuclear warheads because we will 
also be, at some point in our future sad to say, faced with the 
possibility that we may have to intercept those types of weapons 
as they come into our air space. I think it is very important that 
we have defensive capabilities against those weapons.
<P>
	I also point out that there are many places in the world, such as 
the former Soviet Union-the hon. member was talking about 
who is the enemy-and I think many places in the former Soviet 
Union, particularly now with the rise of Vladimir Zhirinovsky in 
Russia, should all give one pause when we talk about how 
peaceful the world really is.
<P>
	Having said all that, and considering there are many places in 
the world that are not likely to become liberal democracies any 
time soon, countries that have the capability to produce nuclear 
weapons and all kinds of other weapons, does the hon. member 
agree that we should be prepared to intercept those types of 
missiles that could come from some of those countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I would be glad to answer the 
question by the member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	If the cruise missile were a weapon of interception, he would 
have a valid question. But the cruise missile is not a weapon of 
interception, it is a weapon of attack, it is a weapon to deliver, if 
necessary, warheads. Therefore his  question is invalid because 
he is addressing the wrong weapon.
<P>
	As to intercepting weapons which come into our Canadian 
space, we would have to use other weapons but certainly not a 
cruise missile because that is not the intent or the qualification 
of that weapon. It is used to attack and deliver nuclear warheads 
to certain specific targets in other countries.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat failed to demonstrate to us that 
this is the weapon he would rely on in order to intercept, but 
more importantly he failed to identify the enemy for us. He very 
vaguely mentioned that there could be an attack. I urge him to 
identify the enemy for us. I submit to him that collectively the 
enemy is us and our fear. It is time to stop talking like cold war 
cavemen and cavewomen because we are living in another 
decade.
<P>
	The agenda has shifted very rapidly. It is no longer the agenda 
on how to prevent a strike or an attack that we should be 
concentrating our time and energy on. It is how to prevent the 
elements in the global community that have to do with, as I 
mentioned, poverty and environmental degradation, that have to 
be addressed and the energies of governments need to be focused 
on that agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me once again to rise in this Chamber and take part 
in the debate on the policy of government which has 
implications for our defence policy.
<P>
	First, I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the 
leadership of the government for giving all members of this 
House the opportunity to express our views on this topic. Much 
has been said this afternoon about our defence policy. Some 
believe it might be redundant. Others say there should have been 
a policy set out which we could have debated.
<P>
	I served some time in provincial legislatures and in this House 
and I believe this is what most members of the House with whom 
I have associated over the last number of years wanted to do. 
Today we are putting forward our views. We do not all agree. We 
all have different opinions. This is allowing us to state our 
opinions and hopefully to give the minister, the department and 
the government our ideas. It make it easier for them to come 
forward with a policy which at that time will be debated. That is 
what we are doing here today.
<P>
	We all appreciate this new and open policy toward the House 
of Commons, this great institution to which we have all been 
elected. All hon. members agree that the respect being shown to 
us by the government is certainly in contrast to what we have 
seen here over the last number of years.
<P>
	The question which has been put before us is a complex one, a 
question which cannot be answered in the course of a one day 
debate, or even in a week long  debate. It is a question that 
arouses all sorts of passions in all hon. members and indeed in 
the public at large.
<P>
	The question has been asked today, why we would talk about 
this when we have signed the agreement with the United States? 
We have an agreement that has been talked about here by people 
who are much more eloquent than I. If for some reason we 
cancelled the agreement or we agreed to let it go ahead without 
debate such as this I am sure that all hon. members who have 
been in public life any amount of time would realize the uproar 
this would cause in the media and in the public at large.
<P>
	I mentioned yesterday during the debate on peacekeeping that 
the time has come when we must assess the role of our armed 
forces both in Canada and abroad. We must provide them with 
the direction which is necessary in a troubled world. We must 
have a multi-level approach in our defence policy and we must 
always be sure that our defence policy is sufficiently adaptable 
to conform to a changing world.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	As I noted yesterday, the world has vastly changed from what 
it was five short years ago. When the Berlin wall came down and 
the communist regimes in eastern Europe fell there were those 
among us who proclaimed that peace was at hand and that total 
victory in the cold war belonged to us. Unfortunately not all of 
the world's problems have been solved these past five years. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="421"> 421 </A></B>
<P>
World tensions which have come and gone in cycles seem again 
to be on the rise.
<P>
	There are many places around the world today, as has been 
said, where military activity is going on. This has been 
mentioned many times today. Relations between some of the 
former republics of the Soviet Union are hostile to say the least. 
The situation in the Persian Gulf area is, as we all know, far from 
settled.
<P>
	Several other trouble spots have appeared around the world 
causing all of us great concern. There is the new nationalism and 
old ethnic hatreds arising in many parts of the globe and who is 
to say in what place or by what spark a new and dangerous 
conflict may be touched off.
<P>
	What I am saying is that the changes we approached with such 
optimism only five years ago have not automatically brought 
about a new world order, nor have they brought about a 
guarantee of peace in our time. We always hope that Canada will 
be at the forefront of seeking the diplomatic solutions to the 
world's problems, but we must, I fear, be prepared in case these 
solutions fail.
<P>
	I do not envy the Minister of National Defence for the 
decisions which he will have to make in the coming year or two 
because the sad state of the Canadian economy and the huge 
deficit is going to cause problems with long-range planning and 
with maintaining the defence establishment which we have at 
the present time.
<P>
	I know from his remarks over the past few days that the 
minister is struggling with the long-term defence policy and 
with the decision which he will have to make. That is why I urge 
on this matter that we take a long-term look at the question and 
not force precipitous action on the minister, action which may 
not be in the long-term interest of Canadians.
<P>
	I spoke yesterday about the fact that the high point of 
Canadian prestige abroad came at the time of the Suez crisis in 
1956. The high point of Canadian military power was at the end 
of World War II when this nation had mobilized and fought as a 
full participant in that conflict.
<P>
	Since that time our military capacity has declined and we have 
come more and more to reply on the protection and the 
technology of others for our defence. We were from the 
beginning a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and a member of the North American Air Defence Command. 
However we have allowed ourselves to be more and more 
dependent upon others, particularly the United States, for the 
technology which we need for defence.
<P>
	Looking back for instance at the cancellation of the Avro 
Arrow fighter plane in the late 1950s, we might be able to see a 
starting point toward our eventual military decline. Since that 
time our military technology has been tied m more and more to 
the United States and we have depended on them to provide us 
with the largest advances.
<P>
	I do not intend to engage in a philosophical debate over 
whether or not we should be that dependent. What I am saying is 
that the practical realities of geography and economics dictate 
that our defence policy be tied closely to theirs. It is, in the 
words of a former Prime Minister, like sleeping with an 
elephant; you are very aware of every little move.
<P>
	As we look over the deficit projections for the next year or 
two, it becomes rather obvious that we will be unable to start 
many new initiatives in the defence field ourselves. Therefore 
we will remain as long as we retain our present defence and 
diplomatic policies very closely tied to our American friends.
<P>
	That brings me to the main point of this discussion: Should we 
or should we not allow the testing of cruise missiles over 
Canadian soil?
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	What I attempted to do by way of my introductory remarks 
was to establish my position rather pragmatically. We should 
allow the tests to continue while the Minister of National 
Defence, this House and the relevant committees study our 
overall defence policy. It would be folly to cancel these tests 
now when we do not know where our long-term policy is going 
and we do not know where the political situation around the 
world is leading us.
<P>
	After saying that, I hope hon. members do not take my 
remarks as those of a hawk, to use that old term. Rather  I hope 
they see them as the legitimate concerns of someone who 
watches the world scene and our armed forces with a great deal 
of interest.
<P>
	We need to develop a clear direction and a clear defence 
policy. For the moment I think it would be in the best interests of 
this nation if the agreement were allowed to continue until such 
time as our government has decided on our future defence 
policies.
<P>
	As I stated yesterday the fundamental cornerstones of 
Canadian foreign policy have not changed substantially over the 
years. We are still committed to defence and collective security 
with our allies. We remain committed to arms control and 
disarmament and we are committed to peaceful resolution of 
disputes.
<P>
	We must not therefore take any hasty action which would 
fundamentally alter our policies without that careful 
examination I noted earlier. I know other hon. members hold 
strong views in this matter and I look forward to hearing them 
along with all the others.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member is the first speaker today to look at the issue from an 
angle that is close to my heart.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="422"> 422 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member said we need a multilevel approach in our 
defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Which brings me to a concern I have that I would like the hon. 
member to address.
<P>
	We know that these cruise missiles will be guided by a 
computerized system that will recognize terrain and shapes 
thanks to artificial intelligence technologies. This extremely 
sophisticated software is under research and development in the 
United States. The tests to be conducted over our territory will 
allow Americans to check the quality of their programs. In 
return, contracts will be awarded to suppliers of the U.S. armed 
forces.
<P>
	Talking about a multi-level approach in our defence 
policy-I am coming to my question-I think we should focus 
not only on the military but also on the economic aspects of all 
this. Jobs are tied to these technologies. Will the Liberal 
government ensure that some of these jobs are created here in 
Quebec and in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> I thank the hon. member for his comments and 
question and the point he has raised.
<P>
	We talk about sharing our territory for testing. Two years ago 
Canada sent troops down to California to train for the Somalia 
peacekeeping mission. As the hon. member says, they have 
developed this sophisticated equipment and the money goes to 
the American contractors to build it.
<P>
	In the new global community that has developed over the last 
decade I believe it would be possible for us to get involved in 
this or other types of operations to get  Canadian companies 
some of the contracts to build the sophisticated high-tech 
instrumentations. That is where our future lies. We talked about 
this on another matter, an economic matter. Canada's economic 
future is in things like these high-tech, innovative 
telecommunication systems. Yes, I believe that Canada should 
have a part of that on a multilevel. Other countries are going to 
want it too. I believe it is as much ours as it is anybody else's.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his clear 
comments on this. It seems that many of the speakers tend to get 
confused on the issues or some of the rationale they are using.
<P>
	The previous speaker whom we heard from that side of the 
House seemed to want to make this into a nuclear issue. I hasten 
to point out to the hon. member that we have many delivery 
systems in our own military capable of delivering nuclear 
weapons, if it was the choice to do so. It does not have to be just 
the cruise missile.
<P>
	The cruise missile is not a nuclear weapon. It is simply a 
deliverance system. We saw it being used in the gulf war for 
conventional weapons in such a way as to be deadly accurate so 
that innocent people did not get injured.
<P>
	Earlier we heard the hon. member for Mississauga West speak 
emotionally. I understand and I accept that she spoke from the 
heart and not necessarily to the facts of the matter.
<P>
	What particularly interests me and is kind of curious is that 
yesterday we heard the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway 
speak with regard to the Bosnian issue where it was suggested 
that we should have air strikes in defence of our humanitarian 
aid in order to ensure that it gets through. Yet today the same 
member spoke against cruise missile testing and it is the very 
system that can make accurate delivery of the kind of strikes he 
was calling for.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member who just spoke for 
being clear and concise and for not trying to cloud the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Kootenay West-Revelstoke for his remarks. I believe, as I 
said earlier when I opened my remarks, that there are some very 
different opinions here. I have my opinions and am very pleased 
to be able to bring them forward.
<P>
	The argument can be made that the cruise missile does or does 
not carry nuclear weapons. My point is that we have an 
agreement. We need our allies and we need to make exchanges 
with them. Until this House, this country and this government 
decide down the line how our defence policy is going to go 
forward, I do not think we need to get into any arguments with 
our neighbours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Madam Speaker, allow 
me to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your new 
position and wishing you all the best. You can count on the 
co-operation of the entire Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Before getting to the core issue, I would like to say a few 
words about the relevance of this debate. I have been constantly 
surprised since the beginning. First surprise, the minister's 
speech. During the first five minutes, we were led to believe that 
he supported the tests and then, for the next five minutes, that he 
had doubts and later, that he did see the tests as useful after all. 
In the end, he said he would abide by the wishes of the House.
<P>
	But behind all this wondering on the part of the minister, one 
could detect a desire to gain time. So I wonder.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	On one hand, I had only praise for the government yesterday 
with respect to yesterday's debate because of the need to 
re-evaluate our peace commitments by April. But in this case, it 
seems to me that we could have had a more global debate on our 
military role, our international commitments and especially our 
agreements with the U.S. I cannot help but wonder, because the 
government does not seem to have a definite policy in that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="423"> 423 </A></B>
<P>
respect and it is gaining time by holding this debate to sound out 
the House. We have people asking us: ``Where are those Liberals 
who, during the last campaign, were waving their little red book 
as if they were disciples of Mao and, whatever the question, 
invariably answered, and their leader was the first to it: It is in 
the red book. Check in the red book for economic matters. Check 
it for defence issues. It is all in there''? The red book contained 
all the answers.
<P>
	Here we are now, and both the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois start off by saying that we are open to a change in the 
member participation process, but let us not go overboard in the 
other direction and have day-long debates like yesterday and 
today. And there are three more planned for next week. Three 
months have gone by since the election, and the people are still 
waiting for the red book to be implemented. We have had a very 
vague, non-specific throne speech, yet the government has no 
bills to table.
<P>
	It has become a joke among the jobless in my riding. The joke 
goes like this: What is the difference between a federal Liberal 
member and an unemployed Joe? The answer is: Unlike the 
Liberal member, the unemployed once had a job. Has it come to 
the point where our elected Liberal members do not put pressure 
on their government any more? Have they lost faith in their red 
book? What is happening? In the debate today, they are 
contradicting one another. Where are the big guns of the party? 
They are quiet. What is the use of debating? The opposition has a 
clear position. The Reform Party has a clear position and so does 
the NDP. Incidentally, I am  surprised that they are not taking 
part in this debate. Perhaps are they going to later. I certainly 
hope so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
simply want to tell the hon. member that we have been trying to 
participate in this debate for three hours; consequently, it is not 
right to suggest that we do not want to participate. We are trying. 
We want to participate because we are the only ones who oppose 
the cruise missile tests, since the Bloc supports the 
government's position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion, it is not a 
point of order from the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, I can understand the hon. 
member's position since I had to go through this for three years. 
I sincerely hope that he will express his views because he 
represents a party which, over the past three years, has left its 
mark in the history of our country and, on occasion, of Quebec 
as well.
<P>
	I want to conclude by discussing the relevancy of this debate, 
and especially the lack of a government position. When I refer to 
the government, I mean the ministers concerned. I am surprised 
that there is no information from the department of National 
Defence. We submitted requests to the public affairs service of 
that Department to obtain documents. The department was 
willing to provide us with all the required documents. Yet, 
because of government directives, we were not able to obtain 
those documents. I therefore ask the minister-I see one sitting 
over there-to convey this message to the Prime Minister's 
Office. If you decide again to hold such a debate, on this issue or 
any other one, I would hope that you will be more open-minded 
so that we can have access to all the necessary documents to 
have a real debate. We are not playing for time. We really want 
to express our views and we want the government to do the 
same. Both sides must give their opinion, but they must also 
have the opportunity to refer to all the documents which can 
influence our national defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I will now get to the subject of this debate. I would like to 
recall the excellent comments made by the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean when he referred to the old line and the new line on 
letting the Americans do their tests. At the time, and in fact 
today, the NDP has not changed its position although the world 
situation has changed dramatically-there was still a nuclear 
threat, and allowing such tests was seen as encouraging arms 
proliferation. Today, we have to look at this from an entirely 
different angle. The global context has changed, as was said 
earlier by members for the Reform Party and our own leader. It 
has changed in that we no longer have two blocs confronting 
each other but the occasional isolated conflict.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Saint-Jean said earlier, if we use 
these tests to enhance our security and concentrate more on 
ways to defend our democracy, we are less likely to put the lives 
of men, women and children and our armed personnel at risk.
<P>
	Earlier today, the hon. member for Portneuf compared the 
tests and giving the Americans permission to proceed with the 
seat belt in a car. You may never have an accident, but it always 
better to put on your seat belt. We approve of the tests as a way to 
maximize the security of our territory and also on the basis of 
our military agreements with the Americans and important 
economic and security considerations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="424"> 424 </A></B>
<P>
	I could also have quoted what was said by the hon. member for 
Champlain or the hon. member for Lotbinière, who told me last 
night that he was reading a very important paper on the subject, 
so we have the hon. member for Champlain and the hon. member 
for Berthier, who is also a member of our regional caucus, and 
we had time to outline a five-point agenda with which I will 
conclude my speech.
<P>
	I would like to get back to what was said by the hon. member 
for Verchères, when he made a connection between Canada's 
sovereignty and permission for these tests. He said, and I quote: 
``And if I start my speech on cruise missile testing by 
emphasizing this concept of sovereignty so dear to my heart, it is 
simply because in certain spheres the testing issue is viewed as 
an attack on the sovereignty of Canada.''
<P>
	And he went on to say: There are people who claim that 
renewing the Canada-U.S.A. umbrella agreement and periodic 
authorization regarding cruise missile testing within Canadian 
territorial boundaries is akin to an unacceptable surrender to the 
imperatives of the foreign and defence policy of our neighbours 
to the south, an infringement upon the political sovereignty of 
Canada. But since any sovereign state must be able to protect its 
borders, we must recognize that Canada's political and 
territorial sovereignty depends to a large extent on its 
participation in the collective security system provided under 
NATO and NORAD. We must recognize that Canada does not 
have the resources required to defend its huge territory by 
itself.''
<P>
	That is what the hon. member for Verchères said in his speech 
earlier today, reflecting what was said by the leader of our party, 
who also referred to the connection between these tests and 
environmental issues.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I quote: ``What about environmental costs? Those costs are, 
for all intents and purposes, non-existent if one considers the 
very low frequency of the flights, merely a few over the course 
of one year, and over 3,000 kilometres of a nearly empty 
territory.''
<P>
	Referring to the political aspect of the decision, and I think 
that is very important, he went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But we must also take into consideration of the political side of the issue. Who is 
asking us to conduct these tests? We must  not forget that the United States is Canada's 
best friend, its only neighbour, its safest ally, its major trading partner, and a great nation 
which speaks the same language as that of most Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let us not forget that the United States is the pillar of NATO and NORAD, the 
two pacts which ensure our security. If there ever was a nuclear threat to Canada. 
. .but there is a risk, to whom would Canadians and Quebecers turn? I do not 
even have to give the answer, because that answer is so obvious. Should such a 
situation occur, we would be quite relieved to be able to rely on an ally equipped 
with cruise missiles which it would have developed at its own expense.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what our leader had to say this morning about the 
political aspect.
<P>
	He also made a very interesting comment on the strategic 
aspect, which was well received by our caucus, when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada's commitments to strategic deterrence are basically a part of 
co-operation between allies. Canada has no strategic weapons in its forces. 
However, in that its defence is based on the agreement among allies and it 
benefits from collective security, it must voluntarily co-operate in 
implementing this strategic deterrent force if required. This is an integral part of 
the national defence policy as found in the 1971 and 1987 white papers on 
defence and the 1992 defence policy statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These were some short and straightforward comments made 
by our leader and a number of new Bloc members, either in their 
20-minute speeches or in pertinent questions to members upon 
conclusion of a speech.
<P>
	Since I have five minutes left, I would also like to consider 
some statements made by other members. I am surprised they 
are not in the House. The statements were made when they were 
in the opposition, but it seems as soon as people sit on the other 
side, there is a kind of alchemy that takes place which turns red 
books into blue books.
<P>
	It happened to the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who said: ``End cruise missile 
testing now. There, I have said it.'' It is as though he regretted 
having said that, back in March 1987. Does he still feel the same 
way? If this debate is so important, why do these people who 
took a stand not rise in the House today to reiterate their 
commitment or explain their reasons for taking a new approach 
to these agreements?
<P>
	There is also the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, the leader 
of the Liberal Party, who said: ``Will the government 
confirm''-he was referring to the Conservative government 
then in power-``that Canadians are diametrically opposed to 
using Canadian territory for these dangerous tests?'' Does he 
still feel the same way? If he does, that is the position the 
government will take. So why bother with a debate? Is it just 
window dressing?
<P>
	I am surprised that the party's so-called big guns are not 
taking a position. However, I did see the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who has always taken a stand, and I am 
glad to see he is about to do so again.
<P>
	I am surprised that the hon. member for Winnipeg South 
Centre, who embodied Liberal party policy when he was in the 
opposition, is not taking a position today in what was announced 
as a crucial debate.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, since I have three minutes left, I will wind up 
my speech with three main arguments in favour of cruise missile 
testing.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	First, Canada has always considered cruise missile tests as an 
opportunity to demonstrate our support for collective defence. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="425"> 425 </A></B>
<P>
In the past, Canada authorized these tests because it felt that our 
security was inseparable from that of our allies within NATO.
<P>
	Second, the agreement for weapons testing is an important 
element of our relations with the United States, which are close, 
complex and unequalled in scope. We are partners under the 
most important bilateral trade agreement in the world. We share 
a whole gamut of political, social and cultural values, and we are 
allies in the defence of North America and Europe.
<P>
	Third, these tests bring financial benefits to Canada. The 
cruise missile tests are the raison d'être of the weapons testing 
agreement. The agreement now includes a clause on additional 
costs, whereby Canadian taxpayers could save thousands of 
dollars each year by reducing the costs of tests conducted by 
Canada in the United States.
<P>
	In my opinion, those are three conclusive arguments which 
confirm that the position set forth by our leader in his speech 
this morning, which was again a remarkable speech and which 
my colleagues supported throughout the day, is a clear and 
logical position which is in the best interest of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
impressed with the speeches that have been given on this issue 
so far, both on the pro and the con. I want to thank the hon. 
member who has just finished speaking.
<P>
	Some of the speeches tonight have been very vivid and to the 
point. I would like to address part of the speech given by the hon. 
member for Davenport when he asked a very important 
question. He referred to the threat to our security and he asked 
who is the enemy.
<P>
	Who is and what is the threat to the security of the child who 
has been molested? What is the threat to the security of the 
women who has been raped or the senior citizen who has been 
murdered?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With 
all respect to the hon. member, I think the rules provide that the 
10-minute question and answer period is to comment on the 
previous speech or to ask questions of the member who has just 
spoken, not to comment on speeches that took place earlier in 
the day.
<P>
	I respect the fact that the member is new member, but I think 
the purpose of the 10-minute question period is to deal with the 
speech that has just been given and not with an earlier speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is quite right. Would the hon. member 
for Crowfoot care to continue discussions and comments on the 
prior speaker's remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, my understanding is that this 
debate or this discussion is open for all comments.
<P>
	The real threat to our security that we must guard against lies 
in the unwillingness of the individual to respect the legal and 
human rights of others. As long as we have people like Saddam 
Hussein, Joseph Stalin and the other tinpot dictators we have 
seen through the annals of history, we will have to protect 
ourselves against their unwillingness to respect the rights of the 
human individual.
<P>
	That begins right here in the House. I have watched the 
operation of this House on television for a number of years and I 
have watched it since I have been here.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	When hon. members in this place do not have the tolerance to 
respect the rules of this House and then violate those rules, that 
in fact is the threat to the security of the individual. It is simply a 
degree. One magnifies that degree and it becomes the real threat 
to the security of individuals, communities and nations.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member who has just spoken this 
question. It is on a different issue. During the cold war we had 
the two great powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. 
They controlled the majority of the nuclear weapons in the 
world. Since there has been the break up of the Soviet Union, I 
would like to ask the the hon. member if he feels that there is a 
greater threat of nuclear attack upon the nations of the world 
now or before?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> I first wish to thank my colleague for his 
comment and for his question.
<P>
	I think that he has touched on a point that can divide people 
and bring some to ask themselves questions.
<P>
	Are we still in a cold war and, if not, since the Russian empire 
has disintegrated, why should we allow these missiles? Some 
are asking themselves this very question. Others will wonder 
whether we should pursue a kind of technological race to make 
war when we should spend our money elsewhere. It is always a 
question of war versus peace. But, when the hon. member talks 
about the cold war, we must never forget that, instead of two 
blocs facing each other, there are now around the world several 
potential hot spots, often plagued by fanaticism.
<P>
	I do not need to remind you of the Iraqi leader's behaviour 
during the gulf war or of certain statements made in Lebanon. 
Those countries, which happen to lie very close to each other, 
have nuclear weapons that can be launched instantly.
<P>
	Is the threat immediate? I would say no, but this guarantee of 
security can only serve the interests of democracy in Canada, 
Quebec, the United States and the rest of the western world.
<P>
	In that sense, the two opposing blocs have been replaced by 
several localized conflicts that are not controlled as strictly. Ten 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="426"> 426 </A></B>
<P>
years ago, each of the two blocs controlled half of the world, but 
today, in some places, there is no control from one bloc or the 
other.
<P>
	That is why, as my colleague from Saint-Jean was saying 
about the old and the new way of thinking, we must look at these 
tests in the new global perspective. We must see this testing not 
as a yearly event that pushes us closer to a nuclear war but as a 
way to enhance security, since the missiles tested are not 
necessarily equipped with nuclear heads.
<P>
	Also, civilian applications are eventually found for the 
sophisticated technologies often developed by the military. Will 
there be civilian applications in this case? We can hardly see any 
at the present time, but could the computerized systems, the 
maps charted and the aerial photos taken from satellites tracking 
these low-level missiles be used for other than military 
purposes?
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	This does not represent, like it did in the past, a stepping up of 
the confrontation with the communist bloc. It is not as far 
reaching since, as a result of disarmament initiatives and 
various treaties signed recently, the number of missiles is 
limited to 460. This is a thousand less than previously. They will 
be replaced as they become obsolete, but the number will never 
exceed 460. In that sense, the tests are done more to refine the 
missiles, to make them more effective, better targeted, and 
therefore better able to spare human lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to start by congratulating you and your 
colleagues on your appointments. I assure you you can count on 
my full co-operation at all times.
<P>
	I also want to give credit to the government for arranging this 
debate today and the debate on peacekeeping yesterday. This is a 
welcome departure in involving the whole House in 
policymaking before a policy decision is made or before an 
agreement is terminated as I hope the case will be in this 
instance.
<P>
	I especially welcome the opportunity to speak on the question 
of cruise missile testing. As hon. members might know I have 
opposed the testing of cruise missiles from the very beginning in 
1983 and on all previous occasions when this matter was before 
the House I voted against the testing.
<P>
	Since the cold war is now fortunately no longer with us I am 
even more opposed than I have been in the past. Why is this so 
important and why am I so opposed?
<P>
	First of all the cruise missile is an extremely dangerous 
weapon. It is small. It is easily concealed. It is mobile. It  is 
accurate. It is capable of avoiding radar detection because it 
flies close to the ground under the general radar beams and 
pickup. It also can carry a nuclear or a conventional war head.
<P>
	Since these missiles can escape detection by radar they can be 
used for a successful first strike and as a result totally knock out 
the opponent's weaponry.
<P>
	I originally opposed cruise missiles because in my view they 
contributed in a very serious way to the arms race. They 
contributed to international instability and they were also, in my 
view, contrary to the principles of the non-proliferation treaty 
which was signed and heavily supported by Canada.
<P>
	Canada originally agreed to test these weapons for the United 
States by an agreement concluded in February 1983. It was said 
at that time that the United States wanted to test these missiles in 
the northwest of Canada because the northwest of Canada had a 
terrain similar to that of the northern Soviet Union.
<P>
	In February 1988 the testing agreement was automatically 
renewed for another five years and in 1993 it was continued by 
the former Conservative government for a new 10-year 
agreement. Since 1983 there have been 23 tests, about two or 
three per year, with the most recent test in March 1993.
<P>
	I want to make clear however that this agreement between the 
United States and Canada is not part of our NATO obligations 
and was never part of the NATO agreement.
<P>
	I said I was originally opposed to cruise missile tests and I am 
now more than ever opposed.
<P>
	In the last Parliament on January 24, 1989, our Liberal Party 
took a position against further cruise testing. I quote the first 
paragraph of the document which was issued by our party on 
January 24, 1989: ``The Liberal Party of Canada today called for 
the Conservative government to finally shake off its cold war 
mentality and cancel further cruise testing in Canada as a 
tangible and positive gesture to improving the climate of 
east-west relations and ongoing disarmament negotiations''. 
This is under the sponsorship of the leader of the opposition at 
that time.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	This was a change of policy. Up until that time the Liberal 
Party had supported cruise missile testing. I had not personally 
supported it-I opposed it-but the party did support it. I felt I 
had some part in bringing about this change in party policy.
<P>
	I also want to point out that our party at a major policy 
convention in 1986 passed two important resolutions. I will not 
read them because time is short but they are in our resolution 
book of 1986 opposing cruise missile testing.
<P>
	The reasons for the change in our party policy given by our 
leader in 1989 were the following:
<P>
	First, the cold war was over.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="427"> 427 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, as a result, the requirement for terrain similar to 
Russia was no longer necessary since Russia was no longer our 
enemy.
<P>
	Third, continued testing could contribute to a renewed arms 
race, not necessarily with Russia or the Soviet Union, but in 
other parts of the world including China, North Korea and other 
countries.
<P>
	I must point out that there are 15 nations on the threshold of 
developing nuclear weapons. Missiles are the principal delivery 
system for those weapons. Both are essential to a successful 
strike.
<P>
	How can the United States and Canada, if they continue to test 
these weapons, say seriously to these 15 nations that they should 
not develop these nuclear weapons? By the way, they are urging 
the 15 countries to sign the non-proliferation treaty. How can 
they urge those countries to do that when they are continuing to 
test new weapon technology themselves that can deliver a 
nuclear weapon? They cannot do that very well.
<P>
	Not only will the continuation of cruise missile tests give 
justification to other countries to develop new dangerous 
weapons, but once tested and developed, they will become 
potential products in the international arms trade.
<P>
	After the Iraq war we discovered that 90 per cent of the 
weapons used by Iraq against our own troops were sold to Iraq 
by the five great powers: the Soviet Union; China; France; the 
United Kingdom and the United States.
<P>
	It is well known that most of the weapons purchased by poor 
Third World countries are developed, tested and sold to them by 
richer First World countries. They do so because in developing 
those weapons, such as the cruise, they have to develop a surplus 
of them to make it economically feasible and then they sell them 
to other countries that might want to buy them.
<P>
	The United States and NATO now have a considerable 
military edge over the former east bloc countries and other 
countries that are their potential enemies. We do not need any 
new, improved cruise missile to maintain that edge. It will only 
justify as I said the development and spread of these weapons to 
other countries.
<P>
	Some people have argued in this debate that the cancellation 
of this agreement will offend the United States. President 
Clinton and the United States government acknowledge 
themselves that the cold war is over. They have worked with 
Ukraine and the Soviet Union to reduce the weapons in those 
countries. As a matter of fact they have just concluded an 
agreement whereby they will no longer point weapons at each 
other. They have closed bases in the United States. I have been in 
various cities in the United States where Mr. Clinton is closing 
bases and they talk about the peace dividend.
<P>
	When we co-operate in the furtherance of the arms race, 
which is what testing of cruise missiles is, we put in jeopardy 
our Canadian role as an honest broker  internationally. We put in 
jeopardy our credibility as a peaceful nation.
<P>
	Yesterday we debated peacekeeping and Canada has a long 
and very enviable role in peacekeeping. We are considered one 
of the outstanding nations of the world with respect to 
peacekeeping. We also have an excellent reputation with respect 
to international development. When we proceed again with 
cruise missile testing, we put the credibility of those other very 
good qualities into jeopardy.
<P>
	I have here the hon. member for Nunatsiaq and I have spoken 
with the other hon. member from the Northwest Territories. It is 
over their territory that these missiles are tested. They are both 
very much opposed to these weapons.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me say this in conclusion. The Prime Minister said he 
wanted a free debate. Without a doubt, he is getting it on this 
side of the House. However, I have not seen very much freedom 
from the Reform Party which has spoken about a free debate. 
They have all sang the same party line from beginning to end. As 
a matter of fact in all the votes in which they have participated so 
far they voted as a group on every occasion. Today they are all 
singing the same song. I have a bit of doubt about their sincerity 
concerning free votes and free expression.
<P>
	I was very much dismayed by the statements made by some of 
my Liberal colleagues, particularly those who were here with 
me in the last Parliament and who approved of the policy we 
adopted in 1989 to oppose cruise missile testing. I could 
understand if they put forward new arguments that would allow 
them to bury the policy that they were in favour of last year. 
However, I heard no such new arguments.
<P>
	The continued development and testing of cruise missiles in 
Canada are no longer necessary. It will contribute to a 
continuing arms race and to world instability.
<P>
	I urge the government in assessing this debate not simply to 
count heads but to assess the arguments that are made by hon. 
members in this case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for his remarks. I 
congratulate him on standing by the position he has held since 
1983. I was surprised, however, by some of his arguments and I 
will quickly explain why. But I do nevertheless have a question 
for him.
<P>
	The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce began by listing 
the reasons why he is opposed to cruise missile testing. He 
described the cruise missile as a very dangerous, highly accurate 
weapon that is difficult to detect and that can carry nuclear 
warheads. I am somewhat surprised by this description because 
weapons are supposed to be dangerous. I do not think his is a 
strong argument because what makes a weapon effective  is its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="428"> 428 </A></B>
<P>
mobility, its ability to quickly reach its target, the enemy, its 
strike power and its invulnerability to enemy attacks. I fail to 
see how one can object to testing on the grounds that the weapon 
itself is dangerous. If the weapon were not dangerous, would 
anyone object to it?
<P>
	Second, the hon. member claims that since the cold war is now 
over, there is no further need to develop weapons. But the cold 
war ended four or five years ago. One could quibble about the 
dates. The thaw came fairly quickly and if we look at the 
international situation, it is quite possible that the freeze could 
be on again, as happens quickly in Ottawa, judging from what I 
have seen.
<P>
	The hon. member argues that allowing cruise missile testing 
will restart the arms race. I think this is somewhat of an 
exaggeration because we are talking here about allowing 
something that has gone on for the past ten years. We are not 
talking about an escalation here, merely about allowing our 
American allies with whom we have an agreement to conduct a 
certain number of tests each year. Our duly elected government 
renewed this agreement last year for a period of ten years. I do 
not see this as any kind of escalation in the arms race.
<P>
	Lastly, in referring to statements made recently by U.S. 
President Clinton, the hon. member argues that the Americans 
will not be upset if we refuse to allow the testing to proceed.
<P>
	I find these arguments somewhat debatable. Given the fact 
that these tests are restricted, that we are not dealing here with a 
new weapon that has suddenly been added to the world arsenal, 
does the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce not think that 
he is being a little alarmist in raising all of these arguments 
when similar tests have in fact been conducted in recent years?
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, while the cold war is over 
with the Soviet Union, as I pointed out there are 15 nations 
called threshold nations and North Korea is one of them. They 
are on the verge of developing nuclear weapons.
<P>
	None of these 15 nations are signatories to the 
non-proliferation treaty. The United States for many years has 
been trying to encourage China, North Korea and other countries 
to sign the non-proliferation treaty.
<P>
	My argument is this: How can we ask these countries to 
renounce nuclear weapons, renounce the development of new 
technology with respect to the delivery of nuclear weapons 
when we continue to fine-tune cruise missiles? By the way the 
cruise missile they are testing now or have tested in recent years 
are not the same as the ones they tested years ago. They 
continually improve on this cruise missile.
<P>
	I am saying that while the cold war is over with the Soviet 
Union, there are still countries that want to develop nuclear 
weapons and the means to deliver those  nuclear weapons. We do 
not help the situation by saying on the one hand ``don't you do 
it'' but by God we are going to do it ourselves. That does not 
help. It only contributes to the arms race.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Madam Speaker, 
at the outset I believe we should acknowledge that this is a 
debate that has no right or wrong side or answer. Whether this 
government endorses or refuses to endorse the acceptance of 
cruise testing over Canadian territory is, whatever the outcome, 
neither right nor wrong.
<P>
	We are discussing today on one level our national role in 
contributing to the aggregate military technological base of our 
American neighbours. These tests are part of their military 
research and development. On another level it affords Canada 
the opportunity to define these tests, having regard to our 
national values.
<P>
	With the end of the cold war arguments either for or against 
cruise missile testing have quite simply lost much force. Hon. 
members here will recall the history of the modern day cruise, 
that it evolved from the buzzbombs of second world war 
Germany and that the Americans and Soviets engaged in a 
protracted period of technological one-up-manship which 
resulted in this low level flying missile.
<P>
	From the development of the cruise has evolved a technology 
which has military and technological applications which are 
quite simply American based. To allow this testing to proceed 
will without doubt and I say this without putting forward a 
positive or a negative opinion, ensures that the United States 
continues in its position of pre-eminence in terms of being the 
number one military power.
<P>
	From a perspective of fortress North America it could be 
suggested that the agreement with the United States in 1983 to 
allow cruise testing was correct. That agreement was 
renegotiated, as we heard, in 1993 for another 10-year period, 
putting us through to the year 2003.
<P>
	The reason for choosing this Canadian corridor as a test site 
was quite simple. The terrain and weather conditions in the 
2,200 kilometre long corridor is similar to that of the Soviet 
Union, as the speaker before me noted.
<P>
	In 1983 NORAD was vitally concerned about the security of 
North American having regard to the then perceived Soviet 
arsenal. I would like to pose this open-ended question to 
members present here today: Are we as North Americans 
threatened by the former Soviet military?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="429"> 429 </A></B>
<P>
	To allow this test to proceed in my opinion is simply to 
confirm the political reality which existed in 1983 but has 
vanished in the intervening years.
<P>
	From a military perspective what can be the logical 
explanation for this testing? There is the argument that other 
countries can and are developing cruise capability which then, 
by implication, requires the United States to  continue to be 
technically superior. If we, and I say this as a Canadian and as a 
member of this House, want to allow this testing to proceed then 
I suggest we should also ask what is the perceived or real benefit 
to Canada. Is it to counter the former Soviet Union and maintain 
the security of North America? Alternatively, is it to facilitate 
the very specialized American-based industries which are 
dependent upon military programs for their very existence?
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	The global political reality of 1983 has substantially changed. 
Canadians must therefore acknowledge this in determining 
whether these tests should proceed.
<P>
	These musings of mine reflect the politics of another era, a 
time when there was an arms race, a time when there was a 
perceived threat to our national security and a time when 
NORAD had some continental importance. These factors today 
have simply either vanished or diminished to the point where 
they are meaningless.
<P>
	The other factor I would suggest requires consideration is 
quite simply this: As Canadians, is it beneficial in any way from 
a security or economic perspective to allow these tests? This is 
not a matter of abrogating a bilateral agreement, as has been 
suggested here today. The agreement dictates the technical and 
financial terms but states specifically that each test must be 
approved by the Government of Canada. I ask: ``What is the 
perceived benefit to Canadians?'' or more directly and simply, 
``What is in it for us?''
<P>
	Yesterday in the House several speakers discussed the 
humanitarian aspect of peacekeeping, that is in certain 
circumstances Canadian military peacekeeping represents a 
positive influence in areas of the world. Many of the opinions 
put forward yesterday reflected a desire to improve the plight of 
many people in countries undergoing conflict. Those are very 
laudable and humanitarian objectives which we, as members of 
the United Nations, have collectively stated in a global 
perspective are in the best interests of all nations.
<P>
	These peacekeeping roles mesh or coincide with the common 
values shared with other member states of that body. Yet as a 
Canadian I ask: Where does the testing of a cruise missile fit into 
the objectives of the Canadian government? Is there a national 
interest which is being served if these tests proceed?
<P>
	American governments over a period of several 
administrations have quite overtly inserted a quid pro quo into 
their relationships with other national governments. Foreign 
aid, whether it be monetary or technical, is often tied to events 
occurring in the other state. For example, the extension of 
American aid to China was jeopardized by China after the 
Tiananmen Square incident. The interventions by American 
forces in Grenada and Panama in the late eighties are also 
examples of a more direct nature. These actions were simply as a 
result, in my opinion, of serving the national objectives of the 
United States.
<P>
	I therefore ask members present today to reflect on the 
broader issue of our relationship with the United States and with 
the Americans. I have heard from many of my constituents on 
this issue and though I cannot say that I am a member of the third 
party, I can quite safely say that my opinion is here reflecting the 
greater consensus that I am hearing in my constituency that in 
our dealings with our American neighbours in the broadest and 
most general sense of the word and of the idea, that we must 
become more self-centred, even more specifically that we must 
ask ``Is it in the Canadian interests''; in the most basic sense 
``What's in it for us?''
<P>
	My riding is a narrow wedge of real estate on the 
Ontario-Michigan border. I would venture to say that 75 per 
cent of the people in my riding live about a three-minute car ride 
from the United States. I would also point out that in my riding 
anyone can purchase a Detroit <I>News</I>, a Detroit <I>Free Press</I> at any 
corner variety store just as easily as I could buy the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. My riding is the third busiest crossing along the 
Canada-U.S. border, in fact 15 per cent of all trade between 
Canada and the United States crosses the border in Sarnia or 
Point Edward in my riding. Yet despite this overwhelming 
presence, which we call the American influence, it is abundantly 
clear to me that we are not Americans. My constituents tell me 
that. We are not anti-American, we are simply not Americans.
<P>
	Through a process of national evolution we have stated that 
our priorities are not always identical to their priorities. We 
have stated that our national values are not the same as their 
national values.
<P>
	As a result, I am aware of Americans attempting to enter some 
of the health clinics offered by the local health unit in my riding 
in an attempt to take advantage of the health services and 
treatment programs offered anonymously to walk-in clients.
<P>
	Obviously our priorities are not their priorities. I am aware of 
the significant collection of hand weapons seized daily by our 
customs officials from American vehicles entering Canada in 
my riding. Obviously our values are not their values. As a result 
I must ask once again: Where does the allowance of cruise 
missile testing over Canadian territory as an objective of 
American military policy coincide with Canadian priorities and 
values?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="430"> 430 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	It has been stated that the role of the Canadian military-and I 
stress Canadian-must and will be reviewed during the course 
of this Parliament.
<P>
	As an extension of this objective, I would state that the 
Canadian government must also examine our national 
objectives under the 1993 bilateral agreement with the United 
States relative to cruise testing. Notwithstanding that 
agreement, as stated previously, we reserve the right to say no.
<P>
	In the 1992-93 fiscal year the Department of National 
Defence spent some $148 million in modernizing our air 
defence systems as well as an additional $175 million for low 
level air defence systems.
<P>
	It is possible to conclude that by allowing these tests to 
proceed we will constantly find ourselves in need of more 
sophisticated air defence systems as a result of the technologies 
we are allowing to be tested by the Americans over Canadian 
territory.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the 
Prime Minister for affording the members of this House the 
opportunity to speak on this important national issue, knowing 
that when a decision is made he will have heard a broad 
cross-section of views from all of Canada.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Madam Speaker, since 
the early afternoon, I have been listening carefully to all the 
speeches on the need for these tests to be conducted within the 
Canadian territorial boundaries. Before putting a question to the 
hon. member, I would like to say a few words about the debate.
<P>
	I think this piecemeal approach to Canada's national defence 
that we have had since yesterday could be dangerous. We should 
have a much broader outlook. It is always better to set a problem 
in a global context than to narrow our focus too much. This 
prompts me to say that I hope that eventually the Minister of 
National Defence will undertake a comprehensive defence 
review.
<P>
	We are presently dealing with a more specific case. Earlier, 
the hon. member for Portneuf clearly described in his speech the 
technical aspects of the testing to be conducted over Canadian 
territory. It is aimed mainly at developing a technology that does 
not increase the power derived from nuclear energy. It is a 
guidance system that could have applications in other areas.
<P>
	I think we must be careful not to get side-tracked on the issue 
of proliferation of nuclear weapons. That is not the point. Of 
course, missiles can have a nuclear capability. That is true, but 
from the point of view of wanting to achieve disarmament 
someday-and no one can have anything against being 
virtuous-we should not ignore the power of our American 
allies in most of the military operations we take part in. We must 
also work extremely closely with them. Co-operation could take 
such a form. Their power of deterrence has been tremendous.
<P>
	This leads me to my question: Would we not be sending out a 
dangerous signal to the whole world if we were to object to and 
oppose these tests, perhaps weakening our alliance with our 
American friends? I am neither pro nor anti-American. I am just 
pro-peace and realistic. Would we not be sending out a 
dangerous signal if we were to say that we do not want this kind 
of testing to be conducted over our territory because we are for 
the peaceful resolution of conflicts? Has the U.S. policy  not 
succeeded to some degree in recent years in advancing the cause 
of disarmament?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
interesting point and makes an interesting quotation, that is that 
with respect to the Americans we must co-operate with them.
<P>
	I do not know in terms of Canadian objectives that we must in 
all cases co-operate with the Americans. Certainly recent 
history has indicated to us that the Americans do not reciprocate 
with Canada. I can think of many examples the hon. member 
may not be aware of.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, about a year and a half ago the American border 
patrol at all crossing points decided that it would take direct 
action against Canadian trucking firms. The method of doing 
that was simply to check the record of every driver crossing the 
border. It happens that a number of Canadian truck drivers have 
rather insignificant criminal matters in their past, such as the 
smoking of cannabis, impaired driving, or minor theft and 
assault charges. In any event, under American law the American 
border patrol can prevent them from entering the United States. 
That is one very trite example of the Americans not 
co-operating with us.
<P>
	We heard about numerous trade matters during the election, 
including the seven appeals regarding pork bellies made by the 
United States. There are many times when we do not agree with 
the Americans.
<P>
	The suggestion that we must co-operate with the Americans 
on military matters is not necessarily correct. I also believe that 
recent history, recent in terms of world history, specifically 
World War II, would indicate that the Americans did not 
co-operate with us in the sense that they did not enter into the 
battle until well after Canada did. So I do not think we must 
follow blindly.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member opposite that he should consider 
that there are times when we can and we ought to say no to the 
Americans and this is probably a time when it should be a very 
definite no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. In 
listening to this debate today I am becoming increasingly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="431"> 431 </A></B>
<P>
alarmed with the use of the 10-minute period following the 
20-minute speech. I refer to Standing Order 43 which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Following each 20-minute speech, a period not exceeding 10 minutes shall be 
made available, if required, to allow members to ask questions and comment 
briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses thereto.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On several occasions this afternoon I note that members are 
using the 10-minute period to make a new speech and to make 
comments which are not relevant to the speech that just came 
before them.
<P>
	Many hon. members have talked about setting a new tone in 
this Parliament and respecting the rules of the House. I hope in 
future that the comments and questions  as the standing order 
says will be brief and relevant to the speech that has just been 
made. It is not an occasion to make a new speech. It is supposed 
to be brief comments or questions relevant to the speech that has 
just been made.
<P>
	I hope that the Chair will enforce that rule.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for his intervention. I trust that other members in this place will 
adhere to the standing order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing the 20-minute time at my disposal 
with the hon. member for Saint John.
<P>
	I very much appreciate the opportunity to participate in this 
debate. I congratulate the members who have spoken 
immediately preceding me, the member for Sarnia-Lambton 
and the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, on the courageous 
position they have taken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that it was the leader of the Bloc Quebecois who 
suggested that this debate today was in a sense a charade, that 
the government's real purpose was not to let the United States 
test cruise missiles and that this debate would give the 
government an opportunity to say ``no''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think the agenda is precisely the opposite. I think the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois is profoundly mistaken. The agenda here 
today is in fact that the government is prepared to say yes to 
cruise missile testing and is laying the groundwork for that by 
betraying in a very profound way the promises that were made in 
opposition by the Liberal Party of Canada and by leading 
members of that party to say no to cruise missile testing for the 
reasons so eloquently set out by the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	I want to take exception not only to the process here because I 
think the fix is in. I think in fact that the decision which has been 
made and communicated to the United States government is that 
yes it can go ahead but there is this little nuisance that came up 
last week when one of the members from the opposition stood up 
and reminded the government of the commitment that it made 
while in opposition.
<P>
	What was that statement that was made by the member for 
Winnipeg South Centre? It was this. He suggested in a question 
to this House on February 15 that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given that many Canadians, particularly citizens of the north as represented 
by the Northwest Territories government, the Dene Nation and the circumpolar 
council, have strongly opposed any continuation of these tests, why has the 
minister wilfully proceeded with this agreement contrary to the wishes of these 
Canadians without any form of public consultation or public parliamentary 
hearings?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Public parliamentary hearings. This parliamentary debate is 
not public parliamentary hearings. The voices of northerners, 
the voices of aboriginal peoples, the voices of peace groups who 
want to be heard on this issue are not being heard in public 
hearings.
<P>
	I note that the representatives from the Northwest Territories, 
the member for Nunatsiaq and the member for Western Arctic, 
are both strongly opposed to the testing of cruise missiles. Yet 
their constituents are denied an opportunity to be heard in public 
hearings.
<P>
	I might ask parenthetically where is the voice of that eloquent 
defender of progressive thought in the Liberal caucus, that 
ardent advocate of an end to cruise missile testing, the member 
for Winnipeg South Centre? I am waiting to hear his 
contribution to this debate.
<P>
	This debate is not just about the testing of the cruise missile. I 
might say that the position we have taken as New Democrats on 
this has been to oppose the testing of the cruise from the time it 
was first started in 1983. It is also fundamentally a debate about 
political integrity, about honesty and about the credibility of the 
governing parties.
<P>
	I say that because I think we have to look at the record. Yes, in 
1983 it was the Liberal government that approved the first 
10-year agreement to allow for cruise missile testing over 
Canadian soil. But in 1984 the Liberals went into opposition. Of 
course Liberals in opposition tend to be a little more progressive 
than when they are in government. What did they say in 
opposition? Well the Liberal Party of Canada in a convention in 
November 1986 said that it would ban cruise missile testing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Papineau, who was then external affairs 
critic, suggested that cruise missiles would be destabilizing and 
that cruise missile technology would have a disastrous effect. I 
quote the Minister of Foreign Affairs: ``The government persists 
in playing hide and seek on the policy it will adopt with respect 
to testing of the new cruise missile, this dangerous cousin of the 
present missile that is faster and better able to escape detection. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="432"> 432 </A></B>
<P>
Letting such a weapon in Northern Canada would raise the 
stakes even more.''
<P>
	He was right in 1988; he is right today. It is really sad that the 
member for Papineau was more progressive then than the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois are today on this issue. It is 
really sad that the very strong and powerful voices of the peace 
movement in Quebec are not represented here in the House by 
the Bloc members, who talk about the importance of supporting 
our great American allies. It is really sad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have heard the glowing statements of the minister of the 
members in opposition. We have read in the fabled red book that 
Liberals believe Canadians want their  national government to 
play a more active independent internationalist role in this 
world of change.
<P>
	What did the Liberal Party of Canada promise to the people of 
Canada in writing in September 1993? It said this in response to 
a questionnaire from End the Arms Race: ``Liberals have 
opposed further testing of the cruise missile since 1987. We will 
bring this testing program to an end''. That was the promise of 
the Liberals in September 1993. They did not say they would 
bring it to an end if George Bush was re-elected. There were no 
parentheses. There were no asterisks. They said they would 
bring it to an end.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	What has happened? A month later they gave approval in 
principle for the cruise missile testing to continue.
<P>
	Let us be clear about what the issue is here. The issue is not a 
question of breaking a contract solemnly entered into. I was 
astonished to hear the very distinguished member for Vancouver 
Quadra suggesting we would be in breach of our solemn 
undertakings if we did not allow cruise missile testing to 
proceed. I would have hoped that member would have read the 
agreement, because of course the agreement itself makes it very 
clear.
<P>
	I quote from the agreement: ``Either the Department of 
National Defence or the Department of Defense in the United 
States may refuse any testing project proposed under this 
agreement''.
<P>
	It is utter nonsense to suggest, as the member for Vancouver 
Quadra has done, that in some way we would be in breach of our 
commitments under this agreement. The agreement provides for 
consent and it provides for withholding that consent.
<P>
	The issue is about the testing of a dangerous new missile, a 
destabilizing new missile, the stealth missile, which has 
first-strike capability. It is nuclear equipped. The reason the 
Americans want to test it over our soil is that our terrain is 
similar to that of Russia.
<P>
	I have the original background document from the first 
agreement in 1983. In response to the question why test in 
Canada it said that it was suitable for operational testing of air 
launched cruise missiles over representative terrain and realistic 
route lengths. Representative terrain. Representative of what? 
Representative of Russia. Realistic route lengths. What are 
they? Some 2,200 kilometres, about the time and about the 
distance it would take to fire those cruise missiles into the heart 
of Russia.
<P>
	We have heard it suggested that because Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky, a very dangerous man, is now in a position of some 
influence in Russia we should be testing this nuclear weapon. I 
say that is another reason for us to say no to the testing of the 
cruise missile.
<P>
	In 1992 Boris Yeltsin said they would stop testing the cruise 
missile. He has appealed to the nations of the world to join in 
that. If Zhirinovsky is able to use the argument that we are 
testing the missile and it is aimed  fundamentally at them, how 
on earth does that help in the pursuit of peace?
<P>
	It is time we recognized the real enemy. The real enemy is 
surely poverty. The fact is that 40,000 children die every day on 
this planet. The real enemy is the crushing debt burden and the 
increasing gap in wealth and power between north and south. 
The real enemy is environmental degradation.
<P>
	I would have hoped the Liberals would have shown leadership 
on those issues. But, no, they are prepared to say yes to the old 
ways of doing things. Why not allow the defence and foreign 
policy reviews to take place before we agree to go ahead?
<P>
	By saying no we will be sending a powerful signal, not only to 
the people of Canada, not only to the Pentagon, but to the world, 
to the community of nations, that we are prepared to take a lead 
in the pursuit of peace.
<P>
	It was the member for Winnipeg South Centre who asked this 
question in February 1993: ``Whatever happened to the fresh 
new thinking about defence matters since the cold war?'' 
Indeed, whatever happened to that fresh new thinking? Let us 
hope that voice and that view will prevail; that we will take bold 
new steps to create a nuclear weapons-free zone in Canada; that 
we will say no to low level testing over Innu lands in Labrador; 
that we will create a common Arctic security zone, as the 
member for Yukon has suggested; and that we will respect the 
wishes of aboriginal people such as the Canoe Lake people as 
suggested by the member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	The time has come for new thinking. The time has come to say 
no to the testing of the cruise missile in Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for his eloquent speech. 
When he was reading from the agreement about representative 
terrain I was wondering whether we might take a look at what 
representative terrain means. I have a feeling that the threat 
today is not so much from Russia or the Soviet Union but from 
other countries that will have some types of nuclear capability.
<P>
	I was wondering whether the terrain of those countries might 
be more like the terrain between Montreal and Ottawa or 
Toronto. We know the threat is not from the Soviet Union now 
but more from other countries. I wondered if he would comment 
on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Nunatsiaq 
makes an excellent point and it is a point that was made earlier. 
Some members have made reference to the tragic war in the gulf 
that was going to dislodge Saddam Hussein and install 
democracy in Kuwait.
<P>
	Surely if that is the argument we should not be testing over 
northern territory. Perhaps we should be testing the  cruise 
missile over the deserts of Nevada. If the threat as suggested is 
coming from the more urban areas, the member for Nunatsiaq is 
probably asking what about testing over Calgary Southwest. 
What about testing over Lac-Saint-Jean? What about testing 
over other areas that are slightly more populated.
<P>
	It is an entirely legitimate question. I welcome the hon. 
member's intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky has already threatened the west with nuclear 
annihilation if we try to interfere with his attempt to 
re-establish the Russian empire.
<P>
	Does the member really think he would not follow through 
with plans to re-arm the former Soviet Union should we quit 
testing the cruise missile in northern Alberta and northern 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is madness to suggest that we 
respond to Vladimir Zhirinovsky at this point by testing the 
advanced cruise missile, the stealth missile, which would allow 
us to respond with a nuclear attack on Russia.
<P>
	Surely the most effective way to respond to the Zhirinovskys 
of this world is to do whatever we can to isolate them. We should 
make it clear that the community of nations has put behind it the 
days when we responded to aggression with aggression, when 
we responded to the very dangerous and destructive threats of 
Zhirinovsky by simply spending more money on developing 
nuclear weapons that will respond to him.
<P>
	We have an excellent opportunity to bolster the forces of 
democracy in the former Soviet Union or Russia by entering into 
a common security arrangement with them that would entirely 
demilitarize the Arctic and restore health to a very fragile Arctic 
environment.
<P>
	That would be the most effective way of responding to 
Zhirinovsky and to isolating Zhirinovsky along with the other 
Zhirinovskys of the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> I would like to thank my 
colleague from Burnaby-Kingsway for sharing his time with 
me. This is supposed to be my maiden speech and I am certainly 
pleased, Mr. Speaker, that you have recognized Wayne's World 
over here in the corner.
<P>
	Given the military history of my riding of Saint John, New 
Brunswick, and our long association with the sea and with 
shipbuilding, we may have a somewhat different perspective on 
military matters than many central Canadians. I say that because 
we are building the frigates for Canadians right in my shipyard. 
The shipyard in Lévis, Quebec, to which one of my colleagues in 
the Bloc referred today, is winding down his program. My 
shipyard is winding down our program. I will have 3,500 people 
out of work, probably by the end of this year or by May 1995. I 
hope the Department of Transport and the Department of 
National Defence will be taking a look at the most modern 
shipyard we have in Canada when they are giving out the next 
contracts.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government and the minister of the day, the hon. 
Roméo LeBlanc who is a senator today, gave us our first set of 
frigates and the next government continued on. We do have what 
is considered to be the most modern shipyard in Canada sitting 
in Saint John, New Brunswick. We should continue to build on 
that. I say to my friends across the way in the Liberal 
government that they should take advantage of what they have 
done in the past by putting that shipyard in place.
<P>
	Certainly we in Saint John have never become caught up in the 
fuss regarding this cruise missile business as others have done. I 
smile to myself as I listen to everyone talking about nuclear 
missiles and nuclear power because we have the most efficient 
nuclear power plant in the world. I just came back from 
Romania. The government sent me during this past year. We are 
building nuclear units in Cernavoda, Romania, because we have 
the most efficient nuclear power plant in the world in Saint John.
<P>
	I have interest groups that pop up and think we are building 
nuclear weapons because of our nuclear power plant. Every time 
we use the word nuclear everyone becomes frightened. 
Sometimes it seems to me that Canadians do not really know 
how lucky we are in many areas, to be sure, but certainly in the 
area of defence policy.
<P>
	I hope that the government goes ahead with its planned review 
of defence policy and that the review will both collect the 
opinions of Canadians and act as an opportunity to inform 
Canadians in this area. Few of us of today's generation have ever 
had to go to war or have even been within the range of one. That 
is a blessing, but sometimes one wonders if that inexperience 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="434"> 434 </A></B>
<P>
has given some of our fellow Canadians a rosy view of what it 
takes to make and preserve peace.
<P>
	I do not know if I subscribe to the view that the best defence is 
a good offence, but I subscribe to the view that the best defence 
is important if war is to be deterred. It is in that context that I put 
the testing of the cruise missile delivery system. It is reasonable 
to be prudent until one can be certain that all risks have 
disappeared.
<P>
	There are those who believe that the best path to disarmament 
is for everyone to lay down their arms, or at least stop 
developing weapons technology, and that one way for that to 
happen is for Canada and her defence partners in NATO and 
NORAD to set an example.
<P>
	I respect them for the sincerity of their belief but I do not 
share it. I am from the school that believes disarmament in 
which one can have real confidence requires binding treaties 
between all countries, a reliable and open verification system, 
and some collective method for dealing with violations of 
agreements.
<P>
	Let us not kid ourselves. Would Canada be at any real risk if 
we had no army, no navy, no air force? The truth is that we are 
not far from being at that point right now. Or, even if we opted 
out of NATO or NORAD, would  Canada be at risk? Almost 
certainly not. That may be God's greatest gift to Canada.
<P>
	We are members of mutual defence agreements like NATO 
and NORAD for other reasons than our own defence. There are 
historical connections, commercial markets, countries where 
many of us came from, and even the knowledge that doing 
defence collectively is not only cheaper but to get everyone 
inside the agreements is best way to forestall war completely.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	The world has made great progress towards disarmament in 
the last 10 years aided immeasurably by the changes that have 
happened in Europe, particularly the former U.S.S.R. But as 
long as there are armies and weapons, maintaining the peace 
will require the capacity to defend oneself and one's partners if 
necessary and that means keeping up with technological 
developments.
<P>
	I make no pretence to be an expert on weapons systems or on 
the cruise, but even a little reading shows very quickly that a 
great deal of misinformation has been put about regarding these 
tests over the years.
<P>
	For example, many of the opponents have argued that the 
cruise is only designed for the delivery of nuclear bombs-I 
heard that here all this afternoon and again this evening-and 
that to agree to test it is to be in favour of expanding nuclear 
weapons.
<P>
	It turns out that the missiles used against Hussein in the gulf 
war were cruise missiles delivering regular bombs with amazing 
accuracy as I remember.
<P>
	I noticed that one member of this House has gone so far as to 
say that these tests should not be allowed because they would 
contribute to instability in Russia; that the conservatives there 
would claim the tests prove the west intends to threaten Russia.
<P>
	That seems just a little far-fetched to me. In fact, it may be 
that I should be a little bit worried about why someone would 
want to make that statement and that case. I completely agree 
that a democratic Russia peacefully integrated into Europe is in 
all our interests but it is hard to imagine that testing unarmed 
cruise missiles could have any impact on what is admittedly far 
from a stable situation in Russia.
<P>
	In fact, I cannot find much evidence that supports the notion 
that the issue is a nuclear one any longer. The real issue as far as 
I can tell is that the technology may be too simple and therefore 
readily developable for conventional use.
<P>
	The excellent reports prepared by the Library of Parliament 
say this, for example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As the understandable pre-occupation with Superpower nuclear cruise missiles has 
diminished over the past several years, more attention has been paid to shorter-range 
and much simpler cruise weapons. While not comparable to the long-range systems of 
the United States and Russia, shorter-range (mainly anti-ship) systems are currently in 
service in a number of countries and even more countries have programs for which 
cruise missiles could be developed. According to reports, some U.S. officials feel  
cruise missiles will become an important proliferation threat in the future, and research 
continues to improve the capability to track them. In April 1992, MIT physicist Kosta 
Tsipis argued in The New York Times that while tremendous attention has been paid to 
the proliferation of ballistic missile technology, accurate cruise missiles could pose a 
much greater threat in the future. According to Tsipis, basic technology in the form of 
commercial jet engines, gyroscopes and autopilots is now widely available to anyone 
who wants it. In his words, ``Any country that can manufacture simple aircraft can 
construct a cruise missile that can carry a ton of cargo at least 300 miles and land no 
more than 30 feet from its target.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the reasons for continued testing is the tests include 
testing anti-cruise systems; the capacity of radar and planes to 
find, follow and intercept missiles once launched. Given 
Professor Tsipis' arguments, that information alone may be the 
best reason for carrying on the tests.
<P>
	I suppose it is imaginable that the full scale review of defence 
policy that the government has said is coming could conclude 
that we should take back our defence exclusively to ourselves, 
that we should leave NATO and/or NORAD, but I doubt it very 
much.
<P>
	In any event, it does seem to me and to my party, which may 
only be two, that one would announce a policy review and then 
make changes in the implementation of existing policy prior to 
actually conducting that review. Is that not the whole point of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="435"> 435 </A></B>
<P>
reviewing policy, too find out what both experts and ordinary 
Canadians think should be done before making any changes?
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact, that is what the then Liberal critic for external affairs, 
the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre, said the 
government should have done before renewing the agreement on 
testing in February of this year. He did not say the government 
should hold a one-day debate in the House. He said that if his 
government was elected it would hold full hearings across the 
country. That is presumably what the defence committee is 
going to do, or I trust that is what they are going to do. The 
Liberal's red book made a big issue out of their commitment to 
``the democratization of foreign policy''.
<P>
	We take the government at its word on this question, that this 
debate will be part of the broad, sincere dialogue with Canadians 
that they were promised during the election. Surely the Liberal 
government should honour their entire commitment and not 
make substantive changes in defence policy before those 
hearings have been held. That, in addition to the wisdom of 
being prepared for the worst while negotiating for better, 
suggests to us that these tests should not now be stopped.
<P>
	In that regard, I note that the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> reported on 
Saturday, January 22 that the cabinet has already made the 
decision to allow the tests despite its objection to the test when it 
was in opposition. For that I am pleased, but while we would 
agree with the decision, if the report is true it does not bode well 
for the  government's stated commitment to the democratization 
of the process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Saint John touched on two aspects that are of 
particular interest to me. She talked about potential job losses in 
her shipyard. She also talked about using cruise missiles with 
more accurate guidance systems. I will address this second point 
before going back to the first one and asking the hon. member 
for Saint John for her comments.
<P>
	The need to make the cruise missile guidance systems more 
accurate is a very subtle indication that these missiles will not be 
used to transport nuclear heads. Missiles carrying nuclear heads 
do not have to be very accurate as any hit within a kilometre of 
the target is considered a bull's eye, but great accuracy is 
required to deliver a conventional head for a ``surgical'' 
operation. Therefore, the tests requested by the Americans 
promote the denuclearization of conflicts. That is how I see it 
and I would ask the hon. member to respond and let me know her 
views on this issue.
<P>
	Let us now talk about jobs. We have been talking about war 
and peace for several hours but, in my opinion, the real issues 
are jobs and technology. There will be no war in the near future 
thanks to the diplomatic efforts being made on several fronts to 
resolve certain conflicts. In the meantime, however, the huge 
military-industrial complex needs contracts and the Americans 
are very good at feeding that beast. As a Liberal member was 
saying this afternoon, it would be interesting to implement the 
conversion of the defence industry to civilian uses. The 
technologies we are talking about, namely the recognition of 
patterns through computerized programs, could easily be used 
for computer-assisted work in our plants. There are jobs in all 
this, as the Americans have been quick to realize while we are 
talking about war and peace. What does the hon. member for 
Saint John think of all this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I trust that we are not talking 
about war but that we are talking about peace.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe Canada needs to stay on top of all high technology. It 
needs to work with its partners across the border to make sure 
that peace remains.
<P>
	As I stated in my comments, we need to enter into agreements 
and treaties in order to ensure there are no more wars. I believe 
the free trade agreement entered into by this government will 
encourage high technology and jobs. I am very pleased that the 
government signed the agreement about 18 days after the 
election. I guess it thought the one we negotiated was pretty 
good. I really appreciated that. It is wonderful. We will now 
have jobs for our people.
<P>
	I do not believe that by working with our partners across the 
border we will lose jobs. I believe we will create jobs for our 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
compliment the member for Saint John for her speech on this 
subject. I have been here since the debate began this afternoon 
and I believe her speech has been the most well-reasoned, well 
thought-out and articulated opinion on this subject that we have 
heard or that I have heard in my opinion here this evening and 
this afternoon.
<P>
	I believe it is important that we have both perspectives 
brought into view, but this one was very articulated. I really 
appreciated her speech.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the 
government has afforded me this opportunity to speak. I believe 
this is the freedom that we have been looking for.
<P>
	We are here to represent all our people and this has given me 
that opportunity. I am hoping that we will all work collectively 
together for what is best for Canada.
<P>
	In this case, I will reiterate that I feel it is most important that 
these cruise missile testings take place. In my opinion and in the 
opinion of my party, if this happens it will be a deterrent because 
one never knows what the former Soviet Union is going to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	I was asked by the German government to go to Germany to 
look at unification. I had an opportunity to be on both sides of 
the Berlin wall. It is like night and day. On one side the people 
are living in harmony, but if one crosses over, even today, those 
soldiers are still living in those homes. When one sees it and 
feels it, I say to every member in this House, make sure to vote 
for keeping the cruise missile testing continuing in Canada 
because it must be a deterrent. Things are not what they appear 
to be.
<P>
	We all thought that when the Berlin wall came down 
everything was all right. That has not happened yet. There is a 
lot of need there and there is a lot of need for us to be ready.
<P>
	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Saint John on her maiden 
speech. It was a very thoughtful speech and indeed she listed 
some of the arguments that I want to make myself.
<P>
	I will be brief because we have had a long debate today. 
Again, I want to congratulate the government on having this 
debate before the decision was taken. That leads me to the point 
brought up by the member for Burnaby-Kingsway who said we 
should take our decision now, a negative decision on cruise 
missile testing and then have a defence review.
<P>
	It seems to me that the proper way to proceed is in fact the 
opposite to within the context of a defence review to examine 
cruise missile testing and in fact all other agreements and all 
other defence arrangements that Canada has.
<P>
	We should be very clear that this is not a debate about a 
nuclear weapon as has been pointed out earlier. This is a weapon 
system and it can have a nuclear warhead or it can have a 
conventional warhead. Therefore, the debate is not about 
nuclear weapons. In fact, nuclear weapons are not allowed on 
Canadian soil. That was an initiative that a Liberal government 
took and it is the law of the land at the present time.
<P>
	This is not a debate-we have to be very clear about 
that-about nuclear weapons, but it is about the testing of a 
weapons system that belongs to a partner of ours in North 
America, to a colleague of ours in NATO and to a partner of ours 
in NORAD. I think we should think very carefully about how we 
treat that particular partner and indeed about how we treat this 
particular weapon.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	It may be that we do not want to continue and there is no need 
to continue all of the arrangements that we have with the 
Americans at the present time. However, I repeat that the proper 
examination of that is within an overall defence review and the 
Liberal Party did commit to a defence review when it was in 
opposition and it is committed to a defence review now. I submit 
that that is the proper context in which to determine the future of 
cruise missile testing. We may not want to continue to test cruise 
missiles forever.
<P>
	However, I think we should be very careful about the 
discontinuing of any weapon at the present time. The fall of the 
Berlin wall and the end of the cold war has not brought stability. 
Rather, I think, we can argue that there is more instability in the 
world now than ever before. Our forces took part in the gulf war 
some time ago. It has already been pointed out that a cruise 
missile was very effective in bringing to an end that war.
<P>
	There will be more gulf wars and Canada will be involved in 
them with our partners. NATO was an important part. It was not 
there with the NATO flag but it was an important part of the gulf 
war. The unity, training and coherence of NATO was a very 
important factor in bringing that war to an end. We have to think 
very carefully about dismantling the weapons and the alliances 
that we have in view of the instability that is in the world at the 
present time.
<P>
	What is the success story? The success story is that our way of 
life, beliefs and philosophy have gained pre-eminence because 
of the strength that we had and the strength we were able to 
demonstrate, but not to exercise. NATO never went to war. 
NATO is the most successful military alliance in history and it is 
arguably the best equipped and best trained military alliance in 
history and yet it never went to war. It was successful simply 
because it was there and everybody knew it was there and 
everybody knew what capability it had.
<P>
	The success we have had is because we have been able to 
demonstrate strength. We have to think very carefully before we 
start to weaken our capability. I think it is  important to 
negotiate from strength and not from weakness.
<P>
	Part of that strength clearly has to be the strength of the 
United States itself. The United States is not universally popular 
and there are many people who resent the growing role of the 
U.S. as the world cop. I would prefer to see the UN become that 
cop, but it is clearly true that in all of our alliances we in Canada 
and other allies on both sides of the Atlantic depend heavily on 
the might of the American military machine for our alliances. 
We have to think very carefully about reducing the strength of 
that machine and those alliances in the present circumstances.
<P>
	I do not think it is necessary to draw this debate out for a long 
time. I simply want to repeat in closing that the proper 
examination of cruise missile testing is within the overall 
review of defence policy. Clearly I think that is the way to 
proceed and my counsel to the government would be to maintain 
our agreement. It is a signed agreement and whether it is with 
the United States or any other partner I think we have to be very 
careful about our own credibility if we simply break agreements 
unilaterally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="437"> 437 </A></B>
<P>
	The proper examination of whether to go ahead with cruise 
missile testing or not in the future is within the defence review 
and not at the present time.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
go back to this issue because I would like to hear the views of the 
members who are taking part in the debate today, with respect to 
employment.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	The previous speaker said that NAFTA would allow us to have 
access to these new technologies. But we must not forget that 
those are classified technologies, since they are designed for 
military purposes by the American DOD. Therefore, specific 
agreements would have to be made with the United States to 
enable Canadian contractors to have access to this type of high 
technology and to get the R and D contracts for that technology. 
I would like to hear the opinion of the hon. member for Labrador 
on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure I caught the 
whole question. I apologize but I wonder if the hon. member 
would simply repeat the question please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, the point is with NAFTA 
you have access to the markets over there but in the case in 
question here this is classified technology. It is not obvious that 
the DOD will give us this access or will give it to our suppliers. 
What is your opinion on what your government should do to 
ensure that the Americans give our suppliers access to that 
technology and to the R and D contracts that go with it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think I was the one 
who brought up NAFTA. I think it was the hon. member for Saint 
John.
<P>
	Nevertheless it seems to me that there are a number of ways in 
which that information can be shared. We do have defence 
agreements with the U.S. We have defence production 
agreements and we have a number of mechanisms whereby 
information can be shared. I think it is entirely possible within 
the various co-operation agreements that we have and within the 
various alliances that we have to ask and to get the United States 
to share the kind of information that the hon. member is talking 
about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here to participate in this 
very important debate. Before I get into my speech I would just 
like to point out a couple of comments that were made by the 
member for Saint John and the member for Labrador. They want 
to differentiate between cruise missile testing and whether it is 
carrying nuclear weapons or conventional weapons.
<P>
	I would like to point out that whether it is conventional or 
nuclear, it is a weapon of destruction. This is a weapon of war we 
are talking about. The conventional weapon kills a few less 
people, but it kills people nonetheless.
<P>
	I would like to thank my colleague the Minister of National 
Defence and his parliamentary secretary for this opportunity. I 
am proud that my party and the leader of my party, the right hon. 
Prime Minister, is giving the House the chance to discuss this 
matter before final decisions are made.
<P>
	The issue of cruise missile testing is a sensitive one for the 
people of the Northwest Territories. As a member of Parliament 
form the NWT it is my duty and privilege to bring their views to 
this Chamber.
<P>
	The people of the Northwest Territories have a strong and 
deep conviction on this matter. Since 1984, when testing began 
over the Mackenzie Valley, the legislative assembly of the 
Northwest Territories passed six resolutions opposing these 
tests. Numerous letters of concern have been sent from the NWT 
government and from individual residents of the Northwest 
Territories.
<P>
	Despite these clear and frequent expressions of the will of the 
people of the Northwest Territories, the missile testing 
agreement has been renewed again and again. Over northern 
objections, the initial testing agreement was renewed in 1988 
for a further five years. In 1989 the Government of Canada 
agreed to allow the testing of the advanced cruise missiles. In 
1993 the government agreed to a ten-year renewal without even 
consulting the government of the Northwest Territories.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	Northerners were shocked by this total disregard for their 
concerns and felt that their voices had not been heard on this 
issue. At the heart of the matter for northerners is their right to 
determine what happens on their territory.
<P>
	The Northwest Territories is a vast land but it is not an empty 
land. The aboriginal people of the Western Arctic in the region 
where the tests take place, the Dene and the Inuvialuit, have 
lived there for thousands of years. Much more recently, 
non-aboriginal people have chosen to make the NWT their 
home.
<P>
	While the population of the region may be considered small 
by southern urban standards, together, all the peoples of the 
NWT are working to build a better future for their children. A 
big part of that future involves aboriginal land claim 
settlements. While progress has been made in this area not all 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="438"> 438 </A></B>
<P>
aboriginal people have achieved land claim settlements. Work is 
still proceeding on several outstanding claims.
<P>
	For those who have not yet settled their claims and for those 
who have, protection and enhancement of the traditional 
economy and lifestyle is an overriding concern. While most 
aboriginal people have settled in communities, their culture and 
economies take them out on the land at various times throughout 
the year. Traditional hunting and trapping grounds can be miles 
away from so-called home communities.
<P>
	When the cruise missiles fly up the Mackenzie Valley to the 
Beaufort Sea, they are not flying over unused and unoccupied 
territory. They are flying over lands that are and have been used 
and loved by generations of people who live up there.
<P>
	Northerners also see a future for themselves that builds closer 
ties with their circumpolar neighbours. While it may be natural 
for southern Canadians to look south, it is more natural for 
northerners to look north and around.
<P>
	The people of the NWT have much in common with other 
circumpolar peoples. Beside climate, we share many social and 
economic concerns. We see opportunities to learn from each 
other and to contribute to each other's development.
<P>
	The peoples of the north are peaceful people. We do not feel 
comfortable with our land being used as testing grounds for 
weapons of war.
<P>
	We worry about the consequences of accidents and the 
damage that could be done to our communities, the wildlife and 
the environment. At this time the threat of an accident from the 
testing of an American cruise missile is far more real to the 
NWT residents than that of the threat of an attack from the old 
Soviet Union and accidents have happened. Let me point them 
out.
<P>
	In 1990 a Canadian CF-18 crashed outside of Inuvik while 
tracking a cruise missile that had been released from an B-52 
bomber.
<P>
	In 1986 two cruise missiles went down during tests. One 
crashed near Primrose, Alberta and the second one went down in 
the Beaufort Sea.
<P>
	Last February, when Canada renewed the cruise missile 
testing agreement with the United States without consulting the 
government of the Northwest Territories or northern aboriginal 
organizations, the leader of the NWT government wrote to the 
Minister of National Defence. She expressed her 
disappointment and concern that the views of the people most 
directly affected by this testing were not even considered.
<P>
	Other members of the legislative assembly also made their 
views known. Some very eloquent words on this matter were 
spoken by the Dene member for Nahendeh, Mr. Jim Antoine. I 
want to share his views with this House and the Canadian 
people. I am excerpting from his statement in the legislative 
assembly in Yellowknife on February 23 of last year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These missiles fly through Dene airspace in my constituency. I have talked to 
people who are in the bush on their trap lines and they have seen these missiles fly 
above the trees. They are followed by B-52 bombers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am opposed to cruise missile testing and I am also opposed to war. I saw the 
coverage on television which showed how cruise missiles were used in the war 
in Iraq. I saw how destructive these cruise missiles could be. I had troubled 
feelings in my heart. I felt like the Northwest Territories had contributed to that 
destruction by allowing those missiles to be tested in the air over our traditional 
lands.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Northerners continue to have troubled feelings in their hearts 
over the role of the military in our territory. While military 
expenditures have improved transportation and communication 
infrastructures and have generated employment, training and 
business opportunities for northerners, these benefits have not 
been as great as northerners had hoped. For many northerners 
the negative social and environmental impact of cruise missile 
testing, low-level training flights and related military activities 
outweigh the benefits. For years a number of northern 
organizations, non-aboriginal and aboriginal, have been 
working toward demilitarization of the Arctic. The Inuit 
Circumpolar Conference has been a pioneer in this effort.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	In 1990 the Government of the Northwest Territories released 
a discussion paper on military activity in the north which 
proposed the establishment of a circumpolar zone of peace and 
security. While the Department of National Defence did not 
respond favourably to the concept at that time, I would ask that 
this proposal for a circumpolar zone of peace and security be 
looked at again. Cruise missile testing of course would have no 
place in such a regime.
<P>
	In any case northerners do not simply see the need for 
continued cruise missile testing over their territory. As the NWT 
government leader recently stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In our view, the cruise missile testing component of military activity in the 
Northwest Territories can no longer be justified given the significant changes 
which have occurred in the international arena during the past few years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree. Northerners recognize that although the cold war is 
over other security concerns have arisen. However they question 
whether the standard military responses are the appropriate or 
only responses we can make. In many cases an economic helping 
hand may accomplish more for our long-term security interests 
than military shows of force.
<P>
	I suggest that northerners who have a unique perspective on 
peace and security can make valuable contributions to the 
upcoming review of national defence policy. Northern views 
should be fully represented and considered in this review.
<P>
	By increasing and improving communications and 
co-operation with our circumpolar neighbours, northerners are 
building bridges across the Arctic Ocean. Northerners are 
forging new friendships and renewing and strengthening old 
ones. For those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="439"> 439 </A></B>
<P>
who may not be aware a northern firm recently built a village in 
Siberia.
<P>
	Northerners do not believe continued cruise missile testing in 
the Northwest Territories will further the goals of enhanced 
peace and security. Cessation of these tests however could be a 
bold step toward a new circumpolar security regime.
<P>
	Cruise missile testing is only one component of the umbrella 
test and evaluation agreement we have with the United States. It 
is possible to terminate this specific project arrangement 
without terminating the other parts of this agreement.
<P>
	Northerners are not suggesting the termination of the entire 
umbrella agreement. They are only asking for the termination of 
the specific cruise missile testing component. Let us take a bold 
step. Let us cancel the cruise missile testing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
the House that questions should be on the previous speaker's 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Madam Speaker, 
like many members in this House I have mixed feelings on this 
question. I certainly appreciate the comments of my colleague. I 
am sure we all share the anguish he must feel representing the 
people most directly affected by this important decision. It 
certainly would not bother me to see Canadian foreign policy by 
this new government show a little bit of independence at this 
time from the United States.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if he could comment on what I 
am hearing as one of the strongest arguments in favour of the 
testing, at least in my opinion, and it is simply this. As a partner 
in NORAD with the United States are we not bound to some 
extent, if not very bound, to carry out this test as part of that 
NORAD partnership?
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could address that concern. I 
listened closely to his comments. They were excellent 
comments, but I did not hear that particular argument 
mentioned. I sincerely would be interested in how he might 
respond to that argument because I think it is also a strong point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Madam Speaker, we do have agreements with 
other countries, whether they are of a military nature or any 
nature. We do have agreements with other countries, treaties, 
pacts. We have to remember we are still an independent country. 
I have very strong feelings about the fact that Canada is a free 
country. We are a nation of people who are peace loving.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	I do not think we have an agreement with the United States 
that can be, as I pointed out at the end of my speech, terminated 
year by year. I do not think we are getting into any trouble. 
Frankly, I would not care if we got into trouble with the United 
States. I do not think we are getting into any trouble if we decide 
to cancel cruise missile testing in the far north.
<P>
	As I said earlier in a point to one of the members, the area of 
possible conflict has changed in the last two or three years. The 
terrain is not the same. If the Americans had to attack anybody it 
would not be the Soviet Union.
<P>
	Despite some concerns about the mad guy from Russia-I 
cannot remember his name, the fool anyway-I do not think he 
is a threat. Therefore Russia is not a threat. There is no Soviet 
Union. The threat is more from other countries that may be 
developing nuclear weapons.
<P>
	Why do we not ask the United States to test their cruise 
missiles over terrain of similar nature. If the terrain is similar to 
the terrain between here and Montreal or Toronto and Vancouver 
why not test it through there?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> I would like to ask the hon. 
member a brief question. I also have mixed feelings regarding 
this issue, and since I also represent a riding which is bordered 
by the far North, I want to ask the member this question: Since 
our country and his region have never experienced war, if we had 
to go to war some day and had not learned how to defend 
ourselves, either alone or with the help of allies, would the hon. 
member still think that he made the right decision today?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Madam Speaker, when the member for Saint 
John was speaking she pointed out quite clearly that the cruise 
missiles that they were using carrying conventional weapons 
were very accurate.
<P>
	It is not as though we were suffering from lack of knowledge 
on how to make a cruise missile that can hit a target within a few 
feet. It is not as if we are going to lose out by not continuing to 
test the cruise missile.
<P>
	We already have weapons that can hit within a few feet from 
hundreds of miles away. I do not think we will get  into trouble if 
we do not test the cruise missile. I do not think the world will be 
any worse off if the cruise missile is not tested. If it is used as it 
is, it still destroys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise today and speak as the 
representative for Edmonton Southwest and to represent the 
citizens of that fine part of the world.
<P>
	Let me begin as others have before me in congratulating you 
and all members of the House on winning the election and 
thereby being entrusted with this high honour, this great 
responsibility and opportunity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="440"> 440 </A></B>
<P>
	As this is my maiden address in the House, I wonder if hon. 
members would bear with me for a moment as I go through the 
traditional greetings and tell them a little about the constituency 
of Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
<B>(2045 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to start, if I may, by thanking the electors of 
Edmonton Southwest for sending me here, and particularly all 
those who worked on my campaign so hard and so selflessly. I 
would also like very much to thank my family, without whose 
help I certainly would not be here today. They are probably the 
most interested people watching the debate at this very moment.
<P>
	Just as an indication of things that may or may not go wrong, 
even if you think that everything is absolutely perfect, they are 
watching me today at a friend's. We get our television from the 
Anik II satellite, which is not working. So the world is not a 
predictable place. We have to be prepared for contingencies. 
This is what this cruise debate is all about. I will get back to that 
in a moment.
<P>
	I wish to thank the voters of Edmonton Southwest for sending 
me here and I pledge to them and I pledge to you, my colleagues, 
that I will represent them with fidelity, with honour and with 
dignity in this House so as not to betray the trust they vested in 
me. I also pledge to represent this House with the same honour 
and dignity and fidelity so as not to betray the trust that we share 
as honourable colleagues here together.
<P>
	It is also appropriate and traditional at this time to recognize 
members who represented the seat in other Parliaments. It is not 
always done but I think it is very appropriate for me to do so 
because this seat in the last Parliament and for the previous 
couple of Parliaments was represented by Mr. Jim Edwards. Jim, 
while we evolved to different political persuasions, always 
treated me and his political foes with dignity and kindness. I am 
sure that other members of this House would join with me in 
wishing Jim, his wife Sheila and family good fortune in the 
years ahead of them.
<P>
	The constituency of Edmonton Southwest is just about 100 
per cent urban. It has a bit of farmland on the extreme south and 
the extreme west ends but it is 90 per cent urban. It has very little 
industry, but a good deal of retail, and it is the home of the 
world's greatest shopping centre, regardless of whatever you 
may have heard about  what exists in the United States. The Mall 
of the Americas will fit into a corner of the great West Edmonton 
Mall, which is a tourist destination that everyone should take in 
as they go through the wonderful, beautiful province of Alberta.
<P>
	Edmonton Southwest has a good mix of people. It is much like 
this Parliament. It is wonderful to sit here and see the mix that is 
in this Parliament, which is truly representative of our great 
country. Edmonton Southwest has aboriginal Canadians. It has 
recent immigrants. It has children of immigrants who were not 
so recent. It is a very pluralistic constituency, and as an example 
the Toronto-Dominion Bank I deal with is bilingual. The signs 
outside are in English and Chinese. Our constituency and our 
country is changing, it is evolving. We should recognize that and 
we should embrace it. We should not be afraid of it. The electors 
and the residents of Edmonton Southwest, I think, do embrace 
the pluralistic nature of our society.
<P>
	The voters of Edmonton Southwest sent me to Ottawa with a 
very clear mandate, and that mandate was to represent them in 
Ottawa and not the other way around. They sent me with a 
mandate to inculcate a sense of parsimony and of personal 
responsibility in government. They sent me here to be part of a 
Parliament that would get a handle on the outrageous systemic 
overspending that has been a hallmark of governments at all 
levels in Canadian society for the last 20 years. They sent me 
here to try and inculcate with all of our hon. colleagues a sense 
that we cannot go on this way forever. Sooner or later we have to 
start living within our means. We need to recognize the situation 
in the world and in our country as it is, not as we would wish it to 
be.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	My constituents also sent me here with another mandate. That 
was to be forthright, direct, and honest in dealing with the Bloc. 
We want our Canada to stay united but we want it to be united on 
a solid foundation. That means all of the protagonists in this 
great debate that is going to rise of its own in a year or so need to 
get everything out on the table and deal with it honestly so that 
one way or another we can put the matter behind us and get on 
with the future.
<P>
	That is precisely the kind of commitment I make and that I 
make to my hon. colleagues of the Bloc. I promise them it will 
be a constructive and honest debate. I wish to be a part of it 
representing my constituents who, make no mistake, want us to 
remain a united Canada.
<P>
	Let me get to the reason for this debate. I will not speak a lot 
about it because virtually everything I have to say on the cruise 
missile has already been said by others over the course of the 
day, many very eloquently and many direct from the heart.
<P>
	I do not pretend to be an expert on defence and I certainly do 
not pretend to be an expert on the cruise missile. I asked if I 
could participate in this debate because I wanted to put forward 
the feelings of the  residents I represent in Edmonton Southwest 
about this kind of issue, an issue where the word of Canada is 
really at stake. Make no mistake, that is what we are talking 
about. We are talking about the veracity of our word when we 
make a deal in the community of nations.
<P>
	That is the underlying theme of the position I would like to 
bring to this debate. When our national government makes an 
undertaking with another government it is in essence making an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="441"> 441 </A></B>
<P>
agreement or a commitment on behalf of each of us as individual 
citizens.
<P>
	There is a truism therefore that comes into play in a situation 
like that. The truism is that your word is your bond. We are only 
as good as our word individually, and collectively as a nation.
<P>
	Our government at the time committed us to an agreement and 
we are therefore honour bound to live up to it today. The bottom 
line is that we should allow these tests to proceed for the 
following reasons.
<P>
	We made an agreement with the United States in good faith 
and we should stick to it. Cruise missiles may be used to deliver 
conventional ordinances. Many countries now have the ability 
to manufacture and use cruise missiles and therefore it is in our 
best interests to learn how to track and intercept them.
<P>
	There is a defensive nature to the testing of cruise missiles 
which needs to be recognized. Unless cruise missiles are flown 
in a test mode how would our pilots and how would our radar 
interceptors ever get the ability or the knowledge to learn how to 
intercept them?
<P>
	The test corridor is in a sparsely settled area thereby posing 
little or no inconvenience or damage to Canadians or to wildlife. 
I do recognize the points made by the hon. member who 
addressed this House prior to me that it is an inhabited territory. 
There are people who do live there and we should not go through 
this without at least getting their permission or their leave to do 
it just as a matter of courtesy.
<P>
	An extremely important consideration is that we have an 
obligation to co-operate with our NORAD partner under whose 
protective umbrella the western world has lived for 40 years. 
Not to mention the fact as others have made the point before me 
that we are going into bilateral negotiations with the Americans 
from time to time. How would you feel if you had been giving 
comfort to and looking after your neighbour for 40 years and 
when you wanted to borrow his lawnmower he said no.
<P>
	There is a quid pro quo here. We have to work together.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to respond to the member from Edmonton 
Southwest in his statement that we are honour bound to our 
agreement.
<P>
	It is my contention that we are honour bound to our children 
and our future children. A group of Alberta physicians once 
stated that prevention is the only treatment for war.
<P>
	I would urge the government to consider cancelling the cruise 
missile testing that is taking world leadership in working toward 
the prevention of war. I would like my hon. colleague on the 
other side to consider this as well.
<P>
	Members of this House had an incredible opportunity 
yesterday to debate an issue of great global significance. 
However the substance of the debate dealt with the treatment of 
war.
<P>
	As we found out yesterday and indeed as humankind has 
struggled repeatedly over the millennia of world history, 
treating victims stricken with the disease of war is tremendously 
difficult, if not impossible.
<P>
	The government is undertaking a review of current defence 
policy. Canada's role as a peacekeeper-peacemaker needs 
redefinition in the light of changing world conditions.
<P>
	I am very thankful to the government for encouraging open 
debate on the topics of peacekeeping in Bosnia and the cruise 
missile testing.
<P>
	This debate is especially important to new members like 
myself and my colleague as it sends out a strong and very real 
message to not only the member's constituents in Edmonton 
Southwest but to my constituents in York-Simcoe.
<P>
	To the people of Canada, the Prime Minister is serious and 
committed to including input from all members of the House 
whether on the government side or not, whether in cabinet or 
not.
<P>
	The debates of the last two days are crucial because it is only 
through a comprehensive examination of the totality of 
Canada's defence policy that we can put the decision whether or 
not to continue the testing of cruise missiles in proper 
perspective and make a decision that is right for the times.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member for Calgary Southwest that 
yes, we are bound to certain kinds of agreements. Those are 
agreements written on paper. Those are agreements that are part 
of legislated agreements between governments.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member and I would like him to 
consider that we are honour bound to our children and our future 
children as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be very succinct.
<P>
	If the agreement that we were honour bound to live up to were 
an agreement of disarmament, I am sure the hon. member would 
have no problem in admonishing this House to live up to that 
agreement. It is the question that you lie to the devil that you do 
not like.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not have much time, but I will try to be quick. The hon. member 
talked about a defensive strategy and I found his point 
interesting. I would have liked to learn a bit more about that. 
There has been a gradual change in the deterrent strategy with 
which I have agreed for years. The nuclear era started with the 
bombing of Hiroshima. Then we witnessed a gradual build-up 
of destructive power to a point were total destruction of a city 
the size of New York was possible. Nowadays, the deterrent 
strategy is more and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="442"> 442 </A></B>
<P>
more focused on better-targeted weapons. I would have liked 
the hon. member to further explain his point of view, as it seems 
to me that this justifies the testing of cruise missiles over 
Canadian territory. Could he elaborate briefly on this new 
deterrent strategy based on precise strikes rather than on total 
annihilation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member has 
about 30 seconds to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think that I can. I 
do not have the confidence to answer that question as I am sure 
the hon. member would want me to.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to start by complimenting the government on 
having this the second open debate which I presume is sincerely 
that, open and not as suggested by our colleague the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway that the fix is already in. I 
choose to believe there is honour on the other side and that we 
are going at this in an open manner.
<P>
	I would also like to address a word to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who alluded to the fact that maybe those 
in this corner of the House were in collusion and we were not 
having an open debate. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
In our debate yesterday on peacekeeping we had sincere 
differences of opinion even though there was some hanging 
together.
<P>
	I assure the House it is entirely so with this current debate on 
the cruise missile. We each have our own opinion. It may happen 
that it sounds much of the same tune, but it is entirely our own 
version of what should be done.
<P>
	The cold war is over. I have heard a lot of comments today 
about the cold war being over. Let us remind ourselves that we in 
the west won the cold war and we won it by being prepared. We 
did not have to shoot off weapons, missiles or anything of the 
sort. We won it through peaceful means but that meant being 
prepared and being armed and being armed better than the other 
side. So it is a successful strategy for peace.
<P>
	Has the threat in the world diminished? Not on your life it has 
not. The world is in greater danger today. It is more unstable 
today than it has been for a long time.
<P>
	I hear some debates in this House that are very idealistic in 
nature and I think we should preserve that to the degree that we 
can. Have our idealists. Have them say we should have peace. 
We all believe in peace. The soldier is the first one who will 
throw his arms on the pile if we can ever achieve that moment 
when we have agreement in the world to have peace. In the 
meantime the world is a rough place. Let us see how rough.
<P>
	The Senate of this Parliament had put out a report, ``Meeting 
new Challenges-Canada's Response to a New Generation of 
Peacekeeping'' and I read from that: ``The current crisis has its 
roots in the proliferation of states which followed the second 
world war. At the end of that war there were barely 60 states. 
Through decolonization that number increased to almost 160 
states by 1988. With the break up of Yugoslavia and the Soviet 
Union the number is over 180 and climbing''.
<P>
	If you do not believe that, take a little tour of the world with 
me in your imagination. Let us go across the Pacific and look at 
the situation between northern Japan and Russia. It always has 
been tense. Move over a little to North and South Korea. They 
are still at odds. Look at all of China. We have not even begun to 
count the factions within China that are a potential problem. In 
fact look at the Chinas, the People's Republic as well as the 
other one.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	If we go through Indo-China, Cambodia and Laos, what do we 
see? We see more potential problems. We could go to Indonesia 
and look at the problems it has had. If we flip over from there to 
Sri Lanka, we see a problem in Sri Lanka that has been there for 
a lot of years. If we go to India or Pakistan what do we see? 
Tension. We could go from there to the Middle East. I do not 
even have to describe the Middle East. It is there. It has been 
there over, over and over again. If we go from there to South 
Africa, the Republic of South Africa and all the countries of 
Africa, what do we see? We see potential for problems.
<P>
	From there we can cross the Mediterranean and look at what 
we have in Europe today. We have the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia that we discussed yesterday. If we traverse the 
Atlantic Ocean, to finish our tour, and look at the Caribbean we 
still have trouble spots. We could look at Central America, a 
continuing problem, and even South America. Chile is quiet 
now. There is no war in Argentina. We do not hear much about 
the shining path in Peru, but we can bet our boots we will hear 
about it again.
<P>
	The world is an unstable place. Until something magic 
happens to unite human beings to say that this is the way to 
peace, we must be prepared.
<P>
	Let us go back in history a bit to look at our situations before 
World War I and before World War II. We have to relearn the 
lessons of history. We say: ``This war is the war to end all wars. 
It is all done''. It is not done.  Until I see something very special 
come along I will know it is never done. Therefore let us be 
prepared.
<P>
	We are talking about weapons systems such as the cruise. 
Several people have already differentiated between the fact that 
it can carry a conventional warhead and a nuclear one. Much of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="443"> 443 </A></B>
<P>
the argument here has been concentrated on nuclear. It carries a 
conventional weapon and as such it is another excellent weapon 
in our total arsenal. We cannot predict which weapon in our 
arsenal we are going to reach for.
<P>
	We could look at Vietnam. We saw the Americans bringing 
back C-47 aircraft and mounting Gatling guns in the open 
doorways. That tells us, if we look at that situation and at the 
gulf war, that we need a complete set of weapons in our arsenal. 
We do not know which one we will have to pick.
<P>
	Thus it is incumbent on us to allow the Americans to continue 
the testing of this specific weapon in case it is needed. We have 
the technological lead in the west. How long will we continue to 
have that lead? We do not know. There are all sorts of other 
countries or groups working to exceed what we have. If we have 
a lead, hang on to it.
<P>
	Finally I ask this question: Has Canada contributed its share 
to democracy or the defence of the west over the last number of 
years? If I look at my time before and after being in NATO, I 
think the answer is no. We have been cheapskating. We have 
always been down around Luxembourg. This gives us a chance 
as a country to pay off some of our debts.
<P>
	I will leave it at that except to reiterate the point made by the 
hon. member for Saint John concerning proliferation. This 
refinement of the missile is a means to prevent proliferation if 
that happens to us.
<P>
<B>(2110 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to ask the hon. member on the other side some 
questions regarding the statement about increased instability in 
the world and the need to use cruise missile tests as a way of 
reducing some of this instability.
<P>
	As I said earlier, prevention is the only treatment for war. The 
Canadian people through their government have a remarkable 
opportunity to take a stand against the proliferation of the tools 
of war by refusing to continue cruise missile testing on 
Canadian soil.
<P>
	Contrary to an earlier statement by a member on the opposite 
side of the House, we do not prepare for peace by preparing for 
war. In fact the mid-eastern war of 1991 showed that in 
preparing for war we prepare and encourage more war. Most of 
the weaponry used by Iraq was manufactured by G-7 countries. 
In fact, even though we are in a post cold war period, the military 
industrial complex of western world countries flourishes as the 
result of sales to Third World countries increasing global 
instability and jeopardizing the world peace the member on the 
other side of the floor has recently spoken to.
<P>
	If we are suffering from so much tension and problems in the 
world, won't supplying more armaments and guns just be like 
adding fuel to the fire?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand the thrust of the 
argument of my friend across the way. We do not get rid of 
tensions by hiding weapons. If the world could find a way of 
disarming so that everyone disarmed, I would be totally in 
favour of it. I said earlier that all people who have borne arms 
would feel the same way. They would be the first to put them on 
the pile.
<P>
	We have not arrived at that point yet, it is sad to say. As soon 
as we can see it coming we should do something about it. If we 
could start to reduce the arms in the world I would be the first to 
join the club, but we have not arrived at that stage yet.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> I heard the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan say that we had won the cold war with 
arms but without using them.
<P>
	The fact is, if we had not dared-perhaps with an incredible 
lack of judgment-if we had not tempted fate with nuclear 
weapons, if we had not chanced it to the point of madness, to the 
point of the ``mutual mad'' as they called it, if we had not 
implemented deterrents, maybe none of us would be here 
tonight to talk about peace.
<P>
	Even though this weapons race may be foolish, at least it 
ensures the precarious parity that now exists and we must take 
that risk until our planet is completely free of violence. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case yet; we live in a violent world 
and if I let my guard down, if we as a country let our guard down, 
someone somewhere will seize the opportunity. Alas, this is not 
Disney World yet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a real treat to participate on behalf of the constituents of 
Scarborough-Rouge River in a debate of this nature. Early in 
this Parliament our Prime Minister said to the House: ``Please 
take this issue, debate it and tell me what Canadians think''. I 
can see individuals in my caucus over here and in their caucuses 
over there with views on both sides of the issue. It is unlikely I 
will be able to address any issue which has not already been 
covered. I want to compliment all of my colleagues, especially 
those who have made their first interventions and speeches in 
the House.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	What is the cruise missile? It is simply a delivery system. This 
was not the case 10 years ago. Ten years ago the cruise missile 
was seen as a delivery system but more importantly a delivery 
system for strategic nuclear capability. That did not make a lot 
of us in this country very comfortable.
<P>
	I know the Liberal Party grappled with the issue for many 
years inside the party, not necessarily in the House, and in 
caucus. I can see that its position has changed from time to time 
over the last one or two decades.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="444"> 444 </A></B>
<P>
	Something happened a few years ago that changed my view in 
relation to the cruise missile. That was the gulf war. As a 
taxpayer, as an individual who cared a lot about what was 
happening at the time of the gulf war, for the first time I was able 
to see right in the opposition lobby something involving a cruise 
missile that did not involve nuclear or strategic nuclear 
warheads.
<P>
	It was at that point that I began to look at the cruise missile a 
little differently. We are talking about roughly 288 cruise 
missiles that were used by the United States as part of what was 
called the allied effort in relation to the gulf war.
<P>
	Having formed a view that the cruise missile was not 
necessarily part of the nuclear capability, I began to look at it 
more as something capable of carrying a payload. In the gulf war 
it had carried a conventional warhead for very specific tactical 
purposes.
<P>
	My colleagues and I realize that it did kill. As I stand here I do 
not know what the body count was, but there were many killed 
and presumably many maimed by the Tomahawk cruise missiles 
used in the gulf war. It was not intentional but there still was 
death and the attendant destruction.
<P>
	Is not the cruise missile simply an increasingly sophisticated 
product of research, development and delivery capability? What 
if the cruise missile simply carried a camera? What if 
technologically we got the cruise missile to go out and come 
back?
<P>
	I know we can take pictures of the earth from satellites. We do 
not really need an unmanned capability all of the time, but what 
if there is cloud cover or what if we are talking about a volcano 
with all kinds of cloud cover? Perhaps the cruise missile could 
have the benefit of the doubt in being seen in a more benevolent 
or kinder content in great contrast with what it has been used as, 
a weapon of war.
<P>
	In saying that I want to articulate my general acquiescence in 
the agreement that permits testing of the cruise missile in 
Canadian territory. I say that knowing the agreement permits the 
sharing of the test results with Canada. I am making an 
assumption, I hope not too naively, that the technology is known 
to the appropriate elements of our armed forces as a technology 
that they can work with.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	There are three sensitivities that I have to put on the record 
and I am sure some of them, if not all, are shared by all my 
colleagues here.
<P>
	First, I have listened intently to the remarks of our colleague, 
the member for Nunatsiaq. I am very sensitive to the issue put 
that the testing of the cruise missile over northwestern Canada 
has to be subjected to the scrutiny  of residents there. The long 
term residents there include the Dene and the Inuvialuit and if 
they have something to say to us through their members then we 
have to listen. We must listen. There are elements of safety, 
environment and morality.
<P>
	Second, this next item of sensitivity has been mentioned by 
the previous speaker and was articulated very well. It is that 
Canada must continue to make its contribution to global 
stability. It must continue to do its part in terms of ensuring our 
defence capability and our ability to be there at times when the 
world needs us as a country. We must participate in that. We 
must foster that.
<P>
	I do not think we have been carrying our load internationally 
in that regard. There were times when we did not really want to 
when it was a cold war battle between two or three nuclear 
powers. Times have changed. We know that from time to time 
the world needs what our country has to offer in terms of global 
stability.
<P>
	Third, we have a moral obligation to those who will follow us 
in this world to do everything possible on our end to remove the 
nuclear threat from the entire world.
<P>
	I know there is an overlap here with the way we used to look at 
the cruise missile, but something tells me that the nuclear threat 
to this world does not relate so much any more to the cruise 
missile. It relates more to stockpiles and of previously built 
nuclear weapons and the potential nuclear weapon to be built 
that is in a steamer trunk somewhere in the world where it should 
not be. God only knows what might happen should we go down 
that road.
<P>
	Those three sensitivities I leave on the record. In the end, 
having analysed this and attempting to articulate what I think 
are the views of my constituents in Scarborough-Rouge River, 
I am, along with other colleagues in the House who may feel this 
way, acquiescent and accepting that Canada should stay as part 
of the current cruise missile testing agreement with the United 
States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
previous member who represented this Waterloo riding was the 
Hon. Walter McLean who was preceded by Max Saltzman. In 
some ways I reflect some of their thinking and the thinking of 
the community that I represent.
<P>
	We have to ask this question. When do we have enough 
armaments?
<P>
	I heard the hon. member talk about an almost benevolent 
cruise missile, one which does not have to have nuclear 
capability.
<P>
<B>(2125 ) </B>
<P>
	If one looks at what initially instigated the development of the 
cruise missile, which was the Soviet Union, and if one looks at 
the Soviet Union today and its break up into many different 
states, one cannot help but think of Ukraine that has nuclear 
weapons and the world  desperately wants it to give them up. In 
some sense I wonder how Canada as a nation that faces virtually 
no threat from Russia can tell the Ukrainians that they should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="445"> 445 </A></B>
<P>
give up their nuclear weapons when we are acquiescing to the 
testing of the cruise missile.
<P>
	We were here all day yesterday debating the war in Bosnia and 
what role this House should take. I really believe that these 
debates are very refreshing. I am glad to see that the Reform 
Party is not sticking together on the issue. They are expressing 
genuinely different points of view and I think that can be said 
about the House as a whole.
<P>
	I guess at some point in time we have to say that we have 
enough weapons of mass destruction. We are just dealing now 
with the cruise, but there are biological and chemical weapons 
that exist on this fragile plant. To take a phrase from Project 
Ploughshares from my community it is time to turn some of that 
weaponry into ploughshares. It is time to turn some of those 
swords into ploughshares.
<P>
	If a country like Canada, with our special standing in the 
world as a middle power and really of little threat as an 
aggressor, is unable to do that then my question has to be this. 
What country is going to take the first step?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member makes a 
wonderful point here. The issue of the nuclear stockpile is out 
there and is unresolved by the entire global community. As I 
understand it I think the Ukraine has reached an agreement to 
liquidate, store away, give away or trade away its nuclear 
stockpile. That was a real plus. I hope they get to the end of their 
inventory.
<P>
	However, I fall back on the remarks I made earlier that I view 
the cruise missile as a delivery system. Maybe it will be the very 
best delivery system we have ever developed. Maybe the cruise 
missile and developments of the cruise missile will become the 
flying saucer of the planet earth because of its ability to move in 
an unmanned way and guide itself. Let us forget about the 
sausage shape for now. It does not have to carry a nuclear 
warhead.
<P>
	Canada has insisted that none of the cruise missiles in Canada 
will carry nuclear warheads. Canada is in the forefront in the 
world in convincing countries to abandon their nuclear 
capability. I point out the regional dispute between India and 
Pakistan involving their own alleged nuclear capabilities and 
the arguments about delivery systems also.
<P>
	I hope that my children's children will have fewer nuclear 
warheads to worry about than that which the hon. member and 
the rest of us have to worry about now.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I am pleased to 
participate as the member for Richmond-Wolfe in this debate 
on cruise missiles and I would like to send warm greetings to all 
the voters in my constituency of  Richmond-Wolfe who placed 
their trust in me last October 25 and gave me a clear mandate.
<P>
	Obviously, we must examine this particular issue within a 
broader context. The Bloc Quebecois would have liked the 
government to undertake a comprehensive review of national 
defence policy. Nevertheless, for a sovereigntist member of 
Parliament and member of the Bloc Quebecois, the Canada-US 
Test and Evaluation Program, or if you prefer, the agreement on 
cruise missile testing, is critically important. This kind of 
debate on the relevance of allowing new tests to take place over 
Canadian territory during the course of this year highlights in 
particular the role of a sovereign Quebec with respect to western 
agreements on military strategy.
<P>
	There are three distinct types of cruise missiles, namely the 
surface, sea and air varieties. The cruise missile tested in 
Canada falls into the third category of weapon. It is primarily 
the vehicle, or delivery system, which determines whether these 
weapons will or will not be subject to disarmament agreements 
or nuclear weapons verification control. The most stringent 
control measures of all have been adopted in the case of the air 
and sea version of these missiles.
<P>
	One of the means available for verifying nuclear arms during 
the cold war and for maintaining a certain balance between the 
superpowers was the National Technical Means, that is a 
verification technique based on information obtained by 
superpowers about the weapons of foreign countries.
<P>
	For instance, if a superpower formally announces that it is 
going to test a specific type of weapon and if the other 
superpower discovers, through its verification techniques, that 
the weapon in question is not consistent with the formal 
announcements made, then the whole balance of deterrence is 
called into question and the mutual trust of the two superpowers 
is shaken. And we know how importance trust is in such matters.
<P>
	Therefore, it is extremely important that Canada, as an ally of 
the United States, stand by its commitment and guarantee its 
co-operation in the area of strategic weapons testing so that it 
does not impede international disarmament procedures and in 
the process fuel the nuclear race.
<P>
	All of the verification, monitoring and voluntary 
disarmament techniques to which the superpowers agreed under 
the SALT I and SALT II treaties have since been superseded by 
new agreements such as the INF, which stands for Intermediate 
Nuclear Force, and START I and START II. Today these 
verification techniques still form the basis of arms control. 
Canada cannot disregard them. It must ensure compliance with 
these agreements to limit the nuclear threat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="446"> 446 </A></B>
<P>
	Cruise missiles launched from bomber aircraft are considered 
strategic if their range exceeds 600 kilometres. The missile 
tested in Canada has a range superior to 600 kilometres. 
Accordingly, the Canadian government cannot, under the terms 
of international arms control  and strategic weapons verification 
treaties, dissociate itself from the strategic nuclear mission of 
the air version of the cruise missile.
<P>
	The cruise missile satisfies different objectives in terms of 
U.S. strategy. The air and sea versions are at the very heart of the 
United States's strategy of deterrence based on the concept of 
the tripartite retaliatory force or triad.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	This offensive triad brings together land-, sea- and air-based 
strategic weapons. Canada's commitments to the strategic 
deterrent force are basically a part of co-operation between 
allies. To the extent that Canada bases its defence on agreement 
among allies, it must voluntarily co-operate in implementing 
this strategic deterrent force if required. This is part of the 
national defence policies of 1971 and 1987 and the defence 
policy statement of 1992.
<P>
	Like my colleagues and my leader, I recall that under this 
approach, Canada was asked in 1983 to accept air-launched 
cruise missile tests on its territory, although this nuclear 
deterrence strategy was not officially based on NATO's strategy.
<P>
	In its 1992 security policy statement, Canada revised its 
position on strategic issues, recognizing that the world was no 
longer bipolar. The new nuclear powers were considered 
inherently unstable and so it became difficult for Canada and its 
allies to get away from nuclear deterrence.
<P>
	Cruise missiles made a key contribution to the offensive 
against Iraq. The non-nuclear air-launched cruise missile was 
used, showing the need for this missile in local conflicts, 
although it is not always perfectly accurate in hitting the target. 
The advantage of using such a weapon is that massive bombing 
is made unnecessary, thus saving many civilian lives. Strategic 
flexibility and tactics make the cruise a weapon better suited to 
the present strategic environment. This flexibility is why the 
development programs for these new missiles need to be 
extended. Canada, like our party, must be aware of the different 
uses to which these weapons can be put.
<P>
	From what we know, the missile that the Americans want to 
test in 1994 would have new electro-optical guidance 
technologies.
<P>
	International relations are extremely complex and cannot be 
analyzed from just one point of view. The issue of national 
defence is revealing in this regard. In 1993, Canada extended a 
formal commitment with the United States to facilitate the 
testing of certain types of weapons. Remember that the 
agreement runs for ten years, so this commitment will end in 
2003. Canada would find itself in a sensitive position with its 
partners if it broke its commitments, whatever their nature. 
Canada must act as a responsible state which respects its 
international commitments. These values are particularly 
important for the sovereigntist members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It is essential to state clearly that the Bloc Quebecois, while 
not agreeing with the continuation of the arms race, cannot 
totally distance itself either from the unstable international 
environment which has existed since the former Soviet Union 
broke up and from the potential dangers which unfortunately 
threaten our world. The Bloc Quebecois's sovereigntist thrust 
must not mean a kind of isolationism, heedless of our 
responsibilities to our strategic allies. On this score, it is 
important to send a clear and unambiguous message to the rest 
of the world: Canada and Quebec must respect their 
international commitments, with the possibility of renegotiating 
them with their allies once these agreements expire, using the 
appropriate procedures when the time comes.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	Another argument for accepting cruise missile tests over 
Canadian territory is the devastating effect of massive 
bombardment on civilian populations. For example, in the gulf 
war, massive conventional bombing would have been extremely 
costly in civilian lives since most of the sites destroyed were 
located in inhabited Iraqi territory. Surgical strikes such as those 
carried out by cruise missiles have shown the effectiveness of 
such weapons, considerably limiting the loss of human life.
<P>
	The tests which the American government wants to conduct 
do not involve new nuclear technologies either. Thus they do not 
escalate strategic nuclear forces. Furthermore, a ceiling has 
already been set for the total number of missiles deployed under 
the START I and START II treaties. The cruise missile tests on 
Canadian soil are only to improve the guidance system. They 
cannot and must not be considered destabilizing under 
international arms control or disarmament agreements.
<P>
	Finally, one question arises: should cruise missile tests be 
related to the issue of converting military industry and to the 
lower military spending advocated by the Bloc Quebecois? I say 
no, they should not. First, very few military companies in 
Quebec and Canada are involved with this type of weapon. The 
economic, industrial and technological impact is minimal since 
a ceiling has been set for the number of units to be built. 
Therefore no increase in the budget of the Canadian Department 
of National Defence is involved.
<P>
	Thus, it would be wrong for the Liberal government to make a 
connection with the lower military spending advocated by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It is important for Canada and Quebec to strengthen these 
strategic commitments; therefore the Bloc Quebecois is in 
<P>

favour of military agreements with its allies to ensure the 
security of Canadian and Quebec territory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, a number 
of members have referred to the cruise and they picked on the 
war in Iraq as an example of how advanced technology in 
weapons of destruction can save lives. We  looked at the 
situation in the Middle East, we looked at star wars in Bagdhad. 
Those were weapons, granted not of the most sophisticated kind, 
supplied basically by the superpowers.
<P>
	How does producing more deadly weapons, with also the 
export that is involved in arms, help world peace? How does that 
make us as a nation more secure? We have to look at the weapons 
that were used in the Middle East. For the most part they were 
produced by advanced technologies, the United States, the 
Soviet Union, France. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	What invariably happens is that the military says we have to 
have more advanced weapons than other countries have to deal 
with our own security. I guess this is a never-ending race.
<P>
	When does the member see this vicious cycle stopping?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his question. First of all, I must remind the 
hon. member that what I suggested in my speech was to allow 
experiments relating to electro-optical guidance technology.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	I totally agree with the member on that. We are totally against 
any arms race or war. I did mention in my speech however that 
destabilisation is occurring in certain regions and, as we know, a 
country where democratic principles are completely 
disregarded is a country with a potential for and threat of 
aggression against which we must react. It is mainly in that 
perspective that we should look at the development of 
technological know-how.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to pose a specific question to the member in light of 
what is the immediate challenge before us. He alluded to the 
agreement that exists for a 10-year period and in this agreement 
is stated a provision that it may be terminated upon 12 months' 
notice in writing by either party.
<P>
	The question I would like to pose is this. Would the hon. 
member favour giving notice today, saying that yes, we will 
terminate it and in fact we would further request that any testing 
be held in abeyance until the Government of Canada has 
completed its full defence policy review by the end of this year. 
This is an approach that I favour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, I did say 
in my speech that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, are committed to 
fundamental values. Clearly, the agreements passed with our 
allies and friends must be abided by. These considerations 
having to do with the value and observance of agreements must 
be maintained. Of course, as far as we are concerned, what really 
matters is to get to consider in its entirety the national defence  
policy, which has not been tabled yet. I call upon the hon. 
member to urge his government to table as soon as possible their 
White Paper on Defence that we have heard so much about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, yesterday and today we have experienced a 
rather unique situation, a somewhat historic moment, as we had 
the opportunity to speak freely on two issues. Yesterday we 
talked of Canada's role as peacekeeper and today we are 
discussing cruise missile testing over Canadian territory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yesterday we talked of Canada's peace efforts abroad, our 
contributions to this particular process. Today we are discussing 
cruise missile testing. It seems to me that the two go hand in 
hand.
<P>
	When people talk to me about Canada's armed forces they 
always talk about our soldiers with a great deal of pride. They 
also ask, increasingly so, very tough questions such as: What is 
peacekeeping? What is peacemaking? Is there a difference 
between peacemaking and war? Do our soldiers have different 
terms of engagement under different circumstances? Are they 
secure? Are we doing everything we can to make sure that they 
can do the job they are being asked to do?
<P>
	As I understand the situation, what Canadians are telling me is 
that they want us to continue to make that contribution but they 
want us to continue to make the contribution within a different 
context. They want to make sure that our soldiers, our armed 
forces, are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve 
because they are putting their lives on the line to create a better 
society and very often it is in very troubled countries.
<P>
	When we talk about cruise missile testing it seems to me that 
we need to ask ourselves very fundamental insightful questions 
as well. I do not pretend that I know all of them but I am going to 
raise a few. What was the original rationale for this particular 
agreement and is it still valid? Some people will argue, and I can 
appreciate that.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="448"> 448 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must honour our commitments. I totally agree but, clearly, 
when the situation changes, it is important that we review our 
commitment.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All I ask is, is the original rationale still valid, or is it equally 
responsible to sit down and ask whether the reasons that 
motivated that particular agreement are such that they 
necessitate that kind of response?
<P>
	I want to ask another question. This is one that is troubling me 
as well. Can we ask other countries of the world to reduce 
armaments, perhaps not to manufacture certain kinds of 
armaments, and undertake such an initiative that is cruise 
missile testing? Is there not a  potential contradiction if we were 
to do that? People will ask.
<P>
	It is important as well before we reach a final decision to 
consider seriously not only what parliamentarians are saying in 
this House but what other elected people are saying to us, 
particularly those who are affected. I am talking about the 
provincial and territorial governments. I am talking about other 
governments where we have elected representatives. We need to 
consider very seriously what the people are saying, because this 
has an impact on them and we have a responsibility to at least 
listen to what they are saying.
<P>
	I appreciate so much that we were given the opportunity 
yesterday to talk about our contribution to peacekeeping and 
peacemaking and that we are talking today about cruise missile 
testing, components of our defence policy. We have been 
promised a thorough review of where we are at and where we 
might go. I see this as the beginning of that particular process.
<P>
	I am going to make one final comment because I know I have 
other colleagues who want to address this issue. We are being 
called upon to exercise leadership. Perhaps some people would 
characterize leadership as to lead, to build, perhaps to refine 
armaments-and I am not suggesting that there is not a role for 
that-but we need to consider it very seriously and with great 
sensitivity. We also need to lead to disarm, to promote peace. 
Clearly I prefer the latter.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it was very interesting listening to the debate today and 
I stand to participate. I would like to suggest that Canadians 
want peace and non-violence, as evidenced by the peacekeeping 
activities. We have some 4,700 Canadian men and women 
involved in peacekeeping. Should we not then encourage those 
values in our international affairs? Should we not encourage 
other countries to seek peaceful and non-violent solutions to 
problems?
<P>
	While this may sound idealistic, and I have heard that said 
earlier, it is up to us to set an example for the international 
community in which we belong. It is up to us to teach by doing. 
We cannot preach to other countries that they should not develop 
their nuclear arsenals while we allow cruise missile testing on 
our northern lands. We cannot preach to other countries that they 
should solve their problems by peaceful and non-violent means, 
when we in effect justify using weapons.
<P>
	To allow cruise missile testing is to say there is still a need for 
nuclear weapons and that North America has a nuclear ability to 
resolve any dispute.
<P>
	We should remember that by our actions not only do we set an 
example for the rest of the world, we set an example for our 
children.
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	Crime among Canadian youth is ever increasing. If we hope to 
change this reality, we must show that we are a society that 
values peaceful solutions. We must show our youth that violence 
is not the way to solve problems but that they should seek 
non-violent solutions. I do not believe we would be setting that 
example if we continue to allow cruise missile testing in 
Canada.
<P>
	Times change. Today our needs have changed. We heard 
earlier about the different uses for the cruise missile. However, I 
want to say to this House that the world around us has changed 
and it is time for us to recognize those changes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought that the period 
following the speech by the hon. member for St. Boniface was 
reserved for questions and comments. I think that the hon. 
member has joined the debate itself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I think the hon. member 
for Etobicoke-Lakeshore may have misunderstood after the 
debate from the hon. member for St. Boniface. The hon. member 
was actually to make comments and/or ask questions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall: </B>Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I 
understand that the debate, by agreement among the parties, is to 
end at ten o'clock. There are a number of us on this side of the 
House who are therefore not going to get the opportunity to 
speak on this most important issue.
<P>
	Given that only one woman from the government benches has 
spoken on this issue-the three remaining speakers who will not 
get an opportunity are also women-I wonder if all members in 
the House might agree to allow the member to continue her 
remarks and to use the remaining five minutes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="449"> 449 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Do we have agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the generosity 
of the members across the way.
<P>
	I am sure that the people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore are 
presently following this because I have had faxes and notations 
from individuals who have been watching this debate all 
afternoon and all evening.
<P>
	I appreciate the few minutes left to me to express what we 
heard from the member from the Northwest Territories about the 
wildlife situation and the environment, keeping the territories 
safe for the individuals who are presently there, for ourselves 
and for our children.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the important point is the example that we as 
Canadians give to the rest of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, may I direct my question to 
the hon. member for St. Boniface as I refrained from making 
more interventions in order not to disrupt the hon. member's 
speech?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> In his speech, the hon. 
member for St. Boniface asked questions and suggested 
alternatives. Was it to give a different spin to his presentation in 
this House? Did he say that his answer to the question the 
government is asking us would be no and that he is not 
favourable to continued cruise missile testing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question. Yes, I asked a number of questions. I 
think that they are important questions that should be discussed 
here in the House of Commons and elsewhere. I would like to 
see such discussions held across Canada as part of the defence 
policy review.
<P>
	I think I closed my speech by saying: We can exercise 
leadership by promoting, building, refining armaments and so 
on. That is an avenue that is open to us. It may be something to 
consider but I am saying that there is an alternative: to promote 
peace and exercise leadership in this area. I thought I had made 
clear that I preferred the latter option but I thank the hon. 
member for having asked me that question. It is very nice of 
him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being ten o'clock, 
pursuant to the order made Tuesday, January 25, 1994, the 
House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 10 p.m.)
