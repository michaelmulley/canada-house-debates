    </p><a name="Para826435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular bill before us has to do with trying to amend the laws of Canada to provide an opportunity for those who are incarcerated but can use help to deal with their addiction and their problem with alcohol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the bill 100% because when we have a social problem, education is always part of the solution. It is part of the prevent model. When we already have the problem, the other part of it is remediation. Sometimes people make mistakes in their lives and it is extremely important that people understand what problems they have, that denial has to be dealt with, and a person needs that opportunity and that support. What we do not want to have is recidivism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People eventually get out of jail and we have a justice system which includes, as part of its operations, the rehabilitation of people. With regard to most people rehabilitation may be appropriate. I say may be appropriate because I know that there are circumstances under which rehabilitation is not applicable and not appropriate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in regard to the member's bill, we are talking about those cases in which there is an incident in which individuals who are incarcerated will have the opportunity to be available, so that they can have the benefit of the kind of assistance that they may need to ensure that they understand what their problem is, why it happened, and how to cope and deal with it in the future. I support the bill 100%.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to comment on those possibilities where rehabilitation is not applicable and not appropriate. That has to do with people who suffer from some sort of mental disability. More specifically, I gave a speech in the House last Friday on this, on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3072973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3072973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-251</A>. It is related to warning labels on alcoholic beverages to caution those who see the label about impending danger. It is a consumer lighthouse just sending out a “be careful message”. That is all the bill is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It relates also to the messaging dealing with things like how alcohol can impair one's ability to operate machinery or equipment, or to drive a motor vehicle. It is extremely important that we talk about the problem when there is consumption of alcohol during pregnancy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been some judicial statements with regard to the problems coming before the courts. The latest I heard, and I included it in my speech, was that almost half of the people who appear before the courts of Canada suffer from some sort of alcohol problem or alcohol related birth defect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is enormous when we think of the cost to the courts, the cost to the system to deal with this. This is a social problem which requires a comprehensive solution. It is not going to be good enough to lecture people about them doing something bad and that they will serve their time, the key will be thrown away and they will be there until the very end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people come out, they have to understand what the problem is, but rehabilitation in our system is not applicable to persons who for instance suffer from alcohol related birth defects.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence, questions also have to be asked, in addition to the issue that the member raises, about giving the kind of support to people who are in jail who understand what they did, so that they can get treatment for their addictions and problems. However, what happens to all the people who are in the same jails that are set up for rehabilitation who have a mental disability such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder? For them, rehabilitation is not applicable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with our system? It needs to go further and perhaps the member has an opportunity for another private member's bill he would like to champion. Our system should not assume that everyone who is incarcerated, because of alcohol misuse or abuse, is in a situation where rehabilitation is applicable. Maybe we have to start talking about the equality of our criminal justice system in terms of addressing what happens after we have the problem and whether or not the jails generically are applicable to all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there should be special institutions where people get an opportunity to be able to cope with a permanent disability. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 100% preventable, but it is not curable. In that regard, we are talking about prevention as well as some sort of remediation, only to the extent that one would have the kind of assistance that the person may need to cope, as well as the kind of assistance that the families need to cope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who know anything about fetal alcohol spectrum disorder will know that the parents have a lifetime responsibility of caring for their children. Most of them never make it through school. Most of them are going to have problems in the labour force. Most of them are going to run afoul of the law, not because they did something wrong but because they did not know it was wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be told 100 times not to do something because it is wrong and they will still do it, but it is not because they understand and just want to react and rebel. In those cases, people who have FASD do not know the difference between right and wrong, and there are many cases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to raise that perspective here because the bill tends to address all those who are incarcerated from the standpoint that they are all the same, they are all subject to the same kinds of rehabilitation possibilities, and that we should have that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes we should, for those who can be rehabilitated, but what happens to those who have no possibility of rehabilitation, those with permanent brain damage and permanent disabilities? They are likely to reoffend, not because they are bad people but because they have a mental disability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this whole question of addressing addictions in our society, whether it be alcohol, drugs or anything else that can be harmful if misused, we need to ensure that we understand what happened, why it happened, how to prevent it, and how to remediate it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many elements to it. This bill deals in part with part of the equation, but our criminal justice system has a very narrow focus. It says that if people do something wrong, they are going to jail. They will stay there, do their time and they will be subject to rehabilitation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is missing a significant component. Let me repeat. If the judges are telling Canadians and they are telling parliamentarians that 50% of the people who appear before the courts of Canada suffer from alcohol related birth defects or addictions to alcohol, now is the time for Parliament to act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I encourage all hon. members to take whatever steps necessary to explore the situation, to examine what is happening in other countries around the world such as France, South Africa, the U.K., Ireland, and 20 other countries that I mentioned in my speech last Friday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the kinds of things that we have to learn. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. The evidence is there. Parliament should have a look at that evidence and Parliament should act.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> adds two new provisions to this act to flesh it out more with respect to young addicts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the bill introduced by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78415,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78415&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</A> provides that a police officer must, before starting judicial proceedings or taking any other measures under this act against a young person alleged to have committed an offence, consider whether it would be sufficient to refer the young person to an addiction specialist for assessment and, if warranted, treatment recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> would also add a clause at the end of section 6 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act stipulating that if the young person enters into a treatment program as a result of such a referral and fails to complete the program, the outcome may be the start of judicial proceedings against that young person.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> is a welcome change from the justice bills introduced by this government since it came to power. Instead of the usual Conservative “law and order” ideology that, under the pretext of protecting public safety, would send more people to prison without reducing the root causes of crime, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> offers valid alternatives to incarcerating minors, which is more important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all those who are watching us, I want to say that a strictly punishment-oriented public safety strategy will never make our societies more vibrant or our prisons less overpopulated. In my opinion, when young people become involved in the criminal justice system, it can exacerbate the problem and be very costly. These are negative results that have an impact not only on the individual involved, but on society as a whole. This situation must therefore be avoided whenever possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the approach taken by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> is commendable: the bill presupposes that prosecution is the final step in the fight against crime and is warranted only if all other valid options have been tried. This bill could reduce the number of young people in court and consequently the number of youth in our penitentiaries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind all of my distinguished colleagues here in this House that prison will always be a crime school, a place where individuals harbour lingering, disgruntled resentment toward society. The decision to incarcerate an individual should be based on the seriousness of the crime committed and on how dangerous the criminal is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have always promoted “restorative justice”, an idea supported by the Bloc Québécois that seeks to rehabilitate the offender by creating awareness of the seriousness of the crime and by repairing the damage done to the community or the people affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> attempt to keep young addicts from appearing before a court, it calls on the law enforcement community to use good judgment in order to give an offender a second chance. In a way, it emphasizes the confidence that we have in police officers and their duty to ensure a safer society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting element that would reinforce a positive image of police forces in public opinion. It is also in line with section 6 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which gives police officers the option to keep young offenders out of court by making it possible to choose another remedy, such as a drug treatment program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do have some concerns about this bill. With respect to the provisions in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A>, we must ensure that the provinces are responsible for providing these drug treatment programs. For example, in Quebec, these programs are administered through health and social services agencies. Sufficient resources must be made available to offer the treatments called for in this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a little confused about how effective this bill can be within the framework of the minority government's vision for justice. I think that the intent behind Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> would be directly or indirectly affected by the new anti-drug strategy announced on October 4. I think that this approach, which is a repressive one, as usual, does not acknowledge the importance of prevention in the war on drugs.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it is unfortunate that so little money, only approximately $10 million, is being allocated to measures to ensure the rehabilitation of our young people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, it would be nice to see this government take greater inspiration from the ideas proposed by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78415,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78415&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</A> in the context of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A>. His proposals should resonate even more within his caucus, which focuses too much on a repressive ideology centred on an illusion of safety that, unfortunately, did not produce the desired results for our neighbours to the south in terms of effectively reducing crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, as I was saying earlier and as I have said during several debates on previous bills, specific realities are breeding grounds of crime and drug use. One such reality is poverty, which appears even more obvious to us now, with the holiday season just around the corner. Like my colleagues, I firmly believe that a greater sharing of riches, working toward better social integration and emphasizing rehabilitation represent essential solutions for the prevention of crime and substance abuse. Unfortunately, this government always has that unproductive tendency to ignore those approaches. It thinks it can achieve security by filling the penitentiaries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I would like to conclude by emphasizing the noble intention of the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78415,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78415&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</A>. In my opinion, this bill offers an important balance between rehabilitation and the vigilance needed when people refuse to take advantage of opportunities presented to them. It also respects the tenets I listed earlier regarding ways to reduce crime, giving young substance abusers a second chance by taking part in a detox program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of initiatives that propose serious alternatives to incarceration, especially when it comes to minors. This is why we will support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A>, so it may be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for further study.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely gratified to have heard the debate on this excellent bill thus far and am encouraged by the positive reception it has received on both sides of the House. This important piece of legislation has the potential to change the lives of thousands of Canadian youth. Each one of those young people represents a family, friends and a community. Early intervention may save those youth, families and communities from the heartache, pain and devastation caused by a life lost to drugs and criminal behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech given earlier during debate on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3108099,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3108099&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25</A>, I spoke of the many young Canadians I have had the privilege of meeting and speaking to in my time representing the constituents of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78371,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78371&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kitchener—Conestoga</A>, young people full of promise with bright futures ahead of them. These youth represent the overwhelming majority of young people in Canada today. I have also had the occasion to meet with families of youth caught in a web of violence and crime and with the young people themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the determinations that would cause a young person to choose one path over another? While undoubtedly there are many factors high on the list of causes, we would find drug use to be one of the chief contributing factors to subsequent violent criminal behaviour. Canada faces some serious drug problems, not the least of which is the growing number of our youth becoming involved with drugs at younger and younger ages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the Waterloo—Wellington region, according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health 2007 Ontario student drug use and health survey, 24.5% of students surveyed from grades 9 to 12 reported a drug use problem. All too often, one bad decision can lead a young person into a life of destructive behaviour. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics on a drug such as crystal meth paint a chilling picture of a near instant addiction, with its subsequent devastation. I am quite certain that many of the young people who have ended up in this spiral of devastation had no idea of the future that awaited them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, I hosted a forum on youth crime, which was attended by our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A>, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78585,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78585&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa West—Nepean</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues are clear. More needs to be done to combat drugs and their devastating effects on Canadian society. This government has listened to Canadians and we are working actively with them to respond to that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government believes that the most effective way to deal with complex issues is to first identify the most important priorities and then act decisively on them in order to achieve results. Our drug strategy establishes goals and priorities that are both clear and measurable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 signalled that the government would be investing in a national anti-drug strategy. The strategy was formally announced on October 4 and provides new funding of $64 million over two years. It establishes a focused approach to address issues of illicit drugs and is based on three concrete action plans: $10 million toward preventing illicit drug use; $32 million to treat illicit drug dependency; and $22 million to combat illicit drug production and distribution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This funding builds on existing programs and initiatives that are focused to meet the government's priorities. Let me summarize the three parts of our anti-drug strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number one is prevention. Our efforts in the area of prevention focus on youth and include community based drug use prevention programs and crime prevention initiatives as well as a public awareness campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two is enforcement. The national anti-drug strategy will also target the production of drugs in Canada, including marijuana grow ops and clandestine labs. It will target those organized criminals who exploit our youth for profit and also exploit other vulnerable citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number three is treatment. The national anti-drug strategy places significant importance on developing new treatment options and improving the availability and effectiveness of treatment programs.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of the funds under the strategy are earmarked for treatment so that we can offer to those who have become addicted to drugs the help they need to get their lives back on track. It is under this priority that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> falls. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated, this amendment will require that a police officer, before starting judicial proceedings or taking any other measures under the act against the young person alleged to have committed an offence, must consider whether it would be sufficient to refer the young person to an addiction specialist for assessment and, if warranted, treatment recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public often views the police role only as one of enforcement. This government recognizes the excellent work that police do in the area of drug prevention and their broader contribution to dealing with community programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A>, police will also be encouraged to assist youth in conflict by referring those with drug problems to assessment for treatment programming.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I remind the members of the House about a conversation I had with a constituent, to which I referred in an earlier speech. She was a mother who wanted her son to go to jail for a series of incidents, including a theft charge, so he could receive treatment for his drug addictions and be saved from a life of more serious crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Youth Criminal Justice Act makes no provision for someone in her son's predicament. She was told by the judge that his criminal record was not long enough for jail, so nothing was done. Several months later he found himself again before a judge, restrained in a straitjacket due to a drug-induced psychosis. At that point, finally, his record was long enough to merit addiction treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unacceptable. Action is needed now. We have ignored these situations for far too long. Had Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> been law at that time, police would have had the ability to recommend drug treatment instead of judicial proceedings. He would have received the help he needed. This law will save lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill complements the national anti-drug strategy, which provides funding to the Department of Justice to support extrajudicial measures and treatment programs for youth in conflict with the law who have drug-related problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding is also directed to the RCMP to implement new tools to refer youth at risk to treatment programming and also to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to develop new treatment models for crystal meth use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes that the combined efforts of many will bring success in addressing our drug priorities. We are working with all those who are concerned about Canada's youth, both from the private and the public sectors and across different disciplines such as health, education and the justice system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a local perspective, in Waterloo region in my riding, organizations such as Ray of Hope, which runs youth treatment programs for youth aged 13 to 17 who are involved in addiction, are working to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable young people. Supporting Ray of Hope is a group of generous people, led by Steve Scherer of Kitchener, who have donated or pledged close to $6 million to build the Ray of Hope Youth Addiction Treatment Centre.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have long been a key resource in dealing with the drug problems facing our communities. We will continue to rely upon their key contribution under the national anti-drug strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> recognizes the role that police can play in linking youth with drug and addiction problems to those who can help on the treatment front. It provides a valuable and additional tool to help youth overcome their problems and make our communities safer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be part of a government taking such active, real steps toward effecting positive change in the area of early intervention for youth at risk. I am proud to represent a riding where people are not only asking what can be done but are committed to making sure it gets done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By working together, we can spare many young people and their families needless pain and trauma. By working together, we can save the lives of young Canadians.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Cape Breton—Canso, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to engage in the debate today on this important topic. When the topic of youth criminal justice comes before the House, I try, as best I can, to speak to it. I will attempt to address some of the concerns around the act and some things that I believe we as legislators can do to improve the act and, in turn, better serve the people we represent and contribute to the youth of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to know that when it comes to justice issues and the bills that have been brought before this House in recent weeks and months, of the 13 pieces of legislation that have come forward, we supported 10 of those pieces of legislation. We even offered to fast-track eight of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular legislation is a private member's bill that has been put forward by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78415,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78415&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</A>, a colleague on the HRDC committee. In discussions with people within our caucus, we certainly believe that, although the provisions may be in the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the bill underlines the importance and the responsibilities of police officers and enforcement officers to look at extrajudicial opportunities when they are dealing with young offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to point out that every community has its own reality when it comes to treatment for substance abuse. We all look in our own backyards. I know in my backyard in Glace Bay, the place where I grew up and continue to work, to live and to raise my kids, there is a problem with substance abuse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people in the House may have seen the movie <i>Cottonland</i>. It addresses the terrible problem that some people in my community are facing in their battle with prescription drugs, such as OxyContin. <i>Cottonland</i> is a very powerful film. It notes how many good, productive, normal young people make some bad decisions at a certain point in their life and those bad decisions have grave consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragic devastation was reaped on one particular life in the film. A young athlete, who suffered an athletic injury, went to his doctor to seek relief from the pain in his shoulder. The doctor prescribed OxyContin and told the patient to take the medication once every two days. However, as the pain continued it was once a day and soon it became twice a day. As it evolved, the OxyContin took over the young man's life and he became addicted. His entire life revolved around how he would get his next fix and how he would get the money to buy the drugs. Prior to being prescribed this drug and developing this addiction, the young man was a productive person in his community. He was very caring and giving to others and involved in life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those tragedies are out there. I think what the member is trying to do with this legislation is to ensure that those people who find themselves in those situations where they enter into an illegal activity or take part in a crime because of drugs, that it is considered prior to any action being taken by the police.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the act stands now, the police are required to consider referring a youth to an addiction specialist for assessment and potential treatment recommendations before commencement of judicial proceedings. The bill further states that a youth's failure to complete this program should be taken into consideration by that officer, which would allow him or her to decide whether to start judicial proceedings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, even under the current act, extrajudicial measures are an option for an enforcement officer. This might involve any spectrum of things, from taking no action at all to issuing the youth a warning, administering a caution or referring the youth to a program or agency within the community. We are fortunate that most communities in Canada have groups and organizations that focus on dealing with troubled young people with addictions. The goal is to provide the youth with some options in order to promote an effective and speedy response to crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of those components are already in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. I see this legislation as making it mandatory for police officers to consider such measures when dealing with a youth involved in crime. I hope my colleague addresses that in his wrap up comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of us bring our own experiences to the House. Having had the opportunity in my past life to work with young people through recreation and through sports, I know that many young people find themselves in the midst of different situations. A group of them might go out one night for a few beers and collectively make an unwise decision. Canadians do not believe that these youth, by making that unwise decision, should pay an extreme price for an extended period of time. Currently within the Youth Criminal Justice Act there is flexibility. It allows law enforcement officers and the judiciary to prescribe rehabilitative action so that youth can go on to lead productive lives. Hopefully we, as Canadians, believe in our youth and try to offer them those opportunities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to see this bill go to committee where witnesses can be heard and where it can be hashed out to see whether or not it would result in what is intended. I certainly support this going to committee, as do, I think, the vast majority of members on this side of the House. </div>

I think he has run across them on either a hockey rink or a baseball field. The Glace Bay Colonels are some of the best little players on the entire North American continent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage we have as grown-ups is being able to work with kids and being able to share our experiences with them in order to guide them on the right path.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague from Hamilton, who was from the great province of New Brunswick originally, tells some wonderful stories about growing up. It would have been very easy in those days to make a wrong turn.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many kids in the country grow up impoverished; have various disabilities, either mental or physical; or come from a broken home. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. It is very easy as a youth, either as an individual or collectively, as my hon. colleague said, to make the wrong choice at a particular time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we then do with them? The initial outrage would be to hang them from the highest tree and make sure they pay for their mistakes. However, there also is a compassionate side to it. Forgiveness in the Bible means that one turns the other cheek. When we look at the child we see a human being and we must try to make a productive person out of the individual. I believe that is how justice must work. However, there is no question that a deterrent is needed. People need to know that if they do something wrong there is a price to pay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the people who do those wrongs or injustices simply may not know what they are doing or they are in a collective group with a lot of peer pressure. However, after sober second thought, in a day or two they realize they should never have done that. It does not necessarily mean that we should throw the baby out with bathwater.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in Richmond, B.C. My parents ran a group home for well over 23 years. We had over 400 kids come through our doors, sometimes for a couple of hours, sometimes for a weekend and sometimes they stayed with us for several months. The one common theme between each kid was that they all lacked love. Either their parents did not love them or society rejected them and, for whatever reason, they did not feel that they fit into the normal structure of our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest problems I felt growing up surrounded by that was the lack of attention and the lack of resources paid by governments to assist these children. It was almost like a babysitting mentality. If they were off the streets and within four walls that was good enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many social workers back in those days tried to do the very best they could. I remember quite clearly that my parents would be with a child 24-7, day in day out. A social worker would come in once a month, do a half hour analysis on the kid and write a report. The social workers would not spend much time with my parents because they were too rushed. They often had to go to another home to talk to another kid. There certainly were not enough of them around, even back then, 40 years ago, to actually ascertain what the kid was thinking, what the environment was and all kinds of other parameters in their lifestyle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just simply shuffled kids off as numbers. We have heard story after story throughout the years about the challenges and difficulties people have had with the Children's Aid Societies in Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes and in the west.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My youngest sister right now looks after three first nations babies. Two of them have fetal alcohol syndrome, which goes back to the bill on labelling of alcohol bottles for fetal alcohol syndrome. My sister loves those kids as if they were her own. She has only cared for them for a few weeks and one she has had for a few months but she knows eventually she must give them up. All she is asking for is that when those children are returned to their families who wish to have them, she wants to ensure the families have the opportunity and the resources to care for these children like their very own.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government introduces legislation to toughen up the laws and increase the penalties or jail sentences for various crimes, one of the questions I keep asking, and to which I have not received an answer yet is whether the government will transfer the needed resources to the provinces. It is the provinces that end up picking up the slack on this one. It is easy to say we are going to extend a sentence for another five years, but that costs money and who pays for it? In many cases when it comes to incarceration, policing services and social services, it falls upon the provinces or territories to pick up that slack. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as we support this legislation and the previous bills that have come forward and the many more that may come down the pike in the years to come, I would encourage the Conservatives to ensure that for every new piece of legislation that comes forward in terms of criminal justice, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, whatever it is, that they incorporate with those increased sentences or deterrents the fiscal capacity for the provinces and municipalities to do their jobs effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good just to download that responsibility. Civic authorities throughout the country are scrambling for police officers. Provinces are scrambling for child care workers, hospital workers, teachers' aides. All of that falls on the backs of the provinces and municipalities. If the federal government wants to show leadership by introducing legislation of this kind, it is incumbent upon the government to back it up with the dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hoping when the bill gets to committee there can be a financial analysis of the bill to determine exactly how much would be required to assist the provinces and territories in moving these issues forward. Then and only then will there be true results. It is one thing to say we passed a bill in the House of Commons and the Senate, but then comes the follow-up. Where is the follow-up three, four, five years down the road? What advantages has it had? What deterrent effect has it had? What benefits has it had? Without a careful analysis of that legislation down the road, we simply would not know. The person who sponsors the bill can say, “Look what I have done”, but the reality is someone down the road will have to pick that up. We would encourage better cooperation between the federal government and the provinces and territories.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to live in Yukon Territory. First nations children are some of the greatest kids we could ever meet, but an awful lot of them were behind the eight ball right from conception onward. They did not have proper housing. They did not have proper education. Their parents may have suffered the abuse at residential schools and all of those things. That kind of trauma goes from generation to generation. All we do is attempt to put a band-aid on these problems. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are first nations people from northern Quebec who were sent to Resolute Bay, Arctic Bay and Grise Fiord, so-called settlement communities in 1953 and 1955. A whole bunch of families were moved up into the bitter cold of the high Arctic. They were given a few supplies and told to have fun. They were uprooted from their communities and off they went, in order to improve our Arctic sovereignty at the time. In the mid-1990s a cash settlement was made for compensation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a recent trip there. They have not yet received an apology from any government. The government has not said to the last surviving people there that the government is sorry for what was done. All they are asking for is an apology. Many first nations groups are asking for an apology for what happened before and when that happens, the healing can start. Once the healing starts, the children of the people who were affected by those traumatic events will be able to move on. If not, we will have these same concerns over and over again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our generation, this Parliament, that should start the healing process. My hon. colleague who spoke earlier is a very serious Christian fellow. I went on a trip with him to Israel recently and we learned a lot. He would know that in the book of Revelation there is a passage about the healing leaves. An Inuit refugee who had been sent up there from northern Quebec said a Catholic priest once read to him the passage about the healing leaves from the book of Revelation. He looked at the Canadian flag and saw the leaf on the Canadian flag. He told me that is what Canada should be, a healing nation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members hear in their ridings over and over again the increased concern about young people who get involved with drugs. The government is so concerned about this that it has committed to respond to these concerns with a national anti-drug strategy and a reassessment of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private member's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> now before the House is a constructive and timely response to the problem of drug use among Canadian youth. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> will support this effort to address the problem of substance abuse by youth through its proposal to amend the Youth Criminal Justice Act to allow police to refer youth charged with less serious offences to addiction specialists to determine if treatment is needed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure will respond to concerns about youth who are tempted to use drugs, develop addiction problems and then engage in minor offences to pay for the drugs. How many of us in our ridings get calls from people who have been victims of young offenders who cause damage, steal, commit break and enter offences simply to get money to buy the drugs they have become addicted to? This is a common problem and one which all of us face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police, through section 6, have the authority to send youth, with their consent, to a program to reduce the chances of their repeating. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> seeks to broaden this measure by giving police the power to send youth, with their consent, to a drug specialist who will recommend the necessary treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth justice system has long had to deal with the challenge presented by troubled youth. Often young people charged with criminal offences face significant problems and find themselves marginalized in society. Their special needs do not absolve them from responsibility for criminal conduct, but it is important to ensure those needs, however severe or pressing, should not result in a greater sentence or criminal sanction than is justified by the offence committed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard from other speakers on this bill, the whole issue of treatment is the emphasis. So often we do not emphasize it and instead talk about the penalties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the youth justice system itself is to address the needs through rehabilitative measures within the sentences and interventions that are proportional to the seriousness of the crime. Safeguards are in place to ensure the penalties imposed on a young offender do not result in a greater penalty because he or she has needs. It is therefore important to examine the measures set out in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is a requirement in this bill that police take into account whether the youth has complied with the treatment program when considering whether to charge the youth for the original offence, to ensure they are fully consistent with the purpose and principles governing the use by police of the extrajudicial measures set out in the Young Criminal Justice Act. We need to ensure that this useful tool for police, which is aimed at helping youth who have substance abuse needs, is not subsequently subject to challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police will tell us how difficult it is for them to make arrests and take the offenders to court. They discover the court system is not able to deal with the offenders and the offenders are back out on the street the next day. We support providing police with the option of referring youth for help with the substance abuse services. This offers a more effective and meaningful response for youth with addictions and drug problems than facing criminal charges for petty crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government takes the concerns of Canadians about youth crime very seriously and is committed to strengthening the Young Offenders Act to ensure that our youth justice system is fair and effective in addressing the problems associated with youth offending. This government welcomes the efforts of the hon. member in tabling private member's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073361,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073361&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-423</A> as one step toward strengthening the whole process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as the House knows, the federal <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> recently tabled Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3108099,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3108099&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25</A>, which will strengthen sentencing and pretrial detention provisions under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. This government believes that solutions to the problems of youth crime will come through comprehensive approaches to the issue. All we have to do is attend some of the trials for young offenders to see that this whole review is so necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a sound legislative base for our youth justice system. We will continue to work collaboratively with all of our partners to address the conditions that underlie youth offending. It is important to encourage equal standards among families, parents and those who are involved in the development of our youth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this government will be launching a comprehensive review of the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the youth justice system in 2008 to ensure that our youth justice system fairly and effectively holds young offenders accountable for criminal conduct.</div>

It also demonstrates the position of the Conservative Party, that we believe it is important to help our young people rather than just throw the book at them any time they commit a crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill deals with the fact that when a young offender is apprehended because it is alleged that he may have committed some crime, the first thing the officer has to do is determine the mental state and attitude of the person. On that basis the officer makes a decision whether or not to start the full process of court proceedings, or whether the drug treatment programs that are currently offered would be much better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great recommendation by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78415,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78415&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</A>. We have had some high profile cases in the past. I think we all remember Davis Inlet on the north shore of Labrador where young kids were into gas sniffing, glue sniffing, and everything else. They ended up at Poundmaker's Lodge in St. Albert, my constituency, for treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of illegal things were going on in Davis Inlet at that time, but the country's compassion was to help the young people. They were taken to Poundmaker's Lodge and we did everything we could to try to rehabilitate them rather than throw them into criminal proceedings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That concept is replicated many times in this country, although it may not get national headlines. A young person is arrested for having fallen into criminal behaviour because of his participation in drugs. If that young person says that he would like to start treatment and demonstrates that he is willing to follow through on the treatment and completes the recommended course by the professionals and experts and he cleans himself up, why would we want to give him a criminal record that would dog him for years and years?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people are a great asset. Some of them fall by the wayside and some of them can pick themselves up and get back on track. We should not be throwing the book at them. We should be helping them because our justice system is all about rehabilitation and protection of society. If we can rehabilitate that person and make him a contributing member of society rather than a criminal for the rest of his life, surely that is one of the greatest investments we can make.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to spend my short amount of time thanking some people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to thank my colleagues from all parties. Members from all parties, despite the fact they had political things to get off their chests when they spoke, articulated their parties support for the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank the House of Commons legal department and the Library of Parliament. They helped me with the drafting of the bill. When we discuss this kind of thing, it is important to ensure we get it right the first time. I thank the people who worked hard to do that and who went back and forth with me as we worked through what we were trying to accomplish here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank ordinary Canadians who dedicate their lives every day to helping kids and adults with addictions issues. It is a very significant issue in our country. I thanked some of them when I first had a chance to speak to the bill, such as Maralyn Benay from Parents Empowering Parents, Patricia Bencz from the Our House addictions treatment centre and folks who spent a lot of time to help people with addictions issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to take a moment to thank the RCMP and other police forces. The Edmonton city police deal with this issue and the results and consequences of addictions issues every day. I have done a couple of ride-alongs with Edmonton city police officers and they have been incredibly helpful in helping me understand the cycle of addictions and crime and how much of their work centres around dealing with the consequences of addictions issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to take a moment to express my appreciation to my nine foster brothers and foster sister. I do not say it nearly enough, but they provide me with a lot of inspiration for a lot of what I do here in the House, and I will name them: Andrew, Randy, Kelly, Jeff, Matt, Jonathan, Howie, Danny, Jeremy and Amanda. They are very important people in my life. They came from some very tough circumstances into my parent's house, when they were early teens for the most part. They are an amazing inspiration. I did not realize how important they were in my life until I grew older and dealt with some of the things we dealt with here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly want to thank my parents, Mark and Bonnie, and my brother Dan. In 1986 I was 16 years old and my parents made the decision to reach out to some kids who had come from some of the toughest circumstances one could imagine. As a 16 year old, that was a pretty life-changing event, bringing people into our house, growing our family of four into five, six, seven, eight, nine and eventually fourteen people. It made for some pretty fun Christmases and some pretty good ball hockey games in the street. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my parents had a heart for kids at risk and kids coming from those circumstances, they decided to do something significant to try to address it and to try to help these kids out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my father passed away in 2003, it really hit home for me how important it was to these kids. Some of the kids are in their young twenties, or even like us, and may not have been around for a little while. They had gone off to do their own thing. However, when he passed away, all of a sudden these kids came back for the funeral. We had a chance to catch up, to talk and to see where they were at. I think it was then when I started to really realize the impact my parents' decision had on the lives of these kids. I definitely want to thank my parents and my brother for the decisions they made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reiterate that the purpose of the bill is to get help for kids at a time when they might not realize they need the help. That is the crux of the bill, to reach out to these kids. I look forward to having the opportunity to work with the members of the justice committee as we try to move forward and make the bill come into law.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take us back to November 2005, when a $1.5 billion forest industry competitive plan was announced by the minister of industry at that time. That plan included funding support for what we would call transformative technologies, incentives for bioenergy expansion, assistance to respond to innovative opportunities, support for market expansion and a national forest community adjustment fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I continue on through my speech, let us understand that the forest industry in Canada, the capacity for us to sell to the rest of the world, remains as vibrant as it ever was. We know our fibre is the best in the world. The product we have to sell and the pent-up demand that continues is something that should afford us tremendous opportunities. Let us keep this market expansion in mind as we discuss all other aspects that affect the industry and its dramatic downturn that we face right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These supports were developed in collaboration with forest industry leaders, union, labour and management, suppliers, to help slow the loss of jobs in forest companies across the country. Therefore, there had been a great deal of concentration and input. Indeed, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78989,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78989&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kenora</A>, who established a forestry caucus, and caucuses are voluntary organizations, took great pains to ensure that representation from coast to coast to coast, covering most provinces and territories, was involved in the drafting of this and the pushing of it, not only through the Liberal caucus but through the cabinet itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what happened in January 2006. After that, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> decided to cancel this plan, in the 2006 budget. From that date to the present, we have yet to see any tangible assistance to replace the supports that were put in place in November 2005, over two years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As news happens daily in the forest industry, very rarely does it offer much good news. On November 16, 800 more jobs were lost in northwestern Ontario. On November 20, the announcement of a permanent closure of AbitibiBowater Fort William mill meant the loss of another 300 people, this time, with a full closure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about a budget being designed to help the country give a leg up to industries that at various times could use the help, it is very clear the budget does nothing to help the forest sector through its own period of restructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us be certain we understand that. We know there will be some casualties. Anything else is a dramatic lack of awareness of what is happening in the industry. However, my contention is that thousands of jobs would have been saved by continuing to keep the forest competitiveness plan in operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of response or the inaction by the government has not been due to a lack of effort by, again, labour or industry. Almost a year ago, on January 22, the CEP Union asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to call a national summit on the future of the forest industry and to do that as soon as possible. It has repeatedly expressed its concern over the past 11 months.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205">(1205)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April of this year the opposition leader pledged, in response directly to the CEP, to hold that national summit on the future of the forest industry upon taking office as prime minister. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days ago, on November 30, the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union again announced that it would do its best to organize a national summit on its own, since the government would not do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 5, the Forest Products Association of Canada called for Parliament to study the forestry challenges and develop a market based action plan that would set the groundwork for a vibrant forest industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I became the critic for FedNor, I was the associate critic for Natural Resources. The departmental briefing made it very clear that the demand for Canadian forest products, whether it be wood, pulp or paper, compared to the rest of the world meant that with some adjustments we could provide market share and grow our market share in many of those components. Whether it is higher end, higher quality product, we know we can find our niches.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all is said and done, Canadian fibre is the best fibre in the world. The way we process it in terms of our environmental standards, the way we harvest it, meeting exceptional environmental safeguards, the way we produce it, by cleaning the plant operations, means that on all those fronts the industry has shown a dramatic interest from the time I was a young boy, when I saw mercury pollution and smokestacks emitting all kinds of pollutants into the air. The Canadian forest industry can stand head and shoulders in the world with the effort it has made in terms of capitalizing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just recently in Thunder Bay, Bowater, before it became AbitibiBowater, put $180 million of environmental improvements into its operation. In these days, in a very competitive environment, it is something that should be applauded and recognized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget of last February was a capital cost allowance. As I read the budget, this is the only assistance that has been offered. While the measure is a small step forward, it is far less than what is needed. The best way to describe it is this way. A company has to have money and it has to make money in order to invest in new equipment, which is logical. It also needs to show a profit to benefit from the measure. Therefore, on two counts, while laudable as a concept, the reality of what the industry faces right now makes it very difficult for a company to take advantage of this. Indeed, to take advantage of something, it is a two year window. I am offering right now my advice that it be improved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In question period last week I asked the government what it was doing to help. It said that it was getting it done. However, for the workers, the families and suppliers, there has been marginal assistance. I insist once more, let the budget include measures to help the forest industry, the workers, the communities and, directly, the suppliers. It is not just northwestern Ontario, it is the entire province of Ontario and, indeed, the whole country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in that light that I would like to ask the member a question related to the budget. Does he fully support reinstating the exhibition transportation service?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had numerous calls from desperate people who have heard that this program is going to be cancelled on March 31, 2008. This is a special fleet of vehicles used by the Canadian government to transport Canadian heritage exhibits across the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program has been in place since 1972 in the Department of Canadian Heritage. If the program is cancelled it will dramatically reduce access by Canadians to their heritage and the works of Canadian artists. It will have a serious effect on non-profit museums and galleries in rural Canada which exhibit the work of Canadian artists. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Museums and galleries across Canada have used this program for years to transport important travelling exhibitions. The program brings high calibre art to remote communities generating a sense of national cohesion. I know Yukon is expecting an exhibit about Inuit and Sami art. This is a very important program. I hope the member will support keeping this program alive.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think of what is involved for these smaller museums and art galleries, without that federal government assistance, smaller communities all over the country simply could not financially afford to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always talk about the arts themselves as being an economic generator. We know that art galleries depend on a turnover and a change to be able to attract new patrons to come and visit specific works of art. Without that program I am deeply concerned, as the hon. member has mentioned, that many people will not be able to see the national treasures that we have and which should be shared with everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk about Fort Frances and Thunder Bay, it is the places even smaller than those communities that really want to try and build up their tourism by having displays and attracting people.

We are attempting to put some rationality into our budgetary process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, as last year and so many years before, because of poor planning and because of the abandonment of our responsibility to a number of sectors of our society, there are substantial surpluses in the budget. If people are on the right wing ideological bent, they would think that Canadians are being over-taxed because of all the money left over at the end of the year. That was a constant complaint from the Conservatives when they were the official opposition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of their rhetoric, when they became government, they showed substantial surpluses for two years in a row. They have also done the same things as the Liberals and over-taxed Canadians. From our perspective, it is a question of not properly allocating the revenues that are derived from taxpayers across this country and from other revenue in the form of fees and services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking this year again at a very substantial surplus primarily because of how well the resource industry is doing and even more specifically, how well the oil and gas industry is doing in exporting its product, mainly to the United States but generally around the globe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a very large surplus which reflects, on a smaller scale, very large profit levels in a number of sectors of the economy, primarily in the financial services sector and the oil and gas sector, and to a lesser degree in the mining and natural resources sector as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 181 in the present legislation substantially lowers the corporate tax rate. In fact, a double lowering because in the budget earlier in 2007, the corporate tax rate would be lowered from 22% to 18% by 2011. In clause 181 of this piece of legislation, the corporate tax rate would be lowered even more to 15% by 2012. In both cases, these tax breaks would provide a substantial benefit to large corporations, particularly the banking sector, the finance sector in general, and the oil and gas sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sectors were given a substantial break earlier this year with the budget and now that break is coupling with an even more substantial tax break. Something in the range of 50% or 60% of these tax breaks will end up in the pockets of large banks, large financial corporations, and the oil and gas industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this make sense? Is this a good budgeting process? Is this good public policy? The NDP says it is not. What would the alternative be if we did not have this? The surplus would be larger if this tax break were not given. That surplus could be used to simply pay down our national debt. The tax breaks in clause 181, if Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A> is passed in the House, could be used in this year's budget for any number of social programs. I would argue today that in fact it should be used in the sector of the economy that is in crisis and that is the manufacturing sector.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from Windsor, Ontario. The unemployment rates came out on Friday. In spite of the fact that the unemployment rate went down marginally in Windsor, we continue to lead the country with the highest unemployment rate of any substantial city of our size, which is over 50,000 people. That is because my community, both the city and the county that surrounds it, is primarily based on the automotive sector as the engine that drives our share of the economy and to a great extent drives the economy across the country, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we continue to have the highest unemployment rate. As an aside, because I did a lot of work on this over my career in trying to help deal with unemployment circumstances during the major recessions we had back in the early eighties and again a minor one in the early nineties. On each occasion, and it has happened again now, the unemployment rate calculation substantially underestimates the real unemployment rate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the methodology that StatsCan uses to calculate the unemployment rate, the real unemployment rate in Windsor is probably approaching 15% at this point. The trauma that families and individuals are going through reflects that reality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that these corporate tax rates are going to benefit the economy. As I have said earlier, that is true only to the extent of parts of the economy, in particular the financial sector, the oil and gas sector and natural resources sector. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These corporate tax breaks will do absolutely nothing to assist the manufacturing sector. There are all sorts of manufacturers, not just in the auto sector but in any number of other sectors, that have no profit. In fact, they are in a situation where they are suffering losses. They are suffering deficits on their balance sheets this year and in a number of cases for several years before that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give them a corporate tax break is absolutely useless in terms of it having any impact on helping them deal with the crisis that we are faced with in the manufacturing sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were really serious about aiding that sector of the economy, it would be looking at other programs. In particular, we have seen both the provincial governments of Ontario and Quebec step forward to provide direct assistance to not just the auto but the manufacturing sector generally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both established large fairly substantial funds, pools of money, to provide a methodology where the manufacturers who need to update their equipment, update technological endeavours within their sector, would have the ability to tap into these pools of funds from the governments and make them more competitive. Hopefully, as they are doing that, we would see unemployment rates begin to drop and people get back to work in that sector. Both of those two provinces have provide those pools of funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have also called on the federal government to play its part, to get involved, and to establish a similar pool. If we were to actually do the calculations on the tax break for just those two sectors, finance and natural resources, oil and gas in particular, if the government were to not grant that tax break in this bill and made enough funds available to establish that pool of money, it would cost anywhere from $.5 billion to $1 billion which is what is needed for our manufacturing sector to get back on its feet.</div>

I acknowledge that the member wants to assist the manufacturing industry. Obviously this is an industry that our government is working with, and we are working to create a strong future for all companies in Canada. I acknowledge that the hon. member has an interest in that, but we have a broader interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get concerned when members of the NDP rail against tax cuts for corporations. Certainly in the finance committee we hear time and time again about how Canada is not competing and is becoming a high tax jurisdiction. That is why we see companies deciding that maybe they should manufacture elsewhere and do business elsewhere and that maybe Canada is not where they should employ people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is obviously a concern for the government. We want Canada to be where companies want to set up, do business and employ Canadians, because ultimately our society is better off. Canadians are better off when they can find well-paid jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to do that is to attract foreign investment dollars and foreign corporations and to also assist in bolstering Canadian corporations. It is not just about helping companies in trouble. It is about strengthening companies that can employ even more Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I acknowledge the hon. member's statements, I just cannot agree with him. In addition, I would like to ask the hon. member if he understands that in assisting companies in becoming stronger, it has been proven time and time again that those tax savings are often passed on to employees in the form of higher wages. Has he considered that?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member speaks of job creation, but let us look at both the previous Liberal government and the Conservative government and we will see that the policies of the previous Liberal government are almost identical to the Conservative government's policies.

It also implements the provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on October 30, which is what we refer to as a mini-budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A> is a confidence bill and that if it is defeated we will be into a general election in Canada. I am sure that Canadians do not want to have a general election right now. We do not need one. I certainly do not want one either.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think that this bill, in implementing these measures of the budget and the mini-budget, falls far short of what Canadians deserve. I would like to cite a few examples, first of all on reducing the GST from 6% to 5%. We all know, as economists worldwide and certainly in Canada have commented, that this is bad economic policy. It is better to reduce income taxes or invest in programs and services that Canadians need. Reducing the GST is not a very good economic measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Conservatives committed to this in their platform, wrongly I think, as they realize now, but there is a better use for that money, that $5.5 billion which reducing the GST from 6% to 5% is going to cost annually in perpetuity. We have already lost roughly $5.5 billion per year by reducing the GST from 7% to 6%, so cumulatively this is $11 billion taken out of the federal treasury from now until forever. It is not a very good use of taxpayers' money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather see an investment in our national infrastructure. Let us take that $5.5 billion and, instead of reducing the GST from 6% to 5%, collaborate with the provinces and the municipalities and start dealing with our national infrastructure deficit. Some have estimated that the infrastructure deficit is in the range of $120 billion to $130 billion, but whatever the number is we know it is significant, and we know anecdotally about some of the pressures on our infrastructure. All we have to do is look at the bridge that collapsed in Montreal. There are many other examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not deal with our infrastructure, we will create a number of problems. We are creating safety issues for Canadians. We are also becoming less competitive as a nation. If our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and harbours are not up to snuff, we are not going to be competitive as a nation, especially in this global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, would support not cutting the GST from 6% to 5%. I would support taking that $5.5 billion, working with the provinces, leveraging some provincial money, leveraging some municipal money, and starting an infrastructure program, initially a five year to ten year program, maybe, and extending it from there. We would start to make a very big dent in our infrastructure deficit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mayors such as Hazel McCallion, a very respected and reasonable mayor of the City of Mississauga, who is saying that the federal government is being hugely negligent by not investing in infrastructure and, because of that, the municipality of Mississauga is going to have to increase its property taxes. If we had this infrastructure program, I am sure that mayors such as Hazel McCallion would not implement this property tax increase and would use the money to invest in infrastructure. That is just one example. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget and the mini-budget are deficient in a number of other ways, particularly in regard to their lack of emphasis on innovation and research and development. Our Liberal government started to reinvest in research and innovation after we started to deal with the deficit and paying down federal debt. We made large investments in the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, in the Canada Foundation for Innovation, in establishing research chairs across Canada, and in putting money forward for research overheads, which are needed to implement these research programs.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, what we have seen in Canada is the brain gain. We had been losing a lot of researchers and scientists who were leaving Canada because of the poor research environment. Because of the measures of our government, we created the brain gain. In fact, I met some of them at the University of Toronto recently. They are U.S. researchers who had come up to Canada as research chairs and spoke very positively about how our government had dealt with this positive research environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is now in jeopardy. It is in jeopardy because the Conservative government is not making those investments in the Canadian Institutes of Health Research or the Canada Foundation for Innovation and also has very cumbersome and unwieldy processes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of those researchers were saying that while the environment is still not bad, it is on a decline. I think it would be a horrible thing to happen to Canada if we reverted to the brain drain, because we had undertaken so much effort to create this very positive research environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that research environment do? It allows us to be competitive in the global economy. It allows us to develop products and services that add value and that create high value jobs in this country. All we have to do is look around and we can see the impact of our global economy. There is a lot of material to read. I would recommend <i>The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</i> as a starter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I have been doing some work on the diamond industry. It is well acknowledged that Canada is now the third largest diamond producer in the world, and we have more diamond production coming in from northern Ontario, but guess what? Ninety-nine per cent of the diamonds leave this country in an uncut, unpolished and no value added form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been working with various stakeholders to see what we can do to deal with this. We could perhaps establish a diamond bourse or a diamond exchange here in Canada. From there, the value added activities, the cutting and polishing and other jewellery businesses, would grow. That is the experience worldwide. In fact, we know that it cannot all be done up in the Northwest Territories and in Yukon. We have to centre some of it in some of the major metropolitan centres. Of course, as a member of Parliament from the Toronto area, I am trying to centre some of that activity in Toronto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a great opportunity with retail diamonds in Canada. They can be and are being differentiated in the marketplace and are a great attraction, but one of the bottlenecks I am running into is that the cutting and polishing of diamonds is increasingly happening in India and China.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could repeat that scenario over many different sectors. We cannot fight that. It is the new reality, but if we are going to compete in this world economy, we have to seek the higher value added initiatives. We have to be innovative. We have to invest in research and in adding value to our products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on in regard to the manufacturing sector. Another colleague commented about it. Our businesses need to invest in new technologies now to increase our productivity. That is why the accelerated capital cost allowance measures that the Conservative government brought in need to be extended, but we need to give business a longer planning horizon. Businesses do not make decisions like these over two years. They need to have the accelerated capital cost allowances extended for five to 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have job shortages looming. What was in the budget about that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was in the budget about investing in carbon capture and sequestration and in technologies that will help us recycle water in areas like the oil sands?</div>

    </p><a name="Para826652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was in the budget about protecting small investors? What was in there about the brokers who are using investors' money and churning their accounts? There is no accountability. There is no responsibility. The integrated market enforcement teams, which are supposed to deal with this type of fraud, are not effective. They are ineffectual. What was in the budget to deal with that? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was in the budget to deal with backlogs in immigration processing?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it interesting that when Toronto has fiscal challenges, it is blamed on the city of Toronto.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the problems we have had in infrastructure in Canada over the last number of decades is possibly related to the way we have built our communities and how they have sprawled out. I note that statisticians call it MTV; Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver have population densities of between some 4,000 and 5,000 persons per square kilometre and yet a city like Mississauga has a population density of 2,300 persons per square kilometre.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should some of the blame for the challenges around the infrastructure deficit not also be placed on the way in which communities like Mississauga have been built? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of urban sprawl, I do agree with the member that part of the problem that we have created in Toronto is urban sprawl. I was glad to see the Liberal government at Queen's Park announce the formation of a green space.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality is that we need to get the density of populations up to rationalize or justify more use of public transit, which is why I am glad our government invested in public transit. Unfortunately, we need to do a lot more because public transit is good for the environment, good for people living in cities and it is a positive thing to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor McCallion is very credible. I think most Canadians would say that if she cannot find it in her budget it is probably not there. I know the mayor of Toronto, David Miller, has been saying the same thing. I think that he does a very credible job as well, but the reality is that the federal government needs to take responsibility for investing in infrastructure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government did it over many years with our cost shared programs. They worked very well. If we look at the United States, its government is making huge investments in infrastructure. It is not worried or concerned about it. Our federal government needs to take a very strong position on infrastructure and leverage other investments but take a lead role.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the economic update, I see that corporate taxes will be cut by 7% in the next four years. Members of the official opposition have applauded this because they say that it was actually their idea in the first place and that they should have credit for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be very clear that when the government puts this forward and the official opposition applauds it, they are applauding and celebrating the fact that yes, in some resource industries, oil, gas, mining, we do have increased revenues, but it is not taking into consideration other natural resource industries in which communities are devastated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak of the natural resource of forestry, which is also a manufacturing industry. In British Columbia, forestry will not in any way benefit by these tax cuts. There is actually not a lot of forestry to be benefited at all. We have no mills left on the Fraser River in British Columbia because they have all closed. The forests have been devastated by pine beetle and towns and communities have closed. It has not only affected the workers. It has affected their families and their children, who are then uprooted to go somewhere else for a job that their prime wage earner may or may not find, and retraining that they may or may not find, because with the corporate tax cuts, I do not see a major focus on retraining for these workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another example of the lack of balance pursued by the government. To rate the economy, what steps can be taken? A number of steps were entirely overlooked in this economic update. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about apprenticeship support? Surely apprenticeship support aids our economy in major ways. In British Columbia, we have jobs we cannot fill. I realize it is hard to say that after listening to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A>, whose town is devastated, but we have well paying jobs in British Columbia that we cannot fill because we do not have the skilled workers. We do not have apprenticeship programs for people to learn those skills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming of the Olympics and all of the development that comes with it: the housing that develops in the communities where the Olympics will take place; all of the creation of the Olympics; the facilities; and simply the visitors that it brings and the facilities they will need, aids the economy enormously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, without apprenticeship support, without support for people in trades and technology, those jobs that support our economy will go unfilled or they will be filled by people who do not really have the skills to do the job. In five years time, as we have all seen happen in B.C., we will back in repairing the work because the work originally done was not necessarily done by people who knew precisely what they should be doing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents in Surrey North cannot afford the private colleges that offer trades and technology. They do not have the dollars for themselves or for their sons and daughters to pay the high tuition fees. This was a superb opportunity to provide support to those young people and those adults who were looking and wanting to have training. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we attract investment? I heard people talking about attracting investment to Canada. If companies are asked what attracts them to a country, they will say that they want to move their company or their manufacturing plant to a country that has skilled workers, strong research and development, has a commitment to assisting companies to renew machinery and equipment and is supportive of green companies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot open my paper from British Columbia without seeing the housing development embracing the building of a home using the green components that we have learned about. Businesses are looking at that as well. What a wonderful opportunity this would have been to invest in green companies.</div>

I live in Surrey, a city of 400,000 people, and it has for years been one of the most rapidly growing cities in the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal government had worked with the provinces and the municipalities, there could have been a vibrant partnership to renew the infrastructure that is virtually crumbling across this country. One part of the Fraser Highway in Surrey needs about $20 million to upgrade but our city does not have that kind of money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People move to Surrey because there is affordable housing but they often work in Vancouver, Coquitlam or Langley. We need a massive expansion of buses or light rapid transit along King George Highway or the Fraser Highway but it would cost $800 million to TransLink, which is our overall transit organization and we do not have that kind of money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those people who want to live in Surrey but work outside Surrey cannot because there is no viable transportation for them. This is because we have a huge national infrastructure deficit and we are ignoring it and we are ignoring it at the plight of all the people who live in our communities and, in this case, in Surrey and in my riding of Surrey North.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is our investment in human resources. The first investment in human resources that any of us can make is in child care. If there are people who are able to choose and they choose to be home while their children are small, then that is their choice and I support that choice. However, not everyone can do that. The government gives $1,200 a year for infant care. I do not know how much a person would need to make in order to even enter into the workforce to support their family. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the NDP looked for in this budget was an investment in people and their communities, targeted tax relief and closing the gap between those who have and those who do not, between working women and men who do not have those opportunities and those who do. How do cuts to corporate taxes help those entrepreneurs and small home businesses that actually support our economy? They do not.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all well and good to say that there will be a tax cut, but who benefits? The companies that are already successful and that are friends with the Conservatives, such as the big oil companies. They are the ones who benefit from tax cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the government done for companies that have recently shut down? Did it make an effort to look for some way to help keep these businesses open?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can provide examples. The UPM Miramichi mill shut down for nine to twelve months. All the people of Miramichi were scared that the mill would not reopen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Smurfit-Stone plant in Bathurst closed two years ago, after the arrival of this U.S. company. What is the government doing ahead of time to determine whether these companies should be allowed to set up here? That U.S. company comes here, buys a Canadian company, Consolidated-Bathurst, and then all of a sudden it turns around and closes its doors. This is a paper plant and its owners plan to sell it only to a non-competitor. Now there is no chance of this plant reopening in Bathurst, in northeastern New Brunswick, after being bought by just any old buyer. That plant was a major employer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago, AbitibiBowater announced it was closing its pulp and paper mill in Restigouche, which employed 450 people. Those were well paying jobs that created many indirect jobs. That plant is closing its doors and the government has not said a word about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government announced a $14 billion tax reduction for the rich oil companies or large companies that are making money. Those who are not making money should get a deductible. They are not benefiting from this tax reduction because they are not paying taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a month ago, the Fils Fins Atlantique Inc. plants in Atholville and Pokemouche, which employed some 300 people, closed their doors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is saying that jobs in Canada have reached a record number and that there are a ton of jobs. However, often—I think many people can identify with this—people have to take on two or three jobs just to get by.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of giving this $14 billion to big companies that are already making money—since, as I was saying, those who are not making money will not benefit from the tax reduction since they are not paying taxes—why not invest this money in municipal infrastructure? The municipalities are struggling with a deficit caused by federal government cuts. Those cuts started at the federal level and trickled down through the provinces to the municipalities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Canadian Municipalities was here two weeks ago asking the federal government to invest in infrastructure. The government says that it will invest some money. It is all well and good to establish programs where the federal and provincial governments invest one third of the money each; however, if the municipality does not have money, it cannot participate in the program. Municipalities need money for water and sewer systems. In some regions, they need an airport to ensure economic development.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the issue of public transit, which is so important today to cities for environmental reasons. Rather than investing money in this area, they decided to give it to their Bay Street friends. Things will be better now because almost all the action will be on Bay Street given that the Toronto Stock Exchange has now combined with the Montreal Stock Exchange. They will give money to their friends to ensure they are happy when they go to the bank at night. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006 and 2007, the employment insurance fund had a surplus of $3.3 or $3.6 billion. It is not true that the Conservative government said that it would put money into improving the employment insurance system for needy regions where many seasonal jobs were lost in the fishery and in blueberry or Christmas tree operations. The Conservatives said they would give money to these people. However, what they said was not true. These people are not important to them, they are just voters. They only vote and put them in power. They are not important. The Conservatives prefer to give money to the big oil companies. Why? We are still wondering about that. The Conservatives do not respect taxpayers and the voters who pay every day and who work to build this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to money that could be invested in infrastructure, roads are also an issue. In past years, people started talking about a two-tier hospital system. We have a pretty mixed-up system now because someone wants a service, that individual has to pay for it. Sooner or later, they will say that because they did not invest in highway infrastructure, individual citizens will have to pay for roads. They will set up toll roads. People will keep paying and paying. They cut taxes for big business and then they fool citizens into believing that they are paying less tax and have more money in their pockets. Then, when they go to the hospital, they will have to pay for care themselves. When they want to use the roads, they will have to pay. The citizens will pay, but the government will keep saying that it has put more money in their pockets. For example, the government is now giving people money directly for children and child care, but in the end, there will not be any child care centres.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much money has been transferred to the provinces? We do not spend enough time in this House talking about people who receive social assistance, people in need. How can a person on welfare live on $500 when that person is disabled? How is that person supposed to live on $500 a month? That person did not ask to be on welfare, to be sick, to have an accident or to be disabled. Nobody asks for that. Every human being on the planet is willing and wants to work and do their part. These people did not ask to end up like this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of giving $14 billion to large corporations that are already making a ton of money and reducing their taxes, could they not give some money to the citizens who really need it? Why not give to homeless people who are on the street because they have nowhere to live? Why not invest money in building houses and putting a roof over the heads of people forced to live in the streets? Why do something like that and help these people? The budget contains nothing to help them. They were completely ignored . Why not allocate some money for older people who need to buy lots of prescription drugs that cost them an arm and a leg? They have to pay for electricity, the cost of which has gone up, as well as their rent. Why not help our older people, our parents who worked hard and are now retired? Some people do not have retirement savings because not everyone had the opportunity to contribute to a pension fund. Why not help these people? We live in a world with an aging population. Baby boomers are retiring, but there is nothing for them in the fat sum of $14 billion that is going to big business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Conservative government is doing. We should be asking ourselves some questions about this. This was not a good budget or a good mini-budget, which is why we will vote against it.</div>

He has often suggested that in the past as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem with employment insurance is that it is not available to contract workers, to those workers who work very part time hours, to small business owners and to self-employment workers. Therefore, it is not a program of universal import.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often these contractor workers, self-employment workers and small business owners are immigrants. They are new Canadians. They have come to this country, the land of opportunity and hope, to build a new life. They have decided to open up perhaps a small restaurant in Montreal or to drive a taxi in Toronto in an effort to get themselves ahead. However, the employment insurance program is not available to these new Canadians, these immigrants, a population that is vulnerable, at risk in many respects and that has fallen behind. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member explain to me how expanding employment would benefit these vulnerable populations, populations that have been documented as being at risk, populations that the United Way of Greater Toronto, for example, has said are falling behind? How does expanding employment insurance benefit some of the most vulnerable in our society, these new Canadians?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have travelled across the country visiting every province. I met immigrants in Toronto and they asked to have a program for the self-employed. I proposed a bill in the House of Commons, which was denied by the Conservative Party. It denied a program for self-employed people across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times have we had bills in the House of Commons asking the government, which was the Liberals in the past and the Conservatives today, to make a change so self-employed employees could pay into the program?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, if people have jobs and lose their jobs, they should be treated the same. We have asked the government to change the rules of the employment insurance program to include everyone who works and wants to pay into the employment insurance fund and receive their employment insurance benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be fair and just. It does not matter if one is a taxi driver, or a nurse or a miner. When people lose their jobs, they should have benefits to feed their families, and the Conservative Party refused to do that. </div>

It favours large corporations with enormous tax breaks. Everyone else may get a few tax credits, and that is good, but ordinary Canadians have to spend that money first to get it back. A lot of people cannot afford to do that, so there will be no tax credit or savings for them.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in my riding who are responsible for administering a lot of services tell me that the greatest need is housing. I live in a rural area and we do not see people on the street like we would see in greater centres. They do not congregate on the streets as they do in big cities. They live in campsites and in their cars. People do not realize this because our homeless do not live downtown where everyone can see them. We only realize this when we look to the service providers and find out that people are in dire need. These are not unemployed people. A lot of them are underemployed or they work part time. Some are young families with children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing everything we can to help them in our communities, but we are doing it with scarce dollars. This could have been addressed in the budget. Some money should have been put into a national housing program like the one called for by the NDP for many years. The program was eliminated, but we would like to see it resurrected so people can get into affordable housing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with respect to housing on reserves is very sad. Sometimes 18 to 24 people live in a house that was only designed for a family of four. They are living in very crowded conditions. Because the houses were not built to a very good standard, they are mouldy, or leaking or falling apart. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money needs to be invested in these communities to ensure aboriginal people have the housing they deserve, which would give them the ability to live in dignity. It is quite shameful that we are forcing first nations to live in Third World conditions on reserves. I cannot say in strong enough words how shameful it is on Canada's part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $14 billion going toward large corporate tax cuts could have been invested in a child care program. Hopefully, my colleague's amendment will pass in the House and we will have a national child care program in the country very soon. All parents have been calling for a child care program. It is sorely needed and it would help ease the debt burden for a lot of working families. I fully support that. I look forward to the day when parents do not need to have bake sales to raise money to fund child care centres. It is important for all our communities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things that we do not see in my riding, especially where I live on coast. A lot of our communities used to be dependent on fishing resources. We have lost a lot of that. What we have lost is habitat protection and part of that is because there is not enough money in the system. We need huge dollars invested in our habitat protection on the coast so we can ensure we have a viable fishery for the future, but we have not seen that. It is sad. There seems to be enough money for so many things, especially for corporate tax cuts. We would like to see some of that money flow to our communities to protect our streams, rivers and lakes. We would like people there to protect those areas so we can have fish in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Acadie—Bathurst also talked about forestry, which is another area of concern in my riding. Because of the softwood lumber sellout, we now see the increase of raw log exports from all our forestry communities across the country. That is causing mills to close. I know the government has said that it will make some investment into mills and resources in Quebec, but I did not hear anything about the west.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the finance minister saying in his budget speech that his Canada was from the Atlantic to the Rockies. I live on the other side of those Rockies. I remind him there is a whole province out there with a huge forest industry, which is in big trouble. We need an investment in our value added manufacturing. We want to see our communities stay alive. Instead we are seeing all our raw logs being shipped out of the country and being processed elsewhere. It is having a devastating impact on our communities and something has to be done about it. The government had an opportunity with billions of dollars in surplus to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of my remarks I mentioned that workers were paying for the debt. They pay for that by a lack of jobs. We have seen a loss of jobs in our forest sector and our fishing industry. There is the lack of child care and housing. People pay huge amounts of money out of their own pockets to the detriment of being able to pay rent, or mortgages or even living decently in a community. That money is being stolen out of their pockets and their tax dollars with nothing given back to them. It is shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and training is another area where the government could have made a real difference for our young people. It could have invested in our colleges, universities and other institutions. It could have ensured that education was more affordable for our young people so they would not have to pay such high tuition fees to get an education, to further their skill building and to get a better career. A few million dollars into the education sector could have gone a long way to help young people reduce their debts, which would help them start their working lives on a more even footing, not having to start off with thousands and thousands of dollars of debt. Some of that debt is probably why they have to live in their cars and campsites rather than in a home. It is another shame on the part of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group I have not talked about is seniors. A seniors charter was passed in the House, but has never been enacted. The government could have invested in some of the things in that such as home care program and long term care for our seniors who really need it. This would help them and the system save money because they would not end up in hospital. They could stay home and be looked after with dignity. It think we would all like to see that for our aging parents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescription drugs should have been made much more affordable, if not free for seniors, as well as dental care. These things were in the seniors charter, which has never been enacted by the government. Again, that is a shame</div>

Someone who had just returned from Afghanistan said that the mission in Afghanistan is not over until the last Canadian who participated in the mission dies. He was saying that some of the men and women who come back from Afghanistan may have mental or physical disabilities and may require care and treatment for the rest of their natural lives. What he was referring to is that the mission is not just when people go in and come out, but it encompasses whatever requirements they may have for the rest of their lives. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government is asked what contingency funds are in place for the future concerns of people who come back with mental or physical disabilities and their families, the answer is that there are none. We can spend $4 billion on the operation of a mission, and I certainly will not argue what is required to operate the mission, but would it not be prudent for the government to ensure that certain funds are put aside so that the men and women who served in that conflict will have their needs met in future years? That could be done in a budget. Those funds could be allocated to make sure the money will be there to ensure their needs are always met.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current government, it does not matter whether it is a social program or economic development or what the issue is, the solution is always a tax cut. Clearly, these tax cuts are not working. The massive corporate tax cuts made by previous governments have drained so much potential from our federal resources and the current government is continuing along the same path. The high cost of these tax cuts means that we are not investing where we ought to be investing, which is in our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a growing economic gap in this country. People are working longer and harder, yet they are falling further and further behind. There is a growing number of Canadians who are homeless, a growing number who are badly housed and who are at the limit, in terms of their capacity to assume any more debt. I certainly see it in my own community. There are people who are working for less than $10 an hour, in other words they are poor, who are paying $1,000 a month for an apartment for them and their families. They are under-housed and cannot make ends meet because they cannot support themselves and pay that kind of rent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the money to be able to invest in a national housing strategy? There are 75,000 families in my city, Toronto, who are on the waiting list for assisted housing. Those numbers are not going down; in fact, they are growing every day. We do not have money to build new facilities for them. We are not seeing new co-op housing or other forms of affordable housing being built. This is an absolute disgrace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent United Way report showed that the number of families falling into poverty in my city of Toronto is double the number in many other communities. Why? Toronto is a fast-growing city. It is the home to many newcomers to Canada. It is the most expensive city in the country. Tax cuts are not fixing the situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax cuts are also not fixing the situation with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing is the biggest sector in our city and yet we have seen the loss of 125,000 manufacturing jobs from our community. These are decent paying jobs. They are full time work. They allow people to support themselves and their families. People are being thrown out of their jobs. Their lives are thrown into turmoil. Often they are only able to secure much lower paying, insecure work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of targeting a strategy to help the manufacturing sector at a time of a high dollar, at a time of greater competition, at a time of high fuel prices, what we have seen is across the board corporate tax cuts which, frankly, are not helping the companies that are not making profits anyway. These companies cannot benefit from the tax cuts. Those that do benefit are already extremely profitable, multi-billion dollars profitable, such as the banking sector and the oil and gas sector. In fact, we are helping the already overheated sectors of the economy, which pushes our dollar even higher. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs a focused targeted strategy to deal with the crisis in the manufacturing sector. It needs to make a strong investment in social programs. It also needs to make a strong investment in infrastructure programs. None of these things happen with across the board corporate tax cuts.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para826764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to spend a couple of minutes on the issue of infrastructure investment. It does not matter whether it is engineers, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities or the Board of Trade, in all the studies everyone agrees that we have a crisis in infrastructure spending, that the current government and previous governments have neglected their responsibilities to invest in our infrastructure. Whether it is water or waste management, roads or transit, the proper stewardship has not been exercised in these areas. We need a major commitment to invest in our infrastructure. Corporate tax cuts do not provide investment in our infrastructure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put forward a motion calling for a national transit strategy. It is a disgrace that the government does not have a national transit strategy. Our transit systems are growing as our populations grow, especially in our major urban centres. In a city like mine, in Toronto, we are seeing a growing gridlock with the resulting pollution and drain on people's time. It puts stress on the family. It is a huge drag on business. The Board of Trade has said that the number one thing it would like to see is investment in transit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ought to be public investment and not shunted off to a public-private partnership. We saw what happened in the city of London when it had a public-private partnership to expand its subway system. There was a $4 billion cost overrun there which the public is on the hook for. It is false economy to say that we can divert this to the private sector, because ultimately the public will be on the hook for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us to be able to invest the needed moneys in our infrastructure and in our transit, we need a strong tax base. Letting profitable corporations off the hook to the tune of tens of billions of dollars is a colossal mistake. It is wasting our tax revenue. It is missing an opportunity to invest in the services, the programs and the infrastructure that Canadians need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when our economy has been expanding and doing relatively well, if we cannot now make these important investments, when will we ever be able to do it?</div>
    </p><a name="Para826769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that to let companies off the hook and not have them pay the taxes that they should be paying based on their very successful profits is a mistake. It is missing a golden opportunity at this point in the business cycle to be able to address the physical and social infrastructure needs that our country has. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through neglect we are letting our country slide into crisis, a crisis of poverty for a growing number of people, a crisis of a lack of child care, a crisis of a lack of housing, a crisis of a lack of infrastructure, especially transit. With the growing number of seniors in this country, I fear that we will increasingly have a crisis in terms of neglecting the needs of seniors as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would strongly argue that this is not the time for across the board tax cuts. We need to pay attention to the manufacturing crisis and the crisis in other sectors, such as tourism, that desperately need attention from the government. These sectors desperately need attention. Across the board tax cuts do not help them. This is the time to be investing in our country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the government to ignore the daily pressing reality of so many families in the city of Toronto is disgraceful.

It would remove a clause that the Conservatives intend to use to reduce the corporate tax rate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been listening to several of the interventions from some of the Conservative members in the House. It has been very interesting. The argument goes something like this: we have to become more competitive with what exists elsewhere in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems we have in Canada right now is that we have built, over the past century, a very balanced economy that includes a very strong resource sector. Of course, mining and forestry have always been the backbone of the Canadian economy, but we also have, especially since the second world war, built a very strong industrial base, especially in the central and eastern parts of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increase in the Canadian dollar's value, especially in the past year, the Canadian manufacturing sector has been under a lot of stress and strain. The same thing applies in particular to the forestry sector. Whether it be in Ontario or Quebec, we have seen a lot of companies closing. We see companies like Baronet, which is a wonderful Quebec company that has been manufacturing furniture since the 1940s, simply unable to compete with the current value of the Canadian dollar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of recognizing that in a country the size and the breadth of Canada that the government has to play a role in shaping the economy and maintaining it when there are these types of ups and downs that we have been going through, what have we got from the Conservatives? They have thrown themselves headlong into a race to see how quickly they could reduce the corporate tax rate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the result of that? It is quite simple. In the forestry sector, companies have not made any profit in the past year simply because the Canadian dollar is so high and exports have become that more difficult for those companies. As a result, those companies will not benefit in any way, shape or form from this purported help that the Conservatives are providing. It is the same thing in the manufacturing sector, where very few companies have actually made a profit in the last year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will get the $14 billion that the Tories are putting on the table and that they keep snapping their suspenders about? The companies that have made the biggest profits and that have been throwing the economy out of kilter, precisely the oil and gas sector, especially in the west, in Alberta to name it, where the companies have made huge profits in the past year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several companies will get cheques back from the government for $50 million, $60 million or $70 million because of the fact that we are reducing the corporate tax rate. It will benefit those companies that have made the most profit and therefore they should be paying the most taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks are also in for a windfall. We all had the benefit of watching our current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Finance Minister</A> go cap in hand to the banks last year and ask them to do something about reducing the fees at ATMs, the automated teller machines. What happened? They told him to take a hike. He thinks they are his boss. He does not realize that he is in charge of regulating the banks in the public interest. They told him to get lost and he did. He came back to Ottawa, reported duly to the House, and said, “Sorry, they will not move”, and that is where it stayed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the same thing earlier this year when he talked to the retail sector and asked them if they really found that it was fair that a product had two prices on it, one in Canadian dollars and one in U.S. dollars, and that the Canadian price was 35% higher than the U.S. price, given the fact that generally speaking in the past year our dollars have been pretty close to par. There was no problem there either. The retail sector told him he did not understand anything about inventories and sent him packing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting is that when we look at the oil sector, no one ever argues that the existing inventories were bought at a lower rate. The minute there is an increase in the per barrel price of oil around the world, somehow the company that is pumping the oil into the tank in our basement, if we have oil-fired hot air at home, increases the rate overnight to go along with that worldwide increase. Anyhow, the argument of the companies works sometimes and not at other times.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before us would remove the tax cuts proposed by the Conservatives in their so-called mini-budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting the following for everyone watching today: the Liberal Party of Canada is supporting the Conservative Party on these cuts for companies, for big corporations, such as the oil and gas companies and the banks. This is interesting, since the economy in Quebec is destabilized because of the massive increase in the production of oil and gas, which has caused the economy in the west to overheat. Instead of trying to alleviate the negative impact of this overheating in the west, what do the Conservatives propose? They would like to issue $50 or $60 million cheques in tax refunds to the oil companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that do for the manufacturers in Quebec and Ontario? What does that do for forestry companies in Quebec and Ontario that are in the process of shutting down, putting hundreds or thousands of families out on the street without a job? The Conservatives are doing absolutely nothing because they strongly believe that it is a mistake for the government to take care of the economy. They do not think that the government, even in a country as large as Canada, has a role to play. It means nothing to the Conservatives that this manufacturing sector has been built up over 60 years <i>a mari usque ad mare</i>. They are prepared to destroy this sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the Liberals tend to preach in major cities such as Toronto and to speak in favour of food banks. We forget that it would be worthwhile asking, when speaking to the managers of food banks and those working in this sector, what was the Liberal Party of Canada doing when the Conservatives were handing over a nice gift to the big oil companies? I will tell you what the Liberals were doing. They were sitting on their hands, as they have been doing since the beginning of this parliamentary session. Why are they doing nothing? Because they believe in nothing. They do not believe, not for one second, in the people who need help in our society. They do not at all believe that the government has a role to play in a modern and diversified economy such as that of Canada. The Liberal Party of Canada has a great deal of explaining to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para826798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the only political party that has the courage to stand up in this House, and to tell the public that we must help the manufacturing and the forestry sectors, is the New Democratic Party. The only political party with representation from British Columbia to Nova Scotia and a real chance to form the next government is the NDP. The people of Quebec and Ontario who believe that the government must play a more active role will vote for the New Democratic Party in the next election.</div>

This is about people who served their country with valour and honour and now are veterans. One of these people is the widow of a veteran.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what happens. When we speak to officials at DVA privately over a glass of beer and with no microphones or anyone looking over their shoulder, they will tell you that the reason why they say no and deny so many people their proper rights and pensions is because they simply do not have the money. They would love to go public with that, but they cannot because we do not have proper whistleblower protection</div>
    </p><a name="Para826810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give two examples. Chris Beattie is the widow of a veteran who served at Chalk River. Just before he died, DVA said to him that he was entitled to the veterans independence program. However, two days before the program was actually delivered, before DVA came to his house to deliver and assist with the VI program, he died. Because he died and because he did not actually receive the program, his spouse is not entitled to VIP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, which is reported in today's Chronicle-Herald, is that of a veteran firefighter with the Department of National Defence, 73 years old, who has been denied repeatedly for cancer and heart problems because of the smoke inhalation he suffered in his career.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province recognizes that pension disability, but DVA says no. With a $14 billion surplus, does the member not think that for their service to their country the government can assist people to have some semblance of a decent life ?</div>

The Conservatives can howl all they want, but the reality is that when banks and petroleum companies are making record profits under the current tax regime, giving them tax breaks is not the answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we really want to give people a tax break, we can eliminate taxes on funerals and crematorium services. We can eliminate taxes on over the counter drugs. We can eliminate taxes, for example, on home heating essentials, as we are advocating in Nova Scotia. That is a good tax break. We also can help the poorest of the poor and stop taxing their disability pensions, for example. That is where good tax relief should go.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always believed in a one-third, one-third and one-third approach: one-third of the budget on debt relief, one-third on strategic tax incentives and one-third on social reinvestment. But those folks over there put the vast majority of it to the most profitable corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we tell veterans and their widows? We cannot help them. What do we tell fishermen and their communities? We cannot help them. What do we tell the Inuit in the far north who are trying to get housing? We cannot help them. What do we tell students who are struggling under massive debts? We cannot help them. What do we tell parents with autistic children who are struggling to pay for the treatment the children require? We cannot help them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on and on. I remind the government about the children at Base Petawawa. When some of those kids whose fathers died in Afghanistan were having psychological problems, we asked a question in this House and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A>'s response was that mental health issues are “a provincial responsibility”. What nonsense. They were kids from a military base who required assistance. Thank goodness for the report of Ontario ombudsman André Marin, who slammed both the Ontario government and the federal government. We are glad to see that there was an arrangement after that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should not have had to have a report. We should not need to have media influence in order to do the right thing. If the government has this kind of surplus, when is it going to invest in the people and communities of this country? My colleague from Toronto is absolutely correct, but it is not just Toronto that is struggling under a massive infrastructure debt. Halifax and others are as well. I will continue this right after question period, Mr. Speaker.</div>

    </p><a name="Para826888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this very serious crisis, the Conservative government says nothing, does nothing and remains silent. With the holiday season just around the corner, this crisis is affecting our workers and their families right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months now, my colleagues and I have been warning the Conservative government about this crisis. During all this time, the Conservatives have always given answers that are not good enough for our workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para826890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the Conservative government do nothing, when it accumulated a surplus of $11.6 billion in the first six months of the year?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now—not in the next budget—is the time to help workers. I would like to make something very clear to the Conservatives. If they are not capable of helping workers, well, they might as well stay at home during the next federal election.</div>

In Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean they were scrambling for federal government money—and we came through—and seven other municipalities in Quebec were waiting for money, but the Bloc Québécois does not want us to do anything to diversify the economy in the Gaspé region, including in the cruise ship industry.</div>

    </p><a name="Para827144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP believe in the collective. We believe that the government can be a source of good for Canadians across this country from coast to coast to coast. We also believe that the resources of this country should benefit Canadians. As well, we should be able to share our expertise and wealth with those around the world who are struggling for human rights and human dignity and also on the environment, education, health, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, also within our own country there are many who are veterans and widows of veterans, who have been promised certain things by the government and have been denied. As my colleagues used to say, there is no greater fraud than a promise that has been broken. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 28, 2005, when the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was then opposition leader, he promised Joyce Carter of Cape Breton that if the Conservatives formed the government they would immediately extend the VIP services for all widows and veterans of World War II and Korea.

They recently came out with a package that covers only those in 1966 and 1967, which is exactly what the Liberals had proposed beforehand. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives in New Brunswick were elected on that promise and they broke that promise. It is unconscionable that a government that is like Scrooge McDuck, sitting on a pile of coins, loonies, toonies and cash, is not able to help those who served their country with such distinction and honour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently toured the north. One of the most outrageous conditions people there are living with is extremely crowded housing. They simply do not have enough housing to go around. We talk about Arctic sovereignty, first nations rights and helping aboriginal people and improving their health, yet the government does very little, if anything, to solve the housing crisis of the far north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not take a rocket scientist to understand this. After travelling to Resolute, Grise Fiord, Arctic Bay or Iqaluit and the other communities of the great territory of Nunavut, one understands that there is a terrific housing shortage going on. If the government is not going to help when it has billions and billions of dollars of surplus, when is it going to do so?</div>
    </p><a name="Para827151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, a colleague of mine who just got back from Afghanistan said the mission in Afghanistan will not end until the final soldier who serves in that country passes away. What he meant by that was quite clear. A lot of the individuals coming back from Afghanistan are going to suffer from mental and physical disabilities. A lot of them are going to require long term care. They and their families are going to need that care for the rest of their lives. That is what he was referring to: the mission will continue in their lives. It is the same for people who lose loved ones in Afghanistan. For them, Remembrance Day is every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has billions of dollars for the mission in Afghanistan. We argued that point the other day. The reality is that it is not hesitant to spend money on the actual mission itself, but when the government is asked what contingency funds are put aside to help with the mental and physical disabilities the soldiers and their families may have down the road, the answer is zero. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate to the government: if it cannot do this now, when it has surpluses, when is it going to do it? I advise the government to make sure there is enough money put aside to ensure the proper care and treatment down the road of those brave men and women who serve their country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, one of the greatest opportunities we have for economic development in this country is shipbuilding. The industry committee unanimously adopted a resolution that the accelerated capital allowance, or ACA, proposal should go from two years to five years, yet the government still has not done that. Those in the shipbuilding industry would like the same considerations that the government has been giving to the aerospace industry in Quebec for a long time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have approximately $20 billion worth of construction to do on naval replacement vessels, Coast Guard replacement vessels, ferries, the laker fleet, tugs, et cetera. We have five remaining shipyards in this country that could do that type of work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage the government to ensure that the domestic procurement process enables those workers and those industries in those yards across the country, in Victoria, Vancouver, Port Welland, Lévis, Halifax, and Marystown in Newfoundland and Labrador,to have the opportunity for long term sustainable growth. That way, especially in Atlantic Canada, people would not have to go down the road to find work.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Halifax have the privilege of being one of the education breadbaskets of Canada, but so many students who come to our schools get their education and leave with a massive debt. That cripples them in their opportunities down the road and they make choices that they normally would not like to make, such as having to move to the United States or other parts of Canada. We would like them to be able to work and find their livelihood right in Atlantic Canada, but saddling them with a massive debt is unconscionable.</div>

    </p><a name="Para827167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was his government that promised almost 300,000 people on the defoliant spraying in Gagetown that they would be compensated. It has ended up that less than 4,000 will be able to apply. Much more than $19 million is going to be needed to look after that. We are looking at hundreds of millions of dollars. That was the promise they made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives also made a promise to extend the VIP services to all veterans and all widows. That was not in the estimates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other things they have promised veterans and have failed to deliver time and time again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I have a veteran in Windsor, Nova Scotia, who is being denied compensation for the smoke inhalation he suffered while serving his country. Many more veterans are denied hearing aids. Many more veterans are denied VIP services. Many more veterans are denied orthotics. All of that is because there is nowhere near enough money, which the member said is in the Veterans Affairs budget, to look after those needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the government that promised to get rid of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board and replace it with medical and military personnel. But what did it do? It brought in Angela Vautour, a defeated Conservative candidate, to sit on that board of appeals. She knows nothing about veterans and their medical concerns.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that my colleague from Sackville raises is a great deal of these corporate tax cuts would go to the oil and gas industry, which already enjoys record profits and do not really need any motivation to do any more development in the tar sands.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the hon. member confirm if what I have read is true? The increase in royalties that the province of Alberta recently applied to the oil and gas industry is 100% tax deductible at the federal end? In other words, it is getting a tax deduction for paying a royalty to gouge and use up all our valuable energy resources.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to individuals, those who have lost their jobs in the manufacturing sector, in forestry, in auto, in shipbuilding, in the fishery, in farming, et cetera, they are told to get to the back of the line. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have been following the debate over the last days in the House of Commons, clause 181 contemplates even deeper corporate tax cuts as an aspect of the economic statement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public should be aware that for the last decade or so, there has been a mantra, a theme, a motif, throughout the Liberal government for 13 years and now the Conservative government, that the cure to all Canada's evils is corporate tax cuts. If it is child poverty, we need corporate tax cuts. If we have potholes in our streets, we need corporate tax cuts. If we give more money to the Canadian business community, that will somehow translate into relief for health care ills, infrastructure and virtually everything of which we can think. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us in the NDP have challenged that orthodoxy. We understand we need a competitive tax regime, but we believe we already have that. In fact, those of us who were asked to tighten our belts for the last 10 or 15 years through record surplus budgets have decided it is time to invest some of our hard-earned cash elsewhere. Some taxpayer dollars can go elsewhere other than its final state of repose in the deep pockets of a banker or somebody in the oil and gas industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the deep corporate tax cuts contemplated in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A> would undermine the fiscal capacity of the government to address the many other legitimate priorities our country has. Simply put, it would take $190 billion of fiscal capacity away from the government and future governments, because God willing, the government may not last that long and perhaps another government will take its place. With a corporate tax structure, which would then be the lowest of developed nations, not in the middle of the pack, not in a competitive, on par basis, but the lowest, we believe we would lose the ability to address the many other pressing social deficits that have been created by years and years of what can only be described as an ideological crusade to eliminate taxes on business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father used to tell me that not long ago the tax system was structured in such a way that business tax would be about 50% of government's revenue and individual personal income tax would be approximately the other 50%. Systematically, incrementally, bit by bit, slowly over the last 20 or 30 years, that has changed dramatically. I do not know what it comes down to with these current, most recent changes, but the proportion was roughly 85% individual personal tax and 15% total revenue from corporate tax. That will be dramatically reduced even further. I can only surmise, given the relentless pressure to reduce and reduce, the ultimate goal would be corporations and businesses would pay no tax and all the tax burden would be shifted onto us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their race to the bottom, there has been a competition between the Liberals and the current Conservative government. The Conservative government said that it would reduce the corporate tax from 21.5% or 22% down to 18.5%. The immediate reaction from the leader of the official opposition was the Liberals would have gone even further. While that was pretty good, they could do better.</div>

If the Conservatives had carte blanche to cut in half and slash corporate taxes, they would take them up on that game of chicken and reduce it to 16.5% in 2011 and to 15% by 2012. That is way below the average of comparable developed nations. It is as if this in and of itself would be the answer to all the shortcomings and the social deficit and the spending that we all recognize is necessary.</div>

    </p><a name="Para827189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank my colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore for pointing this out. The only social spending that has occurred in the last 15 years, 13 years of Liberal rule and two years now of Conservative, has been when the NDP managed, through its balance of power, to stop contemplated corporate tax cuts put forward by the Liberal government of the day. We used our influence, traded our support, to the minority Liberal government in exchange for significant social spending in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1815922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1815922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-48</A>. We managed to interrupt another completely unnecessary and secretive gift to Bay Street. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals did not run on that. They certainly did not give Canadians a chance to have any say on whether another $4.8 billion would be dutifully shuffled to their friends in corporate Canada. Fortunately, we intervened and that resulted in $4.8 billion worth of social spending. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian public deserves to be made aware of this. Some of the social spending now announced by the Conservative government is money that was booked and earmarked two years ago in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1815922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1815922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-48</A>. The NDP used its balance of power in a minority government to trigger some much needed social spending in social housing, post-secondary education, transit and foreign aid, some of the shortfalls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were asked to tighten our belts for 10 surplus budgets in a row. The Liberals told us that the social spending we called for would come but they had to first take care of some necessary priorities, such as paying down the debt and massive corporate tax cuts to their buddies on Bay Street. It seems they always come first. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the NDP to provide a balance of power in a minority situation, the government will always come first. When a right wing corporate organization elects a right wing corporate government to serve its interests, it is not surprising then that budgets are crafted in such a way to benefit those right wing corporate interests and the rest of us are forgotten.</div>

When the Liberals ruled the day and told us that we had to tighten our belts, they cut and hacked and slashed every social program by which we define ourselves as Canadians. Marginalized groups, low income groups, like in the riding I represent, suffered the most. Let me give one example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals cut back eligibility for UIC, or EI as it is called today, those cutbacks in my riding alone amounted to $20.8 million worth of income revenue.

This $20.8 million worth of income that came from the federal government into my low income community pushed more people off EI and on to welfare. That was like taking the payroll of a company with 2,000 employees out of my riding. It ripped federal government revenue out of the heart of my riding and put it into more tax cuts for corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827196"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has failed to mention that we have added another 1% cut to the GST. The GST has gone from 7% down to 5%. That helps the poorest Canadians in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also reduced income taxes for hard-working, ordinary Canadian families. The tax break provides them with a bit of help in raising their families. We have also reduced taxation on small businesses. Yet the NDP votes against all of those tax reductions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that the member focused very much on reductions in corporate taxation, why does he oppose the reduction in taxes for hard-working Canadians, a reduction in the GST, a reduction in taxes for small business people across this country? Why?</div>

I am not sure if that party can consult at all. As soon as the government announced its 1% GST cut, my phone started ringing off the hook with calls from the low income people whom I represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that 47% of all families in my riding and 52% of all children in my riding live below the poverty line. When the government tells those people that there is a cut to the GST, they think it is a cut to their GST rebate cheque. They receive a rebate cheque on a regular basis from the government. They do not pay GST. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague's targeted tax cut in terms of a GST break is of no use to the genuinely poor in this country. They do not pay GST. They get a GST rebate. If anything, they will get less money back from the GST rebate when the tax is reduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were serious about targeted tax cuts and serious about ameliorating some of the social deficit, it would take some of the $190 billion that the government has squandered by shovelling it over to its corporate buddies and put some of that money toward the infrastructure deficit in our streets so that the public could enjoy public amenities like they used to. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should do something about social housing. The Mulroney government eliminated all of the social housing programs in 1993, except for one, and the first thing the Liberal government did when it took over in 1993 was to kill that too. I know because I was the president of a housing co-op that was waiting for an allocation of units so we could put the shovel in the ground and start building. The first thing the Liberal government did was kill the very last remaining social housing program. Canada has had a social housing deficit accumulating year after year ever since.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has squandered our future by giving all that money away to companies that do not need it. It is irresponsible. It is wasteful. It is negligent.</div>

I think it is a good segue into what the budget update reflects and what is happening in the main streets of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived on Parliament Hill three and a half years ago, I suddenly realized, like my other NDP colleagues, what a bubble Conservative and Liberal members of Parliament live under. They come here and corporate lobbyists are around and they read from the corporate media that everything is just rosy in Canada and they believe it because they are profoundly isolated from what is really going on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to provide that context of reality, this dose of reality, as we look at the economic statement. Two-thirds of Canadian families have actually seen their real income fall since 1989. That, of course, was the year when the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was implemented. Subsequent to that, there has been NAFTA. Now the Conservatives and Liberals are trying to foist the so-called security and prosperity partnership, the SPP, on Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through that entire process, none of them, not a single Liberal, not a single Conservative member of Parliament have actually looked into what has happened economically with most Canadian families. Two-thirds of Canadian families have seen a fall in real income. The middle class has lost about a week's income for every year since 1989, since the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was implemented. The lower middle class have lost about two weeks of income. The poorest of Canadians have seen a catastrophic fall in income. They have lost about a month and a half of income in real terms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, overtime hours are up about 50%. The number of Canadians working overtime is up considerably. The average Canadian worker is working about 200 hours more than before. People are working longer and longer hours for less and less pay. What has been the net result? The debt load of the average Canadian family has doubled over that period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking about is an income crisis. We talk often about the prosperity gap. It is the prosperity gulf. It is an income crisis that most Canadian families are living through. Yet Liberals and Conservatives seem to take their direction from corporate CEOs and corporate lawyers because in talking to those folks, life is rosy. They do not need any government support. They do not have to look at the deplorable situation that Canadian services such as health care and our post-secondary education system are in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deplorable income crisis is something that is very real. It means that tonight in the main streets and parks of our nation, about 300,000 Canadians will be homeless. They will be sleeping in homeless shelters, in parks and on main streets, despite how cold the Canadian winter is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Conservative government done to address the income crisis and what most Canadian families are living through? What we have seen is basically an economic update that says the priority for the government is corporate tax cuts, massive corporate tax cuts. Never have corporate tax cuts been deeper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next three or four years, we are talking about an impact of $12 billion a year in corporate tax cuts. The priority of the government is to shovel money at the corporate sector, despite the fact that the corporate sector is at its record level of profits. It makes absolutely no sense, but that is the priority that is contained within the economic statement.</div>

The Prime Minister's saying that is like the tale of the little child who was given $2 by his family to go to the store to buy milk and bread, to buy some essentials, and instead spent three-quarters of the money on candy and when he got back to his house said, “I have a quarter left over. Look how well I have done”. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has talked about the annual deficit in infrastructure. This includes making sure that waste is carried away, that communities from coast to coast to coast have clean water, that highway overpasses are not collapsing and that highways are kept in good shape, and that there are social and recreational facilities for Canadians across this country. The FCM has said that the deficit of what needs to be invested and what is actually being invested is about $18 billion a year. For the government to say there is a surplus and it is going to shovel money at the corporate sector makes absolutely no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know some of the other issues that the NDP has brought to the House. We know the Liberals have said that they are giving the Conservatives a majority in that they are not going to do anything to stop the Conservative agenda. Essentially the government is operating as if it had a majority. Let us look at some of the issues the government should have dealt with.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors have been ripped off by a bad calculation on the GIS. There is nothing to deal with that. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78613,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78613&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hamilton Mountain</A> has been raising that substantially and effectively in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives have refused to give seniors their due part. In a very real sense they have been ripping off Canada's seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Canadians with disabilities. We know that half of all of the homeless across the country, about 40% of those who go to food banks to make ends meet, are Canadians with disabilities, and yet the government has done virtually nothing to support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a crisis in homelessness that I spoke to earlier. There are 300,000 Canadians out on the streets of our nation, and yet the government does nothing except talk about the money that came from the NDP budget. Aside from that, the Conservatives have done absolutely nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are crippled by the cost of drugs and yet there is no pharmacare program, despite the fact the NDP has said that has to be a government priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has done absolutely nothing for the environment. The Liberals had a deplorable record on the environment, but at least they did not try to sabotage international meetings. That is what we are seeing now from the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all issues that need to be dealt with by the government and it has not dealt with any of them. Instead, the Conservatives' priority, very clearly announced, is that they will shovel money off the back of a truck to their friends in the corporate sector. That is their priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier there was a question from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78861,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78861&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Abbotsford</A> regarding tax cuts for working individuals. We know that the change in the bottom bracket, for example, brings a benefit of about $15 a month for the average family. This comes at a time when the income crisis means that, essentially, those families are earning about $2,000 less per year than they were earning back in 1989. That is a $15 benefit when, on the one hand, those incomes have fallen catastrophically and, on the other hand, the net impact will be an increase in service fees and user fees for the services that actually help those families. It makes no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing underfunding in the health care sector. In British Columbia where I come from Gordon Campbell brought in similar tax cuts, a few dollars a month for most families. It turned out that because of all of the increases in user fees for those families, any family earning less than $80,000 a year ended up paying more under the Gordon Campbell tax cuts than the family was paying before. Families got a few dollars off on their income tax and they had hefty, healthy hikes in the cost of the services that they depend on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the NDP is speaking against this budget update. The Liberals have capitulated. They abstain. They will let the Conservatives do anything they want, but in this corner of the House we believe that the real needs of working families need to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to finish with one final point. The NDP has the best fiscal record in the country. The Ministry of Finance is the one that told us that. It did a longitudinal study over 20 years. It compared Liberal governments, Conservative governments and NDP governments. The best fiscal managers, the ones that actually balanced the budget or had a surplus, most often were NDP governments. The ones with the worst records were the Conservatives and Liberals. The reality is they just do not know how to handle money. The only way they handle money is to shovel it off the back of a truck to the corporate sector. That is not what Canadians need and that is why we oppose this economic update.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It just strikes me as ironic to hear people talking about how great a GST cut is and how much it is supposed to help the poor. It is a consumer tax.

    </p><a name="Para827243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had good, family sustaining manufacturing jobs replaced, through the horribly irresponsible policies of the Conservatives and the Liberals before them, by part time jobs at Wal-Mart. Essentially, that means that we have more and more working poor than we have had in this country in the past. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to some indications of income and equality, the clock has been turned back to the 1930s when the CCF was born and when we fought to put in place employment insurance, pensions and medical care. Without the CCF and the NDP, Canadians would be much worse off because it is our battles that have advanced the cause and the quality of life of ordinary working families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the member notes, there is nothing in this so-called fiscal update that makes any substantive change in the lives of most Canadian working families and nothing that deals with that fundamental falling of income that has taken place over the last 20 years.</div>

    </p><a name="Para827247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from Ontario and we all remember very well the record of the Mike Harris government there. Mike Harris was the self-proclaimed tax fighter. That agenda not only took millions and millions of dollars out of communities and impoverished families in our communities, but the downloading side and the impact of those tax cuts on our municipalities left our community, the city of Hamilton, in desperate need of money for infrastructure reinvestments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a number of water and sewer main breaks and our roads are in terrible shape.

The government ought to be because it is the senior level of government and our municipalities need our help to deal with those fundamental infrastructure deficits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether my colleague could reflect on whether the same experience is true in B.C. I am not as familiar with what is happening to municipalities out there but from my perspective as an Ontarian, and, first and foremost, as a Hamiltonian, I had hoped that this mini budget would actually reinvest in our cities and give places like Hamilton an opportunity to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with infrastructure is one that is shared with Hamilton and cities across the country. What we are seeing here is absolutely irresponsible.

    </p><a name="Para827254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I spoke to the bill at second reading there was a lot of discussion on what exactly the government's direction was in how it dealt with financial planning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues today have been stressing the fact that the measures included in the bill and in the government's other economic measures are gutting the fiscal capacity of the federal government. It is gutting it by a total $190 billion over the next six years. That is money that is taken away from the government and Canadians collectively to address the problems that face our society, the needs in our communities and the important aspirations of our families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do not have that money and we take that money out of the capacity of government to respond, it is very hard to get it back, if at all possible. We need to pay attention to the direction of the government when it comes to gutting the fiscal capacity of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to pay attention to the way that surpluses have been dealt with, both by the Conservative government and by the previous Liberal government. The constant refrain of “surprise, it's bigger than we thought” and “surprise we're going to put all of that money toward the debt and the deficit”, that is not good financial planning. To take that money out of any financial planning process related to this place and to the needs of Canadians is not a responsible course of action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen it time and time again where those huge sums of money that could be helping Canadians, that could be going to meet our obligations to our neighbours and to people across the country, are taken out of that discussion and do not become part of the priorities of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real problem with how we set priorities for government spending, both with the present government and the previous Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this corner of the House, we have had some success in trying to draw back governments from making that mistake. When the Liberal government was in power, the NDP negotiated to bring an end to a corporate tax cut that was being proposed at that time. We knew that corporate tax cut would not help Canadians in the way it was proposed. We knew that it was not the way to go. We knew that it was wrong. We proposed instead that the money that would have gone to that tax cut go to important programs that would actually help Canadians: lowering student tuition fees, building affordable housing, supporting public transit projects that help the environment, and to help our neighbours around the world by ensuring that Canada was doing a little bit better in meeting its obligations on foreign aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were successful in that and now the only major money that we have seen spent on social programs in recent years is the result of our action in this corner of the House turning back that last Liberal corporate tax cut in favour of spending in those very important areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud when I walk down the street in Vancouver now and I see the new blue and grey buses that are part of the Coast Mountain bus fleet in Vancouver. I know those buses were possible because of the money that the NDP fought for and obtained in that last Liberal budget. It is making a difference in people's lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is not enough. More needs to be done in the area of public transit and in the area of housing. We know that money went some way to helping and it is being spent now by provinces across the country but we need more to do that. It is not dealing with the crisis in affordable housing and in homelessness that confronts our communities and our citizens every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that students still face high levels of student debt. We know that was only a beginning in what needs to be done in continuing efforts to address those important issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the foreign aid issue we are still nowhere near the commitments we made years ago to dedicate a certain percentage of our gross national product to ensuring assistance to people around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a record in this corner of the House of showing what we would do when confronted with corporate tax cuts, corporations with high levels of profit that do not need our assistance right now. We know that big oil and gas companies and the big banks do not need our assistance because they have sky-high profit rates and are doing very well. They do not need the kind of assistance that the Conservative government is putting forward. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those areas where spending needs to happen? One of the areas that I want to talk about is the need to deal with the levels of child poverty in Canada. Back in 1989, this place made a commitment to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. The Conservative government and Liberal governments of the day failed miserably in even approaching that commitment. In fact, child poverty has gone up in Canada over that same period of time. That was a failed process. It did not happen because nobody in the governments of the day paid attention to that commitment. It is still an issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstcall is a cross-sectoral, non-partisan coalition in British Columbia made up of 79 provincial organizations, anti-poverty and community organizations, and 25 mobilizing communities of which I am happy to say the city of Burnaby is one. Last week, Firstcall released its annual report card dealing with the issue of child poverty. Sadly, British Columbia has the worst record on child poverty in Canada. Statistics in 2005 showed that almost 21% of B.C. children lived in poverty. That is absolutely shameful in a country as wealthy as Canada and a province as prosperous as British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report card, Firstcall proposed setting targets where governments could be held accountable for reducing child poverty. We know the importance of setting those kinds of targets. We often do it in other areas but for some reason we cannot seem to bring ourselves to do it in important areas of social policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstcall is calling for a minimum 25% reduction in the child poverty rate by 2012 and a minimum 50% reduction by 2017. It has some suggestions about how that could happen and what kind of policies could deal with that. It suggested that the federal government increase the Canada child tax benefit to $5,100 per child. It said that cuts to employment insurance should be rescinded. It also said that we should be working with the provinces to provide universally accessible, affordable and high quality child care. I am proud to say that New Democrats have all of those things on our agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that the child tax benefit needs to be increased. If the Conservative government had put that taxable $100 a month toward the child tax benefit, we would be approaching that $5,100 figure. That would have put it up into the high $4,000 range, which is where it needs to be to provide significant assistance to families and children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has fought long and hard for that. Our colleague from Acadie--Bathurst has been the prime figure in terms of restoring EI. The NDP's bill to establish a national child care program would do exactly what Firstcall is calling for. We will continue to push for that because we know it will make a difference to children and families in communities in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the spokesperson on cultural issues for the NDP, the government needs to pay attention to CBC service. My colleagues from Hamilton East--Stoney Creek and Hamilton Mountain will agree with me when I say that the CBC proposal to ensure local radio programming in communities all across this country needs to go ahead. It is not an expensive program, which makes me wonder why it is not in the proposals that we have before us from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight million Canadians currently do not have access to CBC local radio programming, which is one of the most successful aspects of CBC work. Local radio programming increases the cultural life of Canada. It has brought Canadians together. It has increased the democratic participation in Canada by informing Canadians about what is happening in their communities. However, 15 communities need that kind of service, including Kitchener, London, Montreal South Shore, Barrie, Kingston, the Laurentians, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Drummondville, Red Deer, Nanaimo, Kelowna, Fort McMurray, Chiliwack, Saskatoon and Cranbrook, not to mention Hamilton. Canadians living in those places deserve to be connected in the same way that the rest of us enjoy CBC services.</div>

Municipalities are already having to look at increasing property taxes to cover the expenses that they cannot meet given the current fiscal situation. We have seen the mayor of Mississauga directly say that this was going to be necessary in her community. Other communities across the country are having to look at that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offloading onto the shoulders of municipalities, because of cutbacks at the federal government level and at the provincial government level, have been quite serious all across the country in many municipalities, including my own of Burnaby. They have had to struggle against that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior governments would have been happy to see municipalities step in and take over responsibilities that really were not in their jurisdiction. However, municipalities know, they are on the ground every single day and they know the difficulties of their citizens. They have often struggled with how to meet those commitments and how to meet those needs in their communities, but we cannot afford to let that continue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, in its recent report which all of us received in this place, points out a $123 billion infrastructure deficit that affects our communities all across this country, big and small. It points out that this is increasing, that the infrastructure deficit climbed far faster than even it had expected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own riding of Burnaby--Douglas there are a number of important infrastructure needs that are not being assisted by the federal government even when they fall in areas of federal jurisdiction. Burnaby receives a large number of immigrants and refugees each year and is one of the major settling points of immigrants and refugees in British Columbia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Burnaby, seeing the need for services to that community, proposed establishing an immigration service hub, a physical centre in the city of Burnaby where new Canadians, where immigrants and refugees could find the services that they need to access regularly without having to go into the city of Vancouver or travel all over the Lower Mainland.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something like that would be absolutely necessary to help them establish in our community and get the services they need to settle appropriately. Yet, the federal government will not participate in that program. The city found the money to offer the land, but no other level of government would step up to the plate and help that happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen it with Burnaby Lake which is an urban lake and subject to all of the pressures of being smack dab in the middle of a large urban area. It is infilling because of the silt that regularly flows into the lake. This is an important open water lake. A number of species demand and need an open water lake, and gradually it is turning into a mud flat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has had for many years an environmentally sound proposal to dredge that lake to ensure that it continues as an open water lake, to ensure that those various species can continue to live there successfully, and also to ensure that it is available for the citizens of Burnaby and the surrounding communities as a recreational place. Yet, we cannot get the money from the federal government to assist with that kind of program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government found money for a similar program to dredge Wascana Lake in a Liberal member's riding, but no, it could not find the money to assist Burnaby with that and now the Conservative government seems to be having the same difficulty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to continue to push to ensure that this important municipal infrastructure spending happens in our communities because we know how crucial it is to its success.</div>

Some additions were also made in the economic statement of October 30, 2007. I will come back to that a little later, with some comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason I rise here today is to have a closer look at the situation. It seems to me that my colleagues across the floor, the Conservatives, have really missed the boat when it comes to addressing the whole manufacturing and forestry crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this, we must also add the whole question of the employment insurance crisis. Upon reading the various elements of the government's budget contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A>, one must wonder where the extra support is for workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several months now—in fact, since the Conservatives came to power in Ottawa in January 2006—the reality has been that more and more jobs hare being lost every day, every week and every month. In the meantime, we have a Conservative government that is doing absolutely nothing to help our workers. What does this really mean? It means the families are not being supported.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These families are in crisis. The holidays are just weeks away. For several weeks now, plants have been closing one after the other. What does that mean? Lots and lots of lost jobs. Who is suffering as a result? Families. The children of these men and women who work so hard to ensure a better future for their children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember how hard I fought to get the additional five weeks of employment insurance. I practically had to get down on my knees in front of the Conservative government to make it possible for our people to benefit from supplementary assistance during very hard times, especially people who work in seasonal industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at what has happened in the past few months.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to list some of the companies that are in crisis and that are cutting hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78809,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78809&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Madawaska—Restigouche</A> and across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some examples: WHK Woven Labels in Edmundston; Atlantic Yarns in Atholville; and AbitibiBowater, a pulp and paper mill in Dalhousie. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a new disaster hit the manufacturing sector. Shermag in Edmundston and Saint-François de Madawaska announced it would be closing plants. This means lost jobs, and that is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have we been asking the Conservative government to take action? For a long, long time. Actually, we have been asking since they took power. We have been telling them to get ready and do something. Our workers must get help. Businesses must receive support in order to save our jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, cutting taxes is not necessarily the only way to support businesses. If a business is not paying taxes because it is experiencing financial difficulties, what good is a tax cut? It does not pay taxes. This does nothing for that business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must save what we have so that employees can continue to work today, tomorrow, a year from now or 10 years from now. Today, the Conservatives are showing that they would rather have a business shut down. They are saying that it is no big deal and keep telling Canadians that everything is fine.</div>

We can imagine all the other indirect jobs that will be lost. In fact, we are discussing direct jobs, more than 1,000 to date.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we help workers in the future? For one thing, we must provide immediate assistance to workers and their families. We must ensure that existing buildings and equipment continue to be used—we call that hibernation. We need to find other solutions. The Conservatives will not do that. It will be up to us, the ordinary citizens, to find solutions while the government resists taking any kind of action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we must ensure that the government provides assistance to communities. Look at Dalhousie, for example. Not just the city of Dalhousie, but all of Restigouche will suffer. Not just this area, but the entire Madawaska region will suffer because of the closing of the Shermag plants in Edmundston and Saint-François-de-Madawaska. We must be able to provide assistance to every community so they can get through the crisis. Had the Conservatives listened at the right time, we would not be at this point. </div>

    </p><a name="Para827315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to face facts. Today, in 2007, nearly 2008, we are in an unbelievable mess because of the Conservative government. Everyone knows it. Even people in Tim Hortons are starting to say so. That means things are starting to go badly for the Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP member referred to courage, but we also have to face facts. Why are we in such a mess today, in December 2007?</div>
    </p><a name="Para827317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because one fine day in November 2005, the NDP decided to support the Conservatives, who were then in opposition, in defeating the Liberal government. Today, we have a Conservative government. As we often say, the NDP should stop complaining that the Conservatives are like this or like that, because they, too, are responsible for what is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should be ashamed, and they should think twice the next time they vote and act. Because if they had not done what they did back then, the manufacturing and forestry sectors would certainly be better off now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives seriously need to redouble and even triple their efforts, because this is a human crisis that is affecting people across Canada and in my riding every day. If they go on like this—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we solved the problem of the financial crisis—what is known as the softwood lumber crisis—the Liberals had been in power for seven years. For seven years, they allowed the major forestry companies to go under. And not only are we paying the price today, but we are seeing the results. We have succeeded in saving the furniture industry, but that is all. On the other hand, the Liberals literally destroyed the major forestry companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they opposed to the $5 billion settlement paid to the forestry companies, when today, we have managed to save only the furniture industry? Given one more year, the Liberals would have bankrupted these companies and brought them to their knees, and no workers would have jobs today. </div>

    </p><a name="Para827325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Conservatives are boasting about giving $1 billion to the U.S. government and the American lobby so that they can take us to court again.

The value of the Canadian dollar is shooting up. What have they done? Nothing. Yet Ottawa has the money to help our companies save jobs, to give jobs to our workers and to help families.

It is producing 266,000 barrels a day above the targeted average. On the second of this month, the Canadian Oil Sands Trust rose 3.6% to $1.27. The oil companies are doing quite well. What these companies do not need are more tax cuts and tax subsidies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a subsidy of $1.5 billion for big oil and gas companies in the budget. On top of that, in the upcoming five years a total of $14 billion in corporate tax cuts will be given to all profitable organizations and companies. In the year 2012, we are looking at an amount of $6 billion in one year. That is a lot of money to a very profitable industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we are in the middle of a discussion in Bali about Kyoto and beyond and about greenhouse gas emissions. In Alberta there are beautiful boreal forests, wetlands and peatlands. The tar sands lie directly underneath all that. Turning the tar sands into oil is the world's most polluting and carbon intensive oil process. It drains the wetlands, diverts rivers and strips trees and vegetation from the surface. The production process emits three to five times as much greenhouse gas as conventional oil development. The tar sands development is slated to destroy an area of Canada's boreal forest the size of Florida. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May of this year 1,500 scientists, led by an international panel on climate change authors, recommended that Canada protect at least half of its 1.5 billion acres of boreal forest, and we need that. What we do not need to do is to give these companies more corporate tax cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like members to think about what we can do with $14 billion. Think about what we can do for public transit and for clean air. Last summer we had a record of 48 smog days in my hometown of Toronto. This weekend I took the subway to different places in Toronto. I was at the Bloor Street and Yonge Street subway station where millions of Torontonians pass through. It is a hub. The ceiling is falling apart and wires are hanging from it. The Toronto Transit Commission desperately needs more funding for the upkeep of its subway system. It is called a state of good repair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I waited for streetcars and buses, I looked around. The Toronto transit system is struggling. Hundreds and hundreds of people wait for streetcars on Queen Street and King Street. More riders want to take public transit, but there is not enough federal investment in it. In fact, Canada is the only G-8 country without a national transportation program. We are the only G-8 country that does not support the operating costs of a transit system. We absolutely need to invest in out public transit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to quote the mayor. A recent report states that 46% of the population of Toronto is born outside of Canada. In Vancouver that percentage is 40%, with mother tongues other than English and French. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do need a lot of settlement services, housing, support services, community centres and libraries. The mayor said recently that Toronto did not get a nickel from the federal government to support city services. What the city of Toronto is desperately looking for is support from the federal government so these services can be provided.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a lot of new immigrants and some not so new immigrants, those who have been in Canada 10, 15, 20 years, are looking to bring their parents from overseas to join them and live together. Yet the wait times in overseas visa offices, if a person wants to bring his or her loved ones to Canada, is anywhere from three, five or eight years. There is a very long wait to reunite families and that is plainly unfair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that is of great concern in my riding is post-secondary education. We notice that federal cash transfers for post-secondary education, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, have declined steadily over the past 23 years of first Liberal and then Conservative governments. In 1983 the spending of post-secondary education was .56% of GDP. By 1992-93, the spending was .41% of GDP, and it keeps dropping.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know we need at least a $4.9 billion investment to fully restore the federal share of post-secondary education funding to 1992 and 1993 levels. This is according to the Council of the Federation. This kind of funding is needed to freeze and roll back tuition fees, hire faculty, purchase equipment, reduce cost size and increase support for student services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need and what we have pushed for is doubling the investment on federal student grants, offering new grants of $1,500 to every Canadian student loan borrower and giving students a six month grace period after graduation before they begin to repay student loans. A lot of students and graduates in my constituency are desperately trying to pay their student loans. They need to develop their careers and they want to start a family. Because of the huge debt of over $30,000 a year, it is very difficult for them to get a head start.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now we waste $12 million a year paying private collection agencies to go after students for their loans. That same kind of money would be much better spent on grants and research funding for deserving students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a bill in the House, which sets out the war on drugs. The U.S. had many years of war on drugs and it did not worked. We know court diversion programs for young people will work. We know residential treatment programs will work. However, there are no residential treatment programs and no community based residential treatment programs that are planned for the long term. We know there are long waiting lists for any kind of drug treatment program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people are looking for court diversion programs, they are hardly any. A lot of community centres that do this kind of diversion work do not have the permanent and secure funding to provide these kinds of services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the budget in front of us is misdirected and unbalanced. It does not give young families anything to hope for. It does not clean our air. In fact, it gives the most polluting industry a great big corporate tax break. This is why the NDP will not support the budget.</div>

In fact, from 2001 to 2007 corporate tax cuts have lost Canadians a total of $56 billion in government revenue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we were to take 10% of that $56 billion and invest in housing, in our young people, in child care, in supporting the manufacturing industry, and in supporting green jobs such as retrofitting homes so that people can burn less and pay less? Imagine what we could do with the $56 billion. Imagine the kind of greenhouse gas reduction that we could really make happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that in the 1993 red book there was a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. By now, they have actually gone up by 30%. It is unbelievable. What the Liberals do really well is talk one line. I heard all this discussion about how we need to protect and save the manufacturing industry, yet in November, when there was a chance for us to vote, the Liberals were nowhere in sight. They abstained. They decided not to offer their opinion in the vote. What they say is completely different from what they do. That has been their record.</div>

It is revenue that has been generated by the hard-working families of this country. Over the years, many of them, of course, are the exact same hard-working families who are now living in and heading up seniors' households.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about seniors specifically because I have had the opportunity, as the NDP seniors critic, to talk to seniors right across the country. What they are telling me and what they are looking for is some investment in safe, affordable housing and public transportation, and of course my colleague just touched on that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to have access to doctors. We have all probably heard the stories about the long waiting lists in communities like mine in Hamilton. They want pharmacare, adequate nursing home standards and adequate long term care. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want lifelong learning opportunities. We almost caricature seniors as being beyond their prime when so many of them can play really important roles, for example in intergenerational learning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, what seniors are looking for is some help with their income supports. They need increases to the OAS, CPP and GIS so they can make ends meet. They have played by the rules all their lives. They have worked hard. Now all they want to be able to do is pay the bills that are arriving at their doors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government has chosen to give truckloads of cash to the oil and gas industry, we are leaving seniors at a point where they have to choose between heating and eating.</div>

More and more of them are falling into poverty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homeless in our communities want somebody to speak in the House on their behalf and to challenge the government in terms of its priorities and what it has set out in its budget, in the mini-budget that we saw come before the House, and in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A>, the bill we are speaking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell people what many of us were expecting, given what we are hearing, seeing and feeling across the country, with the unease and anxiety in people as they look anxiously and uneasily at their futures and as they are experiencing their abilities to look after themselves, to buy food, put it on table, pay the rent and look after their families as the economy evolves and globalization takes hold and the very foundation of our industrial sector gets shaken to its core.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time in this country when people could look ahead if they worked hard, made the investment and got the education they needed. They could look ahead and expect that investment of time and energy to produce progress for them. It would put them in a place where they would be able to earn a few more dollars and afford a few more things to look after their children in a different way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are now at a time in our history when that is not the case. As we cross the country and talk to people, and I have done that over the last two years to look at the very real poverty in our communities, we find that more and more people are actually anxious about where they are. They are not so much looking ahead any more. They are now beginning to look over their shoulder to see what might be there should they slip, should the rung disappear, should they lose their jobs, should their plants close, in short, should something happen over which they have absolutely no control, something that throws them into a total tailspin. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there for them? What kind of social safety net exists any more, particularly when they and others and our forefathers and foremothers worked so hard to weave a social safety net in this country, which we expected would take care of us in times of difficulty and in our old age?</div>
    </p><a name="Para827367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more we are beginning to see the edge of the fabric fray and people dropping into poverty. We have levels of poverty like we have never seen in our communities, our society and our country today. The poor themselves are a major challenge. We need to be doing something about that. We are disappointed over in this corner of the House that there was nothing to address that in the budget, in the mini-statement on the budget or in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even more important or as important is what this says about the rest of society. Thomas Walkom, in a recent article in the <i>Toronto Star</i>, said it most eloquently in my view. He said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him. As I cross the country I hear more and more people becoming very alarmed. People are experiencing that reality and people are working, getting together and doing everything they can to try to provide some support, to try to knit together with scarce resources community forces and community energy in a way that will provide support, help and assistance to those who find themselves in need. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are groups in places like St. John's, Newfoundland, where I visited last week, who are gathering to work with their government, which now has an anti-poverty strategy, to try to make sure that people have good and affordable homes to live in. There are people like those in groups in my own community who have come together to work on homelessness and put together a proposal and a plan.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, what these people tell me is that the resources they need to do this good work are scarce to begin with and are running out. They now go from month to month and year to year wondering if there is going to be anything in the budget to support them in the work they do. They are getting tired. They are getting older. They are running out of resources. Unless all levels of government come to the table, they say, the job becomes harder and harder and a point will come when it actually becomes impossible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, we in the New Democratic Party propose that the government step out with courage and conviction and begin to work together with the folks out there who are committed to this to put together a comprehensive national anti-poverty strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be in that strategy? Again, the people I have spoken to and the groups that are working out there tell me that the first and most important thing is to make sure that everybody who lives in Canada, everybody who calls Canada home, everybody who has a Canadian citizenship paper in his or her pocket, should have a decent home to live in. There should be a national housing program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not had a national housing program in this country since the late 1980s or early 1990s, when the Liberal government of 1993 decided, in its zeal to cut the deficit, to do away with the Canada assistance plan and to reduce by literally $7 billion or $8 billion the social transfer that went out to the provinces. We know what impact that had as provinces tried to come to terms with it and download to municipalities. We know what difficulty groups and municipalities then had in dealing with the downloading and what a very difficult challenge they had to live with.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people are saying is that they need a roof over their heads. If they are going to get out there, get a job, look after their families, feel good about themselves and take advantage of what little opportunity there is, they need a roof over their heads. We need a national housing program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a homelessness initiative with permanent funding, not the band-aid we saw from the previous government. We have groups out there with very little funding that are spending most of their time raising money through car washes and bottle drives to try to house the homeless in their communities. We need a real homelessness initiative with substantial money and core permanent funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also say to me that to put food on the table for people, particularly children, they need income security. We believe that we must give all children access to healthy food. We believe that we need to have support for families during the early years. We need a national child tax supplement, income security and a national child care program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need productive work for people. We need to recognize in a more meaningful way the effort that most people put in when they go to work. We need to make sure that they are making a half-decent wage so they can pay the rent themselves and buy the food they need. We need affordable child care. We need fair minimum wages. We need income security.</div>

We know that these budget arrangements are a huge giveaway to very profitable large corporations in the oil industry, the gas industry and banking.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about, and make no mistake, tax cuts, and for the most part, while the Conservatives can stand and talk about a few dollars going here and a little bit going there, at the end of the day, average Canadians are going to see a couple of bucks here and there if they are lucky. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people have any doubt, they should check and see how well the banks, the oil companies and the gas companies do in this bill, and compare that to what people in poverty in Hamilton are going to see, or any of our communities in terms of building the infrastructure so they can have the economic strength to provide those things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell members how that worked. There is a very telling point here. When the Harris government came into power in Ontario, it brought in massive tax cuts, saying that tax cuts were good for the economy because they would stimulate the economy and create jobs, people would be working and paying taxes, and at the end of the day, the government would have more revenue to do the things that it says the NDP wanted to do but there would be no money to do it. It came out with massive tax cuts in 1995, 1996, and I believe it carried on into 1997.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Canada and most of the world was just coming out of a recession from 1989. In about 1993, 1994 and 1995 the indicators were there, but it did not really take hold until about 1996, 1997 and 1998, which coincides with the Harris government coming into power.</div>

The next year the same government stood up and said “we were right again. Here are the tax cuts and here is the increase in revenue”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both facts were true. There were tax cuts and there was an increase in revenue. But it had far more to do with the overall world economy, particularly the North American economy and the U.S. picking up and generating economic activity, which then put demand on the services and products that we produced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telling point is that when, as happens in a cyclical economy, it started to edge down a bit after we had this rather strong rise going into the late 1990s, there was a bit of a turn. The finance minister, and I am not sure if it was the one that we have now or his successor, still had the same message.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened on the way to nirvana, as Conservatives saw it, was that the economy was going down. We all knew it. The indicators were there. Nobody was hiding it. It was a known fact that the economy was about to get a little bit soft. Guess what happened? I think if the government had this magical formula of tax cuts creating more income, that the more trouble the government was in the deeper the tax cuts should be because the greater the reward in terms of revenue would be. It makes sense. If it happened in good times, then it is a magic solution to grab on to in the bad times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the way it happened. The finance minister of the day postponed the tax cuts for the coming year. Why? It was because the economy and the Ontario budget could not afford it. There was no better example than a group that said tax cuts work miracles and pointed to the revenue increases and said, “see, we cut taxes and we get more money. We cut taxes and we get more money. We are incredibly smart, we are”. However, when the economy was turning down and the next round of tax cuts was ready to take hold and provide its next phase of the miracle, the provincial Conservative government postponed it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument that tax cuts alone are a saviour is so untrue. It does so much damage to this country's ability to rise to all that we can be. That is why we are so upset about this budget. It is because this bill is all about taking care of those who already have. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any argument that somehow a working stiff somewhere else in Canada is going to benefit because the gas and oil companies got a bigger tax break is a bad joke. It is deadly in some cases, when we talk about the circumstances people find themselves in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is losing thousands and thousands of jobs in Hamilton, tens of thousands of jobs in Ontario, and hundreds of thousands of jobs across Canada in our manufacturing sector alone. What is this bill going to do for that? I have no doubt we are going to hear from the Conservatives, as we have before, that the tax cuts are going to step in and solve the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the old Reagan trickle down theory. If the government takes care of the big corporations and the well off, then the little people will get the crumbs that fall down. Do members remember the trickle down theory when it came back around? It was called Reaganomics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember what everyone would say to one another at that time about the trickle down theory. People asked if they had been trickled on lately. We have had all the trickling that we need in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will stand proudly against this bill because it takes us in the wrong direction. It does not put the assets and the value that Canada has to where it will do the most good for the most people. We will continue to oppose an agenda that takes care of the very few and leaves the vast majority behind.</div>

I would like to acknowledge at the very start that this bill is not new. This idea has been around since the late 1940s, more than six decades. It is something that is needed now to move some of the economic tools forward in northern Ontario and right across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently some of this legislation was proposed by a leader of the Liberal Party in his leadership platform. We recognize the importance of taking this issue forward. There are almost 1,300 claims that have been submitted to Canada since 1973, but just a few over 500 have actually been concluded to date. We need to do much better in this regard. We need to move these forward and give some of the needed tools to the people who live on the land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be a huge benefit to many areas, a huge economic tool which can and will move the communities forward and not just the first nations communities. We cannot forget that aspect of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tribunal would provide an important vehicle in which claims could be settled in a more timely fashion. It is the right thing to do, but more important, we have to do it right. As an example, in my riding there are 41 reserves. Many of those reserves are remote and isolated and many of them have claims that this tribunal may move forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a large number of claims in the Kenora riding. I will take a moment to explain the history and why some of those have come forward. We have standard, straightforward issues such as surveying in the north. I want to explain how difficult it still is in this day to travel into northern Ontario and other parts of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these treaties were signed and claims were made, these remote sites did not receive the proper attention. There are surveying issues and information issues going back over a century. That is why a lot of these claims have come forward, because the discussion and the information on the actual treaties was not what was remembered or noted by the people who actually signed them. Some of the very simple issues and some specific claims can move forward, and then we can get on to the very complex issues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one small remote community, fly in only, the community of Wapekeka, Chief Norman Brown is dealing with a very difficult issue. His community has been held stagnant because of a provincial park that was there. For a lot of good reasons the Fawn River Provincial Park was located in northern Ontario. It protects a lot of the environmental concerns and a lot of the unique landscapes in northern Ontario. This provincial park circled the entire community. The community has done everything it can to grow, to move forward. It basically has no land opportunities because it is encircled by the park. There are no economic opportunities. There is very little hope in the community as long as the park is there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the park will be removed, but through a specific land claim the claim can be moved forward. This would give the community some hope, some actual opportunities to move things forward and to start businesses and take control of its own destiny.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that is partly settled is the Lac Seul claim. Chief Clifford Bull has had to deal with a very difficult issue for about 20 years. In 1932 a power dam at Ear Falls flooded the community. One of the three communities that existed at the time was notified and the other two were not. People returned to their homes to find that the water had risen by some three to five metres. The only visible parts of the houses were the rooftops. This claim has been going on for a long, long time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communities are now actually three separate entities which are totally cut off from each other by water. Frenchman's Head, Whitefish Bay and Kejick Bay are places that something like the specific claims tribunal to make sure that they can resolve some of the long-standing issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have had a bit of a resolution through Ontario Power Generation. They have started the process. They have access to some resources, but we really need to get to the day where all the claims can be dealt with in a timely fashion. There is a limit of $150 million. We are hoping that a lot of these issues in my riding can be dealt with through the specific claims process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kenora riding is large, I believe it is the seventh largest riding in Canada. It sees this as an economic opportunity for every community and again, not just the first nations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message delivered was a very hard sell. Basically they were told, “We made a decision, you are going to live with it, and that is it”. There were no options. The people from the communities and the chiefs who were visiting did not take that message very well. Again, it seemed to be dictating to the communities. The communities were concerned they were not going to be part of the process. Chief Warren White from the community of Whitefish Bay was very upset. He went up to the microphone and made the minister very well aware of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that was delivered over and over again was that negotiation without consultation is not how they are going to do business. The communities are not prepared to accept that. This is not how to start a process where everyone is working together so they can achieve something, make improvements and actually start to settle some of these claims. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communities all across northern Ontario and I am sure right across Canada want to be involved. They want the ability to provide input so the process works right. This is their future we are talking about. It is not simply about getting something off the books. This is about how their future is going to be planned out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed quite often in my riding and in many rural areas of Canada that the people who actually live there have a lot of the answers. They know the information. These are people from the land and they have traditional memories of some of the treaties. When we talk about setting up legislation and a tribunal, it is very important that we get this right because this is an opportunity for them to improve their lot in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do with claims from different jurisdictions? I will give an example. Grassy Narrows in my riding has a federal land claims dispute. It has a huge dispute with the provincial government over some logging practices. A lot of this holds back any economic activity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If given the chance and if the specific claims tribunal works in the proper fashion, we still have to figure out how we are going to draw federal and provincial governments into responding to these claims. Dealing with the provinces is going to be part of the challenge of this. This tribunal is designed to overcome that, but we have to make sure it actually happens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassy Narrows has a long history of difficulty. Some of the disputes, roadblocks and blockades have been in the news far too often. It is simply that people in the communities are trying to achieve what they see as handling their own future and being part of their own destiny.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the claim for the Grassy Narrows area, this harms some industry opportunities for the Kenora forest products in the area. Ailbe Prendiville has an operation there. One of the few bright spots in northern Ontario is a logging operation that actually is looking to expand. It has the opportunity to provide more jobs in northern Ontario, to provide better jobs and to build a stronger future for a faltering industry in northern Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into why the forestry industry is suffering and why it is having the difficulty it does, but there are a couple of operations that are willing to expand in northern Ontario to provide new jobs. These are all being held up by some of the land claims that are in process now. This is what I meant earlier when I talked about this being a huge economic driver that could assist northern Ontario and many other places in Canada. This is something that needs to be done right so that other opportunities can come along.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A community like Kenora has about 16,000 people. Kenora lost the mill. The mill is closed. It is actually being torn down at this point. The day it was closed there were 450 direct jobs lost in Kenora. At one point, there had been more than double that; more than 1,000 people had worked at that facility. This was a huge loss to the forestry sector. We now have a tool before us, the specific land claims tribunal, which could help speed up the process and put some confidence back in to the forestry operations in a couple of specific communities. I see that as extremely positive and an extremely good tool for all communities, not just first nations alone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another opportunity that could be helped by speeding up the claims process. For many who do not know, Red Lake is a huge gold mining area, one of the largest gold mines in North America. The mining aspect is doing very well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a post and beam plant that will employ more than 200 people directly. Its challenge is to get a committed wood supply. It has been working with the province toward that goal. Again, the settlement of some of the claims in this area may free up fibre. It may provide the opportunity for this plant to happen. For something like this to happen in forestry in an area that has been one of the hardest hit in Canada is an extremely bright light for us. We are hoping that day happens and that it will drive a lot of the future for northern Ontario.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other concern is that first nations will not be given a say in the appointment of the judges to this tribunal. This is characteristic of the government, which has been unwilling to consult and discuss with a lot of the aboriginal leaders in the communities. We know it has made some attempts but this is about consultation with everybody that will be affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we ensure the tribunal works in its proper fashion? How will we ensure the results are there to benefit the communities, not just one side of it? If the issue of the judges on the tribunal is not clear, if it is not shown to be fair and not shown to be partisan in any way, we need the appointment of the judges to be something in which everyone will have confidence. Everyone will ensure they buy into the process and that it can provide some future for the communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to why first nations have some doubts that this will actually happen. The present government scrapped the Kelowna accord, which would have changed the way it would do business. The specific land claims is a way to change the way we do business but we also need to ensure we get it right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelowna accord was one of the most comprehensive tools ever negotiated. It would have helped some of the long-standing inequities between first nations and non-first nations people. Again, similar to what the specific claims issue is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of urging from an overwhelming number of first nations people, the government decided not to implement the Kelowna accord. The government did not listen to first nations and that is my fear with the specific land claims tribunal. If we do not get the buy-in of the people, the people who will be affected by this every day, this will be a problem. There will be no confidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing the Kelowna accord would have done is that it would have put confidence back into some of the communities. If we are to get this right, we must ensure the confidence level is there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities like Muskrat Dam, North Spirit Lake and Webequie all talked about a brighter future when confidence would be put back in there. They would be part of the solution. Somebody wanted to know what they thought and what they heard. All these communities have land claims.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Gordon Anderson of Kasabonika Lake saw confidence for new housing for the future. He felt that this would be a very bright opportunity for them. Now that they are able to solve some of these claims, there will be new housing opportunities for the communities. Many of them suffer from chronic overcrowding and chronic problems for which new resources in the community would be a big help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Titus Tait from Sachigo saw the opportunities for education as most important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the members in the House would not realize how difficult it is for first nations. The communities I just mentioned are all remote sites. All they have is gravel runways and the people live literally hundreds and hundreds of kilometres from any major centre. Many students have little or no support for education or post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving some of these land claims through the specific land claims tribunal would put those resources in the hands of the communities. It would allow the communities to deal with some of the issues themselves. At this point, all they can do is go to the government with their hands out and questions. Settling some of these claims would give them the opportunity to look at their own students and to give them a brighter future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Solomon Atlookan from Fort Hope saw confidence coming back into the health care system when we solve some of these claims. I use the word “confidence” over and over again because, since the cancellation of the Kelowna accord, the communities have lacked confidence in the government. This is an opportunity, if we get this right, for the communities to have faith in the tribunal when it is set up. It goes back to ensuring we are all part of the system and the government is listening to everyone who is actually providing information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communities want the specific land claims to work but to work for them and not just the government, and that is done through consultation. It is done through listening to the communities; listening to their guidance, their leadership, their elders and the organizations that have made presentations to the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have many issues. There is one thing I think it important for the House to recognize. All the problems and difficulties that we discuss in this House when we talk about the problems faced in modern municipalities, large cities, anywhere in Canada, these first nations communities all have these same issues. However, they have a lot more to add to them. They have remote sites, cultural differences and many have language differences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those problems that everyone suffers from and struggles with and how we try to maintain a standard of life in Canada and how we try to improve the standard of life in Canada, all those things are faced by the first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chief Solomon Atlookan were able to go to the specific claims tribunal and have confidence that it works, it would make things in his community increasingly better. It would provide a quality of life that most Canadians take for granted and it would be something that he could take to his people and say that we are working together, because that is the important part.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730">(1730)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have a number of instances before us that show the government does not listen. I will now talk about the water in some of the communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many communities in my riding have water advisories on a regular basis. A lot of these have to do with the issue that the regulations are something they cannot meet coming from a remote site. Technology in the future will clean up some of these issues, technology they will be able to afford when specific land claims actually works and the tribunal is actually in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A community in my riding that has been in the news a lot recently is the Pikangikum first nation. The government's approach to problems on first nations when it has been water is that it tends to establish drinking water standards but not the resources for the communities. Again, resources are what is lacking and if the specific claims tribunal works, it is something they will have and they will be able to do themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we establish drinking water standards and do not put resources into the community, we lose the confidence of the community, we lose the ability of the people to actually get the job done, and having unsafe water does not solve any of the health care issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government created an advisory board. The problem I had with the advisory board is that it travelled across Canada and did not bother going to any of the remote sites. It did not go to where the problems were the most prevalent and where the people suffered under some of the long-standing issues. It simply did not go to where it needed to be heard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it was a government with an idea that seemed to be fine. It was going to go to the people but it did not go to the people right across Canada. It did not go to the remote sites nor did it go to any location in my riding, which has 41 reserves. That is why there is no confidence in that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not provide any infrastructure funding for the first nations to reach these legislated standards. Again, it was a great idea but the government simply did not move forward with it in a way that was practical and helpful to the communities. Communities still exist on boil water advisories and will for some time. There is no guaranteed safe drinking water, which is unacceptable in Canada right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do? We need to ensure the resources are theirs so that they can deal with some of these issues, and specific claims may move it forward in a timely manner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the water issue, the government has not consulted a great deal. The government needs to listen if we want this to works. With this important new legislation that I have touched on a number of times, I urge the government to learn from its mistakes and make consultation a priority because there are many different aspects to first nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have different first nations concerns right across Canada and I will try to explain them one by one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the urban aboriginals. People may ask why these people will be affected by the specific land claims. Many of these people are not living on reserve simply because there is no land available, no housing available and no opportunities available. They see the issue as they would be back home. If we are able to solve some of these land claims, these people from right across Canada will be able to go back to some of their home reserves. This is their desire in the end. Therefore, urban aboriginals need to be part of the equation. They must understand the situation and the people on the other side, the government, must understand these people's desires to get back home. This can all be accomplished by using the specific claims tribunal, if it is set up properly, if there is confidence in the judging and in the decisions that are being made and that it will work for the communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the first nations people who are actually on reserve. These people may be some of the most impacted because they live in small areas designed for populations of 200 to 300 but which now have populations of 2,000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the community I mentioned before, Pikangikum, is a very telling example. When the decision was coming, the people actually visited Pikangikum many decades ago when there were about 18 families. Many of them were out in the areas. When the government came to count the people, there were only six families there. A reserve was created that would basically deal with 300 to 500 people, but 2,300 to 2,500 people live on the reserve and many more have moved away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have remote end-of-the-road communities that have their own challenges. On top of all that, we have the fly-ins. We have 21 fly-in locations in my riding alone and many more right across Canada. I believe there are close to 90 in Canada right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these first nations need to be heard to ensure there is confidence in the system. They need to be assured that when they put information forward and when they go to the tribunal that the decision rendered will be fair and not a decision that will be rammed down their throat. They want it to be a decision that will allow the municipality to start moving forward. This can work and we need to make it work for their future.</div>

Two previous bills, one on international bridges and tunnels and other provisions of the act, were passed in the previous session.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Transportation Act is the legislative framework that, among other things, regulates the economic activities of the railways, in particular services and rates. While the act generally relies on market forces, there are a number of shipper protection provisions to address the potential abuse of market power by the railways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remind all members that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> is extremely important to shippers. I am sure that many of us in the House today have heard how important the bill is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members have undoubtedly heard many complaints from coast to coast about railway service and rates over the last few years. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> strengthens the shippers' provisions in the act. By doing so, it improves shippers' leverage when they negotiate with railways, which contribute to better service and lower rates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> is great news for Canada. Over time it is hoped that this will also improve the relationships between shippers and railways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to remind members that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> is the result of extensive consultations, dating back to the statutory review of the Canada Transportation Act that took place in 2000-01. This provided an opportunity for shippers to develop a very strong consensus in support of the bill. In fact, a couple of the members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, on which I sit, commented on how unique it was to see such a strong, solid consensus from an industry sector such as the shippers in this case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask members to keep this in mind during third reading debate. Shippers like the bill. They want it to be passed as soon as possible. Let us not disappoint them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is also important to railways and their investors because it gives them certainty. It gives them regulatory stability and they know this. Providing regulatory stability will improve the investment climate and facilitate investments by the railways and their networks, equipment and crews so they can maintain and even expand their operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a trading nation and railways are important to our future growth in our economy. This in turn will help shippers compete in domestic, continental and international markets. It will also facilitate the achievement of government objectives to improve the transportation gateways in corridors in western, central and eastern Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the government is doing is making this an even stronger trading nation, ensuring we have all the inventory and assets necessary to become that strong nation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked at committee stage whether Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> would cause the railways to cancel any investment plans, Mr. Cliff Mackay, president of the Railway Association of Canada, replied:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para827530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> re-balances the regulatory framework in an appropriate manner. Shippers are clearly looking forward to the new provisions. At the same time, however, there should not be a significant impact on railway investments. The bill is necessary for our future, and the government is going to pass it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the consultative process in the summer of 2006, the minister encouraged the railways to look at potential commercial solutions to address the concerns of shippers. The intention was that improved commercial mechanisms would complement amendments to the shipper provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railways discussed a commercial dispute resolution proposal with shippers. For some period of time, we heard at committee that they discussed this. Good progress was made, but discussions eventually broke down as both sides could not find a solution that was satisfactory to both sides.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is hopeful that the discussions will resume once the bill is passed and sets a framework for those. An effective commercial dispute resolution process is preferable to regulated remedies. A commercial approach would be more expeditious, less costly and less confrontational and better for long term relations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will briefly discuss the main provisions in the bill that have been endorsed by the committee.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing section 27 of the act, the agency must be satisfied that a shipper would suffer “substantial commercial harm” before granting a remedy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shippers have long objected to this test. As members can imagine, it can be quite onerous. The railways argue that this test is consistent with the commercial approach reflected throughout the act and have pointed out that based on agency decisions to date, the provision has not prevented shippers from accessing remedies. The government concurs with shippers that the substantial harm test is not required.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a serious matter for a shipper to seek a remedy under the Canada Transportation Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it can have an adverse impact on a shipper's relationship with a carrier. Many shippers across the country only have one carrier, one railroad to deal with, and this relationship is very important to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, pursuing a regulatory remedy can often be extremely expensive. For small farmers, independent operators, it is almost impossible in some instances to afford or even to launch such a discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test itself is unwarranted and is being dropped under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A>, great news for shippers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also contains a new provision that would allow shippers to complain to the agency if they were not satisfied with railway charges or the conditions associated with such charges, other than freight rates. The principal remedy for freight rates will continue to be final offer arbitration. The charges I refer to include what are often referred to as ancillary charges such as fees levied for cleaning or storing cars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new provision would also deal with such charges as well as some other charges related to the movement of traffic, such as demurrage. Demurrage is a payment incurred when a shipper takes too long to unload or load a car. Sometimes these circumstances happen as a result of something beyond their control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency will have the authority to review complaints about such charges and to order a railway to revise the charge or so stated conditions if the agency finds them to be unreasonable. These charges have become an issue with shippers over the past few years and shippers are very pleased that the Conservative government has introduced an effective measure to address them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major element of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> is the introduction of group final offer arbitration, commonly referred to as group FOA. The existing final offer arbitration provision is one of the more popular remedies with shippers. A shipper can apply for final offer arbitration if the shipper is not satisfied with the railway's freight rates or associated conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the process, the shipper and railway each submit their final offer to the arbitrator. The arbitrator must select either one or the other and is not allowed to change or modify either of the final offers. Imagine what that would lead to. It encourages the two parties to be fair and reasonable, which is most important, or else they lose the arbitration itself. The process often leads to a negotiated settlement and that would be good news as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> would allow a group of shippers to apply for final offer arbitration subject to three main conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the agency must be satisfied that the group attempted to mediate the matter with the railway first. This is to encourage a commercial solution if at all possible, and would be in the best interests of the Canadian shipping industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in addition, the matter must be common to all the shippers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they must make a joint offer, the terms of which apply to all of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of commonality in terms of both the matter and the offer is essential to group final offer arbitration. Otherwise it simply would not work and we would all be wasting our time. In this case it will be and it is again great news for shippers around the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2971497,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2971497&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-58</A>, which was reinstated as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A>, was tabled on May 30 of this year. At that time, the minister announced there would be a review of railway service. This would commence within 30 days after the bill itself has passed.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750">(1750)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that shippers strongly endorse the proposed review and look forward to it. The review will focus on solutions to railway service issues, including commercial solutions. Transport Canada officials have had some preliminary discussions with shippers on the terms of reference for this study. More consultations will take place before recommendations are submitted to the minister and before any final decision is made, again, great news for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a widespread support for Bill C<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> among all political parties. As I mentioned, the former Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2971497,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2971497&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-58</A> was tabled in the House on May 30 of this year. Second reading debate was concluded in one day, on June 14. It moved very quickly, with all party support for the most part of all clauses of the bill, before the session was prorogued.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities heard witnesses at three meetings last month. The witnesses included the minister, the railways and the shippers. We have heard from stakeholders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee heard a clear desire for the bill to be passed expeditiously without amendments. I have seen many emails and have had many phone calls from shippers across the country. They want the bill passed as quickly as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing committee was able to conclude clause-by-clause review in less than 30 minutes. The committee approved one technical amendment to clarify that the new power being given to the agency to address complaints about railway charges would not apply to freight rates. In essence, it was simply an amendment to ensure and to clarify that we would have less litigation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is extremely important to shippers from coast to coast to coast from all types of industry. They have been waiting for results since 2001. The statutory review of the act was completed in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill would also provide regulatory stability sought by the railways. This is good news for Canadians because we are a trading nation. The economy of Canadians is tightly woven with the success of our shipping from coast to coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing committee dealt with the bill very quickly. I want to personally thank all members of the standing committee for their efficient review of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now urge the House and all members to get behind the bill and to pass it as quickly as possible so Canadian shippers and manufacturers can rely on the great work of the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for having had the elegance of thought to acknowledge that this bill was presented by the government of which I was a member and which saw another reincarnation as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2971497,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2971497&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-58</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think other members of both parties are probably equally thankful that the bill has seen its way not only through this House but also through committee. Witness, of course, the fact that report stage went through without comment and that we received, to all intents and purposes, the unanimous consent of all members of this House so that the bill could receive its third and final reading, be voted upon, be sent to the Senate, and be proclaimed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would something like that happen? All members of Parliament have a special interest in ensuring that there is a rebalancing of the relationship between the railway companies and the shippers, be they large or small. More than anything else, I think that members of Parliament, at least from my party, the Liberal Party, the official opposition, has always looked for a balance in the relationship between those who need a particular service and those who provide that service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary used the words “to reintroduce balance”. I thank him for thinking in terms of what needed to be done, and that is to restructure the relationship that had started to develop in a counterproductive way between the railway companies and the shippers. He noted in establishing that interest of balance that all the shippers want this and he is probably right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who came before committee, those who lobbied him, that lobbied me, and that lobbied the Bloc, all said exactly the same thing. They all said that it was time that the relationship that has evolved between them needs to have the Government of Canada, through the agency, establish a relationship that would regenerate the competitiveness of the shipping industry and all those who buy our products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he really meant, I guess, is that without this bill we could see the competitiveness of many of our producing companies and those industries, be they agricultural, lumber, or mining, suffer at the hands of the negative impacts of the monopoly behaviour that had been established by the two monopolies in the railway industry that essentially put the shippers at their mercy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not always this way. Obviously, there have been difficulties between the supplier of the service, the railway companies, and the shippers who need that service in order to get their product to the emerging markets that require Canadian produce and commodities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened over the passage of time is that the railways, as the parliamentary secretary has indicated, have established their position of predominance over the shippers that they serve. What is the result? </div>
    </p><a name="Para827577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there has been an inconsistency in the predictability of the service required by the shippers, so that they in turn can provide for their own marketplace, a guarantee that their product will be delivered on time as prescribed by the contractual arrangement between the buyer of that commodity, usually abroad in the Pacific emerging markets, or even in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that the price that was agreed to initially would suffer as a result of the delay, the ancillary services, and the other penalties that occur as a result of the railways not providing, as agreed, the kinds of services that had been contracted. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800">(1800)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard many stories in committee, many anecdotes, that have angered the shippers and, in turn, the small producers that feed into the shipping companies. As I say, whether they are farmers or lumber companies, all of them have faced great difficulties. They could not guarantee a price because they could not guarantee a time of delivery to the markets that they wanted to penetrate or they had in fact already developed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of relationship that the railways had established and imposed, in fact, upon the very people they purported to serve, proposed to serve and for whom they had made investments to serve had turned out to be counterproductive. It is counterproductive from a Canadian point of view, from a macro Canadian interest point of view, from the point of view of a Canadian economy that needs to grow and provide assurances for all of its markets that it is capable of producing a timely product with timely delivery, and a price that is competitive worldwide. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been unable to do that and so the parliamentary secretary calls this the shippers bill. It is more important than that. It is not just a bill that is important for shippers. It is important for the competitiveness of the Canadian economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we see that there are provisions in this bill to ensure that the monopolistic behaviour of the railway companies is moderated to the point that it is capable of delivery and what Canadians, through them, must have. They must have a guarantee of service at a predetermined price and in a timely fashion that will allow for a revenue stream to come back to the shippers and producers, so that they can then access the financing they, in turn, require in order to make investments in the production of said products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not take much in terms of rocket science to appreciate that the bill is not a shippers bill. It is a bill for you, Mr. Speaker, it is a bill for all of us to ensure that which produces great wealth for Canada, that contributes to the positive side of the ledger in international trade is guaranteed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot put in jeopardy either our producers or shippers, the very people, the very production systems, the very industries that ensure that we will be able to generate wealth. We cannot put them in a precarious position and at the mercy of those who deliver their product from point A to point B.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is absolutely crucial because now we are entering into the area of the viability of Canada's infrastructure. Given the great distances between not only our people but the source of those products and commodities and the markets, we need to be able to have an infrastructure that is reliable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean simply having a road that is paved. It does not simply mean having a railway track that functions without incidents or accidents on as frequent a basis as we have seen. No, it means that we need to have that type of infrastructure function in an efficient and economic fashion that continues to regenerate the business which makes its existence mandatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do with a bill like this one? As I said earlier, it received the support of all members of Parliament in committee and, I dare say, will receive the support of all members of Parliament in the House, unless, of course, some in the NDP decide that they want to filibuster.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will receive the support of Canadians everywhere because, in effect, what will transpire is a new infrastructure of legislation to govern the mandates given to the railway companies and to the shippers as stewards of Canada's natural resource wealth, a wealth that needs to be materialized, realized and brought to fruition in foreign markets, so that Canadians can say, yes, this wealth will be distributed for the good of all citizens, one and all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the bill, as you already noted at second reading, was examined by members of the committee on your behalf very thoroughly, and I might add that, subsequent to the debate such as it was, there was no need to amend the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine, no need to amend the bill that saw its genesis in 2005 with the then Liberal administration, saw its regeneration again as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-58</A> last May, and is now again before the House as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> with not a change, not a comma, not a semicolon, not a capital at the beginning of a sentence, nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Because it has been a bill that has been thoroughly researched. The consultation has taken place with all of the stakeholders and even the railways have not objected as strenuously as one might expect from those who are compelled to do something with which they are, at least in the recent past, not familiar and that is equitable behaviour. But they see the wisdom of the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see that certain mechanisms in this bill, those clauses that ensure the balance is regenerated back between the shippers and the railway companies, are at the core of everything. When things are balanced out, everyone realizes that fairness is the basis for any relationship that develops as a result. What is fair? What is fair, of course, is that shippers contract to have their product taken from point A to a port where the railway companies will deliver the cars required or that product to be picked up at a time contracted so that everybody's expenses are diminished. That is fair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this bill says we are not going to dictate at which time, which day and under what circumstances said number of cars are going to be delivered, but if shippers contract to deliver said number of cars on said day at such and such a time, then railways must deliver and if they do not, there are commercial consequences in the appropriate court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might say, well one might say we would go to court anyway. Well, no, not when David is facing Goliath. The government has accepted the will of Parliament and we have decided no more David and Goliath relationship. We are going to ensure that the shippers are adequately protected in this unbalanced relationship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a price agreed, there shall be no changes to those prices unless companies have given at least a 30 day notice of same. We have seen this: prices subject to change without notice. That is good for those who benefit from that, but it is not good for those who project their business plan on the basis of a guaranteed price down the road. The railways have to give at least a 30 day notice that prices are going to be changed while still delivering the service which they have contracted to deliver. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sound fair. The parliamentary secretary says that it is reintroducing balance. That is a backhanded way of saying the other guys have been taking an unfair advantage of a situation. Is that being critical? It should be. What else does it say?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues from the Bloc will recall that we had some discussion about ancillary services. What are they? In one instance, the railroad said that it had six points to consider. Another one, a shipper, pointed out that there are something like 30 to 60 items that are added on to a price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our colleagues on committee said that it sounded a little bit like going in to buy a car, but after we have contracted the price the dealer says, by the way, if we want a motor it costs this much more, and if we want tires on every wheel, it costs this much more and so on. By the time we are finished, we might well be paying twice as much for the car as what we initially contracted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is transparency of cost. There is transparency of the final price for the product that is being delivered, not necessarily by the shippers, because they already have to do that with their producers and the people over at the ports where they are going to deliver the material. It is something that the railways must be able to guarantee their shippers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the minister agrees, because he put that into the bill. However, we need to make sure people understand that this is what balancing the relationship between railways and shippers is really all about. It is ensuring that no one takes undue advantage of a relationship of power that has developed over time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the ultimate beneficiaries of course will be the Canadian public and the Canadian marketplace. If nothing else, it will mean that producers will get their product to market at a time when the market thinks it is appropriate to receive it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that long ago that in another capacity I was dealing with business people from China. We talked about buying Canadian product,and in particular, agricultural product. Their complaint was not so much that the Canadian product was not of exceptional quality. They really do enjoy Canadian quality. It was not so much that the price was not right, because of course it was. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they said, “What is the use of us buying good quality at the right price if we cannot get it to our market?” If our railways cannot deliver their product to the port of Vancouver or Prince Rupert in a timely fashion, what is the purpose of them putting their ships out off the port, wasting time, costing them money and redoubling the expectation of the price they needed to pay in the first place?</div>
    </p><a name="Para827604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, it does not do them any good to buy Canadian product. They might as well look for it some place else, they said, not because the product is not any good, not because it does not get delivered to port, but because it does not get delivered when they need it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if there is one criticism about all this, it is not that the bill itself will not be capable of delivering what it purports to deliver, but it highlights the importance of having an infrastructure program that includes this relationship as well as the physical infrastructure that must be put in place and which guarantees that the fruition we expect from this bill will be brought to bear and materialize down the road. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is in the Pacific gateway, as we have come to know the development of an infrastructure for delivery outside of Canadian borders out west, whether it is an Atlantic gateway, in the event that we have minerals and other products that need to go through the Great Lakes and out through the Maritimes, or whether it is in fact the gateway at the central part of the continent through Ontario, Quebec and the Great Lakes, we need to have an extension of the bill and the principles which it tries to address through the physical infrastructure that can only result in the continued growth of the Canadian economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the bill does not punish anybody. The bill is designed to bring parties together so that the wealth of Canada, which contributes to the positive side of the foreign relations ledger in foreign trade, is an opportunity to be realized to its maximum.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para827608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all members of this party, the official opposition, will vote in support of this bill at third reading for all of those principles that I have so humbly put forward. I know that the government is going to be supportive of this. I think even my good colleagues from the Bloc are going to be delighted to support it. All other good members may, but I urge all Canadians to get behind this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember an earlier bill concerning these same railways and the noise and problems they were causing in marshalling yards. We did some constructive work on that one in committee too, and adopted very good amendments to balance the interests of railways and the residents and municipalities that surround railway facilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, even though a number of amendments improving the bill were adopted and the bill itself was passed as a result, the railways, which did not necessarily agree with the balance we wanted to restore, lobbied the Senate. In the end, the Senate cancelled the major amendments we had made. When the bill came back to the House, both the official opposition and the government capitulated to the Senate's supreme decision. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827612"></a><p>

Those were good days. I gather that is what he was dying to say, but he has not said it, because we had a really good relationship at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that at the time I said to him, yes, when we are dealing with oranges we will deal with oranges and when we are dealing with apples we will slice apples. Today we are in the business of slicing apples because we are talking about a commercial relationship between shippers/producers and railways.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other issue, we are talking about programs that had to do with the enhancement of local communities. For that, we had a different program.

I must point out, this was formerly Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2971497,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2971497&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-58</A>, before Parliament was prorogued and the bill was at second reading. Committee work has continued during this session and we are now at the third reading stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main purpose of this bill is to clarify the Canada Transportation Act and strengthen the existing provisions that protect shippers against any abuse of the commercial power of the railways. It relates mainly to western Canada's grain producers and shippers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make it clear for those who are currently watching us debate this bill, I think it is important to list the main aspects of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, one of the purposes of the bill is to remove the requirement for the Canadian Transportation Agency to be satisfied that a shipper would suffer substantial commercial harm before it grants a remedy, as it is an unwanted barrier to regulatory remedies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the bill extends final offer arbitration to groups of shippers on matters relating to rates or conditions for the movement of goods, provided the matter submitted for arbitration is common to all and the shippers make a joint offer that applies to all of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the bill allows for the suspension of any final offer arbitration process, if both parties consent to pursue mediation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the bill permits the Agency, upon complaint by a shipper, to investigate charges and conditions for incidental services and those related to the movement of traffic contained in a tariff that are of general application, and to establish new charges or terms and conditions if it finds those in the tariff to be unreasonable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the bill increases the notice period for augmentations in rates for the movement of traffic from 20 to 30 days to ensure that shippers receive adequate notice of rate increases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, the bill requires railways to publish a list of rail sidings available for grain producer car loadings and to give 60 days notice before removing such sidings from operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, the bill ensures—</div>

Indeed, the main point of this bill has to do with the disagreements between the western grain transporters and the railway companies. Although this is happening outside Quebec, the Bloc Québécois is interested in playing a constructive role and always defending the interests of those who are not treated fairly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> is an attempt to strike a better balance between the power of the railway companies and the people who produce and ship products, including grain producers, who do not own the rails and who have to get their hopper cars to destinations all over Canada. They feel oppressed by the railway companies. Thus, the purpose of this bill is to strike a balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments respond to the concerns of shippers—particularly western Canadian grain producers—about railway transportation prices and services, while also providing the railways with regulatory stability. It is time to improve the balance for grain producers, among others, who use their own railway cars. The Conservative government and the Liberals have often had the tendency of giving free reign to the market, with the result that some producers may have been exploited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various amendments also affect arbitration. The objectives of the Canada Transportation Act, prior to these amendments, required that the Canadian Transportation Agency take into account the matter of substantial commercial harm. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085450,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085450&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-8</A> proposes to remove the reference to substantial commercial harm, because there was always substantial harm when the Canadian Transportation Agency had to hear the arguments of the railway companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, those who do not own the rails lose every time. The railway companies always succeed in proving substantial commercial harm where there is none. That will now be subject to arbitration, which will be a means of settling disputes between shippers and the railways—</div>

Today, Mr. O'Brien was charged under two sections of the Criminal Code, namely sections 121 and 125. The two charges involve an offer of a federal appointment in exchange for Mr. Kilrea dropping out of the mayoral race.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not whether Mr. Kilrea accepted the offer. In fact, we know he has sworn that he turned down Mr. O'Brien's offer. The issue is whether an offer was negotiated. For the government, the issue is whether it knew about these negotiations and, if it knew, why it refused to step in to prevent them from continuing or to report these illicit discussions to the authorities.</div>

Mr. Kilrea supported him in past federal and provincial election campaigns.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an email that the minister received from Mr. Kilrea, which appears in court records, it is clear that the minister was aware that Mr. O'Brien had made such an offer. Nonetheless, what is not clear is why the minister did nothing to put a stop to those negotiations. The minister was close to both men and, once again, it seems nothing was done to put an end to the discussions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it seems the provincial police have evidence that the minister may have met with Mr. O'Brien in an Ottawa restaurant during the period in which he met with Mr. Kilrea.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been asking questions on this for months and all we have received are denials on the part of the government.

The Minister of the Environment has consistently and vehemently denied any involvement in the case to which the hon. member refers.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last week there was one of the most disgusting displays of smear and partisan attacks on a member's reputation that I have ever seen in this place.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that members opposite, whether they be in the NDP or the Liberal Party, continuously are trying to create scandals where no scandal exists, but they cannot do any damage to this government and its reputation. We have created a government in which there are no scandals and no untoward activities, and the member knows it, and he knows they are not making any headway in trying to criticize government policy, so the only thing left to the member and his party in a desperate attempt to curry favour with the general electorate is to try and smear the reputations of members on this side of the House in some sordid attempt to bring this government's reputation down, down to the level of that member.</div>

    </p><a name="Para827697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the question was about the new horizons program. I said that the Conservative government had learned nothing from the summer career placement program, because it planned on using a similar tactic for the new horizons program that would centralize decision-making somewhere other than the regional centres, which are perfectly competent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the new horizons for seniors program is a fascinating example of the propensity of governments to turn a very useful initiative into a way to centralize decision-making, which is, at best, very irritating for anyone involved.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program encourages seniors to participate in their community and offers three types of funding: for upgrading equipment, for promoting awareness among the public about elder abuse, and for helping seniors use their life experience to benefit the community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, that will meet the needs expressed by these people. In practice, however, something major is missing to enable them to take control of their own situation. In my region, there are dynamic groups of seniors, such as the Lower St. Lawrence seniors round table and 50-plus forum. These people bring a lot to the community, and they know the Service Canada officers in Rimouski. They would like to propose their own projects to people who know them, who know their community and who understand local dynamics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the government is trying to alienate seniors by making decisions far away in Montreal and Ottawa rather than close to home. Instead of working with people in their community, seniors have to go along with decisions made by people who are very far away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Canada officers in major centres have a lot of experience and they mean well, but they are not close to home and they do not understand our dynamics or our community. The government should enable competent public servants in Rimouski—people who know what is going on and who know how to hold consultations in their community—to do these things close to home to better serve our seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, it started this spring with the move to centralize the summer work experience program, and it is still happening. I would certainly like to know the real reason the government wants to distance people from the decision-making process. Why does it not trust its regional public servants, who are very competent and dedicated? Why does the government not want seniors to have access to services that really are close to home? What is the government's true motivation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para827704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I will get an answer this time without having to ask my follow-up question in English.</div>

I am thankful her for the opportunity to address the subject of the new horizons for seniors program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government takes the well-being of Canadian seniors very seriously. This is why in budget 2007 we committed $10 million per year for the expansion of this program. This new funding will provide capital assistance to non-profit organizations to help maintain programs and activities for seniors as well as assist national and regional non-profits to help reduce the incidence of elder abuse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 2004 this program has funded community based organizations for projects led by seniors. It is a grassroots approach. The purpose is to encourage older persons to continue with their invaluable contributions to society and to enhance their well-being in the community by sharing their skills, their wisdom and their experience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key principle of this program is our belief that decisions about funding for seniors should be made by people who are knowledgeable about the needs of seniors. This is why we put in place a review committee in each province and territory whose members are active in seniors and community issues</div>
    </p><a name="Para827709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial and federal representatives are normally part of these committees. These committees are responsible for setting funding priorities as well as reviewing and recommending projects for funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An essential part of their responsibilities is to ensure that funding decisions do reflect local needs. Each committee recognizes and supports unique needs of seniors in its province or territory. They help to ensure that funding decisions are fair, that they are open and that they are transparent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para827711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government partners with the Government of Quebec through a formal protocol. It ensures that our respective programs for seniors complement each other. Under this protocol Quebec's network of regional advisory committees on seniors provides a community perspective. Their input ensures that the principles of the new horizons for seniors program are respected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is consistent with that taken across the country. In this way people active in seniors issues are part of the decision making process of reviewing and recommending projects for funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year human resources and social development's Quebec region has established a dedicated team working out of one office to handle administrative functions. This practice is normally followed in other regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community engagement, such as program promotion and support to applicants, is still done by the local program staff. As a result, the Quebec region expects to maintain the community focus of program promotions but ensure better administrative quality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new horizons for seniors program helps seniors benefit from and contribute to the quality of life in their community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government takes great pride in our record of providing streamlined benefits and better government programming to Canada's seniors.</div>

During an adjournment debate, instead of expanding on a question that was sincerely raised on behalf of an important segment of the population, that is, our seniors, if the representatives of the Conservative government in this House want to give us a lesson on pride, we could play with words for some time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I had asked, which I will ask again here this evening and to which I hope to receive a response, wondered why this responsibility is not being handed over to the people who are closest to our seniors—if committees are needed, let us strike committees—people who know the field very well?</div>

She put forward Motion No. 383, which called on the government to reduce administrative costs in the old age security program and give the benefit of those savings directly to the seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government also cares deeply--we have a new word now, “cares”--about overhead and bureaucratic costs. This is one of the factors behind this decision to go the route we have gone on the issue and use a single committee comprised of community leaders and experts on seniors issues to make funding decisions, which was the member's question. It was about who makes decisions on funding issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para827721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need hundreds of employees across the country administering these programs. These decisions are not made in the minister's office. They are not centralized as the hon. member has suggested. They are made by a panel of experts in each region so that the seniors receive the greatest benefit.</div>
