	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, lead is 
a poison that can cause animals and humans to die. It certainly 
makes them sick.
<P>
	In Canada we are moving steadily to eliminate lead from 
gasoline, paints and our drinking water systems. The U.S. is 
proceeding in this direction even faster than us.
<P>
	I urge that we now move to eliminate the use of lead shot for 
hunting and lead sinkers for fishing. Non-toxic steel and 
bismuth shot is easily available. The U.S. has already banned 
lead shot for wild fowling. The only lead poisoned wildfowl 
seen down there are ours, birds that have flown from Canada.
<P>
	This is a change which will not affect hunters and anglers and 
one which will simply make our environment more healthy.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, let us just do it.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and Quebec's artistic 
community are outraged at the heartless attitude of the Minister 
of Immigration, who has denied an entry visa to Ms. Koudil, an 
Algerian filmmaker living in France.
<P>
	This woman, whose courage is an example to all those who 
dare denounce publicly the treatment of women by Muslim 
fundamentalists, particularly in Algeria, has been unjustifiably 
denied entry into Quebec and Canada. Because of her honesty 
and courage, Ms. Koudil must be given this visa so that she can 
show her film here.
<P>
	The stubbornness of Canadian authorities in this matter shows 
how subjective and arbitrary this kind of decision often is.
<P>
	In the name of women and artists, we are calling on the 
minister to intervene on behalf of Ms. Koudil, whose film 
highlights the dangers of fundamentalist oppression.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada is deep in debt and 
continuing full speed ahead with government overspending 
toward the inevitable crash into the debt wall. The government 
claims to be using innovative ways to reduce its overspending 
but it is obvious it has no idea what it is doing.
<P>
	The latest example is with the government owned VIA Rail 
system. This crown corporation receives over $800,000 a day in 
government subsidies. It was told to cut its costs but instead it 
cut its fares in half. It seems the only thing it can do well is lose 
money and now it is going to be twice as good at it. These fare 
reductions will continue until the end of May and they are 
devastating the private sector bus industry.
<P>
	Using the taxpayers' money to subsidize poorly run crown 
corporations so they can unfairly compete with Canadian 
business is not only wrong, it is idiotic.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
a great deal of pleasure today to stand and congratulate Premier 
Gary Filmon of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party on 
his third decisive victory last night. Premier Filmon captured 33 
seats, the New Democrats 22 and the Liberals only 3.
<P>
	The Manitoba provincial Liberals campaigned on a platform 
using a copycat provincial Liberal red book. I am proud to say 
that the general electorate discovered the reality of the 
provincial red book and sent them a strong message saying that 
they wanted no part of it.
<P>
	We have discovered the reality of the federal Liberal red book 
which is amounting to broken promises. This is a message to the

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in the House today to draw attention to an event that will 
take place in the city of Hamilton this weekend.
<P>
	Canada's Minister of the Environment is hosting a meeting of 
environmental ministers from the world's most industrialized 
countries, the group of seven. Also in attendance will be senior 
environmental officials from the European Commission and the 
United Nations.
<P>
	The two days of discussions will focus on how G-7 countries 
can continue to work together to improve the world's economic 
and environmental health.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the minister on her fine work as 
Minister of the Environment both in Canada and internationally.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	I am happy that the subjects under discussion will include, 
among other things, species conservation, climate change and 
international management of toxic substances. Discussion will 
also centre on how we as industrialized countries can encourage 
such organizations as the World Bank and the United Nations to 
take a more environmentally sensitive approach to 
development.
<P>
	I urge the minister to use this conference to encourage all 
countries, including Canada, to live up to the commitments 
made at the Rio conference.
<P>
	It is essential that when the leaders of the G-7 countries meet 
in Halifax this June, the concerns raised and discussed at the 
environment ministers conference this weekend are addressed.

	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Earth 
Day is an opportunity for all of us to celebrate the successes we 
have had in the environment which reminds us of the great work 
that remains.
<P>
	This past Saturday was the 25th anniversary of Earth Day. The 
students, parents and teachers of Harry R. Hamilton Elementary 
School in upper Sackville in my riding of Halifax West marked 
Earth Day in a very fitting way. With federal government 
support, they have initiated a number of very important 
environmental projects.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of joining them last Saturday morning for 
an outdoor spring cleaning. Working in rubber gloves and rubber 
boots, we removed garbage, tires, and even an old car from the 
pond behind the school. That pond will now be an excellent 
setting for those kids to learn about science and nature.
<P>
	I want to congratulate all those involved for showing the kind 
of environmental responsibility we all need to exercise.

	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since its inception in 1975 the Forum for Young 
Canadians has become an institution for moulding a national 
identity.
<P>
	For the past 20 years the forum has provided a rich and varied 
experience to approximately 10,000 young Canadians from 
across the country. Every year, 500 students from across Canada 
come to Ottawa to share their regional perceptions and 
concerns.
<P>
	I believe that after living and working with their peers from 
all parts of the country these same students return home one 
week later having learned more about themselves and each 
other, their perceptions and concerns, as well as their common 
interests and bonds. They leave the program challenged, 
inspired and ready to play a leadership role in their 
communities.
<P>
	I congratulate the students who have participated in this very 
valuable forum, the generous corporations and individuals who 
have made the work of the foundation possible, and the many 
volunteers and sponsors of the Forum for Young Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
it first came out, the federal Green Plan was an unprecedented 
environmental initiative. After gradually cutting off funding, 
the Minister of the Environment recently confirmed that the 
Green Plan was dead.
<P>
	Its replacement with a series of scattered and inconsistent 
guidelines shows that the Liberal government is giving up on the 
issue because it seems unable to set global objectives and 
propose a concerted approach.
<P>
	Creating the position of environment commissioner, whose 
mandate and powers are very restricted, can never replace a 
concrete, global policy.
<P>
	The minister is not fooling anyone by claiming that Canada is 
a world leader in environmental matters. She does not impress 
us either by proposing a so-called policy that does not even 
compensate for a dismal record.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the Commissioner of Official Languages 
told us that official bilingualism was, to all intents and purposes, 
a failure.
<P>
	Moreover, he noted in his report that even government 
departments do not meet the standards set in the Official 
Languages Act. It is obvious that the Liberal government's 
commitment is purely symbolic. The time has come to review 
this policy to better serve the people of Canada, perhaps on the 
Swedish or Belgian model.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that a language policy which leaves language and 
culture in the hands of the provinces will better serve the 
linguistic needs of each province.
<P>
	The BNA Act of 1867 ensures minority language and 
education rights are respected. I will be tabling a private 
member's motion later in this session. I hope that members in 
this House will support me in bringing a practical alternative-

	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tobacco use is one of Canada's greatest public health concerns.
<P>
	Each year tobacco causes over 40,000 preventable deaths. 
While the number of Canadian smokers has declined over the 
last 20 years, there are still 6.5 million smokers. Even more 
distressing, thousands of young people begin to smoke every 
month.
<P>
	Tobacco use is a major risk factor for stroke, heart disease, 
circulatory disease, cancer of the lungs, larynx, pancreas, 
mouth, esophagus, bladder, kidney and cervix.
<P>
	Pregnant women who smoke increase their baby's risk of 
premature birth, low birth rate, inhibited child development and 
sudden infant death syndrome.
<P>
	In Grey and Bruce counties 26 per cent of the population 
continue to smoke. As a result, the Hamilton Regional Cancer 
Centre predicts that 287 residents in my riding will die this year 
from tobacco related illnesses.

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Prince Edward-Hastings, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, tomorrow at its annual meeting in Montreal, Northern 
Telecom will be marking a century of progress. Founded in 1895 
as a small manufacturer of telephones, it has since become a 
world leader with revenues of over $12 billion.
<P>
	Today NorTel employs 21,000 Canadians. Four out of ten of 
those jobs are linked to export success. In the city of Belleville 
in my riding, close to 1,000 constituents are employed in 
NorTel's production of telecommunications equipment for use 
in over 90 countries.
<P>
	I think it is particularly important to note NorTel's continuing 
investment in Canada. Not only does it invest in R and D to 
develop networks of tomorrow, it also commits itself to 
Canada's students. Last year NorTel hired over 600 new 
graduates from Canadian universities.
<P>
	NorTel is an excellent example of the benefits that research 
and development and export success bring to Canada. I 
congratulate NorTel on its first 100 years and wish it all the best 
for the next century.

<I>Longo-Barda</I>, en route to England after competing in a race off 
the coast of Australia, was attacked by pirates near Somalia. 
They fired mortar at the ship and were prepared to hijack it when 
one of Canada's new warships, the HMCS <I>Fredericton</I> speeded 
to the rescue, responding to the crew's distress call. The would 
be thieves fled the scene at once.
<P>
	The navy officers aboard the helicopter frigate had heard the 
sailboat's mayday call en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where 
the ship is used to promote Canadian technology.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Apparently, Mr. 
Speaker, the latest constitutional position of the Liberal Party in 
Quebec was another flash in the pan. Ridiculed in Quebec and 
without governmental support in Ottawa, it fizzled out in a 
matter of hours.
<P>
	With the Martin budget and Bill C-76, the federal government 
has started to make changes in Canada that run counter to 
Quebec's traditional demands, which the Quebec Liberal Party 
has not even restated.

Speaker, tomorrow will mark Yom Hashoah, Holocaust 
Memorial Day and the 50th anniversary of the allied liberation 
of the concentration camps in Europe.
<P>
	Yom Hashoah is a day to reflect on the horrors of the 
Holocaust. It is a day to make a pledge for the future: never 
again. It is a day to rededicate ourselves to the sacred principle 
that all people are born equal regardless of race or creed.
<P>
	When racist extremism flourished in Nazi Germany, the 
Jewish people were targeted for death and six million were 
murdered. Millions of others were also killed. When the rights 
of some are attacked on the grounds of race or religion, 
ultimately the rights and freedoms of all are undermined.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party, I solemnly vow that we shall 
honour the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust by 
remaining vigilant against those who would divide us by 
promoting hatred and discrimination.

Speaker, in a document entitled <I>La souveraineté, des réponses à

a superstructure. There will be no need for a new political 
organization governed by another elected parliament. This is 
demonstrated by the increasing number of customs unions and 
free trade agreements throughout the world''.
<P>
	After listening to the comments made on Monday by the Parti 
Quebecois leader, Quebecers find it difficult to understand this 
about-face by sovereignists. Indeed, this is not just a change of 
direction, it is a complete about-face which can only lead to a 
massive pile-up on the road to separation.
<P>
	Let us not forget that we live in an extraordinary democracy 
and that changes are possible because of the flexibility of our 
Canadian political structure. That structure is based on dialogue 
and harmony. Let us work safely together to reach many new

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for the first time since the CRTC was established, 
the cabinet is about to force this independent body to change one 
of its decisions. Furthermore, this interference by the 
government will benefit a group whose main shareholders are 
friends of the government and even close relatives. In a new 
development which may have far reaching consequences, we 
heard today that, in a communication sent to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, the CRTC formally expressed its concern 
about this interference.
<P>
	I therefore want to ask the Prime Minister to tell us from his 
seat whether he refrained from taking part in any discussions in 
cabinet on this matter, since his son-in-law is one of the 
directors of Power DirecTv, a subsidiary of Power Corporation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, later this afternoon, the government intends 
to table in the House a document that will clearly set forth the 
position of the Canadian government on direct to home satellite 
services.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, this does not answer my question, and 
second, from what the minister just said, I must assume that the 
government ignored its fundamental responsibilities and 
decided to intervene directly and interfere with a CRTC decision 
on a matter that was crucial to the public interest.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister, who has remained strangely 
silent on the matter and who is the leader of the government who 
is directly concerned by the ethical aspects of the case, to tell us 
whether he would confirm that his principal adviser, Eddie 
Goldenberg, intervened directly in the matter of Power DirecTv, 
this according to the Minister of Industry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

to make, let them make them. However, I can inform the House 
that, in this particular case, although I have no personal interest 
in the matter, in order to avoid laying myself open to criticism, I 
did not take part in any discussions and, when the time came to 
discuss this matter in cabinet, I abstained, and the acting Prime 
Minister presided over the rest of the meeting.

Mr. Speaker, I must say I appreciate the fact that the Prime 
Minister rose in his seat to answer the question, so I will ask 
him another one.
<P>
	We are talking about a very important matter which requires 
clarification as a matter of course, since according to the 
government's conflict of interest guidelines, subsection 23(3): 
``A public office holder shall not accord preferential treatment 
in relation to any official matter to family members or friends or 
to organizations in which they, family members or friends, have

participate in any discussions on the subject. I did not discuss it 
with anyone, including the ministers. That is my answer. I have 
nothing further to add.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
notice sent to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the secretary 
general of the CRTC said that the federal cabinet would be 
overstepping its bounds if it went ahead with its proposal to use 
orders in council, which are too specific, too narrow and go 
much further than the general policy set out in the Broadcasting 
Act. The CRTC even believes that such orders in council could 
lead to legal action.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that, for the first time in 
history, cabinet orders in council would force the CRTC to 
reconsider its decision and that this action would constitute 
preferential treatment for Power DirecTv?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Industry answered this question 
yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Prime Minister deny that this is a clear case of favouritism, 
given that, in the CRTC's opinion, cabinet orders in council 
compromise the independence and integrity of its licensing 
process to such an extent that the government exposes itself to 
the risk of being taken to court over these retroactive orders?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the legislation allows cabinet some say concerning the 
CRTC's decisions. In the circumstances, cabinet has reviewed 
the situation and made a decision which will be made public 
later this afternoon.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week the federal debt passed the $550 billion 
mark. Yet the government's mismanagement of taxpayers' 
money continues. The latest example, TAGS, the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy with $1.9 billion committed over five years, 
is a program already headed for a $385 million shortfall. Worst 
of all, it provides little in the way of concrete results.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. How much more federal money is the government 
planning to commit to this ill designed and unsuccessful 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are facing the largest 
layoff in the history of Canada as a result of the collapse of the 
Atlantic fishery. It is the responsibility of any federal 
government that cares about the real needs of people in that 
region to respond in the most effective way possible.
<P>
	The government established a budget last year of $1.9 billion 
that would help us to reduce the core fishery down to a point 
where it is a manageable size, which the minister of fisheries is 
responsible for. We also undertook to provide a variety of means 
by which people in that fishery could secure other alternative 
means of livelihood.
<P>
	In that period of time we have provided counselling for 
upward of 25,000 people. We have over 15,000 people enrolled 
in training programs. We have a number-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The question is: How much more money? How 
much more money? Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
apparently the Reform Party does not want an answer to a very 
serious question. Perhaps most important is that the hon. 
member was probably not listening in the House as I replied 
yesterday. For thousands of individuals we restored a sense of 
hope at a time when they are facing a real calamity in their lives 
and the lives of their families.
<P>
	That is what the federal government is doing, not the 
meanspirited nit-picking of the hon. leader of the third party.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all know that TAGS is a fiscal disaster, but the most 
tragic aspect of the program is the fact that it fails the very 
people it was designed to help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11808"> 11808 </A></B>
<P>
	When TAGS was announced it was supposed to break the 
cycle of dependency. The government predicted not that 25,000 
fishery workers would be counselled but that they would be 
retrained for new jobs in new industries. Yet $40 million later 
HRD officials admit that less than 12,000 people have even 
participated in the program, that precious few have found any 
work, and that now money is being diverted from the training 
aspects of the program back into dependency support.
<P>
	How does the minister plan to change TAGS so as to produce 
the results and the hope for affected Canadians in Atlantic 
Canada about whom he professes to be so passionately 
concerned?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my first 
response, we are dealing with probably the most massive, large 
scale adjustment program ever faced by the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> It is not working.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member says: ``It is not working''. He does not know. Like 
most things, he simply does not know. He is simply making it up 
and engaging in fiction, not fact.
<P>
	We have example after example of people who have started 
their own businesses, been retrained for new occupations, have 
started projects to develop new resource conservation and have 
received mobility grants.
<P>
	I challenge the hon. member to come with me to Atlantic 
Canada to talk to the people down there to find out just how well 
we are beginning to provide an alternative option for the people 
of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister could tell me when we are going to go, I 
am perfectly willing to go.
<P>
	TAGS is part of a bigger project. It was originally billed as a 
test run for the whole human resources approach to social 
security reform. The test has been a failure. TAGS was meant to 
tie income support to training, education and retraining, and it 
has not done that. Instead it is another example of a Liberal 
social megaproject that simply does not work. It is based on 
principles that do not work.
<P>
	Has the minister learned anything-and I know this is a 
challenging question-from his disastrous social experiment? 
How will the failure of TAGS affect his overall program of 
social policy reform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing I have learned is 
that the last person in Canada to listen to about what works in 
social reform is the hon. leader of the third party.
<P>
	In response to the kind of major challenges we faced in 
developing those adjustment programs, we commissioned a 
major study by Price Waterhouse that gave us a report on 
examining where the program was working and where it was 
not. I can report to hon. members of the House that my 
department has acted on every one of the recommendations 
made in the Price Waterhouse study.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	On Monday, the Minister received an opinion from the CRTC 
concerning the cabinet's draft directives on satellite 
broadcasting. According to the CRTC, the federal government 
would be open to legal proceedings, because the cabinet's 
directives are too specific and would call into question the 
integrity of the CRTC, a quasi legal, autonomous 
license-granting body.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is 
responsible for the CRTC. Would he tell us whether he informed 
the Prime Minister of the content of the CRTC's opinion on the 
proposed directive at yesterday's cabinet meeting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

<B><A NAME="11809"> 11809 </A></B>
<P>
groundfish strategy, or TAGS, a job security program for 
tinkering, meddling bureaucrats and further that handouts do 
nothing for people. They destroy people and they destroy their 
spirit and will.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development said words to 
this effect: ``Trust us. We know what we are doing''. Now 
Atlantic Canadians have learned that this big government has 
failed them once again.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why he chose to ignore our advice 
last June and proceed with such a flawed program? If you had 
listened to us you would not be in this big mess right now.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you always to make 
your remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will tell you why we 
proceeded with the Atlantic groundfish strategy. Over 40,000 
men and women in the Atlantic region had just lost their 
livelihood. They needed help in securing enough income to keep 
their families and themselves in the basic necessities. They also 
needed to be given certain tools for retraining, for counselling, 
for new employment and for alternatives that would provide 
them over time the opportunity to find an alternative way of 
making a living.
<P>
	That is why we proceeded with the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy. That is what the groundfish strategy is doing today.
<P>
	Rather than having the Reform Party try to make a blanket 
condemnation of the noble efforts being made by all kinds of 
people in the Atlantic fishery to find a new life for themselves, 
they should join in to help, rather than trying to hinder the 
program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister claims that his program is working.
<P>
	If the minister will not listen to us, here is what some other 
people are saying. The senior director for TAGS says this about 
the training component of the program: ``Much of it has led to 
nothing and it is training for what?''. The chair of the committee 
calls it lunacy and crazy.
<P>
	Why does the minister not acknowledge that on the job 
training is many times more effective than institutional training 
and build his job creation strategies on the strengths of small 
businesses in Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had any 
understanding at all, he would realize that you have to have 
small businesses first for people to start.
<P>
	We are dealing with between 40,000 and 50,000 people whose 
families for 400 years have earned their living in the fishery. All 
of a sudden for a variety of reasons, many of which we have seen 
such as overfishing by foreign nations, it has finally come to an 
end. It is a calamity beyond the scope of anything we have faced 
before. It requires major adjustment and changes. We are doing 
our best to meet that.
<P>
	I used examples and I will repeat them for the hon. member. 
Rather than listening to press commentary about what was said, 
talk to the woman who has just received a series of new training 
programs and has started her own business as a result. Listen to 
the family in Newfoundland that has now got new people started 
in their own businesses. Talk to people who are now doing 
college education courses to find new alternatives. Listen to the 
people who are being affected by the programs, not to some 
half-baked commentary in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.

<P>
	I said that the government has given authority to me as 
minister and my officials to explore the possibility of 
purchasing secondhand submarines from the British navy.
<P>

wish the Government of Canada to purchase those submarines.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Yesterday in response to a question from the leader of the 
NDP he said that the new Canada social transfer strengthens the 
federal ability to ensure the responsibility of the provinces to 
live up to national principles. He went on to say it gives the 
continuing ability to ensure that leverage is exercised; in other 
words, blackmailing provincial governments.
<P>
	On March 31 the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said 
that the budget makes it clear that fewer strings will be attached 
to the Canada social transfer and went on to say that social 
transfer strings will be reduced and these requirements will be 
set by mutual consent.
<P>
	In the eyes of the government, does the Canada social transfer 
strengthen or weaken the ability of the federal government to 
apply federal standards in areas of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the new Canadian health 
and social transfer is the best of all possible worlds.
<P>
	It provides more flexibility for the provinces in programming. 
At the same time it ensures fundamental principles and 
standards under the act. That is a sign of very creative policy 
making, which only this government is capable of doing and 
which the Reform Party is totally incapable of understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
best of all possible worlds is apparently the ability of the 
government to talk out of both sides of its mouth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the same minister. Is the 
new Canada social transfer designed to strengthen the 
government's ability to impose federal standards, as the 
Liberals say in English, or to reinforce areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, as the Liberals say in French?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, 
we established five very important health care principles in 
order to protect the health care network throughout Canada.
<P>
	Of course, these principles will still be protected under the 
new transfer program. At the same time, we will hold 
negotiations with all the provinces to discuss the new principles 
based on a consensus among all partners. The new federalism is 
based on consensus, partnership and co-operation for the future.

question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	In his 1994 report, the auditor general gives numerous 
examples of mismanagement resulting, among other things, 
from DND's inability to assess the cost of its operations. More 
recently, we learned that the cost of the frigates was 
underestimated by nearly $2 billion, with two of the twelve 
frigates yet to be delivered.
<P>
	How can the minister maintain that the projected savings 
announced in the 1995 budget will be achieved, when the 
Auditor General's figures show that the department keeps 
miscalculating its expenditures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> First, Mr. Speaker, 
the department must realize all the savings as announced in the 
1995 budget as with 1994, simply because we have only so much 
money that floated by Parliament to the department. Therefore, 
rest assured the budget cuts that were announced will be put in 
place as they were in 1994.
<P>
	I would like to dispute what my friend opposite said when he 
talks about the problems with the Canadian frigate program. As 
with all new technological developments, and the fact that a lot 
of new integrated systems require pioneering developmental 
work with the frigate, there are teething problems. There are 
problems with getting accustomed to the new technologies.
<P>
	However, what the hon. member has conveniently forgotten to 
mention is that this project has come in about a billion dollars 
under budget.

do know about the frigate program is that it will come in at $2 
billion over budget, not $1 billion under, like the minister said.
<P>
	Since senior officials of the Department of National Defence 
recognize that the Canadian Forces can still buy all the 
equipment they need in spite of budget cuts, will the minister 
admit that his department's capital budget has been 
overestimated, that more drastic cuts should have been made 
and that no submarines should be purchased, as specified in the 
Bloc Quebecois's dissenting report?

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to these questions, it has always been looking at the 
issue of openness, accountability and transparency.
<P>
	The government has been fast tracking the cabinet directive to 
try to cover up the huge regulatory mess it has created. It is a 
mess because it does not know if it wants open competition or 
not. It is a mess because industry is opening our borders while 
heritage is closing them. The DTH fiasco demonstrates that the 
CRTC as well has outlived its purpose.
<P>
	Rather than helping a favoured few, why not implement the 
recommendations of the competition bureau to allow 
telecommunications and broadcasting free market driven 
competition?

	There is a problem with visitors' visas. A person wishing to

applications are assessed. They are assessed on a case by case 
basis. Of the nearly one million applications made worldwide, 
86 per cent are approved.
<P>
	What I said is there was something said during the interview 
that caused concern. The person making the application has 
every opportunity to provide clarification, to provide new 
information. The member says just because it was in the news it 
is what, a guarantee to do what?
<P>
	I am open to looking into this case but there has to be the new 
information, the special circumstances or the clarification 
furnished by this applicant. Otherwise people in Quebec will 
also see that somehow we treat visitor visa applications on 
whether they are artists or not. That situation cannot be allowed.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of revenue. Access to information 
documents revealed the Department of National Revenue spent 
$250,000 in order to fly bureaucrats to Victoria during the 
Commonwealth Games last August. In a written response to me 
on September 28 the minister advised me that a total of only 
$76,000 had been spent, a far cry from $250,000.
<P>
	Could the minister explain the discrepancy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have the letter the hon. member 
refers to but if I may speculate the figure given in the newspaper 
apparently refers to all the customs officers reassigned to 
Victoria and Vancouver to take care of the number of people who 
came specifically for the games, be they athletes, officials or 
tourists who were there in the regular course of events.
<P>
	There were a total of 60 people reassigned and of these there 
were some who were from my staff and from the public affairs 
office in Ottawa. If I may again toss my mind back to September 
when I wrote him that letter, the paper is not talking about the 
same group of people the letter referred to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
in my hand the letter from the minister. It states very 
specifically $76,000. I suggest the discrepancy between 
$250,000 and $76,000 is an awfully wide gulf for anyone to 
accept.
<P>
	Can the minister explain more clearly to the House and to the 
long suffering Canadian taxpayer why even $250,000 would 
have been spent on this flying back and forth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very simple to explain why we spent the 
money, to take the extra customs officers from British Colum-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11813"> 11813 </A></B>
<P>
bia, one from Yukon, three from Alberta, to put them where we 
had this sudden rush of people crossing the border.
<P>
	It must be recognized by the hon. member that Canada 
Customs is the country's first line of defence against the 
importation of drugs, weapons or terrorism from other 
countries.
<P>
	Therefore it is important for us when we are faced with a 
situation such as we had to make sure we have the people in 
place who are able to handle it. This type of flexibility is 
perfectly normal. It took place for the Calgary 1988 winter 
Olympics. It took place in the Nordic Games in northern Ontario 
a few months ago and it will take place again if we are successful 
with other bids for other games in the future.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last week, I had the opportunity to visit employment centres 
in my riding, and I noted a marked improvement in the services 
provided. At the same time, however, we know that the 
programs falling under the Department of Human Resources 
Development will inevitably be hit by the budget cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Can the minister please tell the House how his department is 
improving services to assist the unemployed in finding jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased to read 
the article in <I>Le Soleil</I> which described the new system of 
delivery that we are now introducing which will allow us to 
substantially decentralize these services to the local level. Our 
employment centres are able to work now in very close 
partnership with provincial and municipal organizations, with 
business and labour, and they will be able to share the 
responsibility of getting people back to work.
<P>
	The 11 projects in Quebec are part of a much larger 
nationwide program which involves 70 Canada employment 
centres. They are really the forerunner of a brand new design by 
which the federal government is able to deliver these programs 
much more efficiently and effectively, and in the meantime 
ensure that far more Canadians get the chance to return to a job.

question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Twenty-six years after its passage, the Official Languages 
Act is still not being evenly applied, in particular in the Ottawa 
region. According to the Official Languages Commissioner, 
French does not have equal status as a working language in the 
National Capital Region's federal government offices.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board not qualify the 
fact that 62 per cent of all francophone federal employees in 
Ottawa are hired to work exclusively in English as a complete 
and total failure of institutionalized bilingualism?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there have been a number of improvements made over 
the years. The government is dedicated to accelerating the rate 
of improvement in terms of Canadians being able to get service 
from federal institutions in the official language of their choice, 
quality services.
<P>
	We are asking all of our departments to submit action plans by 
September which will outline what programs they will 
undertake to improve levels of service. We will monitor them 
further. In March of next year we will expect a progress report. 
We will expect progress reports every six months thereafter. In 
short, we are determined to live up to our obligations under the 
Official Languages Act and its regulations.

<P>
	It has come to my attention the mileage allowance veterans

these reductions were imposed on our sick and frail veterans to

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

<P>
	With the budget announcing the elimination of the Crow 
benefit under the WGTA effective August 1, abandonment of 
branchline protection effective January 1 and full grain rate 
deregulation by the year 2000, the government has inflicted 
great damage on the global competitive position of our prairie 
farmers.
<P>
	Assuming the government would like to see agricultural 
activity continue on the prairies and given this land locked, 
underpopulated but highly productive region will likely 
continue to export the vast surpluses from production for years 
to come, why has the government not considered turning control 
of CNR, which it wants to privatize anyway, over to farmers so 
they can control at least part of the system from farm to port?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is obvious that the changes the hon. member has 
referred to are very important ones. One that we think has to be 
taken into account is the future ownership of the CNR.
<P>
	A project to commercialize CN will be made public by 
legislation presented to the House of Commons we hope 
relatively soon. Certainly there will be nothing in that 
legislation that would preclude the result the hon. member 
seeks. That is, western farmers will be invited and encouraged to 
participate in the largest single share issue in the history of this 
country.

my question is for the Minister of Public Works and government 
services.
<P>
	Since the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter program, the 
minister has made a financial agreement and settlement with the 
main contractor, called Unisys. Many of the suppliers and 
subcontractors are small Canadian companies that require their 
share of the settlement if they are to survive. What assurances 
can the minister give these suppliers that they will indeed be 
able to secure a fair portion of the $166 million settlement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Oakville-Milton for her question and commend her for the 
concerns she has for those small subcontractors in the EH-101 
helicopter deal.
<P>
	As members know, we kept our promise in the red book and 
cancelled this deal in 1993. In March 1995 a final settlement was 
reached with Unisys Canada for a total of $166 million, $98 
million of which was for work that had been completed upon the 
cancellation and $68 million for work that was in progress upon 
termination.
<P>
	The settlement agreement between Unisys and the crown 
includes a provision that a portion of the settlement will not be 
paid to Unisys until this company reaches its agreements with 
the primary subcontractors of the deal.

petition is from 150 people in the Peterborough area and other 
parts of Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners say that the paperwork surrounding Mr. 
Leonard Peltier's extradition from Canada to the United States 
was falsified by the U.S. authorities. Key witness Myrtle Poor 
Bear who signed the falsified affidavits now publicly admits 
that she lied on the paperwork as well as at the trial. The U.S. 
courts refuse to put her on the stand, labelling her as mentally 
incompetent.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that since that time various 
information has surfaced which indicates that Leonard Peltier is 
innocent but still remains in prison after 18 years.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Under the U.S. freedom of information laws it was found that 
the FBI had withheld certain evidence that would have been 
helpful in Mr. Peltier's case.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="11818"> 11818 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners request that Parliament lobby and 
advocate on behalf of Mr. Leonard Peltier to obtain a prison 
transfer to Canada.

	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to table two petitions on behalf of residents of my 
riding of Bruce-Grey.
<P>
	The first petition calls upon Parliament to oppose any 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms which provide for the inclusion 
of the phrase ``sexual orientation''.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ASSISTEDSUICIDE">ASSISTED SUICIDE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the other petition requests that Parliament ensure that present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no 
change in the law which would sanction or allow the aiding and 
abetting of suicide, active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMS">SOCIAL PROGRAMS</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to present six petitions from the 
province of British Columbia.
<P>
	The first petition deals with the issue of Canada's social 
programs. The petitioners say that along with other Canadians 
they have certain basic rights and that deep cuts to social 
programs will hurt all Canadians and will have a profoundly 
negative impact on the four million adults and children living 
below the poverty line.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore request that Parliament maintain 
and enhance Canada's social programs.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ASSISTEDSUICIDE">ASSISTED SUICIDE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the second petition signed by 308 individuals deals 
with euthanasia. They say the majority of Canadians respect the 
sanctity of human life. They request that Parliament ensure that 
the present provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada 
prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced vigorously.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the final petition deals with the issue of sexual 
orientation. The petitioners say that more than 80 per cent of 
Canadians believe that gays, lesbians and bisexuals are 
subjected to discrimination. They call upon Parliament to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to protect individuals 
from discrimination based on sexual orientation.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition signed by 54 
Canadians including three resident in my riding.
<P>
	The petitioners are calling upon Parliament to maintain the 
single desk selling monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They further request steps be taken to expand the powers of the 
wheat board so that more grains and oilseeds can be placed 
under monopoly control.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that 
has been circulated across Canada. This particular petition has 
been signed by a number of petitioners from the Surrey and 
Delta regions of British Columbia.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing a family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families who make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners pray and call upon Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families who decide to provide care in the home for preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have before me three petitions signed by members of the Peace 
River riding.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by 127 people who call upon the 
Parliament of Canada to oppose any amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and 
freedoms which provide for the inclusion of the phrase ``sexual 
orientation''.
<P>
	I agree with that petition.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the second and third petitions deal with the issue of gun control.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament not to enact any further 
firearms control legislation, regulations or orders in council. 
They are also opposed to any laws that put more restrictions or a 
prohibition on legal firearms ownership.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to present this 
petition signed by 25 petitioners. They are calling upon 
Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination 
against families who decide to provide care in the home for 
preschool children as well as for the disabled, the chronically ill

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the last 
petition which I have to present is signed by 215 citizens. They 
request that Parliament support laws which will severely punish 
all violent criminals who use weapons in the commission of a 
crime and that Parliament support new Criminal Code firearms 
control provisions which recognize and protect the rights of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational firearms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise to present five petitions bearing hundreds of signatures of 
Yellowhead constituents.
<P>
	These petitions are due largely to the efforts of Edson 
Reynolds of Evansburg. The petitioners ask Parliament to 
introduce legislation by which the criminal misuse of firearms 
would be severely punished and the right of law-abiding 
citizens to own and use firearms would be protected.

<P>
	The House resumed from April 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the 
budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am rising to participate in the debate  today, in part 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11821"> 11821 </A></B>
<P>
because of the importance of the bill. I want to put some views in 
respect of the bill on the record.
<P>
	Also I want to anticipate what I know members opposite are 
going to say in the course of their remarks. I expect that you, 
Madam Speaker, and members of the House will be treated to a 
lot of bleating and whining and shrieking this afternoon about 
the evils of time allocation.
<P>
	I want to speak briefly about the virtues of time allocation, at 
least in respect to the bill today. I certainly have had cause to 
criticize its use in the past. I want to point out today some 
relevant facts about the use of time allocation in the debate on 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have been debating this bill for four days. We debated it on 
March 30, March 31, April 3 and April 6. And there had been 
almost 16 hours of debate until today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I turn to the experience we endured in respect of Bill C-93 
during the debates in 1992 and 1993. That was another budget 
implementation bill. It implemented a budget much worse than 
the one to which Canadians have been subjected by the Minister 
of Finance. He has had to take very difficult steps in the budget, 
in part because of the dreadful budgets we endured during the 
Tory years. Members on this side of the House will remember.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I do not think anyone except the hon. member 
for Beaver River from the other side and some of the New 
Democrats will remember that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Oh, yes, the Leader of the Opposition. He 
helped to bring in these budgets. I forgot about that. I am glad 
the chief government whip reminded me of it.
<P>
	In any event, in 1992 and 1993 when we were debating Bill 
C-93, time allocation was used after eight hours and nineteen 
minutes of debate. We have already had almost double the 
debate before time allocation was used on this bill.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Beaver River was here and I 
suspect she may have even spoken. Let me just check the list. 
No, I do not see her name. She did not get to speak on that 
occasion. I am sorry she did not because I am sure she would 
have denounced the Conservative budget too.
<P>
	She should be praising this one because it is doing all the 
things she used to say the Tories did wrong. We have corrected 
the Tory errors. We are trying to make up for their blunders. She 
used to denounce them for failing to do things that we are now 
doing. I am sure that in her heart of hearts she supports this 
budget and would like to be able to vote for it today.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> She does. She does.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Except that her leader has told her she cannot, 
so she is stuck.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No free vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I will leave her out of it for the time being.
<P>
	I want to point out that we have moved time allocation in 
respect of the bill because we have had 15 hours and 40 minutes 
of debate before today. We will have the rest of today on the bill, 
all of the time allotted for Government Orders.
<P>
	I am sorry we could not get any arrangement to extend the 
time beyond that. Had we been able to get agreement pursuant to 
the rules to limit debate to a certain time, the government House 
leader in his beneficence would have given the time. We were 
prepared to do that. However there was no willingness on the 
part of the opposition to indicate when they would terminate 
debate so the government has taken the step of bringing in time 
allocation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is a reasonable and fair use of the rule. The 
hon. member from the New Democratic Party is yelling shame, 
but he is smiling at the same time. In fact he knows we are letting 
the opposition off the hook by using this because they were 
running out of people who could make any intelligent remarks 
on this bill. Virtually everyone had spoken. The well was 
running dry. By using time allocation today we are in fact 
helping the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Let us turn to their criticisms of the budget. We are getting it 
on both sides. It is worth the opposition parties hearing this. We 
have the Bloc Quebecois on the one hand saying our cuts are too 
draconian, and we have the Reform Party on the other hand 
saying the cuts do not go far enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> We are right and they are 
wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There we have it. We hear it from the hon. 
member for Simcoe Centre. He says that they are right and the 
Bloc is wrong. The thing is they are both wrong. It is the 
government that has it right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> It shows in the polls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It shows in the polls, as my friend from 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington has indicated. It 
shows in the polls and it shows in the hearts of Canadians. They 
realize the government had to take tough measures. The govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11822"> 11822 </A></B>
<P>
ment took tough measures and Canadians support their 
government in the tough measures.
<P>
	The hon. member for Simcoe Centre wags his head and says 
that somehow they are not tough enough. The hon. member for 
Bellechasse wags his head and says that they are too strong. I 
will not choose between the two extremes. We have chosen a 
reasonable path, a tough path but a fair path. That is what the 
Minister of Finance did in his budget.
<P>
	It is important, in looking at what he did, to bear in mind the 
fact that he was trying to achieve equity, fairness and a balanced 
budget. That was important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> And he failed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says that he failed. I point 
out some facts that indicate it did not fail. It was a very 
significant budget. It will be a great success.
<P>
	It takes action to reduce government spending and refocus 
activities of government on priorities and needs. The goal of the 
strategy is clear, concrete and compelling. It is to restore 
national fiscal health to Canada. In so doing it will reshape the 
role of government to build a stronger and more dynamic 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The budget will provide sustained growth for Canada and 
confidence in Canada's future. New jobs will be created as a 
result of the budget in spite of the ones that are lost, which we all 
regret. It will also allow the Canadian government to preserve 
its ability to help those in need. Major cuts in the social 
programs of the country are not contained in the budget.
<P>
	To meet the goal, the budget delivers on the commitment to 
cut the deficit to 3 per cent of the economy in two years. That 
was a red book commitment. Hon. members opposite do not like 
to hear about the red book because it upsets them. It was a 
success. It worked and it is still working.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will probably exceed it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says: ``We will probably 
exceed it''. I agree with him. I intend to refer to that later in my 
remarks. If the economic performance is stronger than the very 
prudent forecast of the minister in his budget, the deficit should 
fall even more.
<P>
	The fiscal actions taken in the budget will total $29 billion 
over the next three years, more than any budget since World War 
II. In two years program spending will be $10.4 billion lower 
than it is today.
<P>
	Just as important, the budget also changes the structure of 
how the government operates. The changes will ensure that 
spending will be restrained beyond the two-year target period so 
that the deficit will continue to fall, much to the dismay of 
Reformers, and will reflect the government's commitment to 
eliminate the deficit entirely.
<P>
	To achieve these results the budget takes fundamental action 
across government programs and operations. It implements the 
results of program review, a comprehensive examination of 
departmental spending. The government will focus on what is 
essential and the government will do it better. The budgets of 
some government departments, as hon. members know, have 
been cut in half.
<P>
	The budget also acts on the new vision of the federal 
government's role in the economy, one that includes substantial 
reductions in business subsidies. These will drop from $3.8 
billion this year to $1.5 billion by 1997-98. They are very 
substantial cuts.
<P>
	The budget reforms major transfers to the provinces, 
modernizing the federal-provincial fiscal regime and making it 
more effective, flexible and affordable. These wide ranging 
reforms will mean a smaller public service. Some 45,000 jobs 
will be eliminated as we have heard in the budget speech, but we 
will manage this difficult process with as much fairness as we 
can manage including the use of early departure and retirement 
incentives, some of which have already been announced by the 
involved ministers of the crown.
<P>
	It is also essential to be fair to the taxpayer, and the budget is 
fair to Canadian taxpayers. The tax changes are modest. They 
affect only the most wealthy. The cuts are $7 to every $1 of 
increase in tax. It is a fair budget; it is a good budget. The hon. 
members opposite should be voting for the bill.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I remind hon. members 
that debate is now 10 minutes maximum with no questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands did a desperate job 
of defending the restrictions on debate this afternoon, but there 
really is no excuse for restricting debate on such an important 
topic. It is not because the media do not think it is a hot topic any 
more but because people out there are aware of the budget and 
the problems it could produce.
<P>
	At the various public meetings I am attending people keep 
asking me: ``What did you think of that budget?'' It is almost as 
if there is this background awareness that the budget, which was 
a major anticlimax, might just come back to haunt us.
<P>
	Several weeks ago when the finance minister had his short 
meeting with Moody's bond rating service it was clear that 
Moody's went away dissatisfied with the explanation from the 
finance minister. The <I>Financial Post</I> predicted the same day that 
Canada's debt rating would be downgraded within a few days. 
As we see that is exactly what happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11823"> 11823 </A></B>
<P>
	Even when Moody's announced the downgrade the markets 
had already anticipated the news and there was very little 
reaction out there. As the lack of substance in the budget 
becomes more and more apparent, it is quite likely we will 
continue to incur ever higher interest rates to finance our 
borrowings.
<P>
	We have been lulled into a false sense of security lately by a 
dollar that seems to have risen a little in value. I even heard the 
business reporter on CTV this morning saying that our dollar 
was holding up very well. However, when we look at our 
currency against a basket of major world currencies instead of 
simply comparing it with the U.S. dollar, we find that our 
currency has continued to drop against the basket of major 
currencies.
<P>
	In an international sense we are actually losing ground quite 
rapidly. This means that price inflation is just around the corner. 
Significant price jumps have started to occur already in some 
consumer products. In my office we recently purchased a second 
laser printer. The price had jumped more than 8 per cent in six 
months. Can anyone remember when the price of electronic 
goods actually went up? Prices have been dropping for years 
now, and all of a sudden we have price increases on things like 
cameras, VCRs, vegetables, garden tools, paint and cars, almost 
everything. It is starting to look like standard Liberal economic 
policy: allow the dollar to drop and inflation comes roaring back 
in.
<P>
	The dollar dropped in the late seventies and early eighties 
from $1 to 85 cents. Inflation rose. The export sector boomed. It 
all looked very rosy. We had the appearance of prosperity while 
our deficit and debt were ballooning dramatically. 
Unfortunately the strategy is not going to work this time. We are 
a little too close to the debt wall for it to be effective.
<P>
	Because of my business background I have quite a number of 
friends who are small business people. I have taken the time to 
ask them in the last few weeks about their sales and price levels 
over the past six months. In a group that includes one of the most 
productive realtors in the country, a hardware and garden tools 
importer, a car dealer and a furniture sales company, all have 
experienced dramatic drops in sales over the past two months at 
the same time as they have experienced huge price increases 
from suppliers because of the low dollar.
<P>
	Stacey's, a large furniture manufacturer in Vancouver, 
revealed on a radio talk show last week that bankruptcies in the 
furniture industry were imminent because sales had suddenly 
dropped to levels lower than they were in the last recession. On 
the same radio talk show, bankruptcies of car dealers were being 
predicted as well.
<P>
	The hardware importer I know has had two price increases 
exceeding 15 per cent, in some cases since January, and reports 
that some retail clients have declared bankruptcy in the past 
month. Sales in this sector have dropped sharply at the same 
time as the price increases that they are trying to pass on because 
of low profit margins.
<P>
	Except for the export sector, the good news is not being passed 
on to other parts of the business sector. In the meantime there are 
those sneaky budget tax increases in place taking a bite out of 
everyone's spending power.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals and the NDP must be the only people in the 
country who think that the penalty tax on banks announced in the 
budget will not lead to higher bank service charges or loan 
charges for the average Canadian.
<P>
	Liberals and the NDP must be the only people in the country 
who think that a 1 per cent increase in corporate taxes and a 
change that forces corporations to report their income at the end 
of a calendar year will not lead to an increase in the price of 
goods.
<P>
	Liberals and the NDP must be the only people in the country 
who think that a 1.5 cent increase per litre on gasoline will not 
lead to an increase in the price of gasoline. Actually the new gas 
tax also increases the GST because GST is added on after the 
other taxes on the price of gasoline.
<P>
	Incidentally the Deputy Prime Minister said during the 
election campaign that if the GST had not gone within a year of 
the election she would resign. She has not done that yet.
<P>
	As I have said before, despite the tax increases and the token 
spending cuts, the ship of state is still going down a little bit 
slower with a smaller crew on board. That is all. In three years 
the increase in interest payments on our growing debt will 
consume every cent of savings the minister made in his budget. 
He did not go nearly far enough and he is not going fast enough.
<P>
	I mention New Zealand all the time in my speeches. It has 
shown us the way by making some pretty massive cuts in 
government spending at the same time as it lowered taxes. New 
Zealand is now expecting a budget surplus in excess of $3 
billion. It forecast $2 billion and is getting in excess of a $3 
billion surplus. It has increased spending on social programs. Its 
unemployment rate is down to 5.6 per cent.
<P>
	I cannot use props in the House but I have a full page 
advertisement from a New Zealand newspaper wherein Roger 
Douglas, the architect of a lot of New Zealand's restructuring, 
has now proposed that by the year 2000 New Zealand could have 
zero income tax.
<P>
	I am not suggesting we could follow the procedure here 
because New Zealand is going to run on a 15 per cent GST. That 
is easy to do with a consumption tax when there are no bordering 
countries. Perhaps by the year 2000 New Zealand could be 
income tax free and running on just a consumption tax. Imagine 
zero per cent income taxes. That is pretty good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11824"> 11824 </A></B>
<P>
	I repeat what I have said before. The best way to put more 
money in the hands of the poor, of families, of business, of 
everyone, is to cut spending and to cut taxes. Tax cuts and 
spending cuts make it easier for people to buy homes and 
improve their standard of living. Things work better when 
people make their own spending decisions instead of having big 
brother government make the decisions for them.
<P>
	High taxes punish those who are the most productive in our 
society. High taxes are a symptom of a government's failure, 
incompetence and inability to see the damage taxes are doing to 
society.
<P>
	The finance minister gave it his best shot and was overruled 
by what might be a socialist cabinet. I congratulate him for 
trying but I castigate him for not doing what he knew had to be 
done. He stands responsible for the massive loss of net worth 
that is now occurring for Canadians across the country who do 
not have offshore shipping companies and a multimillion dollar 
worth.
<P>
	Shame on the government. Shame on the MPs who failed their 
constituents by avoiding the truth that we cannot buy our way 
out of poverty. We have not even begun to address other very 
real problems with government programs that lead to waste and 
cheating.
<P>
	For example, I have a copy of an advertisement that appeared 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on March 4, 1995. It was sent to me by a 
constituent, Mr. George Brooks. The advertisement reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>UIC top-up positions: two festival production jobs available mid-April with 
performing arts association. Outgoing individuals with festive or event 
experience sought. Must have minimum of 21 weeks UI benefits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My constituent asks since when has UIC been a prerequisite 
for employment in Canada. Here we have blatant abuse of a 
program that is supposed to help people get retrained. Mr. 
Brooks has asked quite a good question.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Special interest groups know how to milk our system. Nothing 
was done about it in the budget.
<P>
	Look at Bombardier. The hon. member mentioned 
government grants to business. Bombardier, a tremendously 
profitable corporation, is receiving grants from the federal 
government. These grants go directly to the bottom line because 
it is a profitable company. We have no business giving grants to 
a company like Bombardier.
<P>
	I urge members to vote against the implementation of the 
1995 budget on the basis that it has failed to address government 
spending and brings us one step closer to a debt and currency 
crisis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have to wonder what the hon. member who 
has just spoken has been reading, where he gets his information 
and why he is referring to what he  believes to be a currency 
crisis or something like that. It is that kind of irresponsible talk 
on the part of hon. members which could do damage to the 
economy of this country.
<P>
	Luckily for all of us, and I will put it as kindly as I can, very 
few people, if any, would believe what the hon. member has just 
said. That is why it likely will not do any damage. I could put it a 
bit less kindly but I will not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The budget tabled in this House on February 27 by the hon. 
Minister of Finance provides for the most stringent measures 
ever adopted by any government in the last 50 years. During the 
last election campaign, we promised the Canadian people in the 
red book that we would reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 
1996-97. That is what we are going to do. Not only that, but we 
will probably do more: we will reduce the deficit even more 
vigorously than we announced.
<P>
	Second, as you know, the deficit will be down to 1.7 per cent 
of GDP the following year and, who knows, Canada may even 
have a balanced budget one or two years later.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party have managed to do in a few years 
what the Tory government was never able to do during its nine 
years in office. During those nine years, Tory ministers made 
annual fiscal projections about Canada's deficit. Not once did 
the Tory government ever meet its objectives.
<P>
	We have brought down two budgets. After the first budget, we 
not only met our objective, we exceeded it. Of course, the 
second budget was tabled only a few weeks ago, on February 27 
to be exact, and we are still putting in place the measures needed 
to meet requirements.
<P>
	Total savings over the next three years will be $29 billion: $5 
billion in 1995-96, $10.6 billion in 1996-97 and $13.3 billion in 
1997-98. Reform members just told us that no money would be 
saved. That could not be further from the truth.
<P>
	Take a good look at some of the cuts that were made. We will 
have reductions, in departmental budgets for example, totalling 
$3.9 billion in 1995-96, $5.9 billion in 1996-97 and $7.2 billion 
in 1997-98. The public service will be reduced by some 45,000 
positions. Of course, as a member of the party elected in the 
National Capital Region, I am not thrilled to see some of my 
constituents lose their jobs. But if we had not taken these harsh 
measures, that will work and have indeed worked so far, we 
would be much worse off in the future.
<P>
	Subsidies to business will be reduced by some 60 per cent. 
That is a major reduction.

	Only major banks are hit with tax hikes. Other businesses 
were almost all spared, except, of course, for the fuel tax, which 
increased by 1.5 cents per litre. That is the only new tax that will 
affect most of my constituents, generally speaking.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some Bloc Quebecois members say that this budget is way too 
severe or something to that effect. Members of the Reform Party 
say it is not severe enough. Could it be that these two groups are 
at one extreme and the other? Could it be that the middle ground 
is what is reasonable? Could it be that the middle ground is the 
belief of Canadians and also the program on which we were 
elected? I say it is so and it is not just me. Let me read what some 
other Canadians have said.
<P>
	Here is what Jayson Myers of the Canadian Manufacturers' 
Association said: ``I am impressed. I applaud the minister for 
what he has done''. That is a quote from this business leader. 
Reform Party members pretend they know what is good for 
business. Let us listen to another one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``This is a good budget'', said Ghislain Dufour, president of 
the Conseil du patronat du Québec. Again, this is from someone 
who ought to know what he is talking about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This statement is by Fred Ketchen, chairman of the board of 
the Toronto Stock Exchange, probably not a bleeding heart 
socialist. He says: ``A responsible, a fair, a realistic and even a 
humane budget''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Any grants?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I say to members across the way that grants to 
businesses have been cut by 60 per cent. Of course they probably 
were not listening, they never do.
<P>
	Here is another quote: ``It is a good budget on several fronts''. 
This was stated by Peter Wolford of the Retail Council of 
Canada. The Retail Council of Canada sure does not get any 
grants. Let us listen to another one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Michel Audet, president of the Province of Quebec Chamber 
of Commerce said: ``This is a real budget based on concrete 
measures''. Now listen to this: an economist with Nesbitt 
Burns-since the members opposite want to hear from the 
financial sector-said: ``This is a great budget and not just a 
smoke screen''. That person added that this was a realistic 
budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is what Lloyd Atkinson of MT Associates said: ``This is 
one of the few budgets I have seen in a very long time where the 
promise was matched by the reality''. That is us. We made 
commitments to the people of Canada in the red book and we are 
going to live up to those commitments. Whether those 
commitments are for  gun control, for restoring the financial 
integrity of this country, or for good government and sound and 
frugal management, all of those things will be delivered because 
that is what we said we would do. In fact, that is what we are 
delivering to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> What about the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Some members are asking us about the GST. 
We are well on our way to correcting all of the things we want to. 
We were only elected 18 months ago. Our program is for a five 
year mandate and we will deliver. In our second mandate we will 
have another red book and we will deliver again. In our third 
mandate we will do the same thing, and so on. We intend to 
provide good government in the short, medium and long term 
for the people of Canada. The people of Canada know this and 
will recognize this in the next election campaign in 1998 or 
whenever it occurs.
<P>
	While we are talking about election campaigns, Bobby Rae in 
our own province of Ontario is probably going to call an election 
within a few days. His mandate has completely expired. He tried 
to launch an attack against the budget until he realized that most, 
if not all, Canadians agreed with the budget except for him. Of 
course, he was unable to use the budget to launch his campaign. 
His left wing agenda is not going anywhere because that is not 
what the people want.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Neither will the common nonsense revolution of Mike Harris 
in Ontario. I am sorry, the common sense revolution as he calls it 
is not going to fly anywhere because again there are the two 
extremes like we see across the way.
<P>
	The people of Ontario will also do the right thing. They will 
elect Lyn McLeod and a very good government for the province 
of Ontario, such as we are delivering to the people of Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois decided to fight Bill C-76 tooth and nail. 
Basic reasons motivate us to keep this promise, for example, 
fairness. All too often, the budget hits the middle class and the 
needy instead of addressing inequities within the tax system.
<P>
	The government has refused to review the tax system, despite 
the Bloc Quebecois' repeated requests over the past year and a 
half. In addition, the current budget cuts do not target 
unnecessary or extravagant spending, such as the purchase of 
furniture for the fisheries minister's office. No, they hit the 
neediest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11826"> 11826 </A></B>
<P>
	Another example is the army. The Bloc Quebecois 
recommended cutting the Minister of National Defence's 
budget, but only targeted unnecessary spending or spending in 
non-essential areas. For example, Operation William Tell, $7 
million; the lavish fishing trips to the tune of $1.2 million; the 
number of generals, their assistants and retinues of support 
staff; mansions for high-ranking officers; the Reserves, which 
cost us some $532 million but have no specific mission, 
according to several generals.
<P>
	Instead, with Bill C-76, the government hits the neediest, 
widows, orphans, and veterans, whose average age is 73 years.
<P>
	Bill C-76 hits three acts which are administered by Veterans 
Affairs. The seven clauses of the bill which affect these three 
acts all cut benefits and allowances.
<P>
	Clause 42 will have the effect of gradually phasing out 
education assistance benefits for the children of deceased 
veterans. In fact, clause 42 amends the Children of Deceased 
Veterans Education Assistance Act. This amendment initiates 
the gradual phasing out of a veterans benefit that provides the 
children of deceased veterans with the assistance they need to 
continue their education. With a few exceptions, the 85 students 
now receiving these benefits are the children of deceased 
military personnel who participated in Canadian peacekeeping 
missions. Students who were receiving the benefit on the day the 
budget was tabled will continue to receive it under this 
legislation but the department will not accept new applications.
<P>
	Clauses 68 to 72, inclusive, amend the War Veterans 
Allowance Act by terminating the payment of allowances to 
allied veterans of resistance groups. As of September 1, 1995 or 
within two months after Bill C-76 receives royal assent, 
whichever comes later. The same provision will also initiate the 
gradual phasing out of allowances payable to allied veterans in 
uniform who immigrated to Canada at the end of their service 
and resided in Canada for at least 10 years before applying for 
veterans allowance.
<P>
	Bill C-76 will terminate payment of allowances to about 
3,000 veterans. Payments will also be terminated in the case of 
1,000 veterans of resistance groups whose old age security and 
Canada Pension Plan benefits raise their incomes just above the 
threshold below which they would be entitled to certain health 
care benefits. The provinces will inherit this new set of clients, 
two thirds of whom are Quebecers.
<P>
	Clause 73<I>(a)</I> would terminate compensation for loss of 
income in the case of veterans who are required to appear before 
a review board.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Clause 73<I>(b)</I> would also do away with compensation for 
income loss and includes other restrictions on travel and living 
expenses occasioned by a medical examination required by the 
minister. We oppose this loss of benefits  for veterans. Society's 
disadvantaged-seniors, widows and children-are being 
attacked.
<P>
	Let us look at a specific example: a woman in Montreal, a 
widow, who has just received a notice in the mail. The director 
general of veterans' benefits at Veterans Affairs Canada, Doris 
Boulet, is advising her that she will lose all the assistance she 
has been receiving for a number of years. Under the provisions 
proposed in Bill C-76, this woman will lose on a number of 
counts. First, she will lose her allowance. Second, she will no 
longer enjoy the related benefits she received from Veterans 
Affairs Canada, including her Blue Cross identity card. Third, 
she will no longer have access to veterans' independence 
programs, nor, fourth, to Veterans Affairs Canada contributions 
to long term health care. In short, she is being abandoned.
<P>
	The letter tells her to act quickly to find other sources of 
financial and health care assistance. It reminds her of existing 
programs: federal government programs, such as old age 
security and the guaranteed income supplement, and provincial 
government programs, such as social assistance and health care 
plans. She is advised that these are her options to help her 
replace the financial assistance and the other benefits she will no 
longer enjoy following adoption of Bill C-76.
<P>
	In fact, the need of that woman is recognized, but she is 
simply referred to other federal and provincial public services. 
This is a good example of duplication. That woman is told that 
she can get help from both the federal and provincial levels. Yet, 
as I recall, veterans affairs come under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Here is another example. The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot learned from Branch No. 2 of the 
Royal Canadian Legion that the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue 
hospital is increasing the monthly rate for its rooms from $547 
to $704. This increase of 28 per cent brings to 198 per cent the 
total increase for these veterans since 1990. Veterans are 
offended, hurt and humiliated by such off-hand treatment on the 
part of a country they paid to protect. Why penalize these 
veterans by offloading onto them the financial burden related to 
the treatment of injuries which they suffered while defending 
our country? There are many other places cuts could have been 
made.
<P>
	If I had suggested that the responsibility of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs should be decentralized and delegated to the 
provinces to ensure greater efficiency, federalists would 
immediately have objected, on the grounds that this is an 
exclusive federal jurisdiction. Bill C-76 leads us to one 
conclusion: the federal is no longer able to meet its 
responsibilities. Why not decentralize by delegating to the 
provinces responsibilities as well as tax points?
<P>
	The federal system is obsolete. We need autonomous 
provinces which would give to the federal government, or to 
another economic and political union, a mandate and a budget to 
manage certain joint responsibilities. In short,  the Bloc is 
opposed to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11827"> 11827 </A></B>
<P>
loss of these benefits for veterans. The poor, the elderly, widows 
and children are too often the ones who are targeted.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Ottawa West-Public service of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to bring some reality to the fact 
that the Canadian public is in tune with and in favour of the 
recent budget.
<P>
	At a recent meeting in Haliburton I had the pleasure of 
speaking to a group from the chambers of commerce from 
Haliburton to the Quebec border. Most of them are managers, 
some operate chambers of commerce, are CEOs and so forth. 
They agreed that for the first time since the 1940s there was 
actually a budget cut, that it was not just a freeze, it was not 
something that would be taken off at the next election, it was not 
something that was going to change. It was actually an alternate 
course the government has decided to embark on. They 
applauded that.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In researching the budget in order to speak to the chamber of 
commerce and find something to talk about that I thought would 
be of interest to them, I did look at the reduction of business 
subsidies. These are dear to most of our hearts. We all believe 
that businesses should not be financed by federal governments. 
We have talked about that many times.
<P>
	A key principle of the 1995 budget, as the Minister of Finance 
said, was to redesign the role of government in the economy to 
fit the size of the pocketbook and the priorities of our people. 
The decision dramatically reduces subsidies to businesses and 
shows how that principle is at work.
<P>
	The simple fact is that subsidies often did more harm to 
businesses than help. It is a problem business leaders 
themselves have often pointed to. This was confirmed in the 
1994 OECD job studies, which said that subsidies tend to 
operate in exactly the opposite way from what is needed: they 
slow rather than stimulate adjustment, they discourage rather 
than encourage innovation, and they tend to become permanent.
<P>
	That is why the budget cuts business subsidies by 60 per cent, 
from $3.8 billion last year to $1.5 billion by 1997-98. Areas 
where subsidies will drop sharply include agriculture and 
transportation. Again, we can no longer afford subsidies that 
were designed decades ago and that today are actually 
undercutting adaptation, diversification, and competitiveness.
<P>
	Western Grain Transportation Act subsidies are being 
eliminated, for a savings of $2.6 billion over five years. But 
because of the scope of this change there will be transition 
measures. For example, we will make a one-time payment of 
$1.6 billion to prairie farmer landowners and invest a further 
$300 million to help establish a more efficient grain handling 
and transportation system.
<P>
	As well, in line with the recent decision of federal and 
provincial agriculture ministers, we will develop a core national 
whole farm package. This shared cost program will replace 
current programs based on individual commodities. This will 
encourage innovation and diversification while producing a 30 
per cent reduction in federal contributions to agricultural safety 
nets.
<P>
	The Atlantic freight subsidies will also be eliminated, for 
five-year savings of $500 million. This again will be balanced 
by a five-year transition program, including helping to 
modernize the highway system in Atlantic Canada and eastern 
Quebec.
<P>
	Of course our cuts to subsidies extend far beyond agriculture 
and transportation. At Industry Canada subsidies will fall by 
half, from $525 million in 1994-95 to $264 million in three 
years. Remaining spending will focus on initiatives in high 
growth sectors and in partnerships with the private sector.
<P>
	A new role for the regional development agencies will see 
them focusing on small and medium sized enterprises. This 
assistance will rely on loans and repayable contributions rather 
than direct subsidies. As a result, subsidies from these agencies, 
the western diversification, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development for Quebec, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency, will drop from $700 million to $234 million.
<P>
	Subsidies to cultural industries are also being reduced. This 
includes an eight per cent reduction in the postal subsidy, which 
reduces mailing costs for certain books and magazines.
<P>
	As well, we are eliminating the Public Utilities Income Tax 
Transfer Act, which returns to provinces the taxes paid by 
privately owned utilities. As a result, major energy subsidies 
will virtually disappear, dropping from $410 million now to $8 
million.
<P>
	These subsidy cuts are vital components in restoring Canada's 
fiscal health. We also recognize that there are times and places 
where governments can and should assist the private sector in 
today's fast changing global environment. For example, the 
government will continue to play an appropriate role in 
supporting exports for companies in sectors facing intense 
international competition.

	The government will be working with Canada's banks 
between now and the fall to elaborate meaningful benchmarks 
regarding small business lending.
<P>
	A survey in my riding provided overwhelming support for the 
budget. In fact most would have gone further. Eighty per cent 
approved the cuts made and are looking for Canada to live 
within the fiscal constraints of the reality of our income.
<P>
	The results of my survey include to this date 1,167 people as 
of yesterday. One of the questions was: Do you agree with the 
government department spending cuts announced in the 1995 
budget? That was a very simple question. The response was no, 
18 per cent; yes, 73.6 per cent.
<P>
	Do you believe the government spending cuts went too far? 
Yes, 8.7 per cent; no, 83.9 per cent. Do you believe that the 
government's spending cuts did not go far enough? Yes, 70 per 
cent; no, 19.6 per cent. Do you support the proposed changes to 
MPs' pensions? The survey indicated what those changes were. 
Yes, 90.9 per cent.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is that not interesting?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> I wonder about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Is that not interesting? They support them. No, 
6.8 per cent.
<P>
	The other one I really liked: Do you believe that your member 
of Parliament should opt out of the pension program provided 
for members of Parliament? Yes, 28 per cent; no, 82 per cent.
<P>
	What are the people of Canada saying about the budget? They 
are saying that they support it. What are they saying about 
members' pension plans? They are saying that they support 
those cuts.
<P>
	So the doom and gloom from across the way is just that, doom 
and gloom. I am not sorry we have taken the Reform agenda 
away from them. It does not bother me at all.
<P>
	There are 205 rookies in Parliament who came here to make a 
difference. This budget made a difference. The Liberal Party 
made a difference, and we will continue to provide good 
government for Canadian people, which is what they asked for 
and what they elected us for and what we are doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to rise today to speak against Bill C-76, the 
budget implementation act.
<P>
	I would like to make a couple of comments before I get into 
my presentation. I just cannot help but do this.
<P>
	I was interested when the government whip in his presentation 
was making all those quotes about what people said about this 
magnificent government budget. One quote that he apparently 
forgot was the very important quote from Moody's. The quote 
from Moody's of course was: &quot;This budget is too little, too late, 
and unrealistic.&quot; It is going to cost all Canadian taxpayers 
millions if not billions of dollars because Moody's did give that 
verdict on the budget.
<P>
	I was also interested in the survey results just quoted by the 
member for Victoria-Haliburton, where his constituents said 
that they supported the budget, that they supported the cuts. 
They want cuts. The very next question was that the cuts did not 
go far enough. That is what his people responded to, and that is 
what the Canadian people are saying in responding to the 
budget. It made some cuts. They were not deep enough. They did 
not go far enough.
<P>
	I guess it is appropriate to be talking about the budget today 
because today marks a milestone. The debt passed $550 billion 
today, not a milestone we can be very proud of. In fact we should 
all be ashamed of it.
<P>
	The word guts is not a word I use, but it was used by the Prime 
Minister the other day in responding to a question in this House. 
I am going to use it today in suggesting that this budget lacked 
guts. It did not do the things that have to be done. The courage 
was not there to do it. What is more, the budget lacked vision.
<P>
	We have wasted a year and a half. We had our first budget and 
now we have come up with the second stage of a two-part budget 
that does nothing to address the most serious problem we have in 
this country. In that wasted year and a half, what has happened to 
the debt? The debt has gone from $490 billion to just over $550 
billion. Is that an accomplishment? I do not think so.
<P>
	The message a year ago in the budget was don't worry, be 
happy. Because of that, we are $60 billion deeper in debt. Think 
about that first budget. It did not help the situation; it aggravated 
it. It brought out the much heralded infrastructure program: $6 
billion to buy your way to prosperity. It is the old shell game. 
Two for one. What a deal. ``We will give you one, and you get 
two for one''. The same taxpayer is being bribed with his own 
money.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Why did the member say it was a good program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> The government realized the 
infrastructure program was not good. It has now been extended 
supposedly because the municipalities have been asking for it, 
but that was not stated in the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11829"> 11829 </A></B>
<P>
	Unbelievably we reduced tobacco taxes that first year. Here 
we are with our backs to the wall, in debt up to our eyeballs 
and we gave away what was admitted at the time to be about 
$300 million. The government did not understand the 
seriousness of the problem. We gave away $300 million. That 
does not even begin to touch the health costs implicit in 
encouraging people to start smoking again by reducing the 
taxes.
<P>
	However it was not $300 million. It cost the Canadian 
taxpayers $850 million in an attempt to drive the bad guys away. 
``We are only going to do this until the bad guys disappear, then 
we are going to put the tax back''. The Liberals were dreaming 
in technicolour at a time when they should not have been 
dreaming, they should have been facing reality.
<P>
	The last thing we were involved in thanks to this government 
was the Pearson mess. We are still debating whether it is a 
Liberal scandal or a Tory scandal. While we are doing that the 
airport is deteriorating. The jobs that could have been created 
there have not been created. In the long term it will cost jobs 
across Canada. That is all because of the government failing to 
face reality and take action.
<P>
	The other comment I wanted to address at the beginning was: 
``We did not do this; we just took over. It was the Conservatives 
that started all this. They did not address the deficit''. The 
present government was in opposition. I cannot recall a great 
deal of emphasis from them in those years to cut spending. As a 
matter of fact, I detected the exact opposite. Whenever the 
Conservative government, realizing the magnitude of the 
problem, tried to do something about it like revising the UI 
program, the howls of indignation from the Liberals were 
unbelievable.
<P>
	It is a little hypocritical to sit over there and say: &quot;It is not us. 
We did not cause the deficit.&quot; They sure did not help by 
supporting the cuts the Tories were trying to make. Not to 
mention the government was in place when we started this slide 
down the debt hole. When the Liberals were defeated in 1984 the 
debt at that point was just under $200 billion and all 
Conservative efforts to reduce it failed miserably because they 
were not getting the support they needed from the opposition.
<P>
	Now we come to the budget. A year ago it was: ``Don't worry, 
be happy''. Now Canadians are being told: ``It is a serious 
situation. It is life threatening. We have to do something about 
it. We have to cut spending''. They blew it big time. The one 
thing the Liberals had to do was show leadership by example. 
They had to address our gold plated MP pension plan and they 
did not do it. They blew big time any credibility they had with 
the Canadian people in that budget.
<P>
	It is interesting the MP pension cuts were not in the budget. I 
am sure the finance minister looked at that program and said: 
``Forget it. It would be a disaster in my budget''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> You have got to pay the price.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> You have to pay the price. You 
have to show leadership by example. It was not there, so the 
budget started off on a very bad note. They just blew all 
credibility.
<P>
	Let us talk about the budget. In 1997 the debt will be $650 
billion. That is the bottom line. That is an accomplishment? 
That is reality. That is a fact. Interest rates on it amount to $55 
billion to $60 billion. That is reality. That is a fact. We will still 
be overspending by $25 billion. That is reality. That is an 
accomplishment? It is a disaster we are going to have to face and 
deal with.
<P>
	The IMF brought out a study this week on growth and the 
world economy. It showed Canada's growth at 4.3 per cent in 
1995 and 2.6 per cent in 1996. Bad news is coming. Are we 
prepared for it? I suggest not. Just below the growth in the world 
economy is how Canada's debt stacks up. It is compared to our 
other trading partners. Canada is the absolute worst and 
worsening.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has the distinction of being the world's largest 
offshore debtor. That debt has increased. During the last year the 
offshore debt has gone from $319 billion to $341 billion. 
Twenty-eight billion dollars in interest payments flow out of 
Canada to those countries that have been supporting our lavish 
lifestyle. It does not do a thing for the economy. We are not in 
control of our own destiny. That control is in the hands of the 
people who have been supporting that lavish lifestyle we have 
been enjoying while we lived beyond our means.
<P>
	What will be the future costs of the Moody's downgrade? As I 
suggested at the beginning, it is going to be in the area of 
millions if not billions of dollars. We cannot say we were not 
warned. We got a warning shot before the budget. Moody's said: 
``Your 3 per cent target is far too low and we want you to give us 
a date when you are going to get to zero''. Rolling two-year 
targets are laughable.
<P>
	I can see myself going to my bank manager and saying: ``I 
know I am in debt, but will you keep lending me money if I give 
you a rolling two-year target?'' He would throw me out of his 
office after he had a fit of hysterics.
<P>
	Several clouds are on the horizon that are not faced in the 
budget and of course there is what can happen in the United 
States.
<P>
	I will close by saying that the situation prompts me to recall 
buying my first home. The neighbour next door had all the 
trappings, lovely furnishings. I thought he must be making a lot 
of money. Reality was the creditors moving in and closing him 
down because he was doing it with his credit card. That is what 
we are doing and it could hurt our future generations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I remind the next 
member that we have only eight minutes left.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to speak to Bill C-76.
<P>
	I just read something in <I>Quorum</I>: ``A new fever for frugality''. 
That is what we are talking about today. Among other things I 
have learned in my last 18 months as a politician are three 
words: imbalance, fluctuation and disturbance. These are three 
words that politicians hate to hear. They are also the basis for 
innovative and creative thinking. That is what the budget is 
showing right now.
<P>
	The 1994-95 estimates show the first reduction in budgetary 
requirements in 20 years. In the next fiscal year spending here 
will drop by 6 per cent, and 3 per cent each year after. Senior 
employees on the House staff have been cut by 15 per cent. MPs 
remuneration, salaries, as an example, have been frozen and will 
remain frozen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Tell us about the pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> The pension plan has been cut back also. I get a 
kick out of how cynical the member for Simcoe Centre can be at 
times. The member and I had the opportunity a couple of weeks 
ago to tour base Borden. This will give members a rough idea of 
the innovation I am talking about.
<P>
	With the cuts that have been made to the Department of 
National Defence, base Borden at the present time is working in 
conjunction with Georgian College. The member knows this 
because we saw it. Base Borden is conducting welding classes as 
a way of utilizing the facilities. It is holding catering courses 
and courses for firefighting and for paramedical training. The 
member knows this.
<P>
	This is all part of budget cuts and innovative thinking. This is 
what I am talking about if the member would just listen. We 
wanted to make sure the budget was fair to the taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Did you run your farm like that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> I went through this with my farm.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I would ask 
members to address their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Madam Speaker, I apologize. The member asked 
if that was the way I ran my farm. In 1984 I was a pig farmer. The 
draconian cuts he and his party are talking about would be the 
same as me saying that I am not going to pay the taxes on my 
farm, or my hydro bill or buy any clothes this year.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	What they are talking about are targets that cannot be made. 
One of the things laid out in the budget is the fact that we are 
keeping our targets. In fact, we have set targets that are based on 
very pessimistic growth. Even the business community said that 
we were being pessimistic. Our targets are capped.
<P>
	If the target is too low, by the time we get to 3 per cent of the 
GDP by 1996-97, which is what we promised in the red book and 
from our own pessimistic outlook, then if we go by what is 
happening in the business community and what they have been 
projecting, we will exceed 3 per cent. Is that not what it is all 
about, having a government that the voters know is a credible 
government if it comes forward with a budget, sets targets and 
achieves those targets?
<P>
	For the last nine years voters have watched governments 
making promises in different budgets. Those promises were not 
kept. We were at the point where they were becoming cynical 
and saying that this was just another promise which was not 
credible.
<P>
	That is not what this government is all about. We are where we 
are in the polls today because we are credible. We are making 
promises that we can keep.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> What about the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> The GST will be worked out later this year. It is 
in process right now. The member can laugh. I love the way the 
member for Simcoe Centre tries to work this around. He stood 
up and chastised the infrastructure program. In fact, a few 
months ago he made a statement in the House questioning the 
minister responsible. However, at the same time, I found some 
correspondence he had written the mayor of Barrie praising the 
program. It is cynicism like that which gives politicians a bad 
name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Tell the whole story, do not 
just give little quotes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> I am ashamed of the member.
<P>
	The budget has a number of advantages. We have pledged that 
in 1995-96 the debt will not exceed $32.7 billion. We want that 
reduced to 3 per cent of the GDP or $24.3 billion for 1996-97. 
This is something that was laid down in the Maastricht treaty. 
We recognize that a large percentage of our money is borrowed 
from the international market and it is our responsibility to 
make that figure.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons why the Canadian dollar today is 
strong, interest rates within the country are stable and why we 
are the leader in the G-7 nations in exporting. We are an 
exporting nation. If we are going to keep our standard of living 
we have to export. Thirty million people within this country 
without exports just does not cut it. Therefore, we have to be an 
efficient exporting nation. We have to be ISO 9000 effective. We 
have to take every advantage. We have to be innovative and 
creative which is exactly what the budget is.
<P>
	I hope that the member across the way will see the light and 
vote for Bill C-76.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should take the measures 
necessary for the legal recognition of same sex spouses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it must be realized that major social 
changes require some disruption.
<P>
	I thank you for calling the House to order and I want to stress 
how important this motion is to me and how I fully appreciate 
the opportunity we have in this Parliament to raise an issue 
which, in many countries, is the object of repression.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to point out that the motion I am 
tabling today calls on us as members of Parliament to recognize 
same sex spouses. What this means is that we as members of 
Parliament recognize and urge the government to take the 
measures necessary to recognize that same sex individuals, 
whether two men or two women, can have a satisfactory loving 
and sexual relationship. On such a basis, nothing could justify 
legislators condoning discriminatory practices.
<P>
	First of all, I wish to point out that what is to be debated in the 
next few minutes and hours is not the concept of family or the 
issue of adoption but the question of free choice for two same 
sex individuals who want to enjoy a relationship.
<P>
	I would like to draw a comparison between feelings of love 
and religious feelings. I had an old theology professor who used 
to say about religious belief that a religious person is one who 
believes that mysteries exist  and that we cannot apprehend the 
world around us in its totality for we are hindered by our 
conventional senses, while one who sees problems where he or 
she should see mysteries is not a religious but a superstitious 
person. I suggest that religious belief is universal and transcends 
denominational boundaries. Whether Catholic, Protestant, 
Quaker or what not, we have religious beliefs and values and this 
is a matter of feeling.
<P>
	Love is the same kind of feeling. Whether or not this love is 
between two men or two women, the fact remains that what is 
experienced in terms of relationship is the same.
<P>
	I would say that, today, we are picking up where Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and John Turner left off and, with a majority vote on 
this motion in Parliament, we would basically be taking another 
step forward.
<P>
	You will recall that it was John Turner and not Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau who, as Minister of Justice, decriminalized 
homosexuality through the passage of Bill C-150 in December 
1968. Of course, as we recall, this was an omnibus bill which 
included a number of amendments relating to lotteries and 
abortion.
<P>
	But the main thing is that, in 1968, it was recognized in a 
mature way, in a generous society which is no doubt even more 
so today, that two consenting adults, or as paragraph 149(a) of 
the Criminal Code put it, two persons who are both over the age 
of 21 can engage freely in sexual activity- provided, naturally, 
that they have reached the legal age, which was 21 in those 
days-and that they consensually agree to be in a relationship.
<P>
	I think that, as a society, we are now going a further step in 
saying that, as a society, we will not tolerate that individuals 
who knowingly and willingly get into a same sex relationship 
should suffer economic, social or fiscal discrimination.
<P>
	That is what this motion is about. I have heard all kinds of 
remarks and comparisons which, if I may say so, were quite 
misguided.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Before getting down to the specifics, I want to say that the gay 
community, to which I belong, is a fine community. Our fellow 
citizens, as well as the gay community, must realize that a 
person can be gay and still be a taxpayer, a worker and a happy 
human being. The best way for society to integrate its various 
groups and make them feel comfortable is to accept their 
differences. It will be very interesting to see how, as we prepare 
for the 21st century, Canada and Quebec will be prepared to 
accept these differences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11833"> 11833 </A></B>
<P>
	Ultimately, no one can contend, from a psychological or 
anthropological point of view, that homosexuality is something 
abnormal. In psychology, the term abnormal refers to 
something which is unhealthy from a psychological or 
physiological point of view. A person can be a homosexual or 
a lesbian and still be a member of the workforce, a happy human 
being, a conscientious worker, as well as an active member of 
his or her community. In fact, this is the case of most people 
I know.
<P>
	Yet, even though several administrative tribunals, employers 
and provincial governments-including Ontario-have 
recognized same sex spouses, the fact is that, in 1995, there is 
still a great deal of discrimination.
<P>
	In recognizing same sex spouses, we have to take a look at the 
scope of the current notion of spouses, which is defined strictly 
in heterosexist terms.
<P>
	With the diligent and much appreciated help of the Library 
researchers, I sought to find out how many acts in Canada 
contain a definition of ``spouse'' in heterosexist terms, that is a 
definition referring to spouses of two different sexes. Madam 
Speaker, you will surely be surprised to learn that, for all intents 
and purposes, there are about 60 such acts. You have no idea of 
all the lines of activity concerned. I have a list here which 
includes the Bankruptcy Act, the Evidence Act, the Carriage by 
Air Act and the Excise Tax Act. Therefore, this issue does not 
just involve social and fringe benefits, as well as pensions. It 
also concerns all sorts of other rights in a vast array of sectors in 
our society.
<P>
	We are not starting from scratch. Some progress has been 
made and it would be extremely dishonest on my part to claim 
that nothing has been done since 1968. I think the best example I 
could give you is the fact that 11 major Canadian 
cities-Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton, Waterloo, 
Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton and that 
wonderful city where I am sure you would all love to spend your 
vacation, Vancouver-have also recognized same sex spouses.
<P>
	I asked our researchers to join me and the human resources 
managers in each one of these municipalities in evaluating the 
fiscal impact on municipalities. Of course we should realize that 
a municipality is not a central government, and I know that is 
something we have to consider. It is also a fact that each of these 
cities signed a contract with a private insurance company for 
health insurance. They let an insurance company offer coverage. 
It is also a fact, and I think one could not expect it to be 
otherwise, that when these cities and municipalities recognized 
same sex spouses, there were no additional costs because after 
all, would anyone rise in this House and claim that two 30-year 
old lesbians have more dental appointments that a heterosexual 
couple? That two gays in their forties need hospital care more 
often than their heterosexual counterparts?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	So it is clear that recognition of same sex spouses is not a 
money issue, at least based on what one could reasonably expect 
to be the case in these municipalities, since the homosexual 
community, the members of that community do not differ 
physically from heterosexuals. I know some people said that 
there might be neurological or glandular or hormonal 
differences, but upon closer analysis, these theories did not hold 
water.
<P>
	I hope that this debate, which is an extremely important one, 
will reflect what this 35th Parliament is prepared to do to 
enhance the equality of all Canadians and Quebecers. Once 
again, this is not supposed to be a debate on adoption and 
redefining the family, matters that Parliament would have no 
mandate to discuss in any case.
<P>
	As a person who is a committed and militant gay, I have no 
hesitation in saying that two men or two women do not 
constitute a family. For a family, you need children. I am not 
saying that two men or two women would be unable to provide 
an environment comparable to what a heterosexual couple could 
offer, but that is not the point of this debate.
<P>
	So this is an appeal for generosity and openness, since for the 
legislator, there can be no grounds for discrimination. Since 
homosexual couples are made up of taxpayers-a number of 
them are taxpayers-, they are part of the labour market and are 
involved in the community, there is no objective reason for 
allowing the discrimination to rage on.
<P>
	Before concluding, I would like to provide a number of 
examples to illustrate how insidious it can be. Even though I am 
an idealist, opposed to pragmatists, discrimination is tangible 
and a day to day experience in the lives of the people in this 
community.
<P>
	I have chosen this example, which concerns a number of areas 
of activity: unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance 
is no charity. As you know, after the Conservatives opted out, 
unfortunately, with the Liberals following suit, unemployment 
insurance was no longer an assistance plan. It became an 
insurance plan, with workers paying for unemployment 
insurance, along with employers, of course.
<P>
	I will give you an example. A claimant can, in certain 
instances, voluntarily leave his job if his or her spouse is 
transferred to another city. It is clear that a gay or lesbian couple 
appearing before an unemployment insurance officer because 
one partner must move to another city for job-related reasons 
will not enjoy the same benefits a heterosexual couple might.
<P>
	Obviously, discrimination is a major concern. Such an issue 
concerning the Income Tax Act was of real concern to the 
community. In the past 10 to 15 years, social laws have tended to 
acknowledge common law spouses. Under most Canadian laws, 
you must meet the following two conditions to have your 
relationship recognized and to acquire the same rights as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11834"> 11834 </A></B>
<P>
married couple. You must  share accommodation with the same 
person for at least one year and you must identify yourselves 
publicly as a couple.
<P>
	Regarding income tax, and the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot follows all developments in this area 
very closely, as he is the finance critic, since 1987, the definition 
of the term ``spouse'' in the Income Tax Act has been the 
following: a person of the opposite sex living in a situation 
similar to that of marital union. What rights would same sex 
couples acquire, what would be the significance of recognizing 
them from an income tax point of view? It would give them the 
right to claim credits for dependents.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	They would also gain access to spousal RRSPs, and we all 
know how important RRSPs are for preparing, obviously, for 
retirement and old age, since governments are withdrawing 
from this area. I would like to take this opportunity to say first 
off that the gay community is a beautiful community, within 
which it is not unusual to see couples who have been together for 
20, 25 or 30 years. I know that many people tend to think that 
same sex relationships, gay relationships, are short-lived, 
futile, superficial, but I personally can vouch for the fact, as can 
others, that it is not unusual to see same sex relationships last 
20, 25 or 30 years.
<P>
	We can safely say that the same is not always true of the 
heterosexual community. Of course, there are also couples that 
last 20, 25 or 30 years, but one must also acknowledge, in all 
fairness, that the same exists in the gay community. Therefore, 
if I may use a specific example, recognizing same sex spouses 
for income tax purposes would also mean they could use RRSP 
limits to their mutual advantage, claim a parent of their spouse 
as a dependent, transfer to the other spouse some unused tax 
credits for pension purposes, tuition fees or disability credits.
<P>
	We could also talk about the Canada Pension Plan. Since 
1986, it has recognized a spouse of the opposite sex that has 
been living with the contributor for one year or more. It means 
that, in the case of heterosexual couples in Canada, when one 
spouse has contributed to the Canada Pension Plan, at the time 
of death, undoubtedly a tragic event, the other is entitled to part 
of the pension. This is also a form of discrimination against 
homosexual and gay couples.
<P>
	Another very obvious example is a case concerning the Old 
Age Security Act that is now before the Supreme Court, which is 
expected to hand down its decision in May, and it will be 
interesting to see what this decision will be. You know that, 
under this act, when two people live together and their total 
income is under a certain level, one of them can receive a 
guaranteed income supplement. Unfortunately, two 
homosexuals or two lesbians who have been living together for 
10, 15 or 20 years in some cases, cannot get the guaranteed 
income supplement when their income is under that threshold.
<P>
	We could also talk about pensions in the Canadian public 
service. The issue, as far as public service pensions are 
concerned, is that, when a heterosexual partner dies, the 
surviving partner is entitled to a portion of the pension. There 
are very concrete, commonplace examples to show clearly that 
same sex partners living as a couple, who freely got into this 
relationship, honourable citizens who are participants in the the 
workforce and, in most cases, want to contribute to society, are 
discriminated against.
<P>
	This is a test for Parliament. We could choose to act as if this 
reality did not exist, but it does. I think that we must be driven by 
a feeling of generosity which should lead us ultimately to accept 
our differences. This motion provides us with an opportunity to 
discuss one difference which has been of concern to all 
societies. Allow me, in closing, to be optimistic about its 
chances of being adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member moved that the government 
should take the measures necessary for the legal recognition of 
same sex spouses.
<P>
	By legal recognition of same sex spouses I am unclear as to 
whether the hon. member means same sex partners should be 
able to register, as I understand they can in Denmark, or that 
benefits currently given to married and common law spouses 
should be extended to same sex partners.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Neither option is viable, given the current state of the law. 
Perhaps it would be a better motion had it been made in a 
provincial legislature rather than in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The federal government has very limited jurisdiction in this 
area of the legal recognition of personal relationships. The 
Constitution divides jurisdiction in the area of family law 
between the provincial legislatures and the federal Parliament. 
The jurisdiction for marriage is divided with the provinces being 
responsible for the solemnization of marriage, including 
licensing requirements, and the federal government being 
responsible for the legal capacity to marry. However, as the 
definition of marriage clearly makes it an opposite sex concept, 
this constitutional power is irrelevant for the current discussion.
<P>
	The Constitution also gives Parliament the power over 
divorce, although the province retains the power to administer 
the application of the Divorce Act, including division of 
property and support obligations. However, as marriage is 
irrelevant here, I am assuming the divorce power is as well, as 
divorce cannot apply without marriage, although I understand 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11835"> 11835 </A></B>
<P>
Denmark requires same sex couples who have registered to go 
through the divorce legislation to deregister.
<P>
	Perhaps the only relevant example I can think of is the 
treatment of common law spouses under provincial family law. 
This is a personal relationship widely recognized by law, even 
though it is not specifically mentioned by the Constitution, 
unlike marriage.
<P>
	Until fairly recently historically common law spouses were 
not recognized by our law. The term is a misnomer in any event, 
as common law spouses do not actually exist in the common law 
or judge made law. They actually are created by statute law, not 
by one statute but by a very large number of statutes at both the 
federal and provincial levels.
<P>
	In other words, unless a particular statute specifically 
provides that a reference to spouse will include common law 
relationships, they are not included for the purpose of the 
benefit in issue. The major statute law that recognizes common 
law spouses is the provincial family law statutes.
<P>
	These statutes create the major legal obligations imposed on 
common law spouses should the relationship break down. They 
deal with division of property, support obligations between the 
former spouses and for any children. Even here the provincial 
law is not consistent across the country. Common law spouses 
are subject to different legal obligations under different 
provincial family law statutes across the provinces. They are not 
even recognized in two provinces including Quebec, the 
province of residence of the hon. member proposing this 
measure.
<P>
	Common law marriage is a different concept from that of 
common law spouses. Common law marriage existed only in the 
early settlement days of Canada where a minister or a priest was 
often difficult to find. Although there is some speculation that 
the concept may still exist in the common law in Canada it 
would only apply in an opposite sex context.
<P>
	Therefore, if provincial family law is the main source of legal 
obligations between spouses, it would seem more appropriate 
that any legal recognition of same sex partners would come first 
under provincial family law. As I understand it, this was 
primarily the way which common law relationships first gained 
legal recognition.
<P>
	As a result of several high profile cases before the Supreme 
Court of Canada the courts recognized through the doctrines of 
unjust enrichment and constructive trust the contribution of a 
woman who had lived for a long period of time with a man as 
married, even though they had not married.
<P>
	Legislative changes followed shortly thereafter, starting 
primarily with provincial family law and then slowly moving 
into the benefits field.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	This legal recognition is recent in Canadian law. The changes 
to the Income Tax Act to recognize common law spouses have 
come about in the last year or two after the majority of 
provincial family law statutes recognized the status. The 
question of whether common law spouses must be treated in the 
same way as married spouses in some or all circumstances is 
still before the Supreme Court of Canada. The Miron case was 
argued last fall and a decision is pending.
<P>
	The only references in federal law to personal relationships 
either follow blood or marriage relationships, which are 
relatively easy to prove, or copy provincial family law 
definitions of common law relationships. At the federal level 
spouses are mostly included in legislation for the purposes of 
employment benefits, the government pension plans and income 
tax.
<P>
	The concern is that if we were to extend these benefits to same 
sex partners at the federal level first before provincial family 
law extends any legal obligations it could create a situation of 
unfairness. Spouses, both married and common law, are 
currently subject to a package of legal rights and responsibilities 
created by a combination of federal and provincial laws.
<P>
	It is because spouses are subject to legal obligations such as 
support obligations upon the breakdown of the relationship that 
they are also eligible for benefits such as survivor benefits under 
pension plans. It is for the provinces to extend first the 
obligations before we should extend benefits under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	How would we accomplish what the hon. member is asking? 
How would we take the measures necessary for the legal 
recognition of same sex spouses, even were we to agree this 
should be done? It is clear from the history of the recognition of 
common law relationships that this was not accomplished by 
passing a statute called the common law spouses act. Nor was 
this legal recognition even accomplished by the government at 
any level.
<P>
	The fact of social change was first acknowledged by the 
courts in looking at unfairness and unjust enrichment between 
two partners who had not married. The courts felt strongly that 
individuals who were living together as if married and so were 
getting all of the advantages of being married, such as working 
together to afford a better lifestyle than either would have been 
able to live alone, should not be able to avoid taking on the 
obligations of married persons simply by choosing not to marry. 
Particularly in a situation such as that represented in the first 
few high profile cases, the common life wife needed the 
protection of the law.
<P>
	However, this is a controversial enough subject with regard to 
opposite sex common law couples. Many common law couples 
continue to disagree and feel frustrated the law deems their 
relationship to be akin to marriage after a certain time has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11836"> 11836 </A></B>
<P>
passed. Many still feel their choice not to marry should be 
respected by the law.
<P>
	How much more of a problem will this be with same sex 
couples who may not be public about their relationships? 
Conversely, is it fair to recognize only those same sex couples 
who do wish to be open about their relationships? For a number 
of reasons this motion is premature and not feasible for the 
federal government to adopt without the full co-operation of the 
provincial legislatures.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to Motion No. 264, a 
private member's motion forwarded by the member by 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take the measures 
necessary for the legal recognition of same sex spouses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As chair of the Reform Party's family task force I will speak 
definitely in opposition to this motion for the reasons I will 
outline.
<P>
	First let me comment on the make-up of the Canadian family. 
In its 1994 report on families in Canada, Statistics Canada 
reported that in 1991 the traditional model of the Canadian 
family, a husband and wife, made up 87 per cent of all families.
<P>
	Members may wish to note that in 1941, 88 per cent of 
families consisted of a traditional husband and wife family. 
Therefore, it would seem there has been relatively no change in 
the make-up of the traditional Canadian family unit, in spite of 
the tremendous economic, fiscal, social, and cultural pressures 
it has faced over the last 50 years. This is a testimony to the 
resilience of the family as a social institution.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	In recent years there have been numerous efforts and 
suggestions to change what is commonly understood as the 
traditional family unit. The assumptions about the traditional 
family unit are being challenged by courts, interest groups, 
non-governmental organizations, and government agencies.
<P>
	Often the judicial system has been used by interest groups and 
individuals to pursue issues that do not have broad based support 
with Canadians, and this is such a case in point. Presently the 
Supreme Court is considering a case, Egan and Nesbit v. The 
Queen, which would redefine the term spouse and therefore the 
related concepts of family and marriage. Another case is in 
Ontario, Leshner v. Ontario, where the court actually ordered 
the Ontario government to give same sex couples pension 
benefits, even though the federal Income Tax Act does not 
permit registered pension plans to provide for same sex spouses.
<P>
	Another example of this trend outside of law is the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission. In its recent annual report, as it has 
recommended every year since 1979, it has proposed the 
inclusion of sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights 
Act as a prohibited ground of discrimination. If enacted this 
would provide a legal basis for challenges to redefine spouse, 
marriage, and family.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice, ignoring what I feel is the voice of 
real Canadians, has listened to these other voices and has 
committed himself to this goal.
<P>
	I could go on to mention the ultra-feminist and lesbian 
representation sent as the Canadian delegation to the 
preparatory conference for the upcoming Beijing conference 
and their proposal supporting the removal of alleged barriers 
due to sexual orientation.
<P>
	In contrast to this, the Reform Party has long recognized the 
importance of family to the stability and prosperity of our 
society. Principle six of our party states: ``We affirm the value 
and dignity of the individual person and the importance of 
strengthening and protecting the family unit as essential to the 
well-being of individuals and society''.
<P>
	To date the Reform Party is the only political party to have 
defined family. Our family task force, which I chair, has 
researched and developed a policy on the definition of family. 
We define family in the following way: ``Those individuals 
related by the ties of blood, marriage, or adoption. Marriage is a 
union between a man and a woman as recognized by the state''.
<P>
	This is the traditional family unit, which is the fundamental 
building block of our society. I believe it is the best social 
institution for the cultivation and protection of values and 
culture in our society, for the raising of our children and the 
nurturing and provision of the care of all family members.
<P>
	This having been said, the Reform Party reaffirms the 
traditional definition of the family and opposes any efforts to 
redefine it.
<P>
	These efforts and challenges have been made in spite of the 
well entrenched views of grassroots Canadians. In June 1994 a 
<I>Maclean's</I>-CTV-Angus Reid poll found that 68 per cent of 
Canadians believed that the best type of family in which to raise 
children has two heterosexual parents.
<P>
	Over 600 petitions have been tabled in this House, with over 
70,000 signatures from grassroots Canadians stating their 
opposition to the extension of benefits to same sex couples and 
the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
	Contrary to the expressed will of so many Canadians, this 
motion is another example of the efforts under way to redefine 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11837"> 11837 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian family. The motion calls upon the House of 
Commons and the federal government to take measures 
necessary for the legal recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
	What is legal recognition? It is undefined in the motion. What 
would it mean and what issues would it raise? Would legal 
recognition automatically result in benefits to same sex 
partners? Would legal recognition mean that same sex partners 
could be married? Would it mean that homosexual couples could 
adopt children? What and how many federal and provincial 
statutes would have to be amended?
<P>
	The legal recognition of same sex spouses would ultimately 
entail the revision of many federal and provincial statutes, 
particularly those that relate to the tax law that defines spouse, 
marriage, and family. Our research has indicated that up to 40 
federal statutes would have to be amended if this recognition 
were to occur.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Provincially, in Ontario the word spouse is contained in over 
80 provincial laws and statutes. Presently, marriage between 
individuals of the same sex is not permitted in Canada.
<P>
	Adoption of children, although a provincial matter, is a 
question our society will have to deal with. Last year, Bill 167 in 
Ontario, which would have allowed for adoption by same sex 
couples, was defeated, largely in response to a huge public 
outcry. In June 1994, a <I>Maclean's</I>-CTV-Angus Reid poll found 
that 67 per cent of Canadians oppose giving homosexual couples 
the same legal status as mothers and fathers.
<P>
	There is another question. Would this motion strengthen 
arguments in favour of the inclusion of sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act? Clearly it would.
<P>
	Again, a majority of grassroots Canadians do not support the 
proposed amendment to the act by the justice minister. The 
minister's proposed amendment is in so much trouble that he has 
publicly asked the homosexual community to support his efforts 
``to keep a prod on the government to move forward on these 
matters'', in spite of opposition from Canadians, opposition in 
this House, and opposition in his own caucus.
<P>
	I would like to conclude. This motion, if passed, like all other 
approved private members' motions, would express an opinion 
of this House. This motion is a votable motion and thus would be 
a clear and distinct expression of the opinion of this House. The 
expression of this opinion would send a moral signal and 
provide a moral direction for our society on this particular issue, 
which flies in the face of the expressed will of Canadians.
<P>
	This House faces a choice. Which path will we choose for the 
future of our society, our families and our children? I say that 
this House should choose a path that has guided this country and 
many others and has provided stability to our society.
<P>
	Therefore, I oppose this motion and call upon my colleagues 
on all sides of the House to vote in favour rather of the 
traditional Canadian family and against this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased today to make a few comments on the motion put 
forward by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who is committed to a very big 
issue: the legal recognition of same sex spouses.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This issue certainly has a number of moral and historical 
implications. This is not the first time this House has treated this 
issue. Yet it is an issue that from time to time will come back. I 
am sure the pending Bill C-41 and other bills being proposed by 
the Minister of Justice-or suggested in terms of changes to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act-will certainly have an impact on 
the future of this particular issue.
<P>
	We also know the Canadian Human Rights Commissioner has 
been a strong advocate and has on many occasions shown to the 
government and Parliament that it must act in this area.
<P>
	My interest today is to talk about the real implications of the 
hon. member's motion. We know that in Canada there is a very 
strong sense of the traditional family, with opposite sexes. 
Family status in law involves a couple comprised of a husband 
and a wife, and possibly children. Lately that definition has 
changed to also include non-married families or common law 
couples.
<P>
	My concern with this particular motion is its implications in 
Canada. One of the most critical things that has not been touched 
by my honourable colleague and other members in this House is 
the direct cost impact that such an undertaking would have in 
terms of the federal treasury. These are very difficult times, and 
we are asking the taxpayers to fund the benefits accruing from 
the same sex relationships.
<P>
	Probably a more important side to this is how one defines the 
question of same sex benefits or spousal benefits. We are not 
necessarily talking about people of similar sex. We are really 
talking about the possibility-as is the case in many ridings, 
including I am sure the riding of the hon. member-that a 
grandfather and a grandson who are of the same sex and live in 
the same household would be effectively left out because we 
have not really defined what we mean by same sex benefits. 
Presumably, I know the intention. It is very clear what the hon. 
member is seeking. However, it does not include the important 
case of people who are not together for sexual reasons.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11838"> 11838 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	As we know, the federal court has already dealt with the issue 
of same sex benefits. In 1991 it ruled that the federal approach 
has not been established and has not demonstrated 
discrimination per se. That ruling was again upheld in 1993 by a 
two to one vote. It was found at the time that the law does not 
discriminate against gay men or lesbians because there are many 
other couples who live together who are ineligible for the same 
benefits.
<P>
	My concern is that we have to be very careful about what this 
legislation really means. As a member of Parliament from 
Ontario, I am only too familiar with what happens when a 
government, through a motion presented by a member of 
Parliament, or Parliament considers a motion that has not been 
thoroughly discussed or debated by the vast majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	We are asking Canadians to undertake a major financial hit 
here. It is incumbent upon this Parliament to also examine the 
cost attached to such an initiative.
<P>
	This no doubt raises a number of moral and political 
implications for all members of Parliament. The traditional role 
of a member of Parliament is to be advised, to consult and to 
hear from constituents, and not act as a court in a situation.
<P>
	We know this issue is before the Supreme Court of Canada 
under the Egan and Nesbit case, the same individuals who had 
appeared before the federal court. Many of us are familiar with 
the proceedings, and some of us might cynically suggest that the 
crown in this case put forth a rather weak argument in defence of 
the status quo. I find that very interesting. However, I am 
speaking with liberty in the House of Commons on that issue.
<P>
	I think we want to make sure that we do not confuse legal 
rights to protect against discrimination. We do not want to be 
seen as invalidating equal rights. We want to be seen as not 
promoting a certain lifestyle that is conducted in a way whereby 
people have to spend more money to approve of somebody's 
activity.
<P>
	The comments made by the hon. member when he alluded to 
John Turner in 1969 and to the Rt. Hon. Pierre Trudeau in 
reference to the state not having any business in the bedrooms of 
the nation is one issue. We as Liberals recognize that what 
people do in their own private affairs is fine, but there is a 
difference between tolerance and equality and promoting that on 
the streets. I think there is a quantum leap in terms of the 
philosophy of government.
<P>
	Of course this is not the first time Parliament has been seized 
of this issue. It is a very complicated issue, and if as members of 
Parliament we are going to debate the various relative impacts 
of what my honourable colleague is suggesting, we must first 
and foremost ensure that Canadian people are adequately and 
thoroughly canvassed on the issue. We cannot have legislation, 
motions, or private members' bills introduced by stealth.  This 
is a very important matter of fundamental public policy.
<P>
	As my honourable colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
has suggested, this is a matter that has gone on for a considerable 
amount of time. It is a matter that Parliament has not addressed 
up until this time. Perhaps one reason it has not addressed the 
issue in the past is because it did not consult with the very people 
it is supposed to represent.
<P>
	My concern also is with the whole notion of whether or not, as 
a society, we are effectively capable of defining what a spouse 
is. The spouse issue is very important, because of course it 
relates to the possibility of different interpretations. We do not 
know exactly what the term spouse is really trying to achieve in 
this bill.
<P>
	My view of a spouse is very simple. A spouse happens to be a 
male and female who happen to come together for whatever 
reasons, as the hon. member suggested, for amorous reasons, 
and whose fruit, the product of that love, may ultimately 
produce a family.
<P>
	We should not be playing with words here. We should try to 
find some kind of definition or interpretation that really relates 
to common usage and what the common person on the street 
would accept as the term spouse.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	If two people who happen to be homosexual wish to live 
together, that is fine. I do not think anyone in this House objects 
to that. It really is up to them. The concern we have is where the 
society or state moves from saying that is great and fine, they are 
free to do what they want, section 15 of the charter of rights and 
freedoms covers them sufficiently, to saying that now we should 
in some way promote, benefit or provide some kind of support 
for that activity.
<P>
	Many members from the homosexual community will make 
the argument that it is a question of cost, that they are paying for 
someone else's benefits. I am wondering if those who have 
spoken on this matter as homosexuals have consulted and 
canvassed their own constituency which would suggest that 
some of their members are not prepared to accept the benefits. 
Some people would be uncomfortable with accepting those 
benefits.
<P>
	We have a situation that is not addressed well in this motion, 
although it is understandable. Benjamin Disraeli put it very well 
that when estimating the accuracy of a political opinion one 
should first of all take into account the standing of the 
opinionist. My hon. colleague has very good standing not only 
in this House but also in the community on the issue which the 
member is advocating.
<P>
	We must also make sure that Canadians as a whole are 
involved in this and that the traditional family or the term family 
is not itself compromised.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11839"> 11839 </A></B>
<P>
	I am the member of Parliament for one of the most populous 
ridings in this country. I have seen an Ontario colleague at the 
provincial level debate this issue without popular consent. It 
seems to me we may be trying to do in this House or through 
weak arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada that 
which we cannot do enough to convince the Canadian people 
that this is an issue that is well worthwhile.
<P>
	Everyone is equal before and under the law and has equal 
treatment and equal protection and derives benefits from that 
protection. I do not believe this House should be in a position of 
making a moral decision as to what is right and what is wrong. I 
do however believe that when it comes to the term family there 
is very little room for compromise.
<P>
	We must look at the cost. We must look at the implications. 
We must make sure that above all we are making legislation 
which reflects accurately the opinion, judgment and sentiments 
of those people we represent.
<P>
	While I compliment the member of Parliament for his courage 
in bringing this forward, I will not support this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the motion put forward 
in the House by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, seeking the legal recognition of 
same sex spouses.
<P>
	I want first of all to stress that this motion does not seek at all, 
as some would believe or might want to make us believe, to 
promote same sex relationships as the ideal way of life that 
every Canadian man and woman should adopt. This motion only 
seeks to recognize something that already exists in our society. 
Quite obviously, there are homosexuals in our society.
<P>
	Homosexuals lead the same kind of life we do. Just like other 
Canadians, they have a job and sometimes live with a spouse. 
Just like other workers, they get fringe benefits to which their 
spouse could be entitled.
<P>
	This motion recommends that homosexuals get the same 
rights as heterosexuals. I think it is about time Canada moved 
with the times and stopped discriminating against homosexuals.
<P>
	Both at the provincial level and in collective agreements of 
federal public servants, precedents are building up to the effect 
that fringe benefits should be granted to same sex spouses. All 
existing federal statutes that are discriminatory in nature will 
eventually be challenged in court with a very good chance of 
success. Over the past few years, an increasing number of 
organizations, private companies and government 
administrations have come to offer the same benefits to same 
sex couples and opposite sex couples, in order to respect the 
principles of equity and non-discrimination.
<P>
	This acknowledgement should not be seen as a threat. What 
we give to others will not lessen our entitlements. And this will 
not prevent anyone from choosing a more conventional, 
traditional lifestyle or from being heterosexual.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, I must say that same sex couples should be 
entitled to benefits. It is not a privilege but a right, a right for 
which they have already paid. In the current state of things, 
employees who have contributed for years to health, sickness 
and life insurance plans or to pension plans cannot transfer their 
entitlements to their same sex spouses.
<P>
	This could lead to situations where, for example, a 
homosexual employee living with the same person for 20 years 
could not share his benefits with this person, whereas one of his 
coworkers, a heterosexual, could share his benefits with 
someone he had been with only since the day before.
<P>
	I repeat, this is not a matter of granting special rights but of 
not discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. People 
who are more or less well intentioned will want to hide their 
intolerance behind financial objections. These people will claim 
that measures providing the same benefits for same sex partners 
will cost too much, just as they did when it involved obtaining 
the same benefits for working women.
<P>
	I want to talk about the low cost of these measures. Several 
private businesses, organizations and governments asked 
actuary firms to estimate the cost of measures they intended to 
take respecting same sex couples.
<P>
	For example, at <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, out of 700 employees, 
only a dozen took advantage of the program, while at the 
Toronto Hospital for Sick Children, less than 1 per cent of the 
employees took advantage of the program and at Northern 
Telecom, which has more than 20 000 employees in Canada, the 
company said: ``We do not expect this to represent a lot of 
money''. William Mercer, an actuary firm, said: ``The changes 
requested will probably represent less than 0.5 per cent of the 
total payroll of the company''.
<P>
	Another interesting example is that of the City of Montreal, 
which, since 1989, has treated all its employees on the same 
basis, whatever their sexual orientation or the sex of their 
spouse. Only 10 of the 8,000 City of Montreal employees have 
registered spouses of the same sex. Because of the actuarial 
nature of its benefit plans, the City of Montreal would incur no 
immediately identifiable costs by introducing this policy.
<P>
	Given the small percentage of homosexual people in 
Canadian society, the smaller percentage of gay people living in 
a common-law relationship and the even smaller percentage of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11840"> 11840 </A></B>
<P>
gay people living in a common law relationship who would 
claim spousal benefits, the experts surveyed agree that costs 
would only go up by 0.5  to 1.5 per cent, depending on the 
various benefits being considered.
<P>
	According to two recent surveys conducted by SOM in 
Quebec and Angus-Reid across Canada, 73 per cent of 
Quebecers feel that homosexual couples should be entitled to 
the same benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples. In 
Canada, the percentage is lower but still represents a majority. 
Indeed, 54 per cent of Canadians feel that, except for the right to 
adopt children, same sex couples should enjoy the same rights as 
heterosexual couples.
<P>
	According to another poll, 70 per cent of Canadians would 
support legislation prohibiting any form of discrimination based 
on sexual orientation. These figures confirm that Canadians are 
increasingly aware that we should all enjoy the same rights. I do 
hope that this House will not be more conservative than the 
population which it serves.
<P>
	I will conclude by pointing out that, on March 18, 1994, the 
Minister of Justice provided the following answer to my 
colleague and friend, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve: ``Mr. Speaker, in its campaign for 
office, in its throne speech and in statements made subsequently 
in the House, the government has committed itself to 
amendments to the Human Rights Act which will add sexual 
orientation as a ground on which discrimination is prohibited. 
We intend to follow through on that commitment''.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I ask only one thing, that the Minister of Justice make good on 
his promise to end discrimination against homosexuals and start 
by supporting, with me, the motion tabled by the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to enter into the debate on the motion that the government 
should take the necessary measures for the legal recognition of 
same sex spouses.
<P>
	It is the role of Parliament to give leadership in providing the 
rules and laws that reflect the needs, wishes and aspirations of 
Canadians. In a democracy it is important for us to represent the 
views of the majority. If we did that carefully we would most 
likely end up with the best proportion of good laws for the 
benefit of all the people in this magnificent country.
<P>
	I was elected to represent the will of the people who elected 
me in Elk Island. One could perhaps argue there is such a thing 
as the tyranny of the majority. However, in a well educated, well 
informed society such as ours if there is a really good idea, one 
that bears recognition, there should be absolutely no difficulty 
in gaining the majority consent for that.
<P>
	I think of many different examples. We have rules of taxation. 
There was a big hue and cry when the GST was introduced and 
the majority of Canadians objected to it.
<P>
	The Liberal Party ran on the platform of eliminating the GST 
because subsequently it found the majority of the people were 
against this and it was not a good tax. We are still waiting for 
that to happen.
<P>
	In the context of this bill I find an overwhelming degree of 
support for the maintenance and development of the traditional 
family. I share what probably most MPs share in the receipt of 
letters and petitions given to us that by far the majority, an 
overwhelming number, indicate they would prefer not to 
recognize same sex relationships. They do not want to include 
homosexuality as part of the fabric of our society.
<P>
	This could be viewed as the tyranny of the majority but we 
should look at it as a very clear and strong understanding of what 
is best. I say this with all due regard to those who think the other 
way.
<P>
	With all due regard to my hon. colleague moving the motion 
today, I understand what he is saying but I want to very clearly 
communicate that we do not in any way wish him or other people 
who have the sexual orientation which he has admitted to any ill. 
We really do not.
<P>
	We need to ask seriously the question whether this is best.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to 
the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICSERVICEOFCANADA">PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, four minutes is not long to follow up on my question of 
December 2 to the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal. Therefore I will only touch on a few highlights. In 
these few minutes I hope to provide some inspiration for the 
minister to get on with the business of renewal of the public 
service.
<P>
	We have been known for a long time as having one of the best 
public service organizations in the world, to the extent that 
people who work in or have worked in the public service are in 
demand in countries around the world to show other 
governments how to set up democratic institutions and how to 
set up efficient and effective public sector organizations.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11841"> 11841 </A></B>
<P>
	Our ability to do as the minister said shortly after he was 
appointed to restore good relations between politicians and 
public servants has been severely strained. Because of the 
economic climate we have found ourselves in, we have 
extended the wage freeze and deepened it by including 
increments. We have introduced a budget which stated that we 
were to reduce the size of the federal public sector by over 
45,000 jobs.
<P>
	It is a little difficult in that climate to talk about renewal. 
Renewal suggests improvement, restored hope and a better 
future. There are not too many public servants who feel that way 
right now.
<P>
	When the minister spoke a year ago this month to the 
professional executives of the Public Service of Canada he said 
that our success would be judged not only by what we do but also 
by how we do it.
<P>
	I refer to a couple of other comments the minister made in the 
speech a year ago when he spoke about what was required for 
public service renewal and give him some of my thoughts on 
how important it is to move ahead with that initiative.
<P>
	This is the largest organization in the country. If we cannot go 
through a period of transition and come out the other side with 
an organization that has a clear understanding of its mission and 
a clear commitment to service to Canadians, I do not know what 
other organization or business in the country can do it.
<P>
	Let me talk about some of the elements the minister spoke 
about. He talked about the importance of the people side, the 
importance of giving more prominence to human resource 
management issues and to training. Yet we have not seen the 
kinds of initiatives, the overall sense of a new vision and the 
leadership required to make people feel that their organization is 
moving into a better and clearer state where it has a clear sense 
of mission and of serving the country again.
<P>
	The minister talked about perhaps separating the policy 
function from the service function and at the same time 
improving services to Canadians. I frankly urge him not to do 
that. If the frontline service becomes disconnected from policy, 
we no longer have the feedback to ensure that we have the kinds 
of policies and programs that provide good services to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The minister talked about organization. I encourage him not 
to think in terms of structures but to think of organic working 
relationships that can change easily. The organization has had 
far too much reorganization.
<P>
	Above all, I urge the minister to get through this period of 
what I called a demolition derby in my question and get on with 
the business of public renewal. He should get the leadership 
going at the administrative and political levels so that people 
can again feel they have a mission of serving their country, 
serving their fellow citizens and doing the best darned job they 
can, not because excellence is a jargon word but because that is 
what they want to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member for Ottawa West has long been recognized as one of the 
most creative and inspired thinkers in the area of public service 
renewal. That spirit animated the question we have heard 
tonight.
<P>
	I should like to respond to some of the comments made by the 
hon. member for Ottawa West. It is true we are downsizing the 
public service, but the government has given a pledge that 
during the downsizing it will keep involuntary layoffs to an 
absolute minimum. I assure the hon. member that the 
government will keep that pledge.
<P>
	Let me reiterate the government's commitment to deal with 
employees in the fairest and most sensitive way possible, as has 
been suggested by the hon. member for Ottawa West. It is 
particularly important to express our determination to continue 
to work with the unions and with local governments to ease the 
transition.
<P>
	Finally let me say that we hope to keep layoffs and the number 
of employees on unpaid surplus status to an absolute minimum. 
Some individuals will be accommodated through normal 
attrition. Others may take advantage of the early departure and 
early retirement incentives announced by the President of the 
Treasury Board. The hon. member is aware of the $2.25 million 
program for displaced public servants in the national capital 
region who are seeking employment.
<P>
	The government will continue its program review because it 
believes that with all other problems still to be solved it is the 
only way to allocate resources properly. However I strongly 
reiterate that the government also believes, as does the hon. 
member, in public service renewal.
<P>
	With the new government policies we hope for a role for the 
public service that is much more satisfying, much more 
fulfilling and much more challenging than it ever has been.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
