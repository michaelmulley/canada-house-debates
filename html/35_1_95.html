<P>
	This bill decriminalizes offences against regulations 
respecting storage, display, handling and transportation of 
firearms. It simplifies the FAC renewal process and allows 
previous law-abiding gun owners to acquire an FAC without 
going through the course and test.

Parliament not to amend the Human Rights Act or the Charter of

amend the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to present a petition this morning on behalf of the 
Catholic Women's League from Kapuskasing.
<P>
	Its members would like Parliament to review and revise our 
laws concerning young offenders by empowering the courts to 
prosecute and punish the young law breakers who are terrorizing 
our society by releasing their names and lowering the age limit 
to allow prosecution to meet the severity of the crime.

views.
<P>
	I therefore present a petition requesting that this Parliament 
maintain the status quo regarding the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act to avoid any 
semblance of societal approval for same sex relationships.
<P>
	The petition, which erroneously states that Canada has a 
human rights code, is identical to many petitions that have been 
presented in this Parliament over the past several months. I 
suspect they are part of an organized campaign to deny a 
significant group of Canadians equal rights.
<P>
	I do not believe that we as parliamentarians have the authority 
to extend or deny any person's right on the basis of petitioners' 
personal convictions or beliefs. We have the important 
responsibility of ensuring that all Canadians have the same 
rights. Without this none of us has any true guarantees.

	These petitioners want to draw the attention of the House to 
the fact that Canada's investment climate is forcing its mineral 
industry to look for new opportunities elsewhere. The Canadian 
Mineral Industry Federation has prepared a 10 point program of 
action to be addressed by both the mineral industry and the

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the amendment lost. The next 
question is on the main motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak in the debate on second reading of Bill 
C-44, which proposes amendments to the Immigration Act, the 
Citizenship Act and the Customs Act.
<P>
	Before getting into the details of this bill, I would like to offer 
a few observations and comments that should make us think 
about the impact of the decisions we will be asked to make ask a 
result of Bill C-44.
<P>
	In part I of Canada's immigration policy document, when 
referring to the broad objectives, paragraphs <I>(i)</I> and <I>(j)</I> clearly 
state the needs, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>i</I>) to maintain and protect the health, safety and good order of Canadian 
society; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>j</I>) to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian 
territory to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Obviously, the party I represent fully agrees with this 
position. These are principles and objectives that we support 
because they reflect a broad consensus in a society that is based 
on the rule of law.
<P>
	There are also a number of concerns directly related to Bill 
C-44 which remain essential to an understanding of the issues.
<P>
	During the consultations on immigration conducted recently 
by the minister, someone said that intolerance was the biggest 
growth industry in Canada. Intolerance produces hysteria, 
racism and fear, so that reality becomes clouded by one's 
perception of reality. That is why the public has been led to 
believe for some time that criminal immigrants are countless in 
our society. It will soon come to think that crime is a 
characteristic of immigrants.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	So, we must firmly oppose the spreading of deformed and 
false information about immigration that prevents a trust 
relationship from being created between the welcoming society 
and immigrants.
<P>
	Last year, an in-house study by the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration reminded us that there are no links between the 
ethnic origin and a propensity to crime. Unlike what some 
popular trend would lead us to believe, Mr. Derek Thomas, a 
senior researcher with the department, confirms that people 
born in other countries and now living in Canada are 
under-represented in our prisons.
<P>
	While 20.2 per cent of the Canadian population is comprised 
of newcomers, these same people only represent 11.9 per cent of 
prisoners or those on  probation, that is half of that. Again, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6006"> 6006 </A></B>
<P>
unlike some popular clichés, visible minorities were not 
over-represented in criminal statistics.
<P>
	Because of the many questions that are being asked by the 
public and the concerns that it is showing, it is worth reminding 
that the crime rate in this country has been reduced by 5 per cent 
in 1993. According to the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics: 
``For the second consecutive year, the crime rate reported by 
police services has dropped in 1993. The 5 per cent reduction 
has been the most important on a year-to-year basis since 
criminal statistics were first collected in 1962''. These are the 
facts.
<P>
	That confirms what I was saying earlier about reality and 
perceptions. While the public thinks that the overall crime rate 
has increased, that is not the reality. The same goes for the link 
that the public is trying to establish between immigration and 
crime. I do not intend in any way to trivialize criminal activities, 
because they really do exist in our society and everywhere in 
Canada.
<P>
	I know that the public is concerned for its safety. Surveys are 
showing that. However, let us get things straight. This House has 
the duty to rely on facts and act accordingly. One also has to 
wonder about and to denounce the source of these errors and 
perceptions of the public. This House should not be a reflection 
of papers like <I>Allô Police</I> or media sensationalism which 
overexpose individual cases and give the impression that they 
are now the norm in Canada.
<P>
	It is unbelievable that after trying to blame young people for 
every ill under the sun, we are now targeting immigrants. Should 
we not ask ourselves whether social and economic conditions 
have more to do with crime than immigration? The difficulties 
that immigrant families and young people in particular have to 
face-lack of money, lack of jobs, lack of training-have 
probably more to do with crime than immigration as such.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I now want to go back to the wording of Bill C-44 introduced 
by the government on June 17 of this year. Its object is to tighten 
the provisions of the Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act to 
reduce the legal recourse of immigrants and refugee claimants 
found guilty of crimes in Canada.
<P>
	First, I would like to stress that government has indeed the 
right and the duty to protect its citizens against crime. In that 
sense the Official Opposition is not against trying to make sure 
that dangerous criminals do not prolong their stay or settle in 
Quebec or Canada. We support the underlying principles of Bill 
C-44, but we seriously question the nature of some of the 
proposed measures.
<P>
	The first question we have is about the rationale for such a 
bill. Do we have specific reasons to seek to tighten the 
legislation because of criminal activity, especially among 
immigrants and refugees? How can we explain the increased 
opposition to criminal immigrants in the public opinion in 
English Canada? Could it be that a wave of disinformation has 
influenced English Canadians, giving rise to fear and almost 
xenophobic attitudes?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, beyond these apprehensions, there are specific 
provisions in Bill C-44 that we are concerned about. The most 
important of these provisions is the explicit intent to eliminate 
the right to appeal for immigrants and refugees charged with an 
offence punishable by a minimum ten-year jail sentence. This 
seems to be contrary to the fundamental principles a so-called 
``just'' society should be based on. We all remember who 
promoted this concept. What we are demanding today is a 
society as just as when it first became a buzzword. The Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms must apply to everyone when it 
comes to fair and equitable proceedings.
<P>
	There is another element of this bill which causes us some 
concern; it has to do with sentencing. Bill C-44 only takes into 
account the maximum sentence for a given crime instead of the 
particular sentence handed down by the judge. Indeed, even 
though under the Criminal Code a particular crime is punishable 
by a ten-year jail sentence, the courts use the sentencing 
principles to determine the penalty.
<P>
	For example, break and enter in a private home is punishable 
by life; offences such as being an accessory to counterfeiting 
credit cards could justify the deportation of the accused to his 
country of origin.
<P>
	As you know, the sentences handed down are generally far 
less severe than the maximum permitted. In some cases, instead 
of a fine or a jail term, the sentence may even be suspended or 
the accused put on probation. As a consequence, an individual 
who receives a light sentence could still be forced to leave the 
country.
<P>
	This provision could contravene the Geneva convention. The 
handbook of the High Commissioner for Refugees stipulates and 
I quote: ``In evaluating the nature of the crime presumed to have 
been committed, all the relevant factors-including any 
mitigating circumstances-must be taken into account''.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-44 should take these comments into consideration.
<P>
	Another aspect not covered in Bill C-44 is the distinction 
between a political crime and a crime under common law. We 
find it disturbing that someone would be removed from Canada 
for, say, political reasons, without regard for the risks awaiting 
him in his country of origin. This sort of rule clearly lacks 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6007"> 6007 </A></B>
<P>
flexibility and humanity. Should we not weigh the risks 
involved against the acts committed?
<P>
	Other important questions come to mind. What will happen to 
permanent residents who have been living in Canada for several 
years? In some cases, they came to this country as children. Now 
adults, they work here, have families here and barely remember 
their country of origin. They no longer have friends or family 
there. This is the reality. These people are in fact Quebecers or 
Canadians. Is returning them to their country of origin a good 
solution, the right solution?
<P>
	Other aspects of this bill also deserve our attention. The bill 
the minister has tabled proposes to grant immigration officers 
the authority to seize and open all parcels and documents 
suspected of being used for fraudulent purposes. Is this not 
contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? I 
think it is. Under our legal system the accused is presumed 
innocent. This right must apply to everyone.
<P>
	The provisions for the seizure of mail reverse the burden of 
proof. On what basis would a seizure be carried out and how 
would the nature of the parcels be determined? These questions 
are weighty ones.
<P>
	The Bill also provides that certain decisions formerly taken 
by the Immigration and Refugee Board, the IRB, will henceforth 
be taken by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and his 
officials. On the one hand, the minister is being given new 
authority to appeal decisions made by adjudicators, and on the 
other hand the board is being denied the right to review cases for 
humanitarian reasons. Is this a case of the administrative 
process being politicized? Is it an attack on the independence of 
the IRB? Would it not be better to try to improve the operation of 
the board? I think it would.
<P>
	There are other aspects of this bill I could question. We will 
have the opportunity to discuss it further in the standing 
committee dealing with the issue. A study released by 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada this summer showed that 
the whereabouts of 1,888 foreign criminals slated for 
deportation remained unknown. Is there no way of locating 
these individuals and trying to prevent this kind of thing from 
happening in the future without putting up yet more entry 
barriers, and thus risk finding ourselves in embarrassing 
situations like the ones described earlier?
<P>
	Do missing foreign criminals constitute a specific problem? 
In other words, are there more of these criminals than Canadian 
or Quebec ones? How many Canadians and Quebecers is the 
police unsuccessfully trying to locate at present? Are their 
numbers substantially lower than those of immigrants who are 
sought by police?
<P>
	To better inform and reassure the public, the elected 
government, this Liberal government, should release all the 
information relating to the issue of foreign criminals.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Immigrants and refugee claimants would not be subjected to 
this witch hunt then. I wish to make it clear that the Bloc 
Quebecois is aware of the problem created by foreign criminals 
currently in Canada. We also know that criminal activity causes 
turmoil and fright in local communities.
<P>
	We will support the government in its efforts to find a fair and 
lasting solution to this problem. We entirely agree with 
immigrants and refugee claimants not being allowed to use our 
immigration legislation or the reputation of Canada or Quebec 
to flee their country of origin, where they have committed 
serious crimes. We are in complete agreement with that.
<P>
	However, we shall not let ourselves be distracted by 
unfounded remarks which, as we pointed out, may not reflect the 
reality. It seems that the Canadian government is presently 
taking a more radical stance to appeal to a certain constituency. 
Just think of the young offenders legislation passed this past 
session. Think also of the stronger and stronger reservations 
expressed by the Liberal caucus about gun control or concerning 
Motion M-157 put forward by the Liberal member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River to reduce immigration levels in 
times of economic recession.
<P>
	While on the subject, I might add that Bill C-44 like many 
other government initiatives does not reflect the Quebec reality. 
Public opinion in Quebec reacts quite differently from our 
Canadian neighbours with respect to how crime and 
immigration should be tied together.
<P>
	As pointed out quite rightly in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, last week, 
the people of Quebec did not let a few sordid cases reported 
recently in Canada, and which we deplore, influence their 
attitude or behaviour toward immigration. Perhaps this is 
another characteristic of Quebec's distinctiveness, is it not? 
Immigrants are a fundamental addition to the Canadian and 
Quebec society and they contribute undeniably to its collective 
wealth. Legislation to deny the right of entry and asylum to 
criminals should not put us in an awkward position.
<P>
	There are sometimes discrepancies between the goals set and 
the measures put forward to achieve them. Bill C-44 as tabled in 
second reading seems to be so afflicted. In light of the questions 
and comments raised by the members of this House, we express 
the wish that the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration improve this legislation and, in so doing, restore 
the trust of the Canadian and Quebec public in their institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker,I 
certainly thank the member for his presentation. I believe it 
lacks in some areas given the fact that, as the member must 
realize, the accord Quebec has with the federal government 
regarding immigration is substantially different from the rest of 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6008"> 6008 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know if he is aware of that. He might be to some 
degree. He mentioned in his presentation that the attitude in 
Quebec and that of Quebecers is different with reference to 
immigration than it is in the rest of Canada. Does the member 
realize that with the Quebec-Canada accord only 16 per cent of 
the total immigration flow is into the province of Quebec? That 
may be very inaccurate. From what I understand, substantial 
numbers leave from year to year. Therefore the figure could be 
closer to 8 per cent or 10 per cent of all immigration into the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I believe that is a very realistic number going into one region 
of the country and I believe that the rest of the country should 
adopt a similar percentage.
<P>
	Does the member realize that the attitude of Quebecers may 
be different because of the fewer problems relating to 
immigration due to lower immigration levels? Would the 
member agree with that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the hon. member for Calgary Northeast for his comments. As I 
said in my speech, there was a steady decline in Canada's crime 
rate in 1992-93.
<P>
	I am aware that Quebec's immigration law is different from 
that in the rest of Canada but it is not so different. As I was 
saying, I think we must be careful. We, as members of 
Parliament, have a duty and a responsibility not to rely only on 
what is written in the newspapers, on some journalists' tendency 
to sensationalize this issue. The fact remains that there has been 
a 5 per cent reduction in the crime rate.
<P>
	It is true that today, some journalists may be tempted to make 
more of a case than the facts warrant. When a vicious crime is 
committed in a small town or community, there may be a 
tendency to exaggerate because it is a highly emotional time. 
But I think that, as members of Parliament, we must stay above 
the fray. We must be compassionate but when we make decisions 
on behalf of all Canadian people, I think me must first look at the 
facts. As I was saying, the facts show a decline in the crime rate.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel 
particularly concerned about the immigration bill introduced by 
the government. I must say that in my riding of Québec-Est 
there is the case of a Mr. Chouaiby, who arrived in Canada from 
Morocco in 1988. In 1989, he committed a robbery during which 
he seriously injured a security guard and, in 1990, he strangled a 
19-year old woman.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	He was sentenced to prison where he spent three years. In 
1993, he got out and was allowed to remain in Canada by the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. They accepted him. They 
allowed him to stay in Canada for another six years, seven years 
in fact, until the year 2000, on the grounds that he could be 
rehabilitated.
<P>
	However, I found their decision totally unacceptable because 
the mother of the woman who was strangled met him on the 
street after he moved back to the same neighbourhood. She saw 
him again several times. What a shock it must have been to see 
her daughter's killer in her own neighbourhood. She had to 
move. The troubled mother then lost her job because of the 
severe psychological shock she experienced. She then had to 
move. She does not work any more and she is still afraid of 
running into this man again in her neighbourhood.
<P>
	I approached the minister of immigration to find out whether 
it is possible to deport this young man who is still violent, who is 
even considered by psychologists and psychiatrists to be very 
violent. The Immigration Act as it now stands and even if it were 
amended by this bill-although we may be in favour of this bill 
in principle-contains many shortcomings. Here is one of them: 
the bill does not deal with such cases, which are quite common 
in Canada. I think there are about 150 similar cases in Canada.
<P>
	We are unable to expel this young man from Canada, at least 
until the year 2000, unless he commits another murder or 
another serious crime. That is ridiculous. It is as though 
Canadian citizens and especially the victim's mother were taken 
hostage by a violent immigrant who may be about to commit 
another act of violence. It is totally absurd. Totally 
unacceptable. This person should have been deported the day 
after he got out of jail. That is an example of the appalling 
mismanagement at the Canadian department of immigration. In 
fact, this case could have been invoked as a reason to tighten this 
act.
<P>
	Of course, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, totally agree with the 
principle of this bill but it contains huge holes, unfortunately. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6009"> 6009 </A></B>
<P>
The minister should review his bill and tighten it so that it can 
tackle the real problems. That is the comment I wanted to make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the member for Québec-Est for his remarks at this point. I think 
that cases like the one he just described for us occur frequently.
<P>
	You know, the question of refugees is in federal jurisdiction. 
We in Quebec have always been open to foreigners. Now, of 
course, cases can arise, as I just said. Now, even though there are 
isolated cases, the law must still be applied. The law must be 
improved, but we must not make a case of it when an immigrant 
is accused. The law must be clear, but we must not make special 
cases. I think it is dangerous to make special cases. That is why 
we will support the bill on second reading; however, we will 
present amendments to improve it on third reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
and an honour to take part in this debate on Bill C-44.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that the member for Québec-Est may be talking 
through his hat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There has already been some healthy debate in this House and 
elsewhere on the important topics of immigration, the 
enforcement of immigration issues, and the removal of a small 
but dangerous criminal element that has managed to infiltrate 
our system.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	I use the word dangerous advisedly here. It works two ways. 
Certainly a few of those serious criminals who have managed to 
slip through the screening net are dangerous to our fellow 
citizens, but they are also dangerous to the health of our entire 
refugee and immigration policy.
<P>
	For years our policies have been the envy of the world. Our 
citizens have had justifiable pride in a system that has both 
helped our country grow and has served as a bright beacon of 
hope on the horizon of a world beset by suffering.
<P>
	Lately there have been tales of abuse of the immigration and 
refugee process. It is not widespread but it is enough to cause 
concern and concern can be healthy. When we are concerned 
about abuse and crime it is natural that the entire system comes 
under scrutiny. I am sure it is healthy for any process to get a 
periodic re-evaluation.
<P>
	The danger we face now is that the repeated tales of 
wrongdoing, stories in the newspapers about criminals using red 
tape or quirky regulations to avoid departure, television stories 
about senseless crime involving people who perhaps should 
have been deported long ago are taking their toll on human faith 
and on charity. We are beginning to doubt the validity of the 
entire system. We cannot allow this to happen. A criminal few 
should not shake our faith in a system that has been decent and 
good and an example to the world. That is why this legislation  is 
so important. I would hope that the hon. member for Québec-Est 
might see that and might possibly see his way clear to 
supporting it.
<P>
	Just the other day in one of the newspapers I saw a map of the 
world reproduced. The headline on the map was ``Tracking the 
tide of human suffering''. Almost every corner of the globe was 
covered, from the slaughterhouses of the Balkans to the killing 
fields of Africa with horror stopovers in between.
<P>
	We are seeing borders erased, vast legions of humanity on the 
move and migrations of people on a scale never before 
witnessed in human history. Here we are in one of the safest, 
healthiest and wealthiest nations in the world letting doubts and 
uncertainty cloud policies that have helped make us healthy, 
wealthy and safe and that have brought new hope and relieved 
the suffering of millions. I might add those policies have 
allowed all of us, or nearly all of us who sit in this House to be 
here, either ourselves, our parents, our grandparents, whomever.
<P>
	We have in our hands the ability to restore faith in a process 
that has helped shape our destiny as a nation. The amendments 
enclosed in these few pages will help us get rid of the hiding 
places for criminals. I am not talking about criminal hideouts, 
something you might find in the movies. I am talking about the 
loopholes and anomalies of the law.
<P>
	Changes to these points of law coupled with other parts to the 
multi-pronged strategy to curtail abuse of our immigration laws 
as outlined by the minister earlier will do a great deal to restore 
faith in a system which needs some bolstering. Let me point to a 
few of those loopholes and anomalies as I see them.
<P>
	This legislation eliminates the possibility of one person 
having a number of refugee claims at the same time. It allows us 
to take serious criminals out of the refugee process. It also 
means we will not have to go behind penitentiary walls for 
hearings for convicted murderers who claim to be refugees.
<P>
	Until these amendments came forward there was nothing 
officials could do to stop the citizenship process when a person 
was subject to an immigration inquiry and of course we cannot 
deport a citizen. With these changes the citizenship process 
stops cold until any immigration proceedings are concluded.
<P>
	There is nothing here that should cause any alarm for real 
refugees and most of the immigrants Canada has been receiving 
over the years. Critics who say these amendments hurt real 
refugees and upright immigrants should think again. They 
should think of the tremendous waste of time and energy 
tracking down scofflaws. No, these changes do not hurt the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6010"> 6010 </A></B>
<P>
innocent but they will bring an increased sense of justice and 
integrity to the immigration and refugee system.
<P>
	The amendments take away a few legal hidey-holes that have 
camouflaged a small criminal minority and they put some 
integrity back in the system. It is actions like these which will 
take us a long way toward restoring some of the faith in the 
system, faith that may have been lost in recent months and years.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Before I close my remarks I would like to take a moment to 
deal with an issue which has caused some criticism of the 
legislation. That is the resolution to take the decision making to 
allow a serious criminal to stay in Canada for humanitarian or 
compassionate reasons away from the immigration appeal 
division and put it in the hands of the minister.
<P>
	This is not a plot to rob the appeal division of power, it is 
simply making the system more accountable. The immigration 
appeal division may still review these cases on questions of law 
and fact. The way it stands now, the minister must deal with the 
consequences of allowing a serious criminal to stay in Canada, 
but the minister does not take part in the decision making that 
led to those consequences.
<P>
	If this legislation is approved, the government does not 
project or predict that far fewer removal orders will be stopped. 
What we do say is that our goal will be to protect Canadians who 
might be a danger but to still recognize the fact that some serious 
criminals should be allowed to remain here on humanitarian 
grounds.
<P>
	There is a chance with this legislation to restore some faith in 
the system. Let us be honest here, governments do not get too 
many chances. If we fail on this we may not get another chance. 
That is why we take it so seriously. That is why we have zero 
tolerance for this kind of behaviour.
<P>
	Let us be very blunt about this. If Canadians turn their backs 
on our refugee and immigration policies, the world will be a 
much darker and bleaker place. None of us should be playing 
politics with an issue which, if we look at the world around us, is 
a life and death issue for far too many people.
<P>
	I urge all members to move this legislation forward swiftly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the parliamentary secretary. What in this 
legislation addresses the concern of the member for 
Québec-Est, removing violent criminals who are not citizens of 
this country? What in the legislation deals with that problem?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast is speaking for the member for Québec-Est, 
who I am sure will manage to speak for himself as well.
<P>
	At any rate I would suggest that the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast read the legislation. It is there in the bill. Perhaps if 
the hon. member is having some difficulty with the 
interpretation he could check with one of his female 
colleagues-I am sorry but I forget the hon. member's 
riding-who I know is a member of the bar. She or perhaps the 
justice critic might be able to help him.
<P>
	However it definitely is in the legislation. I am sure if the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast reads it quite carefully he will 
see what is there.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, with great respect I think 
members should try to treat each other with a little bit more 
respect than was just given in that answer. I wonder if the 
parliamentary secretary has any comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary 
has no comment on that except to say she is mystified at your 
remarks. I do not understand. Perhaps you could explain. I am 
sorry.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions or comments, the hon. 
member for Bourassa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. She is a great 
expert and very competent in the field. She did outstanding work 
when she was in the opposition, but I admit that I do not follow 
what she was saying in her speech today. On the one hand, she 
talks a very humanitarian line, she always did, but on the other, 
how can she justify this Bill C-44 which I think is contrary to 
several principles of the Geneva convention?
<P>
	For example, a political crime is not distinguished from a 
common law crime. How can she justify transferring much of 
the IRB's mandate to the department and the minister? For 
example, how can she justify no longer allowing permanent 
residents who have been here for 10, 20 or 30 years to appeal to 
the appeal division of the IRB?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
She will expel these people because they committed a crime 
punishable by 10 or more years in penitentiary but in fact were 
fined, given a suspended sentence or put on probation. Why did 
the parliamentary secretary not admit, as the member of our 
party just said, that the crime rate has gone down in Canada in 
recent years and fell by 5 per cent in 1993?
<P>
	Why does she not admit that the crime rate for immigrants is 
lower than the crime rate for Canadians who were born here and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6011"> 6011 </A></B>
<P>
that on the whole immigrants are more law abiding than 
Canadians born here? I do not  follow her. I admit that she is very 
competent, she knows the field well and she has always taken a 
very humane position in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I reassure the hon. critic for the 
Bloc, the member for Bourassa, that we will not be deporting 
people who do not break the law.
<P>
	We agree with him very strongly that the crime rate for 
immigrants and refugees in this country is indeed lower than the 
national average, absolutely and no question. He could look it up 
as I am sure he has.
<P>
	I would like to correct a couple of things. It may have been a 
difficulty in the translation but with regard to the offences it is 
one indictable offence under the law and two summary 
conviction offences.
<P>
	Perhaps I did not get the question on that. If the hon. member 
wants to rephrase it or ask me again, I will try to get it. It is fairly 
straightforward. If there is a problem there I would be happy to 
address it.
<P>
	On the question of right of appeal, the right of appeal to the 
appeal division of the Immigration and Refugee Board is still 
there on questions of law and questions of fact. There is now a 
humane and compassionate right of appeal to the minister. As I 
said in my speech, the reason for it is that the minister deals with 
the consequences. It is a question of accountability, as the 
member knows. We as elected members of Parliament are 
accountable to our electorate in four to five years.
<P>
	In consequence, because the minister bears the responsibility 
in the House but the Immigration and Refugee Board is as it 
should be on questions of fact and law at arm's length from the 
minister, the minister now has a place to make decisions based 
on humane and compassionate grounds.
<P>
	As I said in my speech as well, we do not expect the number of 
appeals granted to go up in leaps and bounds, but this is yet 
another safeguard of the humane and compassionate grounds 
rooted in political accountability.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
give the member for Halifax a chance to redeem herself, I would 
like to ask her essentially the same question that my colleague 
from the Reform Party just asked her, which she did not answer. 
Would she be so kind as to tell me how this bill will deal with a 
case like the one I mentioned before?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with some trepidation that I get 
into these waters again. The hon. member did bring up a specific 
case in his remarks. I am sorry but I did not hear the full details 
of the specific case.
<P>
	It would not be wise, as I am sure Mr. Speaker would agree 
with me, to comment on the specifics of a case. I would be 
happy, as I frequently do for other members of the House, to 
look at the file the hon. member is talking about. If he would like 
to see me either in my office or in the lobby to deal with the 
specific case I would be happy to look at it. However I think it 
would be unwise to deal with specifics in the matter of general 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to some of the debate that just 
went on with the hon. member for Québec-Est. He cited 
examples of abuse of the system. Even the answers of the 
parliamentary secretary made reference to some concerns that 
are purportedly in the legislation. Perhaps we will establish in 
what I am about to say that they are not in the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on the 
amendments to the Immigration Act contained in Bill C-44, 
dealing with deportation and the strengthening of the 
enforcement system to deal with the threat of criminals entering 
into Canada. This is an area which has been in need of a serious 
overhaul for a long time. It is an area which my party has 
brought to the attention of the House and the minister on 
numerous occasions. Reform members have been forceful in 
their desire to see serious and strong amendments brought 
forward in the area of immigration.
<P>
	While I am glad to see our efforts finally being acknowledged 
by the government, the bill is only a partial step forward. I 
believe Bill C-44 may do more harm than good by luring us into 
a false sense of security.
<P>
	Canadians will be told that immigration has been amended 
and that criminals will now be kept out of the country, but this is 
not the case nor will it be. Canadians need to know the facts. The 
issue must not be glossed over by the efforts of the government 
to pretend that its stop gap measure will actually stop anything 
at all.
<P>
	The bill amending the Immigration Act falls short of its 
desired goal because the system has not been redesigned to 
accommodate the changes. It is the system itself that is at fault. 
As we have seen in countless legislative examples past and 
present, without a willingness to make core systemic change 
tinkering with legislation will not work. There must not only 
appear to be a willingness to address criminality in our 
immigration process, but real will must produce some of the 
results we see are lacking in the system.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is a step in the right direction in that it will help 
ensure that criminals are kept out of the immigration system 
once they are identified. And once they are identified it does 
limit the appeals they will have.
<P>
	However the bill is impotent in that persons with a serious 
criminal past can arrive and stay in Canada free to move about as 
they wish with no restraints. Persons entering into Canada will 
still not have a security check done on them until just prior to a 
refugee hearing or  when they fill out an application for 
permanent residence. Yes, immediate steps will then be taken to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6012"> 6012 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that a criminal is removed and that is good, but that is 
very similar to someone drawing up a plan to get a fox out of the 
hen house after the fox has had his run through the place. The 
goal is not to set up a strategy to get the fox once he is in the hen 
house. The goal should be to set up a system whereby we can 
prevent him from entering the hen house at all.
<P>
	We have the people on the frontline who are there to interview 
those who make a claim for refugee status at the port of entry. 
Why do we not empower them to make an inquiry as to whether 
or not the applicant is a wanted criminal or someone with a 
serious criminal past? We do not even equip them with the 
necessary tools to make such an inquiry. We even go as far as to 
leave the door on the hen house unlocked and open with a sign 
that reads: ``If you are found to be a fox you may be asked to 
leave''.
<P>
	This summer I had the honour of meeting with a group of 
police officers in the 12th Division B Platoon in Westside, 
Toronto, the friends and co-workers of Todd Baylis. This 
25-year old constable was brutally murdered in the line of duty 
by a deportee designate on June 16, 1994.
<P>
	What I saw and felt as I met with them was the grief of men 
and women betrayed by the system they try to uphold. They told 
of harassment, lack of information, lack of immigration 
enforcement, manpower and training, continual imminent 
danger and plummeting morale as they cope with life and death, 
drugs and violence in a once peaceful community.
<P>
	I read the new legislation and I paused to reflect on their grief 
and anger on the one side and the response from the government. 
The new rules would do nothing to prevent the very same event 
from happening again.
<P>
	I am amazed, as should all Canadians be, that after a senseless 
death-and a full inquiry by the way placed no blame-and the 
consequential drafting of the legislation that Todd Baylis would 
be in the same danger today as he was on that fateful night. 
Shame on those that have been part of this so-called solution. It 
is too late simply to say this tragedy should never have occurred, 
but for the friends of Todd Baylis it is a reality.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative that we as legislators take seriously 
the obligation to tighten up a system that needs a major overhaul 
so that the memory of Constable Baylis will serve as a catalyst to 
ensure that such mistakes do not happen again.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has said that the immigration system was not 
solely at fault in this particular case and the murder was as much 
a product of our society as deserving deportation as an 
immigrant. Unfortunately some truth may be here. This young 
man's pattern of criminality was well established over many 
years. Much of it was under the Young Offenders Act, another 
government system of  rules and excuses that destroys 
accountability and creates a mockery of respect for the laws of 
the land.
<P>
	The government's tinkering in both systems-the 
Immigration Act and the Young Offenders Act-does not reflect 
the will of Canadians or the real need toward the security of our 
streets and homes.
<P>
	Bureaucrats and politicians must wake up and listen to 
Canadians. I have met with shop owners on Queen Street in 
Toronto who watch 100 crack deals a day in front of their empty 
stores. I have talked with struggling immigrant restaurant 
owners whose livelihood investment is being sucked dry by a 
decaying criminal neighbourhood. I receive overwhelming 
community feedback for changes to the age identification and 
record keeping for young offenders. If the government wants 
safe streets and homes, it should make those changes happen and 
make them happen soon.
<P>
	The legislation before us today leaves us with some very 
serious unanswered questions which must be addressed. To 
begin with, there are serious administrative questions. The 
budget for the removals division for fiscal year 1991-92 was 
$13 million. This increased to $23 million in 1993-94. This 77 
per cent increase begs this first question: How was the money 
spent in light of the fact that an administrative nightmare still 
exists in the issuance and tracking of deportation orders?
<P>
	Second, what has happened to the thousands of inactive cases 
we heard about in the inquiry that were kept in boxes in 
immigration offices because there were not enough officers or 
administrative support staff to deal with them? Have they been 
dealt with now?
<P>
	What about the request for a shared database between police 
and immigration agents to help track down those who have 
effectively avoided deportation? Have the department's 
computer systems been brought up to date with regard to 
determining exact numbers of refugees and immigrants that are 
out there facing deportation orders? Has a better system been 
put into place to keep track of those who were supposedly ready 
to leave voluntarily on their deportation orders?
<P>
	Let me expand on the importance of getting answers to these 
questions. This summer there were approximately 26,000 
warrants outstanding on deportation orders. Of these, there were 
approximately 11,000 immigration warrants in the Canadian 
Police Information Centre system which alerts police across the 
country to persons who are arrestable for immigration reasons.
<P>
	There is a great discrepancy in these numbers. The main 
problem is the poor administration in this crucial area. Police 
are often not aware of whether or not the person they are dealing 
with is under a deportation order. Those people in the system 
and operating it are not even fully aware of the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6013"> 6013 </A></B>
<P>
deportation orders that are still active because of all the 
unknowns currently existing in the system.
<P>
	For example, there is no way of currently knowing if a person 
has indeed left the country, or even if they were requested to do 
so, unless they were escorted out or informed the immigration 
authorities that they were leaving. This must change. There 
exists a serious flaw within the present deportation system 
where great emphasis is placed upon personal compliance with 
the order to leave.
<P>
	In response to a request by the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, Mr. Hallam Johnston from the 
department agreed to provide members of the committee with a 
list of impediments to removal. I quote from his reply:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most significant impediment to removal is the failure of persons to effect 
their open removal from Canada. Some examples of this include (1) failure to 
comply with the deportation order; (2) failure to show up for removal 
arrangements (approximately a 40 per cent no-show rate experienced), and (3) 
failure to appear at port of entry to effect the removal after arrangements have 
been completed (approximately a 10 per cent no-show rate experienced).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lack of travel documents is also an impediment in effecting removals. 
Foreign governments require returning citizens to be in possession of a valid 
passport or other re-entry document. The difficulty is to secure a document and 
satisfy the foreign government that the person being returned is a citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Nowhere within this amendment is there reason to believe 
that this serious problem in supervising the deportation of those 
requested to leave Canada has been addressed. It is ridiculous to 
continue in this pattern. For the department to even admit that its 
biggest obstacle in carrying out deportations is the failure of 
people to remove themselves is incredulous. How can 
Canadians feel their confidence in this government is well 
founded when they hear reports like that? How can Canadians 
feel reassured that they are safe and secure that criminals will be 
deported when this government has been relying on the 
criminals checking themselves out of the country?
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It should also not be of any surprise to us that foreign 
governments are reluctant to take their citizens back when they 
discover they are being deported for criminal activity.
<P>
	The ironies of deportation of professional criminals was 
pointed out this weekend in a national news report. It was 
reported that Canada returned 227 deportees to Jamaica from 
January to July of this year, one-quarter of the total from all 
sources. It also pointed out that wealthy countries such as 
Canada are viewed by some countries as dumping our problems 
on them.
<P>
	Does this government have a plan to assure Canadians that 
proper and sufficient paper work will be available for needed 
deportations even in the face of resistance or lack of 
co-operation from receiving nations?
<P>
	Once those criminals are deported, can this government 
assure us through the integrity of our own system that those 
same individuals will be made to stay out?
<P>
	In most cases the problems should have been averted by 
denying access of the criminals to Canada in the first place. This 
could be accomplished by having the proper computer system 
set up that is linked into the CPIC and Interpol systems and able 
to do a criminal record check on anyone applying for refugee 
status at the port of entry. This must be a priority.
<P>
	There is also a problem with too few investigators doing the 
job with very little training and lack of proper backup and 
protection. Is it any surprise that a large number of deportations 
being carried out each year are served against those who are 
charged with overstaying their visitors' visas? These are 
grandmothers and grandfathers visiting kids, not dangerous 
criminals. Why should this change? Has the need for more 
investigators, better administrative support and working 
computer systems been established yet? Are police constables 
like Todd Baylis walking the beat on our city streets better 
informed now than they were in June?
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has stated there 
are three main objectives to his removal strategy: getting 
foreign criminals out of Canada, ensuring compliance with 
removal orders, and ensuring that failed refugee claimants are 
removed properly.
<P>
	On July 7 the minister stated: ``This government has adopted 
clear priorities for removals. Our top priority is to remove 
criminals. Those who present a danger to Canadian society and 
those who wilfully abuse the immigration system will be clearly 
identified and we will take whatever action is necessary to see 
that these people are removed from Canada. The legislation and 
other measures I have introduced related to criminality will 
allow immigration officials to take prompt, decisive action in 
these cases''.
<P>
	These are tough words. The minister must have a great deal of 
confidence in his present system to believe that it can 
accomplish these objectives without very major overhauls to the 
system of which to date there has been no sign.
<P>
	Is this minister willing to back up these words by putting his 
job on the line? Will he resign his position as minister if his new 
task force and deportation plan are ineffective in preventing any 
more tragedies like those we heard about this morning and that 
have occurred even in this last year?
<P>
	The commitment made by the minister is not new. It has been 
made in the past by other administrations but this minister has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6014"> 6014 </A></B>
<P>
promised immediate action. How has his promise been 
translated into action? This week there  was a report in the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> suggesting that Pearson International Airport 
authorities and facilities were unable to cope with new arrivals. 
Criminals were slipping through desperately overcrowded 
immigration facilities and given free access to our communities.
<P>
	How can this minister believe we can have confidence in task 
forces and deportation plans when the system he claims to be 
adequate continues to justify the deep concern that Canadians 
have about an immigration system that is not working?
<P>
	Since the immigration-RCMP task force came into effect in 
July it has identified 1,888 deportation cases involving 
criminality. How effective has his prompt decisive action been?
<P>
	Out of all the cases identified a total of 14 have been removed 
from Canada. That is less than .7 per cent of the total number 
identified. As a matter of fact the task force has discovered that 
another 14 of the individuals being sought have been found to be 
deceased. At least the task force is keeping even in its efforts in 
this particular statistic.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Another thing for us to remember is that a task force is a 
temporary measure, not a permanent one. How can Bill C-44 be 
properly implemented when the task force and its personnel are 
no longer working on these cases? Where will the personnel 
come from? Who will be serving the deportation notices? Who 
will be monitoring the outcome and ensuring that those required 
to leave are doing so? What permanent steps are being taken to 
deal with the shortcomings in the system and the great need to 
implement the changes being proposed.
<P>
	When one looks at the numbers released by the task force in 
August, it is interesting to note that 414 of these cases are 
presently in the judicial system. Another 779 are currently 
awaiting decisions on their claims for review of their cases. 
Another 532 are under investigation. Does this mean they are 
currently being looked for?
<P>
	A major flaw in this legislation is that it presumes that 
someone with a serious criminal past will come to Canada and 
then appear at a refugee determination hearing where a security 
check will finally be done. It presumes upon the criminal mind 
that they will wait to be discovered instead of immediately 
going underground to prevent themselves from facing automatic 
deportation. There is nothing in the system or the amendments 
to prevent them from doing so.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must ask ourselves whether or not these 
steps are a real solution to the problem or simply a reaction to a 
crisis. For example, we have yet to see how the system will deal 
with those who have criminal records for a string of offences 
including assault for which a 10-year maximum sentence does 
not apply. These are people who may be powder kegs ready to 
blow and yet the immigration system will take no action against 
them because they have not yet committed the ultimate crime. 
This particular amendment, like the Young Offenders  Act, 
completely ignores repeat criminal activity to the peril of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The fact that we need tough legislation in this area is apparent 
enough to the people of my riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam. 
Just mention the name of Michael Drake there to someone and 
you can see the anger flare up as they realize the system is still 
trying to deport this convicted child molester back to the United 
States. Not only has Drake been successful in deferring his 
deportation orders time and time again but he has been 
successful in ensuring that he is free to roam the streets while he 
awaits his hearing.
<P>
	It is our responsibility to see that the laws are in effect that 
will end these kinds of travesties. Bill C-44 in itself will not 
make the necessary changes needed to right the wrongs created 
by a system that suffers so greatly from neglect. But we as 
legislators need to ensure that any changes we propose to the 
system are aimed at the heart of the problem and not simply at 
the needs of the moment.
<P>
	We need to equip those in the trenches not just with a book of 
rules but with the tools to do the job. We need to assure the 
shopkeepers, the businessmen, the parents and the police, 
Canadians by birth or by choice that they do not need to fear the 
system that should protect them.
<P>
	Bill C-44 regarding the amendments to the Immigration Act 
is a step in the right direction. However this legislation alone 
cannot make the system succeed. The government must go 
further to demonstrate its commitment to the safety of all 
Canadians in their homes and on their streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam for a very clear presentation. I would remind 
her to look at the minister's remarks when he introduced the bill 
when he said: ``Throughout the years immigrants have helped 
build our country. The contributions of recent immigrants are 
also widely recognized. But Canadians will not tolerate and I 
will not tolerate those who abuse our generosity and violate our 
laws''. That is what this bill is attempting to do, to remove any 
immigrant or refugee who violates our laws.
<P>
	We have heard from the Reform Party how we must reduce our 
annual deficit and public debt. I agree with the Reform Party on 
that. To do what the Reform Party wants in immigration will 
require additional resources, additional personnel resources, 
additional financial resources.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6015"> 6015 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam 
where her party suggests we get the additional funds to 
implement what the Reform Party would like to see in Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I would like to comment on what he said aside from 
his question.
<P>
	Certainly in my comments I sought to address the needs of all 
Canadians by birth or by choice. All immigrants are not 
criminals. In fact very few are. It is the same as with all 
Canadians. Very few are involved in criminal activity. It is the 
immigrants as much as Canadians who suffer from the abuse of 
our immigration system. I want to make that very clear. That is 
my purpose. The people whom I met in Toronto were 
immigrants who were victims of what was happening by the 
abuse of this system. I speak for them as I speak for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	What the hon. member says is true. We feel that for the sake of 
the integrity of the immigration system for Canadians and new 
immigrants the present system is not working. It is not working 
in the criminal element. It is not working in the way that 
immigrants are welcomed into Canadian society.
<P>
	We need people who can come here who have jobs available to 
them. We need to provide a future for people who come to this 
country.
<P>
	True, we need to get our fiscal house in order. We need to 
make our economy work. We also need to provide those 
opportunities for the people who come here. We have to select 
the people so that they have the opportunity when they get here. 
If we bring people here with no future for them, is that fair to 
them or is that fair to the fellow Canadians that they join?
<P>
	Yes, the immigration numbers need to be addressed so that we 
have an economic mix that works for all Canadians new and old. 
By doing that we will in fact be more than able to afford it 
because it will work for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the greatest respect for my colleague from Port 
Moody-Coquitlam. We serve on the same committee together. 
She is well known for her carefully reasoned remarks on all 
issues.
<P>
	I must say that I was surprised that in her speech she 
suggested this bill does not provide sufficient precautions for 
keeping deported criminals from re-entering the country. I was 
surprised at that remark because coming from a western 
province she will know that Canada has one of the longest 
undefended borders in the world and that it is traditionally and 
always has been impossible to keep illegals of all sorts from 
crossing the border at one point or another.
<P>
	I would suggest to her that this bill addresses that fact by its 
provisions for the seizure of false documents. The way our 
security authorities keep track of illegals, be they criminals or 
otherwise, is by the fact that their documentation eventually 
comes under scrutiny and thus raises a red flag for the proper 
authorities to take action.
<P>
	I point out that we are talking here about criminals who as a 
means of getting back into this country and staying in this 
country falsify passports, drivers' licences, health cards, birth 
certificates and so on.
<P>
	I would request that my colleague opposite comment on this. 
Surely she would agree that this is a fine and progressive 
measure in this bill to close this loophole of false documentation 
to get these illegals out of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
comments and his question. I do commend this legislation for 
the fact that it does close that loophole of allowing illegal 
documents into the country. The fact that that was previously 
allowed astounds me. It seems most appropriate that now there 
is legislation in place which says no, these will not be allowed in 
the country.
<P>
	However I do not know if I have quite addressed the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	That legislation is toward the boxes of illegal documents that 
would come through our postal service and then be available 
within this country for people to use here. The thing you were 
referring to though was people coming across our borders from 
outside with illegal documents. That part of the legislation 
would in no way affect someone presenting themselves at our 
border from outside with documents that were illegal or 
falsified. It could not affect that particular case.
<P>
	It is at that point where our present system has no check point. 
We take a person's word for it. They come into our country and 
then are not actually processed by a security system until they 
then present themselves for a refugee hearing or some other kind 
of a hearing.
<P>
	I go back to the comment I made earlier. We let the foxes into 
the hen house and then expect them to show up for a process that 
will then check their validity. There is the problem and that is 
not addressed by this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, hon. 
members of this House, I am proud to rise to support Bill C-44, 
an act to amend the Immigration Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a great and generous country. Its doors have always 
been open to welcome all people who dreamed of a better future, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6016"> 6016 </A></B>
<P>
people who came for a better life in a country free of civil 
violence or war in order to raise a family in one of the best 
countries in the world, as the UN so honoured us not once but 
twice.
<P>
	These immigrants, people like my parents, became Canadian 
citizens and participate actively in all facets of our society. 
Canada's history is full of stories of immigrants who through 
their hard work and perseverance have made this country what it 
is today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Throughout our history, immigrants have come to Canada. 
These immigrants included some individuals guilty of serious 
offences. Amendments must be made in order to put a stop to 
this problem and to correct some flaws in the Immigration Act. I 
want to discuss these changes, because Canadians rely on us to 
protect them and their children. They rely on the department of 
immigration as well as on Canadian police forces at the 
municipal, provincial, territorial and national levels. But first 
and foremost, they rely on the government to pass legislation 
that will protect their interests.
<P>
	In its present form, the Immigration Act contains complex 
provisions as well as loopholes which allow criminals to abuse 
the system.
<P>
	Every day, you meet people who were not born in Canada. 
These persons overcame various difficulties to come here with 
more or less money, and they adapted to our society. I am one of 
them.
<P>
	If you ask these persons what they think of criminals and 
individuals who abuse the system you will see that, like the rest 
of us, they are frustrated, shocked and resentful. They also fear 
that all immigrants will be assimilated to these offenders.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is an essential piece of legislation if we are to meet 
the expectations of all Canadians. It brings solutions to specific 
problems. We must send back those who are not deserving of our 
institutions and who only want to take advantage of our 
generosity, while hurting the reputation of honest immigrants 
and genuine refugees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada's immigration policy plays a key role in our country's 
future. We believe strongly that Canada must conserve this 
policy and the changes which we are proposing today will help 
to alleviate the abuses in the system and the problems that exist.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister of immigration said, on August 24, at the annual 
conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police: ``I 
will not tolerate those who take advantage of our generosity and 
violate our laws. No Canadian should put up with such an insult. 
A good immigration policy is one that ensures a balance 
between equity and tolerance, on one hand, and law 
enforcement, on the other hand.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to have to go looking for these people; I want 
them out of the country''.
<P>
	Remember that Canada has an immigration program that is 
the envy of the whole world. We cannot let a handful of 
individuals discredit it and take advantage of us. We have a good 
program, but it needs to be changed and fast.
<P>
	The problems in this area are long-standing. It would be 
pointless to search for their causes. We need to act now and to 
take whatever action is necessary.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to go over the four-point 
strategy announced by the minister of Immigration last June.
<P>
	First, we want to amend the Immigration Act in order to 
reduce fraudulent claims and improve law enforcement 
measures, which should help us stop criminals from cheating the 
system.
<P>
	Second, we want to make some changes to the management of 
the immigration appeal division of the IRB and improve the 
decision-making process.
<P>
	Next, we need to exchange information with the Correctional 
Service of Canada on parolees facing deportation, if necessary.
<P>
	Finally, guidelines are being developed to ensure that 
immigration officers are better prepared when they appear 
before the Board to discuss the files of war criminals or people 
who systematically use an assumed identity.
<P>
	Let us review the proposed changes to the act. Right now, the 
immigration appeal division of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board can allow serious criminals to enter Canada and to stay in 
our country for humanitarian reasons. The immigration appeal 
division will lose that authority and only the minister will be 
entitled to allow a permanent resident, someone for example 
who has lived in Canada all his life, to stay in Canada for 
humanitarian reasons or to deport him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need to prohibit people convicted of serious crimes, 
crimes punishable by a sentence of 10 years or more, from 
claiming refugee status. This should apply whether the crime 
took place in Canada or anywhere else.
<P>
	Dangerous criminals will no longer be able to seek refugee 
status in their goal to postpone removal from this country. We 
need to ensure that criminals are not allowed to ask for refugee 
status.
<P>
	We also need to regulate the problem of multiple applications. 
Last year over 800 people presented more than one claim for 
refugee status. Under the proposed legislation only the first 
claim will be studied by the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6017"> 6017 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to stop the flow of illegal documents used in claims. 
That is why we are proposing to give immigration officers the 
power to seize identity documents from the international mail 
that might be used by impostors for fraudulent or improper 
purposes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister instead of the cabinet will be authorized to make 
the decision in all cases of rehabilitation of former offenders. 
Once the Federal Court has determined that a security certificate 
is justified or not, it will no longer be possible to file an appeal 
with the immigration appeal division of the IRB. Let us take 
these measures seriously. Would we not all agree that we need to 
have all the necessary information before we grant these people 
Canadian citizenship? That is exactly what another of these 
changes will ensure.
<P>
	The proposed provisions are reasonable and fair. Contrary to 
what our colleagues opposite have said, these provisions are in 
keeping with the Geneva Convention relating to the refugee 
status where crime is concerned. This is a question of justice, a 
question of democracy.
<P>
	That is why our government is committed to maintaining an 
immigration policy which would truly put a stop to illegal 
immigration and ensure effective control of our borders.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In order to do that, we must establish a close co-operation 
between the various agencies involved in dealing with frauds 
and crimes, for example immigration officers and members of 
the RCMP and of the various police forces.
<P>
	We need all the men and women of local, regional and 
provincial police forces if we are to better enforce the law. Only 
with their co-operation shall we improve our effectiveness in 
getting rid of undesirable elements. We created a partnership 
with the Correctional Service of Canada for that matter and 
foreign offenders will not be allowed to remain in this country 
once they have served their sentences.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, the minister of immigration will be working 
closely with the Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice. 
We are all partners when it comes to maintaining the security 
and prosperity of our country and in preserving our quality of 
life. These measures we are introducing will ensure the integrity 
of Canada's immigration and refugee system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will say it again, not all immigrants are criminals. 
Immigrants have been a part of the development of this country 
since the beginning of our history. Today, in this changing 
world, there is a constant movement of populations and the high 
number of immigrant applications poses crucial problems.
<P>
	I am sure you will be surprised to learn that our officers have 
interviewed more than three million persons last year. Clearer 
legislation would make their work much more efficient. We all 
know that among the immigrants who come to Canada, some set 
up small businesses and contribute to job creation. We would be 
wrong to think they come here to steal our jobs. This is not my 
own saying; it has been demonstrated by statistics. Immigration 
is good for Canada and it must continue to be so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our intention in proposing this legislation is to eliminate the 
small percentage of abusers in our system who profit from the 
loopholes in our law. All immigrants should not have to be made 
to pay for the few individuals who take advantage of our 
country's generosity. Unfortunately this small group of 
immigrants is drawing the attention of the media and of course 
of the opposition which in turn sensationalizes these events and 
causes Canadians to question the integrity of our programs.
<P>
	My experience of 15 years in dealing with immigrants has 
shown me that the large majority of immigrants want to live a 
peaceful and productive life. Just look around this Chamber and 
see how many hon. members are of ethnic origin. Many on this 
side of the House are children of immigrants, including the 
minister of immigration himself, who are now giving back to 
this country what this country gave to them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-44 that we are bringing in today fulfils our 
requirements. It does not penalize those who wish to make an 
honest living in our country, but it will prevent abuse of our 
system. It will not have any impact on those individuals who, in 
good faith, make application to the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. As I said at the beginning of my speech, Canada is a 
generous country. Help us maintain that image of generosity and 
keep our reputation in the eyes of the world and help us prevent 
abuse.
<P>
	Therefore, I trust that you, as members of the opposition 
parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, will support 
us. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that you 
will give your general support to this important bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said 
before, you can count on the Bloc Quebecois as far as the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6018"> 6018 </A></B>
<P>
principles of the bill are concerned. Canada must protect itself 
against immigrant criminals. There is a very real  problem, but 
this bill is not the appropriate way to deal with it. I think many of 
your constituents will be astonished by this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In St-Denis there are a lot of immigrants, a lot of Latin 
Americans whom I know personally and who will be astonished 
by your speech today, which does nothing to help the cause of 
immigrants or refugees. You said that Canada is generous, but 
its generosity is waning, unfortunately, like that of all 
industrialized countries, and I was surprised the other day when 
I heard the minister of immigration say that he would favour 
European immigration.
<P>
	There are a lot of people who do not come from Europe, and 
they feel a little insulted and hurt by the minister's words. The 
other day I said there were a lot of socio-economic problems, 
which are often the reason why Canadians and a number of 
immigrants commit crimes. There are enormous problems in 
Canadian society as a result of a lingering economic recession, 
unemployment and problems experienced by young people. I do 
not think the bill provides a solution to these problems.
<P>
	You say that the bill does not violate the provisions of the 
Geneva Convention relating to refugees. I have here a document 
that has just been released by the Canadian Council for 
Refugees, and it says the exact opposite. The Council is a 
respected organization in this country, and I would appreciate 
your comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that my riding 
includes constituents who belong to various cultural 
communities. These are the people who voted for me, and I want 
to thank them again for doing so.
<P>
	I have had the privilege of working with these people for 
fifteen years. The hon. member for Bourassa knows that I have 
been working with immigrants for 15 years. In fact, these very 
same people agree that we must do something to deal with the 
abuse in the system.
<P>
	I will repeat what the minister said, which is that we are not 
trying to penalize immigrants who have not committed serious 
crimes. We are only trying to eliminate the abuse that exists in 
the system and ensure that criminals are deported from this 
country.
<P>
	You said something I thought was very interesting. You said 
that we favour European immigrants. I do not think the minister 
of immigration ever said that this government only favours 
European immigrants. It is not this government's policy, and it 
should not be, as far as I am concerned.
<P>
	I repeat what I said in my speech: We are a generous society 
and we want to keep it that way. Genuine immigrants who are 
not criminals are aware of this. Canada will continue to keep its 
doors open.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we want to do is close the loopholes in the law.
<P>
	I find it rather unusual that we have one opposition party 
saying we are going too far and the other one saying we are not 
going far enough. This indicates to me that we are doing the 
right thing somewhere along the line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member says that the vast majority of immigrants are law 
abiding and contribute to Canadian society. Of course that is 
true. I am an immigrant myself and am making a contribution.
<P>
	However when my wife and I immigrated to Canada in 1979 it 
was a pretty tough process. We had to apply three times from 
outside the country, even though we had money to buy a house 
here and we had jobs to come to in Canada. On entry we had to 
sign away our rights to UI and welfare for five years and we did 
not think that was a hardship. We felt proud that we had earned 
the right to come here. I do not personally see anything wrong 
with setting high standards.
<P>
	When the hon. member accuses us in the Reform Party of 
sensationalizing some of the absolutely dreadful situations that 
are occurring with the immigration system, it would not be 
necessary if there were some sort of strict control like there was 
at the time when I immigrated in 1979.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to address that and answer the 
question as to what is wrong with establishing some reasonable 
standards once again.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are 
trying to do. We are trying to establish reasonable measures in 
which to make sure that the few-and I want to repeat that 
constantly, because the image the opposition party gives to the 
general public is that these few people are in fact vast numbers.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to say that all Reform members stand up and 
speak about immigrants in a negative way. I really do not want 
my words to be misinterpreted in that way. All I want to say is 
that there are a few examples which are exaggerated by the 
media and some opposition members. Unfortunately, because 
members of the general public may not have the same 
opportunity to be in contact with members of our cultural 
communities across Canada, they may be left with that tainted 
image of someone having abused our system.
<P>
	The reason I support Bill C-44 is that we are trying to do away 
with the loopholes and close the doors that lead to the abuse of 
our system and to also get rid of those criminals who take 
advantage of our system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly share some of the comments the member just related. 
However, the growing concern for many Canadians as they learn 
more about our immigration policy is that certain matters should 
be addressed.
<P>
	There is the Immigration and Refugee Board which spends 
over a billion dollars of taxpayers' money every  year. We have a 
system that does not adequately screen individuals who come 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6019"> 6019 </A></B>
<P>
into the country. There is the expedited process in the 
Immigration and Refugee Board which allows people with very 
questionable backgrounds to enter and a system of sponsorship 
where immigrants are self-selected. I know that is being 
tightened up now. However this is a system that has been in 
place and certainly one that the people in this country question. 
The integrity of the government's program has to be questioned. 
I believe it has failed the test.
<P>
	I would like the member to speak to those particular issues. 
The taxpayers are here. The taxpayers are paying the shot and I 
think they have a right to know. Would she not agree?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House 
are just as concerned as the hon. member about the costs of our 
system. The minister has stated publicly that he is reviewing the 
whole process. We are taking measures to make sure the public 
purse is not being overly burdened by the system.
<P>
	I would also like to say that no system is perfect. There will 
always be people who will find a way to abuse the system, any 
system. That is exactly why Bill C-44 is an important piece of 
legislation. We are trying to do our utmost as a government to 
plug those loopholes that do exist. However, no law is perfect 
and there are always people who will get around the law. 
However we are doing our best as a government to make sure 
there are fewer ways of getting around the law.
<P>
	As far as sponsorship is concerned, I think the hon. member 
answered the question himself. The minister has tightened up 
those rules and will continue to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill 
has serious, serious problems. Reform Party members elevated 
this issue of crime and immigration. We focused the public's 
attention and anger. We forced the minister who began his term 
as minister by stating there was no problem with crime and 
immigrants to introduce these measures. It may seem a bit ironic 
that after doing that, we are now opposing this bill.
<P>
	I can assure this House and all Canadians that the Reform 
Party does not oppose getting tough on newcomers to Canada 
who break our laws. We do not oppose many of the specific 
measures in this bill. What we do oppose is the minister's 
attempt to sell this package of minor reforms as a package that 
will significantly address the problems of undesirable 
immigrants in Canada. We oppose the notion that this bill will 
somehow fix any of the major problems that are plaguing 
immigration to Canada.
<P>
	We need to look no further than a few very recent high profile 
instances of criminal immigrants to see what effect this 
legislation would have. I will give away the surprise by telling 
members that Bill C-44 would have done nothing to prevent 
these tragedies.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	First is the much publicized case of Clinton Gayle who is 
suspected of the murder of Constable Todd Baylis. Mr. Gayle 
came to the country legally. Mr. Gayle had a removal order 
issued against him. Mr. Gayle evaded that deportation order not 
by running and not by tying up the system with appeals. Rather, 
Mr. Gayle avoided removal because his file was lost. Mr. Gayle 
avoided capture and removal because the system was 
overworked, because priorities for removal were confused. It is 
more likely than not, although we will never know, because 
someone dropped the ball.
<P>
	Bill C-44 does nothing to change the priorities of 
immigration enforcement. It does nothing to ensure that the 
system is less overworked than it is now. It does not address the 
problem and this problem is just as fundamental and 
troublesome as the actual issuance of removal orders, namely, 
the capture and physical removal of those who are issued 
removal orders.
<P>
	The second case that has outraged Canadians and has 
illustrated the deficiencies both in immigration and in the 
priorities of this government was the very recent case of one Mr. 
Forbes. He is currently being sought for the senseless shooting 
of several people in Toronto over the weekend.
<P>
	Tragically two of those people died at the hands of this 
individual. Mr. Forbes who is also from Jamaica came to Canada 
on a visitor's visa, as so many illegal entrants do. He overstayed 
that visa and a deportation order was issued. Rather 
surprisingly, he was removed from Canada.
<P>
	I say surprisingly because the numbers of people who are 
removed because of an overstay on a visa are very small indeed. 
These cases while important tend not to receive a high priority 
from an overworked immigration enforcement bureau.
<P>
	One must keep in mind that this took place in the mid-1980s, 
during a time when the number of immigrants to Canada was 
roughly one-third of what it currently is. Those reasonable 
numbers actually permitted the immigration department to do 
its job.
<P>
	Nonetheless Mr. Forbes returned to Canada. He was again 
ordered deported and he again left the country. To no one's 
surprise he came back again and the results of his return have 
been tragic.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of all 
Canadians to publicly offer my sincerest condolences to the 
families of those two people who were struck down by this 
madman and also to the other victims who were shot. I am sure 
all members of this House join me in offering our sincerest 
hopes for a speedy and full recovery.
<P>
	Too often in the heat of political debate we forget about the 
victims and concentrate only on the perpetrator. However there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6020"> 6020 </A></B>
<P>
are victims here and they highlight the urgency that we must feel 
as we look for solutions to the problem of violent non-citizens.
<P>
	The Forbes case illustrates several things. First, it illustrates 
the importance of enforcement in the immigration system. We 
can issue removal orders until we are blue in the face. We can try 
to stop the system from being abused. We can adopt a one strike 
and you are out policy for those immigrants and visitors who 
violate Canada's laws.
<P>
	However what good does that do when we do not have any 
officers to carry out those removals, and I can assure you we do 
not. In the region of Toronto where a vast majority of deportable 
criminals reside, there are a total of 30 investigation and 
enforcement officers. That used to be 36. Before he decided to 
get tough, the minister cut that number. He also cut overtime 
staff in the Vancouver region. There simply is not the staff to 
find deportables.
<P>
	Currently there is a backlog of deportations that best 
estimates put at around 40,000. Bill C-44 would do nothing at 
all to ensure the speedy removal of those people. Bill C-44 will 
probably just add to the backlog.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-44 shows the laxity with which visas and 
immigration permits are granted.
<P>
	It is my understanding Mr. Forbes came into the country for 
the last time, sponsored by his wife, despite the fact that he had 
been removed from the country twice before. I asked the 
minister yesterday, and did not receive an answer, why would 
someone who has been removed with a deportation order twice 
for whatever reason be allowed back into the country. The 
spokesperson for the department was reported as saying that Mr. 
Forbes had been removed for reasons other than criminality in 
the past.
<P>
	Mr. Forbes had intentionally violated Canada's law by 
overstaying a visa. He had intentionally violated and flouted 
Canada's immigration laws. These violations do not carry a 
sentence of more than 10 years. Thus, according to the terms of 
Bill C-44 Mr. Forbes would not be found in violation of the act 
to a degree that would warrant his permanent removal from 
Canada. That simply does not make sense.
<P>
	There are other very serious problems that the bill does not 
address that undermine the very integrity of the immigration 
policy in Canada.
<P>
	Over the summer I released a document that came from the 
department of immigration which outlined guidelines for fast 
tracking through the refugee system various categories of 
people who in the minds of some senior bureaucrats and refugee 
advocates were self-evidently refugees. This included armed 
insurgents, former and present guerrillas, former and present 
members of such anti-democratic and even genocidal regimes 
like the Mengistu regime and the former communist government 
of Afghanistan, very choice members of Canadian society 
indeed.
<P>
	These people, I have to reiterate, are not only being allowed to 
make refugee claims, they are being fast tracked after they admit 
to participation in these regimes.
<P>
	I know that these folks might face persecution in their home 
countries and that is a good enough reason for some people in 
Canada's immigration industry to invite them in. In the words of 
one spokesperson for the Canadian Council for Refugees, it does 
not matter if people are torturers or terrorists, if they face 
persecution, they deserve refugee status in Canada. Those are 
his words.
<P>
	I am willing to wager that most of my fellow Canadians would 
call that silly logic and certainly not agree with the idea that 
these are the sorts of people who deserve to be at the top of our 
list for refugee status, but currently they are.
<P>
	Despite what some misinformed voices have said there are no 
background checks for criminality, for war crimes or for crimes 
against humanity done at the refugee hearing stage. Very 
recently the Immigration and Refugee Board told its refugee 
hearing officers that they were not even allowed to conduct 
checks through Interpol or other such recognized sources. No 
background checks can be performed on a refugee claimant until 
after they have been accepted as refugees. Often that is when the 
information comes forward, after they are in the system and 
making an application for permanent residence.
<P>
	Bill C-44 will allow a refugee hearing to be halted if a 
criminal record is found but the bill does not give adequate 
power to the refugee hearing officers to undertake a thorough 
background check of all applicants for refugee status. It does not 
override the orders of the Immigration and Refugee Board to 
refrain from conducting background searches.
<P>
	As with enforcement and as with the granting of permanent 
residency, this bill proves itself to be on the right track. It even 
displays good intentions but it does not have teeth.
<P>
	If Bill C-44 is implemented I am willing to predict the 
following. The effect will not have an increase in the amount of 
deportations. It will not have an effect of clearing the system of 
appeals and bogus refugee claims. It will not significantly 
increase the onus on the refugees to prove that they have clean 
histories before being allowed into Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I know as a former police officer that laws are a good first step 
but they only work when there are individuals who have the 
means and the authority to carry them out, to make sure that they 
are enforced. I have shown with only two examples of serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6021"> 6021 </A></B>
<P>
immigrant offenders that Bill C-44 would not have the effect of 
getting rid of the people we most need to get rid of.
<P>
	Further, I have shown that Bill C-44 does not address the 
fundamental problem of an Immigration and Refugee Board that 
is stacked with members of the immigration industry, political 
appointees not working in the best interests of Canadians and 
who, it would appear, have an agenda to accept as many refugees 
without question as possible.
<P>
	Bill C-44 does not do the job. If the minister had announced a 
bill that tackled only one area of the Immigration Act, let us say 
criminal refugees, and then revamped the working of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board to add teeth to the act then it 
would have my full support. The minister has taken a shotgun 
approach and has hit in Bill C-44 a number of different areas of 
immigration law, all of which are troublesome, but left huge 
gaping holes in our system and has not backed up any of his 
proposed changes with staff that have real power to make the 
measures work.
<P>
	I applaud the minister for listening to the people and to the 
Reform Party. I only wish it had not taken so long. I truly wish it 
had not taken tragedies to make him stop listening to those out 
there who insist that there can never be problems in 
immigration.
<P>
	Further, I applaud the minister for taking the initiative to act 
and to table legislation that at least takes a crack at toughening 
up the system. I applaud him for stripping the power of the IAD 
to overturn deportation orders on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds. I only wish he had not gone half way. 
The minister knows how to toughen up the system. Starting with 
cutting the numbers down to a level that our immigration 
department can handle would be a good beginning, then 
revamping the IRB, taking power away from the irresponsible 
and unaccountable appointed members, giving refugee hearing 
officers the ability to do full and thorough background checks 
before refugee status is determined.
<P>
	There are so many measures, not simple measures but obvious 
ones, that could have gone into this bill if there had been the 
political will to do so. There was not. I am not talking about 
minor technicalities. The Reform Party would not oppose this 
legislation if the problems were minor, but this bill has such 
gaping holes it fails to address the most important issues that we 
simply cannot give it support. We simply cannot allow the 
Canadian people to be lulled into a false sense of security.
<P>
	The minister's task force was a small step but he heralded it as 
though the problems in enforcement had been solved. They have 
not. The success or lack of success of the task force speaks 
volumes to the insignificance of the measure.
<P>
	With Bill C-44 the minister is trying to tell the Canadian 
people that Canada is cracking down on those who violate our 
laws and abuse our system. We are doing no such thing until we 
address the real issues. We cannot support any immigration bill 
that makes itself out to be the be all and end all of a strategy to 
take care of the problems of criminal immigration.
<P>
	I would urge all members of this House to send a clear 
message to the minister. Vote against this bill, not because you 
oppose specific measures in it, not because you oppose the broad 
intent, but because you want real change in immigration law, 
because you want to answer responsibly to your constituents 
who have been demanding change, radical change, because you 
want immigration to work once more, to be a boon to the country 
and not a cause of grief.
<P>
	I urge you to send a message to this minister that things really 
need to change. This bill simply does not offer enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have waited all morning in patient expectation to hear the 
speech on this subject from the member from Calgary who is 
well known for his knowledge on immigration matters, and I 
have an almost subservient respect for his views on the subject.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I found myself disappointed in that his speech addressed 
many examples of the failures of immigration and refugee 
policy in the past. It never at any time-I think <I>Hansard</I> will 
show this-offered a constructive criticism of any aspect of Bill 
C-44.
<P>
	I do appreciate that there have been abuses in the past. Indeed, 
some of the horror stories he mentioned will be addressed in 
other legislation and belong in other legislation. I was hoping to 
hear specific criticism.
<P>
	To help him in this regard, I would like to suggest that he give 
us his views as a former police officer on the question of 
identity, the use of false identity, false documents, as a 
mechanism by which criminals get through the immigration 
process, getting into this country.
<P>
	Would he not agree that in Bill C-44 we are making a giant 
step toward enforcement and for keeping out these 
undesirables? Would he not agree as a former police officer that 
this is an excellent step and this is an excellent bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I would like to make a comment in reference to the 
preamble that the member presented before his question. As far 
as the bill is concerned and what the Reform Party is stating 
here, it does not go far enough.
<P>
	It still does not address the concerns that many Canadians 
have when it comes to actual removals of individuals once a 
deportation order has been issued. We have 40,000 individuals 
right now under deportation orders. Why are they not being 
removed? They are not being removed for problems within the 
policy, the law. They are not being removed because there is an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6022"> 6022 </A></B>
<P>
insufficient number of individuals assigned for removal to take 
care of that specific problem.
<P>
	The immigration department in so many areas is overworked 
and understaffed in many respects. The question of finances 
came up when reviewing staffing problems so that increased 
staffing needs could be achieved to meet this demand.
<P>
	There are not sufficient resources on the front end of 
enforcement and too much for the administrative aspects of 
immigration. There is increased cost to the taxpayers for having 
to assign individuals to try to pick up the pieces afterward 
through the courts as they prosecute individuals violating our 
laws.
<P>
	Those are the problems with the immigration department. 
They go far beyond what this bill will ever offer or address. 
When it comes to the point of documents, certainly I am not 
arguing with the specifics that this will address part of the 
problem. It does not address it all, as was pointed out by my 
colleague. This deals only with those documents that may be in 
the mail.
<P>
	There is a major problem at the point of entry when it comes to 
evaluating documents or to even questioning individuals who 
enter at whatever the port of entry may be. No immigration 
officer on the frontline questions those who pass through the 
points of entry.
<P>
	The immigration officers are pushed to the back of the offices. 
When the customs officer addresses an individual who may 
come into the country, he may refer him to the immigration 
officer if there is reason to do so. You really have no frontline 
protection there when it comes to immigration. That has to 
change.
<P>
	The borders are not secure. I can point to several other areas 
as well. Specifically, to address the member's question on 
documents, certainly C-44 is a start but it does not address the 
whole problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member and I come from different backgrounds. You are a 
former police officer, while I am a former refugee. We do not 
share the same experiences, the same situations. You want to 
have more stringent measures, while I find that the bill will not 
solve the real problems. There are already three working groups 
made up of the RCMP, the immigration officers and the local 
police in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Do you think this is 
enough?
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	You also know that there are Canadian criminals abroad. 
There are Canadians in prison in a number of countries. They too 
need our protection and I have received several calls. Canadian 
consulates are there to offer some protection to these Canadians, 
who have usually been sentenced for drug trafficking. What are 
you going to do? Are you going to ask these countries to deport 
them to Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the member's second 
question first.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned if an individual enters another 
country and violates its laws he should pay the price, and if he is 
not a citizen of that country he should be expelled immediately. I 
would venture to say that the majority of people agree with that 
position, including the member across the way who asked the 
question.
<P>
	The problem is that in this country that does not happen. First, 
it is lucky if they pay the price for the crime that they commit. 
Second, who is going to remove them and why are they not being 
removed? That is the problem and Bill C-44 does not address it.
<P>
	Are there enough policing agencies or enforcement agencies 
to deal with enforcement of the Immigration Act and the 
Criminal Code? I would venture to say there are not. I am not 
looking for Draconian measures. All we are doing is seeking the 
best for the Canadian people to protect them in the best way we 
can. There is an undesirable element slipping into the country. 
There is no question about that. That undesirable element should 
be removed. Bill C-44 does not go far enough to remove it.
<P>
	My only suggestion is that the bill be voted down and that a 
complete review be done of the immigration policy in the 
country. The voice crying for a moratorium is getting louder. We 
are not suggesting that but some people in society are. I suggest 
we start to clean up what we have now before that voice gets 
louder.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member a question and I would like to make a 
comment.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is a law that thinks about the victims in our society. 
Despite what the hon. member said, we as a government are 
concerned about the victims. That is why we want to introduce 
the legislation.
<P>
	I also want to bring to the member's attention that the minister 
has said he will collaborate both with the Solicitor General and 
the Minister of Justice to make sure that the law is enforced. If 
the problem of enforcement is there the three will work together 
to make sure there will be enforcement of the law.
<P>
	I understood the hon. member to say that there were no 
deportations last year, if I understood him. Perhaps I am wrong; 
perhaps he could correct me. Does he have knowledge of how 
many deportations were issued last year and how many 
individuals were deported last year?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6023"> 6023 </A></B>
<P>
	There were 8,200 orders carried out; 1,200 of those orders 
were criminals and a minimum of 3,000 orders were against 
criminals who still remain in the country and cannot be located.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The member spoke of the collaboration between the Minister 
of Justice and the minister of immigration to deal with the 
matter of removal. I agree that is what has to happen. Under the 
terms of Bill C-44, however, removal will not occur at any 
faster rate than it is right now.
<P>
	The minister recognizes that in the fourth paragraph of page 
5794 of his legislation. It will be a lengthy process and we will 
be faced with the same problem that has been addressed by one 
member of the official opposition.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments. Actually the five hours of debate expired at 12.38 so 
we are now into 10-minute speeches from all members and no 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the subject of 
Bill C-44 now before the House.
<P>
	The bill marks advancement in the approach of the 
government toward enforcing the Immigration Act. It marks an 
advancement in our respect for people from around the world 
who come to this country. It also marks progress in the way we 
see Canada's role as a protector of individuals who are refugees 
from oppression.
<P>
	Canada has been and continues to be built on the efforts and 
ingenuity of immigrants. They came, saw opportunity and 
settled. New Canadians became second generation, third 
generation or tenth generation Canadians. At some point in time 
they stopped being new Canadians and simply became 
Canadians.
<P>
	The House has 295 members of Parliament. I submit 293 of 
them are new Canadians. Some are newer than I am. Some are 
older than I am. However new Canadians enjoy the prosperity 
and happiness the country provides to all.
<P>
	Today at every port of entry, at Canadian embassies and 
consulates the world over, people ask to become the next group 
of new Canadians. They hope to join the rest of Canadians on our 
unique journey. They want to grow from who they are to whom 
they could become, if given the opportunities that Canada 
provides in abundance and that Canadians enjoy.
<P>
	I believe that most people who have asked to become 
Canadians want to share the same feeling of pride many of our 
ancestors experienced when a judge, an immigration officer or a 
postman delivered the news of their new citizenship. They want 
to stand as Canadians and sing <I>O Canada</I> whether it is for the 
first time or the thousandth time. They want to be one of us, to 
contribute, to make a life, to create their future.
<P>
	At this point I want to remind the House that every year April 
17 to April 24 is Citizenship Week. This year for the first time 
members of Parliament in the House and the Senate and their 
staff gathered in the Hall of Honour to reaffirm their citizenship. 
When <I>O Canada</I> was sung I was amazed and happy to see tears 
in the eyes of many of the singers, including some members of 
Parliament, who were born here. They really enjoyed the 
atmosphere; there were tears in their eyes. That is the way 
Canada wants to have it. That is the way Canada wants to keep it.
<P>
	Being a Canadian means having an open mind and an open 
heart. It means accepting each other's differences, celebrating 
them and not condemning their differences. Being a Canadian 
means sharing generously. Canada has much to offer those who 
come here. Canada offers a potential for self-development that 
exists in few other countries in the world. Tolerance, generosity 
and potential bind Canadians together, attract newcomers to our 
shores and brought our forebears to the country many centuries 
ago.
<P>
	The first step on the road to obtaining Canadian citizenship is 
to become a landed immigrant or to be found to be a convention 
refugee. If we do not protect our immigration and refugee 
system from abuse we endanger the citizenship system, which 
demeans the concept of Canadian citizenship.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-44 is a manifestation of our government's 
responsibility to protect new, old and potential Canadians from 
hoodlums that would like Canadian citizenship under false 
pretences. A Canadian passport is a very precious possession. 
Inside the cover of every Canadian passport issued we can read 
these words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Secretary of State for External Affairs Canada requires that in the name 
of Her Majesty the Queen, all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer of 
this pass freely without let or hindrance and to afford the bearer such assistance 
as may be necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And at the bottom of the facing page it reads: ``The bearer of 
this passport is a Canadian citizen''. There are people for whom 
these words mean nothing. The promise and protection they 
offer means nothing to them. They seem to come to this country 
to make deals, and they would abuse the system if they had the 
chance to do so.
<P>
	Fortunately these people are few and far between. The 
overwhelming majority of newcomers to Canada see these 
words as a source of protection, pride and hope. They see these 
words as a chance to better themselves in a country that 
welcomes new Canadians. They see these words as a promise of 
freedom, both in Canada and abroad.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6024"> 6024 </A></B>
<P>
	However for a tiny group of people who do not share this 
vision and who would abuse their status as immigrants the 
country has laws. We want to prohibit any serious and dangerous 
criminals from becoming fellow Canadians or from being able 
to stay here. We want to give enforcement officers the power to 
seize documents from international mail that might be used by 
people who do not deserve to have citizenship here.
<P>
	We want to change some of the responsibilities of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. We want to make sure that if 
there must be exceptions to the rule it is the minister who shall 
judge those exceptions and be accountable for them in the 
House. We want to close the loopholes that have been exploited 
by those who would pervert the process of becoming a Canadian 
citizen.
<P>
	The tools to accomplish these things are in Bill C-44. It is as 
simple as that. By letting hoods and thugs into the country we 
tarnish what it means to be Canadian. We must never let that 
happen.
<P>
	Canadians will not tolerate an abuse of our generosity. The 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration said to Canada's chiefs 
of police last month: ``No Canadian should have to accept such a 
slap in the face''. Even a few abuses, and there are very few, 
destroy the trust of Canadians in our immigration system. Abuse 
erodes the acceptance of Canadians of a progressive 
immigration policy.
<P>
	I call on hon. members of the House to act as Canadians want 
us to act, to apply the laws of Canada as Canadians want the laws 
applied and to continue Canada's long tradition of a tolerant, 
generous, progressive and enlightened immigration policy. I ask 
that we move swiftly to protect the integrity of the Canadian 
passport and give meaning to the words found inside.
<P>
	To that end, I call on all members of the House to support Bill 
C-44. We owe it to the people of Canada who have placed their 
confidence in us as leaders and legislators. We owe it to our 
neighbourhoods, our families and our friends.
<P>
	The safer Canada of tomorrow is in our hands today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk 
this afternoon on Bill C-44, an act to amend the Immigration 
Act. As members have heard, the member for Calgary Northeast 
says that while the bill has made some small beginnings, it does 
not go far enough to warrant our support and to vote in favour of 
the bill.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The government seems to be sending out mixed messages. I 
quote from page 5792 of <I>Hansard</I> dated September 19, 1994 
when the minister was giving his speech on the introduction of 
this bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The actions of a small group of people are causing Canadians to question the 
very limits and the very merits of a system that has done much to build our nation 
as we know it. In short, the deeds of a few have cast a shadow over the reputations 
of many.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On the subsequent page it reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Abuse of the system by a few has been cause for alarm. While the numbers of 
those causing the problem are small, the damage they have done is large.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have read the reports, heard the stories, seen the pictures or maybe even 
attended a funeral. A criminal minority has used the immigration system to its 
own advantage. There has been slow enforcement and some of us have watched 
with growing anger while a justice and immigration appeals system was used as a 
stalling tactic to delay departure orders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister says he is concerned about the criminal element 
that has tainted and tarnished the reputation of our immigration 
and refugee policy.
<P>
	Earlier this morning the Reform Party presented a motion to 
amend the bill that the minister introduced. We introduced a 
motion to decline to give second reading to this bill and ``to 
make a consequential amendment to the Customs Act because of 
its failure to bar, prior to a refugee hearing and an application for 
permanent residence, those who have been convicted of a crime 
that would carry a sentence in Canada of 10 years or more and 
those individuals who fall under the category of persons listed in 
section 19(1) and (2) of the Immigration Act''.
<P>
	That motion was defeated by the Liberal Party. The Bloc 
Quebecois of course joined the Liberals and defeated any 
attempt by the Reform Party to put some real teeth into the 
minister's bill. That is why I say we have mixed messages 
coming from the government where it talks tough. When the 
Reform Party says that we want to really talk tough, the 
government backs down and nothing really gets going.
<P>
	The fundamental philosophy of the Canadian refugee policy 
needs to be altered. The current philosophy seems to say that a 
refugee is into this country unless we can prove at a later date 
that he or she should not be in, at which point in time deportation 
hearings begin.
<P>
	That philosophy needs to be reversed to say that a person 
cannot come into this country unless there are good reasons why 
he or she should be allowed in. I know and I endorse a policy of 
opening our doors to millions of refugees, the hundreds of 
thousands of refugees who seek and have obtained a safe haven 
in this country. Of the millions around the world there are few 
who are brave enough, lucky enough or enterprising enough to 
make it to our shores. However far too many times those who 
were brave enough, lucky enough or enterprising enough were 
actually the perpetrators of the prosecution.
<P>
	The first thing we must be aware of when a refugee applies for 
refugee status is that they need not necessarily be the helpless 
and hapless victim of persecution. Refugees should not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6025"> 6025 </A></B>
<P>
allowed automatic entry into this country and move around 
freely until three specific checks have been performed.
<P>
	Number one, we should verify they are indeed helpless and 
hapless innocent victims of persecution and not the perpetrators 
of the persecution themselves. In the last couple of years all of 
us have seen situations in the newspapers where we have 
definitely found that refugee applicants are not refugees but the 
cause of the refugee problem.
<P>
	Two, we should also check that they are not criminals who 
have a record of violent crime in the countries where they come 
from.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Number three is that we have not barred them entry for failing 
to meet the first two criteria or for abusing the privilege of being 
in Canada and carrying out criminal activities. This is basically 
saying that if we have deported once, why go through the hassle 
of even thinking about it again. Let us call the situation as it is.
<P>
	Only after they meet those three checks should we consider 
that Canada would be available as a safe haven for them.
<P>
	This bill has some positive features such as stripping the 
Immigration and Refugee Board of its ability to overturn 
deportation orders. It is long overdue. We have had appeal after 
appeal after appeal, when it is absolutely obvious there is no way 
we should even be considering the application. The minister 
himself referred to the embarrassment of the appeal board 
having to go to a Kingston prison to hold hearings with 
convicted murderers to find out whether or not they should be 
allowed entry.
<P>
	The bureaucratic process grinds on spending money, when I 
know and everybody else in this country knows that the answer 
is to let us get them out and get them out now.
<P>
	The bill also ensures that someone convicted of a crime in 
Canada which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years or more 
will automatically be subject to a deportation order that can only 
be appealed to the minister. That is one of the better parts of the 
bill, but as I say it does not go very far in our point of view.
<P>
	One thing we are concerned about is that the bill does not 
identify criminals before they are allowed into the country. No 
criminal checks are performed on the claimant until his refugee 
status has been determined. I had to scratch my head to 
understand the logic here.
<P>
	Ordinary Canadians are telling me that surely this is putting 
the cart before the horse. Why would we allow a refugee in if we 
are going to find out subsequent to granting him refugee status 
that he is a serious criminal from wherever he came and does not 
deserve refugee status? Then we have to turn around and get the 
process in order to ship him back out, when we could have 
stopped him long, long before. This seems to be an example of 
the refugee and immigration industry cranking through the mill 
just to keep the system going and keep them all employed.
<P>
	We say the criminal checks should be front and centre of the 
review process, not after the fact. When it comes to deportation, 
it seems that this bill is a tiger without teeth. There is a major 
difference between a deportation order and a deportation itself. 
Last year 25,000 deportation orders resulted in only 8,200 
deportations. So we have a law that is being laughed at, ignored 
and ridiculed by people who we find undesirable in the first 
place and who we want out of the country.
<P>
	Canadians I have spoken to also want the assurance that once 
an individual has been deported he will not be allowed into 
Canada again. That seems a fairly simple and straightforward 
thing. Once someone has been deported immigration officials 
should be able to say no at the border, long before the individual 
sets one foot on Canadian soil. If we have been through the 
deportation order once, why would we even think about doing it 
again? Millions of dollars are wasted as the whole industry 
churns on to arrive at a decision that should be obvious and 
already concluded. Once someone has been deported they are 
out to stay out. Out should mean out.
<P>
	I think I can congratulate the minister for his about turn. He is 
halfway around the U-turn from his position this spring when 
Parliament first sat. At that time he was quite satisfied in many 
ways with the immigration department and the levels of 
immigration in this country.
<P>
	However this bill demonstrates he has been listening to 
Reform members and this House and to Canadians across this 
land and he has discovered there are many more Reformers in 
Canada on the immigration policy than there are Liberals. It is, 
however, unfortunate that he did not listen more closely and 
complete the entire U-turn. If he had paid closer attention some 
of the problems and the deficiencies that are still present in this 
bill would have been cleared up.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also unfortunate the minister did not act more like the 
ordinary Canadian. It makes perfect sense to everyone I have 
spoken to, although I have to admit I have not spoken to the 
minister, that we should ensure that individuals are not 
criminals before we allow them into our country. Something that 
simple seems to be beyond the minister's comprehension.
<P>
	In conclusion this bill represents a small first step, but such a 
small first step that we cannot support it. The minister should 
listen more attentively to the wishes of Canadians and to Reform 
members in this House.
<P>
	While the bill deals with some of the issues, it does not tackle 
the fundamental problem of criminals entering into Canada. It 
does not resolve the process that allows refugees to be in limbo 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6026"> 6026 </A></B>
<P>
for years while they build a social case for staying in Canada that 
has nothing to do with why they left in the first place.
<P>
	If the minister wants my support he has to go all the way 
around the U-turn and make a serious attempt at solving 
Canada's definitely serious immigration problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-44, which is an amendment to clarify 
and codify changes to the Immigration Act.
<P>
	The people of Canada will not tolerate the abuse of our 
generosity. Even a few abuses destroy the trust Canadians have 
in our immigration policies of fairness and tolerance. It also 
means that Canadians' acceptance of a progressive immigration 
policy is compromised.
<P>
	Bill C-44 will further the government's commitment to 
control illegal immigration and control our borders. This bill 
also provides further evidence that we take our commitments of 
the trust of the Canadian people seriously.
<P>
	There are four main areas where Bill C-44 will improve the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	This bill will assist our frontline people to intervene in 
situations where someone is using the system to his or her 
advantage. As an example, a person who can have more than one 
claim before the Immigration and Refugee Board means the 
system becomes clogged with overlapping, repetitive, frivolous 
claims. The IRB is spending too much time investigating the 
already investigated and assessing the already assessed. Under 
Bill C-44 the first claim will take precedence and all subsequent 
claims will be terminated.
<P>
	This bill will help to keep serious criminals out of the refugee 
determination system. At any time in the refugee determination 
process if senior immigration officials discover a serious 
criminal offence either in Canada or abroad, they will be able to 
suspend and terminate the process before the Immigration and 
Refugee Board makes a final decision.
<P>
	Claims for refugee status can be dismissed for a number of 
reasons. The amendments in Bill C-44 will prohibit people 
convicted of serious crimes from claiming refugee status.
<P>
	Under the Geneva convention on refugees, criminality is a 
valid basis for refusing a refugee claim. Bill C-44 will 
encourage this, as well as provisions for the exclusion of war 
criminals. As well the IAD will no longer have the power to 
allow serious criminals to remain in Canada on humanitarian 
and compassionate grounds. The minister will assume the 
authority to decide humanitarian and compassionate exceptions. 
Of course the IAD will still have the jurisdiction to grant stays of 
removal for reasons of law or fact or a mix of law and fact as it 
does now.
<P>
	Finally, immigration officers will have the authority to seize 
identity documents sent by international mail. There is a 
disturbing trend toward the distribution of genuine counterfeit 
visas, passports and identity documents as part of attempts to 
bring illegal immigrants to Canada.
<P>
	To that end customs officers will have the authority to 
examine international packages for documents like passports, 
visas, health cards and other documentation. The suspect 
material will be referred to an immigration officer who will 
determine if these documents might furnish evidence relevant to 
attempts to get around the immigration policy.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	There are other pertinent amendments contained in Bill C-44. 
These specifics can be found in the relevant documents you have 
before you, Mr. Speaker. However, the central theme of my 
remarks is to endorse the spirit of the changes proposed in Bill 
C-44. The people of Canada want to see laws applied with some 
consistency and fairness. Where persons have broken the law or 
have misinterpreted their claim as a refugee or are trying to 
manipulate the system and the spirit of the Immigration Act we 
want to have the ability to act in the best interest of Canada.
<P>
	If that means throwing a person out then it means throwing 
that person out. If it means convicting them of fraud with jail 
time then it means a conviction for fraud and jail time. It also 
means that we are going to enforce the laws reasonably, fairly 
and equally. The system is going to be changed for the better 
with this bill.
<P>
	I call on all hon. members of this House to act as Canadians 
want us to act, to apply the laws as Canadians want the laws 
applied and to continue the tradition of fair, progressive and 
enlightened immigration that Canadians have grown 
accustomed to. To that end I call on all hon. members of this 
House to support Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am very 
pleased to be able to speak to Bill C-44, an act to amend the 
Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act and to make 
consequential amendments to the Customs Act.
<P>
	Bill C-44 goes a long way to address the concerns of many 
people. It provides the necessary tools and authority to maintain 
the integrity of our immigration and refugee system. There are a 
number of key points to the bill which merit highlighting. I 
would like to highlight a few.
<P>
	Immigration officials, for example, would be given expanded 
powers to seize suspicious documents for inspection. 
Enforcement officers would have the authority to prohibit the 
shipment of documents which could be used to circumvent the 
rules and regulations of the Canada Immigration Act. These 
papers are the documents used to establish false identities to 
enable persons to enter and travel to Canada illegally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6027"> 6027 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year during a five-month period over 120 packages 
containing one or more status or identity documents were found 
in major Canadian cities each week. These packages had to be 
returned to the mails because there was no authority to seize 
them.
<P>
	Under the provisions of Bill C-44 serious criminals will be 
prevented from using the refugee process to delay their removal 
from Canada. It should be noted that this is not a violation of 
their human rights. The United Nations convention on the status 
of refugees recognizes that some individuals are not deserving 
of protection because they had committed serious criminal 
offences.
<P>
	This bill would also transfer from the immigration appeals 
division to the minister of immigration the authority to disallow 
permanent residents convicted of serious crimes to remain in the 
country on humanitarian grounds.
<P>
	As many hon. members in the House are aware the 
immigration appeals division has recently been involved in a 
number of controversial decisions that allowed certain people to 
stay in Canada in spite of the crimes they previously committed. 
This amendment will place this important and controversial 
duty squarely in the hands of the minister, which I believe makes 
the system more accountable to Parliament.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the immigration appeals division will retain 
jurisdiction to stay removal orders on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds for permanent residents convicted of 
minor offences.
<P>
	There are a number of serious other provisions in Bill C-44 
that I believe will have a positive impact on our immigration and 
refugee system. For example, a person who is found to have 
made multiple claims will not be able to pursue a claim of their 
choice once the series of claims has been discovered. Instead, 
the first claim will now take precedence and the Immigration 
and Refugee Board will be notified to terminate all subsequent 
claims.
<P>
	Senior immigration officers would also have authority to 
make removal orders besides the powers they have now at ports 
of entry and inland. In addition, all permanent residents who are 
ordered removed will lose their permanent resident status.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Abuse of Canada's immigration system and the existence of 
criminal immigrants and refugees are real serious concerns to 
many people in my constituency of Nepean. During the summer 
months I held a forum in my riding to garner the views and ideas 
of my constituents regarding Canada's immigration policy.
<P>
	Throughout the evening a number of topics with a wide range 
of opinions were examined. One of the underlying themes of the 
discussion was a tremendous concern about newcomers who 
undermine the integrity of our immigration and refugee system.
<P>
	The people of Nepean recognize that crime in Canada is not a 
result of any particular ethnocultural group of immigrants or 
refugees. They do however clearly feel that we must take steps 
to prevent criminals from entering Canada, expel those who 
commit crimes while in the country and impose barriers to those 
who have been able to cheat the system, attempting to enter 
Canada under false pretences.
<P>
	A copy of the full report on the thoughts of the participants at 
the Nepean forum has been filed with the minister of 
immigration.
<P>
	I firmly believe that Bill C-44 will work to tighten up our 
enforcement system and help to restore not only the faith of my 
constituents but of all Canadians in the integrity of our 
immigration and refugee system.
<P>
	I am confident that hon. members in this House will see the 
merits of Bill C-44 and join me in supporting this legislation. 
We owe it to the people of Canada, both native born and 
newcomers alike, to ensure that our country is a nation where 
peace, prosperity and safety prevail.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I address this bill before us on sentencing reform. These 
proposals fulfil a commitment made in the red book by the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	The hon. members opposite should take note that we are 
keeping our promise. The main goals of this bill are to ensure the 
rehabilitation of offenders to become law-abiding citizens, to 
separate offenders from society when necessary and to promote 
a sense of responsibility in offenders by making restitution and 
acknowledging harm done.
<P>
	To achieve these principles the bill sets out a number of 
fundamental principles to guide the courts. These principles are, 
first, to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the 
responsibility of the offender. Second, the courts must consider 
the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Third, similar 
acts should receive similar sentences. Fourth, the principle of 
sentencing totality is upheld. Fifth, the offender should not be 
imprisoned if other options are appropriate. Sixth, all 
reasonable alternatives should be considered. I mention this 
especially because of the aboriginal offenders.
<P>
	There are a few features of this legislation on which I would 
like to focus. The use of alternatives for aboriginal offenders is a 
very important principle of this bill. In my province of 
Saskatchewan the aboriginal population is the fastest growing 
segment of society today. It also represents a disproportionate 
percentage of offenders incarcerated.
<P>
	The courts in Saskatchewan have started to experiment with 
sentencing circles. A sentencing circle brings together elders of 
the community and also includes members of the non-native 
community and professionals such as lawyers and police 
officers.
<P>
	The emphasis is not on retribution but rather on returning the 
community to its sense of harmony as defined by the aboriginal 
population.
<P>
	Recently in Saskatoon an accused, a Saskatoon Metis, was 
sentenced in this manner. The sentencing circle was convened 
after this individual had robbed a gasoline station in my city. 
The sentencing circle met and decided that this individual must 
perform certain punishments to return its community harmony. 
He was instructed to do voluntary work for the gas station he had 
robbed, a certain number of hours of work or days, to volunteer 
at the Metis society and to admit his guilt to the community. 
Over and above this he was also sentenced to a penitentiary term 
of imprisonment.
<P>
	The gas station owner was hesitant at first but has publicly 
said that he believes that justice has been served by the 
sentencing circle. This is an important part of criminal justice, 
the belief by members of the public at large that justice has been 
served, has been fulfilled.
<P>
	We must resist the urge to incarcerate everyone who commits 
a crime. It costs more money to keep someone in jail for a year 
than it does to send a student to school.
<P>
	Another important function of the bill is to provide for 
victims' impact statements at early parole hearings held under 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 745 is the section that allows for review of the 
mandatory life sentence without parole for 25 years to 
determine whether the person should be paroled after 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I have strong feelings on this issue. Constable Brian King, a 
constable in the RCMP, was killed in Saskatoon. Constable King 
was a personal friend of mine. He was ruthlessly killed in the 
line of duty in 1978. Last year the individual convicted of killing 
him made an application for early parole under section 745.
<P>
	Imagine for a moment the frustration and sense of 
helplessness of his family as they were forced to sit in a 
courtroom in Saskatoon and hear witness after witness give 
evidence but were not allowed to say a word themselves to the 
court. They were not allowed to bring the victim's voice to 
confront the person who had done the wrong.
<P>
	Death, thanks to the current provisions, has not only silenced 
Brian King, but it has also silenced the memories of his family in 
the courtrooms of the land. Is this justice?
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say a few words in support of the 
restitution provisions of the bill. When a criminal is sent to jail, 
does the store owner he robbed feel better? Maybe he does. Does 
the sentence imposed upon the criminal help the store owner 
make ends meet at the end of the month? Restitution provides 
the opportunity to make criminals pay for their crimes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6029"> 6029 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation makes allowances for restitution for people 
who unwittingly buy stolen property. Currently if one buys 
stolen property and it is confiscated by the police, one loses 
what one has paid for it. Now restitution can be ordered by the 
courts and innocent victims of crime will be compensated.
<P>
	This bill shows that the Liberal government is committed to 
showing criminals that crime does not pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the member's speech. I have one question that I would 
like to ask. It is whether or not he would favour extending the 
right of individual groups to sentence people in their own group 
to groups beyond the aboriginals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, the contributions of the aboriginal 
community in the area of sentencing and sentencing circles to 
the rest of society can be very important. We should be looking 
to many of the provisions that the aboriginal community has, 
one of them being sentencing circles.
<P>
	That method of sentencing may be far more beneficial than 
many of the provisions that we presently incorporate into our 
criminal justice system. My answer is yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, this past 
week I attended a conference in Hamilton sponsored by 
Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its 
Termination otherwise known as CAVEAT.
<P>
	There were 185 delegates present, Canadians from all across 
Canada representing all walks of life including victims, police, 
educators, law societies, politicians, members from the other 
side of the House. Numerous others were present at this 
conference.
<P>
	At the conclusion of the conference many recommendations 
will be forwarded to the government, recommendations that I 
fully support-that must frighten some of them on the other side 
of the House-and believe would create an atmosphere that 
would make Canada a safe place for its citizens.
<P>
	In comparison, I look at the various proposals put forward by 
the government from the justice department, proposals like Bill 
C-41, Bill C-42, Bill C-44, Bill C-45, Bill C-37. While they 
are all small steps, and I emphasize small, in the right direction, 
all of them are a far cry from what Canadians are calling for and 
what these recommendations are going to represent.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In my final analysis, I believe these proposals, including Bill 
C-41, will not produce the means to reduce violent crimes in 
this country to any significant degree. I listened to speeches 
from members of the Liberal caucus who say these bills are 
nothing more than a small step in the right direction. I am also 
aware of petitions put forward in the House calling for serious 
amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada, amendments to 
the Bail Reform Act of 1972 and the Parole Act, petitions I 
might add with over two million signatures from all across 
Canada.
<P>
	The only result that all the proposals for change that this 
government is producing will be an attempt to convince people 
all across the country that another promise by the red ink book 
has been fulfilled when in fact these proposals will do little or 
nothing to improve the safety of Canadians regarding violent 
crimes.
<P>
	Now is the time and the opportunity for the government to 
bring forward legislation that announces zero tolerance for all 
acts of violence, and this is a far cry from that. What is wrong 
with zero tolerance? Why do we want to continue to live in a 
country where we have to be afraid for our children and 
grandchildren? What is the point? Let us continue to work hard 
in the area of prevention, but for heaven's sake draw the line in 
the sand and let all violent offenders know immediately that 
crossing that line will result in harsh meaningful punishment 
that they would regret.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is anxious to introduce new gun laws 
to make Canada safer. Why has one of these bills not been 
legislation that deems the use of a weapon in any crime will 
result in immediate incarceration to be served consecutively 
with any other sentence to a crime? Is the justice minister saving 
the gun issue to bring in legislation that will create a burden on 
law-abiding people? That is exactly what it will do when you 
start presenting legislation like I have seen. The criminal 
element will look at this legislation, they will laugh, make a joke 
and enjoy life.
<P>
	What is wrong with legislation that says life means life and 
repealing such sections as 745 of the Criminal Code? Remember 
the victims. You seem to forget the word victims. Remember 
that victims of all violent crimes are affected for life by these 
crimes so why should punishment for the criminals be any less?
<P>
	I agree with the Minister of Justice when he says that we need 
to reduce the population in our prisons. There are better ways to 
deal with some non-violent offenders. But to suggest that 
violent offenders should be considered for release from a life 
sentence in 15 years is totally ridiculous. I shudder to think that 
Clifford Olson and his type may be on the street again some day.
<P>
	That is why we have to ensure that sentencing guidelines are 
clear and consistent with the feeling of Canadians as represented 
by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The preamble to the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms states in section 15 that every 
individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to 
the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without 
discrimination. Bill C-41, clause 718.2, subclause (1) states 
that: ``When a court imposes a sentence it shall take into 
consideration the following: That the evidence that the offence 
was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, 
nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability'' and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6030"> 6030 </A></B>
<P>
now they want to  include sexual orientation ``of the victim shall 
be taken into consideration''.
<P>
	I cannot understand what is the difference between murdering 
a white man, a black man, a heterosexual or a homosexual. 
Violence is violence. Why do we want to make it tougher 
because they happen to believe something different than the 
rest? There is no way in the world that inclusion of sexual 
orientation, for example, in this legislation should make one 
iota of difference as to how severely the criminal should be 
treated.
<P>
	I personally believe that this clause conflicts with section 15 
of the charter. There is no reason to say that a sentence should be 
tougher because of violence or hate. Violence is violence and 
hate is hate. There should be no exclusion when it comes to 
sentencing. The whole point of sentencing is protection of the 
victim and punishment for criminals based on severity of the 
crime.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In summary I would like to say this. This country is alarmed, 
people are alarmed. If we think that 2.5 million signatures to this 
government can be ignored then we had better think again. I can 
promise that from what I have seen from the recommendations 
of those petitioners, that is exactly what this government has 
done. It has ignored their recommendations. The government 
better open its eyes, read them when they are received and 
adhere to them or one day we will truly regret it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has been reference made to the question of mandatory 
sentences when the firearms are used in the commission of an 
offence.
<P>
	A close review of the provisions of the Criminal Code will 
show that that is already the case. There is a mandatory jail 
sentence for the use of a firearm in the commission of an 
offence. The minimum sentence is one year. The problem that 
arises is not one of legislation. It is enforcement of the code by 
the provincial attorneys general.
<P>
	Further, there was reference made to zero tolerance. Zero 
tolerance of what? Police officers now lay charges when a 
person commits an offence. I would like to know from the hon. 
member what he means by zero tolerance in charging.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, apparently we are running into 
the same problem we always run into with these people. When 
your head is in the sand and your eyes and your ears are buried 
you do not hear or see what is going on. When you get a petition 
with 2.5 million names and you cannot hear the message, you 
should get your head out of the sand.
<P>
	I do not have to defend zero tolerance. Canadians will do that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, as you have seen, I have just 
come into the Chair. I noticed that when the hon. member was 
saying ``you'' that he was looking sort of in my direction. I 
presume the remarks were for the Chair and I take them as such.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to statements by members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

woman to run the full length of Canada.
<P>
	Jo began her incredible journey in May leaving from St. 
John's, Newfoundland, and arriving in Victoria, B.C., 111 days 
later. Along the way, a long way-some 7,295 kilometres-Jo 
was greeted, cheered and encouraged by many Canadians in all 
regions and by many members of Parliament.
<P>
	Her goal quite simply was to show that it could be done, that 
anyone who sets goals for themselves however big or small can 
accomplish them. Jo was especially running to raise awareness 
about the abilities of women, to show that there are no limits to 
what women can do.
<P>
	We can all learn from Jo's extraordinary determination and 
enthusiasm. Please join me in congratulating an amazing 
woman, a terrific Canadian.

	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to offer my support to the Minister of 
Justice and his initiative to draft legislation on gun control. The 
minister is striving to strike the right balance. He has told the 
House that his bill will focus on three areas: stopping illegal 
firearms, toughening the criminal justice system for firearms 
offences, and improving the regulation of firearms with a goal to 
enhancing community safety.
<P>
	The minister has also assured the House that he is keenly 
aware that hunting has a long tradition and is an important 
economic activity in many parts of Canada. His proposals will 
reflect not only the need for a safe society and a strong criminal 
justice system but will also respect the legitimate interests of 
hunters, farmers, and those who use firearms for subsistence.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	This is the kind of balanced approach to gun control that 
Canadians need and deserve. I encourage the minister to stick to 
his timetable and table new legislation in November.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, today on 
Parliament Hill there are thousands of people protesting the 
proposed gun laws that the government is considering.
<P>
	While the government has been talking about legislation to 
restrict guns, it has also been cutting back on the resources to 
enforce the existing laws that we have.
<P>
	For example, since 1992 the RCMP budget has been cut by 
$33.4 million. This means a reduction in prevention services, 
community services, enforcement services. I would urge the 
government to restore adequate funding to the RCMP so that 
crimes can be prevented and the laws we have enforced. It must 
be part of any overall approach to making our streets safer.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before we pass to Question Period, I know we 
have just been back for three or four days. I wonder if we might 
consider putting our questions a little more quickly, especially 
in the supplementaries, and cutting down and making almost 
non-existent the preamble. I would urge all hon. members who 
are answering questions to perhaps come to the point a little 
sooner so that we might get on more of our colleagues in the 
question and answer period.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government promised to reimburse Quebec for the 
expenses incurred in the referendum on the Charlottetown 
Accord. On Tuesday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
said that his government was not bound by this commitment and 
that Ottawa would therefore not reimburse Quebec. I remind you 
that the commitment in question was entered into by one first 
minister with another.
<P>
	I put my question to the Prime Minister. What is the 
commitment of a Prime Minister of Canada to the Premier of 
Quebec worth if his successor can go back on it so shamelessly 
and with such impunity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
asked senior officials in the Privy Council to check whether 
there had been commitments. I even discussed it at one point 
with current and former senior officials and we could not find 
any commitment made by the previous government in this 
regard. Under the circumstances, it must have been understood 
by the persons involved at the time that there was to be no 
compensation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if requested, I will file a statement from the public 
accounts of the Government of Quebec showing that the federal 
government still owes $47 million for this item. Furthermore, 
Senator Jean-Claude Rivest, a Liberal, who was Mr. Bourassa's 
principal advisor at the time, said yesterday that Prime Minister 
Mulroney had made such a commitment to Mr. Bourassa. I 
would remind the Prime Minister that he is less scrupulous than 
his Minister of Heritage, who on a mere rumour honoured a 
commitment made by some unknown person to allow an 
unacceptable transaction with Ginn Publishing to proceed.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister know that his refusal to reimburse 
will force Quebecers to pay twice for the referendum? Does he 
realize that the injustice is even more flagrant because the 
Charlottetown referendum dealt with a question formulated and 
presented by the federal authorities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I said, we will respect the commitments made by the 
government. If someone can clearly establish that the 
Government of Canada made a commitment, we will respect 
that commitment. We were not there, we were not part of the 
discussion and I asked senior officials to verify whether 
commitments had been made between the two levels of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	No trace of any commitment was found. Therefore I conclude 
that we have no obligation and that the Government of Quebec at 
the time knew very well that if it held a referendum under 
provincial law, the expenses would be incurred under that same 
law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the Ginn Publishing case also, it was an anonymous 
verbal commitment made under a previous government-we 
never found out who had made it-and it was supposedly 
honoured.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Prime Minister seems to be making a 
strange distinction between the Prime Minister, the head of the 
federal government, and the government, as if the Prime 
Minister did not have authority to commit his government when 
he gives his word of honour to another first minister. There must 
also be honour among first ministers.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister not ashamed to punish Quebecers in this 
way for rejecting the Charlottetown Accord?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am quite surprised that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois is 
asking me to keep a commitment made by someone else, when 
last week, he asked the leader of the Parti Quebecois in Quebec 
not to keep his word about holding a referendum within eight to 
ten months.
<P>
	If the Hon. Leader of the Opposition could just give us a 
document showing that there was a commitment between the 
Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada, we will 
honour the government's commitments. However, I have been 
unable to find any commitment of that kind. It is not mentioned 
anywhere in the minutes of Cabinet or in any documents.
<P>
	Gentlemen, give me proof that my predecessor and the 
previous government made a commitment and we will gladly 
pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of 
going on about the Quebec government's referendum, which is 
none of his business, perhaps the Prime Minister should start by 
paying his bills, and I am referring to what he owes Quebec.
<P>
	On January 28, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said 
in the House that he was looking into the request from the 
Government of Quebec. On May 4, the minister stated that the 
government had not yet reached a final decision. Yesterday, he 
said in passing that the government would not pay, which has 
been confirmed by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister trying to say that the federal 
government's refusal to pay the $26 million was motivated by 
the election of a sovereigntist government in Quebec, which 
would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6035"> 6035 </A></B>
<P>
confirm what was said by the Deputy Prime Minister on 
Tuesday: ``That is the price of separation.''?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member claims that what the Province of Quebec does 
is none of our business. What were he and his leader doing 
during the provincial election, when they went on the hustings? 
They are federal members, and federal members should stick to 
federal business. But he went around the province and ended up 
looking like a Don Quixote tilting at windmills.
<P>
	We did not cross the line between our jurisdictions. However, 
Canada's future is the Prime Minister's business.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	I am a citizen of Quebec, and Quebec's separation is my 
business, and I will do everything that is necessary to keep this 
country united.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Prime 
Minister of Canada wants to know what we were doing in a 
federal election, we were getting elected. He still does not 
realize that.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister's attitude, which deliberately and for no 
good reason is depriving Quebec of the $26 million to which it is 
entitled, is that attitude supposed to reflect this new spirit of 
co-operation with the new Government of Quebec? Will the 
Prime Minister of Canada, from now on, take the position that 
agreements do not count and he is the boss?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not going to say the same thing twice. If the Bloc Quebecois 
can establish that there was a commitment, we will abide by that 
commitment. I cannot make it clearer than that. However, we 
have worked very hard to find any evidence of such a 
commitment, and there is none.
<P>
	At the time, the Premier could easily have asked the Prime 
Minister to put it in writing, but we have found no indication 
whatsoever that any commitments were made.
<P>
	You said ``we were getting elected'', but I think it is now clear 
you got elected under false pretences.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Oh, yes. Mr. Speaker, they 
said: ``We are going to be the real power in Ottawa'', but they are 
all in the opposition, and not for more than four years. There will 
be no repeats.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to point out that while the Prime Minister and the 
Bloc were arguing about the cost of this referendum and the bill 
from Quebec, the total debt of the country just went up by a 
million dollars.
<P>
	The minister of immigration has been giving tough talk and 
proposals to the House that purport to tighten up the loopholes 
that allow criminal immigrants to remain in Canada. At the same 
time his department has been giving the Immigration and 
Refugee Board guidelines that specifically expedite the refugee 
claims of such dubious characters as Algerian double agents, 
members of the former Ethiopian dictatorship and guerrillas 
from Latin America.
<P>
	The minister gives the appearance of shutting the door to 
undesirable immigrants on the one hand, while allowing the IRB 
to open it right back up again.
<P>
	How does the minister plan to resolve this glaring 
contradiction in the implementation of immigration policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the short answer is that there is no 
contradiction. The editorials across the country, after your critic 
spoke on that, talked about the fabrication of the words spoken 
by your critic. Certainly that-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would ask the hon. minister to please 
direct his remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I think that put the 
matter to rest.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Pursuant to the Hathaway report, we have made it very clear 
to our case presenting officers that they have a duty to 
aggressively, regularly and consistently produce information to 
those applicants that would suggest that they either have a 
criminal background from the country they came or in Canada 
itself. Second, I made it very clear that the refugee case 
presenting officers have a duty to put forward the same 
information.
<P>
	The only question at the heart of those guidelines is that both 
my officers and the independent officers to the refugee board 
should not get involved in the adjudication of that case but they 
very clearly have the obligation to provide that information. If 
the information sticks then that will be carried out in the case of 
the adjudication.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact is that the system does not work. When the minister 
denigrates the critic from Calgary Northeast he should 
remember that he is a 20-year veteran of the Calgary police 
department who with his colleagues has spent years dealing with 
the defects of the department's processes and the failures of its 
processes.
<P>
	His perspective on this issue is not an academic or an interest 
group perspective, it is a street level perspective to which the 
minister should pay more attention.

defects of the-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would ask with all respect that the hon. 
member please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> My question, Mr. Speaker, for the minister is 
this. When is the minister of immigration going to assume full 
responsibility for immigration policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that on this subject 
matter this leader is out of his depth because he does not know 
what he is talking about.
<P>
	First, neither I nor my government have ever abdicated policy 
for either the IRB or immigration policy. For you, sir, there is a 
difference between-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask you, my colleagues, to please 
address your remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Perhaps the 
minister is out of depth on parliamentary procedure, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	We are talking about depth, Mr. Speaker. The real reason, and 
the minister knows this, for the difficulty in keeping illegal 
immigrants and foreign criminals out of Canada is that the 
Canadian courts ruled some time ago that the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms applies to anyone who is physically present in 
Canada regardless of how they got here or their criminal defects.
<P>
	Surely this is not what the Parliament of Canada nor the 
legislatures intended. They did not intend that the charter would 
undermine the ability of Canada to protect the integrity of its 
own boundaries.
<P>
	We can think of two ways to rectify this situation.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is quite a day. Welcome back to 
Parliament. I wonder if the hon. member would please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Does the minister have any proposal for 
getting to the root of this problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, through you, the hon. member is as 
convoluted as his party's policy on this. He moves from Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms to the IRB to immigration policy. He is 
changing his adjectives.
<P>
	This minister has not abdicated policy for the IRB. What I 
have said time in and time out is that this minister and this 
government will not get involved in the day to day adjudication 
of cases before the Immigration and  Refugee Board regardless 
of how many times its critics get up and give us the blood and the 
guts and the gore of individual cases. We are responsible for the 
general policy framework under which the IRB operates.

their pressure on the government to go back on its election 
promise regarding firearms. Just today, these lobbies are 
holding a major demonstration on the Hill in order to sway the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, last May the Prime Minister 
asked me to prepare proposals for the fall with a view to 
strengthening firearms legislation, and I will do so.
<P>
	I spent most of the summer consulting Canadians throughout 
the country and I listened to what they had to say. We are 
currently examining a full range of possibilities and I will be 
tabling a bill in the House within a few months, probably in 
November. Our primary goal at all times will be the safety of 
Canadian citizens. We are, I believe, at the point where we must 
decide what kind of country we want to live in.

	We will have substantial changes in gun control for the safety 
of Canada in the months ahead. Make no mistake about that. In 
the preparation of that package we are taking into account the

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

engaged has taken me across the country to speak to people 
interested in this subject. I have consulted with my colleagues in 
the Liberal caucus who come from every province and territory 
of the country.
<P>
	Rather than tell the House today what it is that is going to be 
done, we are developing proposals through that consultation and 
we are being respectful of the legitimate interests of firearms 
owners.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member, as I emphasize on each occasion 
when I am given the opportunity to do so, that our fundamental 
objective is a safer society, that we are going to deal with illegal 
firearms in this country, that we are going to toughen the 
criminal law in its response to those who use firearms in the 
commission of offences, and we are going to deal with the 
regulation of firearms in the hands of lawful owners in a manner 
consistent with safety in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see clearly 
from the last exchange that the law-abiding gun owners from 
Quebec out here on the lawn do not have a representative here in

<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is a very far reaching Question Period we 
are into. I know the hon. member is going to put his question 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the justice 
minister as well. In his 1993 report, the Auditor General 
indicated the previous government's Bill C-17 was not 
formulated upon a sound statistical basis and that the 
government proceeded for reasons of public policy.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice this. Will his proposed 
amendment to the gun control legislation be based upon 
statistical information that clearly demonstrates whether or not 
the current controls are meeting their objectives which is to 
reduce the criminal use of firearms in society or are we again 
proceeding simply for the purposes of public policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice 
has indeed commissioned studies. It has received factual 
research information about the situation with firearms in this 
country.
<P>
	We have read with interest some research information 
released yesterday by the Toronto police about the incidence of 
the use of handguns in the commission of crime in that city. We 
read the report recently about the defects in the present 
registration system for restricted firearms and the need to 
improve the registration system.
<P>
	We have read studies about the need for change in the criminal 
law to send the message that if one uses a firearm in the 
commission of an offence, one will get a stern response from the 
justice system.
<P>
	Our proposals will be based upon fact. They are going to be 
based upon research. But they are going to be based more than 
anything else upon the policy of this government which is to 
take steps that ensure the safety of our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
minister for that response. I am sure that he will submit those 
reports to the members of the standing committee on justice.
<P>
	My supplemental is this. In describing Canada's current gun 
control legislation, the courts of Canada have used the terms 
such as vague, uncertain, invalid, inconsistent with the charter, 
convoluted, fictitious and twice removed from reality.
<P>
	I ask the minister this. Will he put aside any proposed 
legislation and immediately undertake a complete re-evaluation 
of the current legislation to ensure it is clear, consistent and of 
direct effect upon the criminal element to provide the protection 
needed by our society?

<P>
	While Canadians are, with good reason, asking themselves 
serious questions about the blood supply system, the minister 
told the Canadian press that the reason Canadian standards are 
not as stringent as those in effect in the U.S. is that Canadian

am always happy to clarify the hon member's question and to

reason it is different is that it is based on a different philosophy, 
on a volunteer donor system instead of a paid donor system.

country would like that.
<P>
	With Bill C-44 we have taken precisely the common sense 
approach to try to fix up the removals and tighten up the refugee 
system. My question is: Why is that party playing politics and 
not supporting the legislation?
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's bureaucrats want numbers cut. They want family 
reunification rationalized and refugee determination tightened. 
The minister's department, the overwhelming majority of 
Canadians and even a significant number of backbenchers in the 
minister's own party want Reform policy implemented.
<P>
	When will the minister stop standing alone, stop pandering to 
special interests and do what everyone wants him to do: 
implement Reform immigration policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last eight months this 
party has put in motion an unprecedented consultation process 
with Canadians, the very grassroots, which is what the hon. 
member suggests we did not do.
<P>
	In fact the hon. member told our departmental officials at the 
two-day conference how impressed he was with the breadth of 
the consultation process. I challenge the member to deny that.
<P>
	Not only are we putting in train, putting in the one room the 
individuals who accentuate one particular line, but when was the 
last time a minister of a government invited the Immigration 
Association of Canada to participate so that government could 
have the purview of Canadian public opinion?
<P>
	Before November 1 this government will table those levels. I 
know the levels will be in the best interests of Canada and not in 
the best interests of the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last June several provinces rejected the proposal to replace the 
GST with an alternate tax put forward by the Liberal members of 
the finance committee. Faced with this absolute refusal, within 
24 hours, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance had 
disowned the report tabled by their own people, thereby 
throwing people into total confusion with respect to their 
intentions.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance recognize that, in response to 
this deadlock, he is now offering two choices to the provinces: 
either replace the GST with an 11 per cent Canadian tax on

<HR>
<B><A NAME="6039"> 6039 </A></B>
<P>
goods and services, including food, health care and drugs, or 
increase instead the income tax  rate of individuals who are 
already overburdened by taxation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, we did 
approve the main finding of the finance committee regarding the 
need to harmonize federal and provincial sales tax to better 
serve consumers as well as small and medium-sized business 
and indeed save a lot by reducing duplication and overlapping.
<P>
	This being said, we had talks with the provinces and 
discussions are ongoing. As a matter of fact, we intend to look at 
what our officials have done over the summer at the next finance 
ministers meeting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance is telling us that he actually resolved the 
matter with this proposal, but nothing was resolved. The 
proposal was brushed aside as soon as it was tabled. So, it solved 
nothing.
<P>
	When will the minister recognize that the solution, the only 
one, is to get rid of the whole sorry mess, eliminate overlapping 
and respect the fiscal autonomy of the provinces, particularly 
that of Quebec? This would involve abolishing the GST, yet 
another commitment the Prime Minister failed to fulfil, and 
transferring this entire field of taxation to the provinces. That is 
the only solution and the Liberals have already reneged on their 
promise to eliminate the GST.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is so 
anxious to see the GST disappear, I certainly would expect him 
to tell us at the same time where we are supposed to find the 
money it used to generate. We have waited, week after week, for 
the hon. critic opposite to come up with constructive 
suggestions for us, but he has refused to make any.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Canadian taxation is too important a matter to depend merely 
on speeches made in this House. The hon. member had his 
chance, but if he is prepared to sit down with us and make some 
constructive suggestions, we are certainly willing to listen.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Justice. Today we hear strong voices 
speaking out on gun control. In his statements the minister has 
recognized there is a legitimate role for firearms in rural 
communities. Can he also assure this House that he is prepared 
to take the necessary measures to ensure the security of our inner 
cities and urban communities where gun related violence is 
becoming a serious problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope it is evident from my 
responses earlier today that the approach we are taking will deal 
with just the issue the hon. member has described. We will deal 
with the presence of illegal firearms in the country in a 
comprehensive and effective way. We will toughen the response 
of the criminal justice system to those criminals who use 
firearms in the commission of offences.
<P>
	However I am not one of those who believes this issue is rural 
or urban in its division. I believe, as I think many others do, that 
those persons who live in rural areas are just as concerned as the 
urban dwellers with their personal security and safety. The facts 
establish that the per capita homicide rate from firearms over 10 
years based on 5,000 deaths is higher in the rural areas of this 
country than it is in the urban areas. So we must pay attention to 
both the urban and the rural setting. Ultimately the bottom line 
for this government is the safety of this society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been given a list of refugees allowed into this country by the 
immigration department. According to the report one such 
individual who is believed to reside in Toronto is reported to be 
trafficking in munitions.
<P>
	Has the Minister of Justice considered talking to the minister 
of immigration about removing such individuals as a means of 
real effective gun control, rather than concentrating on our 
law-abiding citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall be happy to take it up 
with the minister. I am certain he is aware of it.
<P>
	But I do not think we should conclude for a moment that the 
question of gun control applies uniquely to people trading in 
munitions or robbing the cornerstore with a handgun or hunters 
who perhaps might be careless on occasion with a rifle. It 
pertains to all of that and more and we are taking a 
comprehensive look at the entire subject.
<P>
	I do not suggest for a moment, nor have I ever, that the 
question is narrow. I suggest it is broad. It involves illegal 
firearms in the country and we should do something about that. 
It involves criminals using firearms, and we must do more about 
that. But we cannot forget either that 1,400 people per year lose 
their lives in this country as a result of firearms, 1,100 by 
suicides and one-third of those are in the age group of 15 to 22 
who perhaps act impulsively on a single episode.
<P>
	Let us look at the whole question. I will take up that matter 
with my colleague in cabinet but I shall work away at proposals 
that deal with the whole question.

very disappointed. At this late date the Minister of Justice is 
saying he will be happy to take it up with the minister of 
immigration. He should have already taken it up.
<P>
	There is another such individual according to immigration 
intelligence or lack thereof. He is an international black 
marketer in weapons. Does the minister of immigration 
understand the link between criminal refugees marketing 
weapons and crime and gun control, or is this just one big fog?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed we do 
understand the link very clearly. That is one of the reasons Bill 
C-44 was brought in today.
<P>
	Consequently because of the hon. member's concern with 
matters like this, because of his concern about crime and justice 
issues in this country, those that relate to immigration and those 
that do not, I hope he will rethink the issue and support Bill C-44 
on Tuesday.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is three o'clock p.m. I would simply bring to 
your attention that it was a rather unusual day. We did not get in

comments made by my colleague, the hon. member from Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	There are two points on which I would appreciate clarification 
from the Chair. What I wanted to say faithfully reflected what 
was said by the hon. member. I now wonder whether the Chair's 
response to my statement was an indication that there are two 
kinds of parliamentarians in this House, and why the Chair 
tolerates such comments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. My dear colleagues, as you 
know, in the course of a debate, when we make speeches, we 
may use some pretty strong language. I would like to read to the 
hon. member what it says here in the Annotated Standing 
Orders: ``What is acceptable depends largely on the 
circumstances, but personal attacks, insults, obscene language 
or words which question a Member's or a Senator's integrity, 
honesty, or character are not in order. To reduce the possibility 
of personal references, convention further requires Members to 
refer to each other by title, position or constituency names. 
Likewise, the Senate is usually ``the other place'', and Senators, 
``Members of the other place'', although generally references to 
Senate debates and Senators are discouraged altogether. A  
further long-standing practice also protects the judiciary from 
disrespectful or offensive attacks.''

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-41, an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other 
acts in consequence thereof, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are considering Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code with respect to sentencing.
<P>
	While this bill has several good provisions, it also has some 
that concern me. It is evident that it is difficult to properly 
consider Criminal Code provisions with respect to sentencing 
without also considering the substantive provisions of the code 
or even to consider sentencing without relating that to the prison 
system or the parole system.
<P>
	In other words, if we are deciding on whether to change our 
sentencing procedures and our sentencing policy, we have to ask 
ourselves how these changes will impact on our prison 
populations, on how they inter-relate to our parole system and 
how they will affect our treatment programs in prison.
<P>
	If the sentencing provisions, if they are provisions that will 
lengthen sentences, will result in more people in prisons, then 
there will be an impact on prison populations. If there is an 
impact on increasing the prison populations, then it will also 
relate to the level of programs that we have in prisons to treat 
inmates, whether there are enough resources for those programs, 
enough spaces, enough teachers, enough counsellors, enough 
psychiatrists and so on.
<P>
	My concern is if we adopt a policy of lengthening sentences 
and at the same time become tougher on parole, make parole 
more difficult to get-I refer members to some parts of Bill 
C-45, which was before us yesterday-and if at the same time 
we provide fewer resources for our correction and prison 
systems as a result of our campaign to cut the deficit, then we are 
going to have a situation in which we have more people going 
into the prison system for longer periods of time where those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6042"> 6042 </A></B>
<P>
people will stay in longer because parole is becoming more 
difficult to obtain and at the same time fewer resources to 
provide accommodation and programs for those inmates.
<P>
	At the present time our prisons are extremely overcrowded. 
During the summer I had the opportunity to visit prisons in the 
Kingston area. There were prisons that were built to 
accommodate 450 inmates which now have well over 650 
inmates. There is double bunking and even triple bunking in 
cells that are narrower than I can stretch my arms, and I am not a 
big man. There are very small cells in which there now is double 
bunking.
<P>
	There have been reductions in the educational programs 
available to inmates and a reduction in recreation programs 
available to inmates. This goes back to the previous government 
from which there were continual cuts over the last nine years. I 
raise it now. We have come to government recently but I raise 
this very important matter that must be considered when we are 
considering sentencing and parole.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves what the result will be if we continue 
on that policy line where inmates go in for longer periods of time 
and do not have the same access to parole or who are not 
prepared for parole, and there are no programs to occupy and 
help those inmates when they are in prison because we are 
overly concerned with the deficit and we are cutting here and 
there and everywhere.
<P>
	We can look to previous periods that had similar situations. 
There were hostage taking incidents. There were riots and there 
were higher rates of recidivism.
<P>
	We must remember that the great majority of inmates who are 
sent to prison are there on limited sentences. They are not there 
on life sentences. They are there for armed robbery or assault or 
fraud or theft and so on for which they get sentences of five 
years, seven years, ten years. Sooner or later they have to be 
released. If we are truly concerned with the safety of the public 
surely we want them to be released in a situation, in a state 
where they are of less danger to the public than when they went 
in.
<P>
	If we continue on this drift which is being suggested by some 
quarters in our society and which is principally put forward by 
the Reform Party in this House, I must ask whether we should 
simply have longer and harsher sentences and tighter parole and 
cut the moneys available for our prisons. What is the result with 
respect to the protection of society when the great majority of 
those inmates are released into society?
<P>
	I suggest that this will leave us with a much more dangerous 
situation for our citizens. Inmates will be released into society 
without education, without training, without treatment, who 
have been through an experience of tension, violence and so on. 
We just have to look at the American experience where they 
have adopted those kinds of policies. Look at some of the 
southern states, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia where they 
went ahead with such policies. They had longer and harder 
sentences. It was more difficult to get parole and they cut back 
on resources.
<P>
	I read recently of a situation in which a judge in a particular 
community had no prison space to send an inmate to because 
there were no places available. The prison was so full and there 
were so few people coming out, so many people had gone in, that 
here was an inmate who was convicted but there was no place in 
the prison for that individual. The lawmakers had not considered 
when changing their provisions with sentencing and parole that 
maybe they have to also provide resources.
<P>
	We may have to build new prisons if we keep on lengthening 
the sentences and cutting down on the parole. We may have to 
build at a much greater expense than we would otherwise have to 
to accommodate these individuals.
<P>
	Where they have done this in the United States, where they 
have pursued those policies, they have not protected the public. 
The rates of violent crimes are much higher than they are here. 
In those states that have brought back capital punishment, for 
example Florida, they are executing people in the morning and 
in the afternoon somebody is killing an innocent citizen simply 
to get his car. There was a citizen from Montreal who flew to 
Florida. He rented a car at the airport and was murdered simply 
for the automobile when there had been an execution that very 
same day. We hear the same thing with respect to other 
individuals.
<P>
	Let us think out our policies on these matters very clearly and 
examine the interrelationship between sentencing, our 
correctional system and our parole system.
<P>
	This bill also deals with certain amendments to section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. Section 745 is the article that I am in part 
responsible for because it deals with the review of parole 
eligibility for convicted murderers at 15 years. This bill would 
allow for certain victim information to be provided at those 
hearings which are meant to determine whether parole 
eligibility should be reduced from 25 years to 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	I certainly agree that we must have more programs to help 
victims, that we must consider victims more in our criminal 
justice system but I have some doubt if this is the right place to 
provide for victims' statements.
<P>
	I say that because section 745 says that upon receipt of an 
application under this section the appropriate chief justice shall 
designate a judge to empanel a jury to hear the application and 
determine whether the applicant's number of years of 
imprisonment without eligibility for parole ought to be reduced 
having regard to the character of the applicant, his 
conduct-that is, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6043"> 6043 </A></B>
<P>
inmate's conduct while serving his sentence-the nature of the 
offence and such other matters as the judge deems relevant.
<P>
	I have to ask myself whether the information of the victim's 
family-it will have to be the victim's family in this case, the 
parents, the wife, the husband of the person who has been 
murdered-put on the record would relate to the character of the 
applicant because that is what the judge has to consider, the 
character of the applicant, his conduct while serving his 
sentence and the nature of the offence. I ask how the victim's 
family might have something to say after 15 years about the 
character or the conduct of the inmate applying for early parole 
eligibility.
<P>
	In any case, I presume that the victim information statements 
would have to be relevant to the matter that is before the court 
and not to matters that are irrelevant.
<P>
	Let me explain the background of these provisions. Prior to 
1976 those convicted of non-capital murder or whose sentences 
were commuted from the death penalty who had committed 
capital murder were eligible for parole at 10 years. I should 
point out that we have had no executions in Canada since 1962. 
Until 1976 when we had parole eligibility at 10 years there were 
very few errors. I think at the time we introduced the bill in 1976 
in the history of the country there had been four individuals who 
had been released on parole and committed murder again. The 
10-year parole eligibility experience had not been one which led 
to disaster in this country.
<P>
	When capital punishment was abolished in 1976 we provided  
a life sentence for first and second degree murder with parole 
eligibility at 10 years for second degree murder with the 
possibility of the judge and jury increasing that up to 25 years at 
the time of the trial or the judgment. For first degree murder it 
was a 25 year parole eligibility period but with the opportunity 
of applying at 15 years for a reduction of the parole eligibility 
date from 25 to 15.
<P>
	Some commentators and some members of this House have 
referred to that 15-year provision as a loophole. It was not a 
loophole. It was in the bill. It was debated in this House. It is 
clearly in the legislation. It is expressly provided for. It is not 
something that the government or the authorities have found and 
dropped between the boards, so to speak. It is there positively. It 
is a positive statement in the law that one can apply at 15 years to 
have one's parole eligibility reduced from 25 years to 15 years. 
If the court reduces your parole eligibility from 25 to 16 or 17 
years you still have to go to the parole board and argue in favour 
of your parole.
<P>
	You cannot be paroled unless you prove to the parole board 
that you are completely rehabilitated and no longer a danger to 
society. This is not automatic before the parole board or before 
the court on the 15-year review. As a matter of fact, most 
applicants on the 15-year review have been turned down. Even 
when people get before the parole board many of the cases are 
rejected. They are not granted parole because they are  not able 
to establish that they are totally rehabilitated and no longer a 
danger to society.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I have proposed that we do away with the 15-year review and 
have parole eligibility at 15 years. Some people have 
misrepresented that proposal and have said that I am proposing 
that the sentence for murder be 15 years. That is totally false. 
The sentence for murder is and was a life sentence and should 
remain a life sentence.
<P>
	One must also remember that when you are on a life sentence 
even if you are on parole the sentence continues. You may be 
serving the sentence outside the institution, outside of prison, 
but you are still under that life sentence. If you break the 
conditions of your parole-you do not even have to commit a 
crime-you can be sent back to prison to continue serving the 
life sentence. If you commit a minor offence of criminal 
negligence, theft or whatever, you can be put back into prison 
not only for the minor offence but also to continue serving your 
life sentence for murder.
<P>
	It is not a question of changing the sentence for murder. The 
sentence for murder is life. I am not suggesting that it be 
otherwise. What we are talking about is the eligibility for 
parole, whether it should be 15 years or 25 years. We are not 
suggesting that the sentence be changed. It is a question under 
our system of whether you serve your sentence in a maximum 
security institution, in a medium security institution, in a 
minimum security institution or outside an institution altogether 
but under supervision in the community, which is parole.
<P>
	There are various ways of serving sentences but you are still 
under sentence. For murder it is always a life sentence and 
nobody has suggested changing the sentence.
<P>
	I simply want to say I was pleased that the minister did not do 
away with the 15-year review in the case of convicted 
murderers. I have some concern about how the provision he has 
put in the bill will apply and be relevant to the question to be 
decided at 15 years. My preference would have been that we get 
rid of the 15-year review and have parole eligibility at 15 years. 
Not everybody would be granted parole. They would still have 
to prove that they were no longer a danger to society and were 
totally rehabilitated. Therefore, people who are dangerous 
would not be released. They would still be kept in prison. It 
would give an opportunity to those who have served 15 or 16 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6044"> 6044 </A></B>
<P>
years who were totally rehabilitated, who are ready to work and 
support themselves and their families to go back into society 
under supervision, serving their sentence in society, in the 
community.
<P>
	I want to say again that any policy on sentencing must have as 
its principal goal the protection of the public. The purpose of 
criminal law is to protect the public from that behaviour which 
we categorize as criminal. That is the goal. If that is the goal of 
course then once we have people within the prison system our 
goal there has to be to rehabilitate or correct those individuals 
because the overwhelming majority of them will be on limited 
sentences and returned to society. If they are going to return to 
society the goal of the system has to be to rehabilitate, to 
correct.
<P>
	We cannot expect the Criminal Code or the criminal justice 
system or our sentencing policy to be the principal means of 
preventing and reducing crime. Those policies can only relate to 
individuals once the crime is committed, once the damage has 
been done.
<P>
	If we are really interested in reducing and preventing crime 
then we have to direct our attention to the causes of those 
crimes, whether they are social or economic, whether they are 
psychological. We have to ask ourselves why these individuals 
whether they are young people or adults are committing those 
crimes, and what can we do to prevent them.
<P>
	Maybe we can have better gun control. I fully support more 
gun control and will support the minister when he brings in his 
bill because the fewer guns available the fewer crimes we will 
have with guns.
<P>
	It could be that we have to do something about children who 
are abandoned or mistreated, whose parents are alcoholics or 
drug addicts who have abandoned their children and they grow 
up in a system of complete neglect without belonging to any 
family or group and who become very anti-social.
<P>
	My point is those people who think that we can simply make 
amendments to the Criminal Code with respect to sentencing or 
the substance of a criminal offence will solve the problem and 
give the public the impression that will bring about a safer 
society are deluding society, are fooling society. They are not 
being honest with society.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We could amend every section of the Criminal Code. We 
could make it as hard and tough as we wish. That would not 
solve the problem. We have seen that, as I have said, in certain 
states of the United States.
<P>
	If we are truly serious about protecting the public from crime, 
reducing crime or preventing crime, we must address the causes 
of crime. It is not simply a question for the Department of 
Justice or the Department of the Solicitor General. It is also for 
health and welfare, human resources, employment and 
immigration, provincial governments, school boards and 
municipal governments. We all have to play our role in dealing 
with society and the causes that give rise to crime.
<P>
	I will bring my remarks to a close. As I said, the bill contains 
some very good provisions, some better alternatives for 
sentencing. It sets out a charter or a goal for sentencing policy. 
However there are a few provisions in the bill with which I have 
concern and I will be pleased, with the permanent committee on 
justice, to examine the bill to see if it can be improved in 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the presentation just made by the member opposite. I 
share some of his concerns with respect to the legislation and the 
whole problem of how we solve the crime situation in the 
country. We have heard recently that the crime rate in Canada is 
now going down. If that is really true then we ought to be truly 
grateful.
<P>
	I have concern with respect to the whole idea of probation and 
the elements of section 745. It seems to me that people who enter 
the criminal justice system are those who already are 
demonstrating they are not good in and of themselves or they 
have failed. Somehow it seems we have to kick in an extra gear 
of the administration of justice in this case so that they will learn 
the harder lesson they have failed to learn before.
<P>
	I would really be interested in a comment from the hon. 
member. He indicated that he would like to see automatic parole 
at 15 years instead of merely the eligibility to apply for it despite 
the crime. It concerns me a great deal that there should 
automatically be a right to say: ``My punishment is over even 
though I have taken someone's life''. That is heinous and 
serious. We ought to be strengthening it rather than weakening 
it.
<P>
	I would like to hear some further justification if he has it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I sometimes wonder whether we 
all are speaking the same language even when we are speaking 
English. I thought I said-and I have said it over and over 
again-that I am opposed to automatic parole. There is no such 
thing as automatic parole in the country. I never suggested at any 
time in my entire life that anybody be paroled automatically.
<P>
	What I was saying and what I continue to say is that I believe 
at a certain date people should be eligible to go to the parole 
board and present their case. They would have to show they were 
totally rehabilitated and no longer a danger to society. If they 
cannot demonstrate it then they are not paroled. The last thing I 
would recommend would be releasing into society on parole 
people automatically, simply because they had reached a date.
<P>
	At the end of a sentence is a different thing which I will deal 
with in a moment. I have never recommended automatic parole 
for murderers and I will not. I assure the hon. member of that. He 
may have read things like that, but I have never recommended 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6045"> 6045 </A></B>
<P>
	I have recommended the right to apply for parole at 15 years, 
just as they have the right to parole at one-third of sentence. For 
example, if they have a six-year sentence they can apply at two 
years. It does not mean they are going to get it. The parole board 
will hear their case but it may say no.
<P>
	We hear of certain cases where people have gone before the 
parole board six times and were turned down six times because 
they were still bad actors. All the evidence that comes in on 
them with respect to their case before the parole board is that 
they are not ready for parole. I support that. I do not believe in 
automatic parole. I want to put that to rest.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The member raised a good point when he said that some 
people have demonstrated by committing their crimes that they 
are not good and need some time in prison. I agree with him.
<P>
	Violent individuals who committed crimes of violence should 
be kept in prison, but they should be given a system of treatment 
or correction which, when they go back on the street, will mean 
that they will be safer. They will be less likely to commit the 
crimes that they went in for.
<P>
	There are provisions. We find, for example, that the rate of 
literacy in prison is very low. People have a very low rate of 
literacy, very low education. They do not have trades. If we can 
help them in prison to learn trades, learn how to work, learn to 
live like ordinary people who get up in the morning, go to work, 
save their money, and learn the skills of ordinary people who 
live in society, we will be doing a great deal.
<P>
	If we have a system of release whereby they are released with 
support when they go back in the community, whereby they have 
parole officers who will help them get jobs, get settled, 
reintroduce them to their families and so on, we will have less 
chance of crime when they return to society.
<P>
	I believe in keeping people in prison, but when they are in 
prison they must be given a program that will help them do 
better when they get out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has a great deal of 
experience in this matter having served as Solicitor General of 
the country.
<P>
	He describes to us the American system which most of us 
regard with a considerable amount of concern and is obviously 
not providing a sensible solution by building more prisons and 
having longer sentences. It seems to be an infernal industry in 
the United States. They create the crime. They create the crime 
chasers and then they create the incarceration. There is no end to 
it.
<P>
	The member gave a very cogent description of the problems in 
Florida and the juxtaposition of a death penalty in the morning 
and a murder in the afternoon. I understand his point about the 
lack of deterrence.
<P>
	We also have the problem of the Canadian public desperately 
trying to understand what we can do. In our inner cities today we 
are confronted with serious problems. In my own riding of 
Rosedale I have serious problems in downtown Toronto. At a 
time 15 years ago gunshots did not ricochet off downtown 
buildings. Now there are women and children who are afraid to 
walk around at night in parts of downtown Toronto. It is no good 
to say we will seize all the guns. Admittedly that is a start but 
only a start. There will always be guns there.
<P>
	Has the member found another model? Does he know of 
somewhere else? Is there some other model that he can draw to 
our attention from the depth of his experience that we could be 
looking at, something concrete to which we as Canadians can 
turn to address the problem of the violence that is getting worse 
in our inner cities and not react in the American way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Rosedale. As I said there is no quick fix for increasing 
criminality. If we delude our citizens into believing there is a 
quick fix we deserve condemnation.
<P>
	If we suggest to them that we can solve the problems of crime 
in the streets in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver simply by 
amending provisions of the Criminal Code or by making the 
sentence 20 years instead of 10 years which they have done in 
certain American states, if we suggest that is a solution and five 
months later there is even more crime, we are not serving our 
public very well.
<P>
	We must show leadership in the House on these issues. We 
must deal with the causes of crime. We must make sure that we 
have child protection acts that intervene at an early age when 
children are being abused or when they start going wrong, 
whether it is eight or nine. They have such an act in Quebec 
called the Child Protection Act. I am sure they have one in 
Ontario which deals with children under 12 who are lower than 
the age for the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Whether these are children going from foster home to foster 
home, whether they are abandoned by their families, or whether 
they are caught up in drugs or whatever, we have to intervene 
quickly to try to prevent these things. We also have to make sure 
that we have proper educational systems, employment policies 
and so on that help turn people to productive ways of life and not 
criminal ways of life. That is the model I suggest but it is not a 
quick fix. It means we have to spend some money but it is money 
that will show dividends. If we have safer communities in the 
long run it is money that pays off.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6046"> 6046 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	There may have been some terrible crimes in Toronto in 
recent years but I have looked at the statistics. Toronto had 
somewhere between 50 and 60 murders last year. It is a city of 
over three million people. If we compare it with Detroit, 
Cleveland or New Orleans, those communities have over 500 or 
600 murders per year. Toronto is a safe city compared to those 
others.
<P>
	I do not show any sort of toleration for the terrible murders 
that took place in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver or wherever, 
but the rate of crime is much lower than it is in the United States, 
maybe because we have traditionally taken an approach that was 
not simply a criminal justice approach.
<P>
	We have had broader social programs and better educational 
programs. When we talk about the United States, criminal law is 
a state matter unlike here where it is a national matter. Some 
states in the United States have much better programs and 
systems than others. I referred to the ones that were very 
punitive and did not take a preventive or rehabilitative 
approach. There are some states that do and do much better, by 
the way.
<P>
	If we look at states like Minnesota, some New England states 
and some other states there are much lower rates of crime per 
100,000 than some southern states with very tough, long 
sentencing policies.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member from 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley and the other members of 
our caucus will be on during the time allotted for 20 minutes.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House today to address 
some remarks on Bill C-41 that deals with sentencing in our 
criminal justice system. The Minister of Justice is to be 
congratulated for bringing the bill forward at this time and for 
his other attempts to deal with young offenders and with 
restrictions on firearms.
<P>
	While we may not always agree with the minister's proposals 
on this side of the House, there is no question that he is giving us 
food for thought. I cannot help but think that if the current 
Minister of Finance was working this hard on behalf of the 
Canadian people the deficit would be well under control.
<P>
	In any event, we are here to address the various aspects of Bill 
C-41. I would like in my remarks today to address some of the 
positive aspects of the bill and then deal with some of the 
deficiencies-at least deficiencies as I see them-that hopefully 
can be cured when the bill is dealt with in committee.
<P>
	As my colleagues have pointed out, one of the most 
important, positive elements of the bill is that for the first time a 
statute will contain a statement of the purpose and principles of 
sentencing.
<P>
	There is nothing new in this statement, but it does codify the 
existing law and will provide explicit direction to judges in our 
criminal courts on the principles that must be applied in each 
individual case. While this is a positive aspect to Bill C-41, 
there are a number of negatives that I hope will be addressed in 
committee.
<P>
	When I talk to my constituents about the criminal justice 
system the comments I hear most often concern the lack of 
predictability about sentencing. This lack of predictability can 
range from comments on different lengths of sentences being 
imposed for similar crimes, to comments that sometimes 
express outrage at the short amount of time some criminals have 
to spend in prison.
<P>
	People feel that like crimes should be treated alike. That is, if 
a white collar criminal steals through breach of trust he or she 
should receive the same sentence as any other person convicted 
of theft. I know that in some cases white collar criminals do 
receive stiffer sentences than others, but because of the way our 
system operates most of the sentence is served on the street and 
not in prison.
<P>
	White collar criminals should spend their sentences in prison. 
This is the deterrent aspect of sentencing: accountability or 
being held responsible for our actions. Our criminal justice 
system must send a clear message to all who are contemplating 
the commission of a crime that if you do the crime then you must 
do the time. It is time spent in incarceration with no special 
treatment.
<P>
	The second issue raised by constituents deals with the length 
of time served in incarceration. We are all aware of anecdotal 
evidence of people being sentenced to long prison terms and 
then in a very short time they are back on the street. Our system 
seems to be full of opportunities for criminals to manipulate it 
so they do not spend nearly as much time in jail as the judge or 
those who are victims originally believed the convicted person 
would spend in jail.
<P>
	Bill C-41 addresses this issue to some extent by allowing 
victims to make representations at early parole hearings.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Why should we put victims through this trauma? Indeed, why 
should there be early parole hearings at all? When a person has 
been sentenced to 10 years in prison, what is wrong with that 
person serving at least seven or eight of that 10 years before 
looking at parole or other means to put the person back on the 
street?
<P>
	This raises a question. Should offenders of violent crimes be 
paroled at all? Should their sentences be reduced? Today more 
than ever before we are made aware of the anger of all Canadians 
when offenders of violent crimes are out on day passes or 
paroled at a very early date or receive a reduced sentence and a 
violent crime is the result. One death from the hands of a violent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6047"> 6047 </A></B>
<P>
offender who should not be out on the streets of our country 
before his or her sentence is up is one death too many.
<P>
	The people of Canada want to see some measure of certainty 
in the system and this bill does not provide it for them.
<P>
	Another point that I take issue with is the aggravating factor 
of hate in relation to the sentencing for some crimes. We in the 
Reform Party believe that we are all created equal. No group 
should have more rights than others. It makes no sense to me to 
grade severity of punishment on the basis that the victim 
belongs to a protected class. Can it be any worse to kill or wound 
a person of a protected group than to kill or maim someone who 
is not in a protected group? I do not think so. If a crime is 
committed, the criminal should be punished and the public 
should know that if you commit crime <I>x</I> then you get <I>y</I> years. 
Maybe that is too simple for our seemingly complex society 
today but it is the way we see things on this side of the House.
<P>
	I heard Tuesday in this House that if a crime is perpetrated as a 
result of hate against the individual, there should be a harsher 
sentence, a stronger sentence. As I understand the example 
given, it was a member of the gay community who was brutally 
beaten causing death.
<P>
	I ask the House to consider the senseless death of a 31-year 
old Coquitlam man, I believe it was Mr. Niven, who outside a 
convenience store was brutally kicked and beaten to death just 
recently. Is there any difference in the savagery of such a crime? 
Can we really state that one is worse than the other?
<P>
	Does one deserve a harsher penalty than the other? Has not in 
each case a man been brutally beaten to death? Is one life worth 
less than another? I sincerely hope not. Is not all life precious 
and of equal value? I sincerely hope so.
<P>
	We are also concerned that this bill allows provinces to 
establish alternative measures programs. Again, such a system 
while in theory its goals may be laudable will create unevenness 
in the system. Some crimes in some provinces will be treated 
differently than similar crimes in other provinces. Again, there 
is enough uncertainty in the system. Let us not introduce more 
uncertainty.
<P>
	One glaring omission from this bill is that when a crime is 
committed and a firearm is used, a longer sentence should be 
automatically required. The Minister of Justice talked about this 
in relation to gun control. So have those who are lobbying for 
stronger restrictions on the use of firearms.
<P>
	At this point, I want to refer to the recent report released 
August 25, 1994 by the Correctional Service of Canada. After it 
had completed its investigation report into the escapes from 
Ferndale Minimum Security, which happens to be in my riding, 
two prisoners, Timothy Denis Cronin and Michael Kelly 
Roberts, walked away from the institution May 3.
<P>
	They were subsequently picked up in Salem, Oregon and 
charged with the murder of an American, all within the short 
time they had been free. Both men had been convicted of violent 
offences, each having used a firearm in criminal offences for 
which they were convicted. Why were these two inmates in a 
minimum security institution?
<P>
	One of Robert's psychologists in 1979 stressed that Roberts 
should remain in a maximum security institution.
<P>
	These are the findings of the investigation: ``The board 
concluded that, notwithstanding the best judgments of staff and 
the advice of psychologists and psychiatrists in the cases of 
Roberts and Cronin, their placement in a minimum security 
institution was inappropriate and in one case was based partly on 
an assessment tool being incorrectly applied''.
<P>
	I am pleased that the error was admitted to and 
recommendations made to try to prevent such happenings in the 
future. I quote statement number eight of the report: ``The 
Correctional Service of Canada should adopt an approach which 
incorporates both intensive supervision and clinical service for 
new arrivals and higher risk cases in minimum security''.
<P>
	This is the action plan: ``No offender who is generally of high 
risk should be in minimum security''. I wish it had ended there. 
It went on to say: ``However, it must be recognized that some 
offenders who are suitable for minimum security require more 
attention than others''.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I find problems with that. Upon reviewing the percentage of 
the types of crimes committed by the inmates of Ferndale I 
found that 43.8 per cent of the inmates in Ferndale institution 
are still there and they are violent offenders. I would presume as 
murder or violent death formed over 29 per cent of these 
offences that many of these crimes would involve a weapon, 
more than likely a gun.
<P>
	Who will be the next high risk offender to walk away from 
Ferndale? When will we start to put the rights of law-abiding 
citizens ahead of the rights of criminals? Again I stress that if 
one more high risk inmate walks away from Ferndale minimum 
security prison in Mission, as they can easily do, and another 
death of an innocent victim is the result we are paying too high a 
price.
<P>
	This bill would have been the ideal place to put in a provision 
which requires longer, harsher sentences for crimes committed 
with a firearm. This is perhaps the only restriction on the use of 
firearms which directly affects those who use firearms the most, 
criminals. It is high time we addressed this part of the gun 
control issue. I hope the government will make the bill stronger.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6048"> 6048 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing I believe it is time that we had a comprehensive bill 
dealing with sentencing and, as I have said, this is a good start. 
In the months to come I look forward to receiving other 
initiatives from the Minister of Justice, perhaps in the areas of 
appointment of judges and proposals to reduce the tremendously 
high cost of our legal system. These will have to wait for another 
day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has indicated that people engaging in 
white collar crime should do the time. Earlier today her 
colleague from the constituency of Wild Rose indicated that 
perhaps there are mechanisms other than incarceration to deal 
with non-violent offenders.
<P>
	How does the hon. member explain the inconsistency that has 
been brought forward by her party on a single day?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
for his question.
<P>
	Yes, I did make that statement. I do think that all people who 
commit crimes must pay for those crimes and must be 
incarcerated. However if the occasion should arise, and I say if 
the occasion should arise, that in our institutions we are 
overcrowded then the logical thing would be to look for avenues 
to relieve that overcrowding. Logically we would then find a 
way for non-violent offenders to spend time in another way. 
Within the community would be an excellent way to do it but 
only if we find we do not have places in the prisons for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was quite interested in the 
comments made by the hon. member. We are informed that there 
are fewer resources now available for incarcerating people in 
our prison system. We are aware that it costs approximately 
$50,000 a year to keep a person in prison.
<P>
	We are faced with overcrowded prisons. We are also talking 
about the possible increase of 30 per cent over the next few years 
of incarcerated people in our prisons. However we also know 
that in the United States where they have reduced actually the 
levels of liberté conditionnelle, as we say in French, that their 
levels have not been very satisfactory, that is to say that even if 
they are not allowing them to leave prison, the crime levels in 
these states have not decreased.
<P>
	I am also curious to find out why the Reform Party believes 
that by not having gun control as we propose that crime levels 
will actually fall. I find it very curious that we are more 
concerned about sentencing when we should be concentrating on 
trying to control the use of firearms in society. If we were able to 
register firearms in this society we would have better control, 
but now we are more concerned about sentencing people who 
have already committed a crime. This is what I found illogical in 
the arguments presented by the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know how they can reconcile the fact that we 
do not have to control the use of firearms as proposed by the 
minister, by this government, but we are better off trying to 
spend more in terms of sentencing and throwing people into 
prison when we could simply reduce the murder rate in this 
country if we had a real serious and comprehensive bill and law 
controlling the use of firearms. I would like to hear the 
member's comments on that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	You mentioned two or three things. First, I was very 
concerned every time you mentioned control of firearms. What 
you are really saying is that we prevent law-abiding citizens-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would just like to 
remind members on both sides of the House that when 
intervening to direct your comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker, and I apologize to 
the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	What I would like to stress is that I find this whole situation 
very disturbing because I have respect for every member in this 
House. I try to think that you say what you honestly mean and 
you honestly believe, as I try. When I say that I mean we have in 
Canada today responsible gun owners. Every time we put laws in 
force on firearms we hit at them one more time. That is not 
acceptable. We have to find another avenue. You can never 
justify putting more laws in place that will withdraw rights from 
law-abiding citizens. You cannot justify that in a just society.
<P>
	As far as this business of overcrowded prisons goes, is the 
answer because we have overcrowded prisons to open the doors 
and release them? Did that not happen in Russia in 1917? Are 
any of you aware of what happened in the small villages around 
the steplands in Russia to all of the innocent people? Think 
about it for a minute.
<P>
	No, we do not open the doors. We do not let prisoners out. We 
try to convince even the young people of today who because they 
are under age can go ahead and commit any crime they want 
because they cannot be held responsible. We do not start a new 
slogan: ``Do the crime and spend less time''. Instead of that we 
stick with what we have and we make it better. We show that 
people have to be responsible. There is only one way and that is 
to serve your time. If you are not guilty of a violent offence then 
it is possible to look at other avenues of serving. I think we can 
do that but we have to work together seriously on it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I could be as generous as my colleague in 
commending the government for Bill C-41, but I find it is like 
many other pieces of legislation. It is a mere camouflage. It is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6049"> 6049 </A></B>
<P>
life sentence tinkering  instead of truly changing a system that 
needs to be changed.
<P>
	I feel that Bill C-41 will not make those substantive changes 
that Canadians are expecting of this government. However, the 
true value of Bill C-41 will be and must be measured by whether 
it will provide safer streets for Canadians. I personally do not 
think that it will.
<P>
	I would like to concentrate most of my talk this afternoon on 
one aspect of the proposed legislation and that is crimes that are 
motivated by bias, prejudice or hate. I agree with everybody that 
we need to condemn that type of crime, but we should not be 
creating a hierarchy of victims in doing that.
<P>
	Section 15(1) of the charter of rights states that every 
individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to 
equal protection. I feel that Bill C-41 is going to change this. It 
will say that there are certain crimes against classes of victims 
that are worse than the same crime against other classes of 
victims. I would suggest that is against the fundamental 
principles of the charter of rights and that is that every Canadian 
has the same equal right to protection under the laws of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	An example of how this could be applied happens more 
regularly than I would like to see. That is the home invasions 
which are occurring in the Vancouver area. Individuals, either 
alone or in a group are breaking into homes and terrorizing the 
occupants. They are not waiting until the homes are empty. They 
are breaking in when people are at home and they terrorize the 
homeowners and steal all the valuables. Many of these home 
invasions are committed by Asian youth gangs and they are 
targeting Asian members of the community. That is bias and it is 
victim selection. That would be considered an aggravating 
factor under Bill C-41.
<P>
	In another instance there is gang activity. They 
indiscriminately invade homes, again harassing the victims and 
stealing all of their valuables. There is no aggravating factor yet 
that crime is just as serious and just as damaging to the victims.
<P>
	They are two equally deplorable crimes. But one gang would 
get stiffer sentences because they were more selective in their 
choice of crime.
<P>
	Judge the act. Judge the criminal activity, not the motivation. 
By judging the motivation we are delving into a risky 
proposition and it smacks of Orwellian thought policing. We are 
treading on very dangerous ground when we start to invade what 
we think are people's thoughts.
<P>
	I would like to know whether this is there for the profit of 
lawyers and self-styled psychologists and psychiatrists who 
will soon become legal experts on this subject. Why should 
senseless assault be viewed as any less serious than one that is 
biased, based on bias, prejudice or hate?
<P>
	We would have fewer problems with considering crimes 
where offenders abuse the position of trust with the victim to be 
considered aggravated. The Minister of Justice used adults and 
children, doctors and patients as examples. I would hope that he 
would also consider lawyers who abuse their position of trust 
with clients and politicians who abuse their position of trust 
with the electorate as other examples of breach of trust that 
should be considered aggravating circumstances.
<P>
	Not only special mention of classes of victims but special 
consideration of aboriginal offenders also concerns me. This 
seems to offend the equality section of the charter. I am not 
suggesting there is an over-representation of the native 
population in our prisons, but I do not think this is the way to 
deal with it.
<P>
	I spent 15 years in northern Alberta living in a native 
community. I have more experience than most on the 
inequalities and injustices that our aboriginal people face. They 
would be the first to agree that the problem is not solved in 
legislation. The problem is solved in the administration of 
justice.
<P>
	I would like to give another example to consider. Suppose two 
individuals with identical criminal records participate equally 
in a crime, but one is aboriginal and the other is not. Does this 
legislation mean that the aboriginal offender would be given a 
lesser sentence even though he participated equally in 
committing the crime? What about an aboriginal offender who 
commits a hate crime? Does the mitigating factor of being 
aboriginal cancel out the aggravating factor of it being a hate 
crime?
<P>
	We should not even be asking those questions. It is not for us 
to question the motivation of a crime. We must judge it on the 
act itself and make sure that every Canadian is treated equally 
under the law, that the law is not looking at race, colour or 
gender.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Generally I agree with incarceration being the last resort. I am 
well aware of the potential overcrowding in our prisons and the 
ongoing concern of what that will mean, but to suggest that we 
only want violent criminals in our jails only addresses part of the 
problem.
<P>
	However, this bill does not in any way deal with white collar 
crimes. In those cases financial penalties may not be enough in 
themselves to deter fraudulent behaviour by corporations or 
people who ought to know better. Those people can easily pay a 
fine and need a more substantive deterrent than just paying some 
money.
<P>
	I had hoped for more in the sentencing package. I had hoped 
for a greater recognition of the concern of Canadians that we 
need to have more control over violent offenders, that we need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6050"> 6050 </A></B>
<P>
have some measure of deterrent, and that we need to consider 
that all Canadians should be treated equally.
<P>
	The prime purpose of sentencing should not only be to have a 
penalty for the act but there should also be a deterrence factor. 
We cannot omit the deterrence factor in our sentencing 
legislation.
<P>
	Sentences, like probation and prison terms are effective in the 
short term but long term supervision is needed. When a person is 
given a prison term of two years as the appropriate sentence for 
the committed crime, they should serve two years and an 
additional sentence of community supervision should be added 
on to that.
<P>
	One might say that is similar to what parole is now. However 
there would be a greater acceptance and understanding by 
Canadians if they knew the courts deemed the penalty for a 
crime was <I>x</I> number of years and then deemed that the criminal 
would be assisted in getting back into the community under a 
period of supervision to be determined by the courts. If that 
happened there would be much greater acceptance for some of 
the sentencing that is handed down.
<P>
	Serious violent offenders should have a lifetime of 
supervision. People who have committed murder or vicious 
assaults against another person should be under lifetime 
supervision in addition to their sentence. If Canadians were 
assured that long term supervision was being provided they 
would be a little bit more willing to allow offenders back on to 
their streets.
<P>
	Although Bill C-41 is giving direction, it certainly does not 
go far enough. I wish this government would have a little bit 
more strength and a little bit more courage in making the tough 
decisions that have to be made.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I feel constrained to make a couple of comments on the 
content of the last address. There are some fundamental errors in 
terms of what information has been promulgated in that 
argument.
<P>
	First of all, it is very important when discussing parole and 
the issue of when or whether someone might be paroled to 
understand that parole is, in effect, a community based 
continuation of the sentence. A person who commits first or 
second degree murder is sentenced to prison for life. If he or she 
subsequently is paroled, they continue serving their sentence in 
the community under the supervision of parole officials.
<P>
	It is misleading to suggest that a person who receives parole 
after 15 years is suddenly absolved and walks away. There are 
limitations on that individual's behaviour which are set out 
under the terms of the parole. His or her life is supervised. They 
can no longer simply live wherever they want or associate with 
whomever they want. They have to report regularly.
<P>
	That part of the system may have strained resources. There 
may be other ways to strengthen or improve that system, but a 
person who commits murder is punished for life by the 
combination of incarceration and ongoing community 
supervision. It is misleading to suggest there is any other 
structure that somehow absolves that person at the conclusion of 
their jail term.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to point out that a false example was given of 
the amendments which relate to crime which is affected as a 
result of hate. In the example the hon. member gave of a home 
invasion perpetrated against members of a particular ethnic 
group, there would not be an automatic increase in penalty, nor 
would the issue of the victim's race come into play unless the 
prosecutor could prove beyond a reasonable doubt to the 
satisfaction of the court that the crime itself was motivated by 
the hatred of a member of that group. To invade the home of a 
person of a particular ethnic group may not be motivated by 
hate. It may just have been the most convenient place to hit on 
that particular night.
<P>
	It strikes me that the government is absolutely right in 
recognizing that crimes motivated by specific hatreds of race, of 
sexual orientation or any of the other specified classes is 
particularly heinous in our society.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am little concerned. I am 
hearing the government suggest the same crime may be 
considered more heinous simply because it has a bias or hate or 
prejudice attached to it. I would like to think the crime itself is 
heinous no matter what the motivation or no matter who the 
victim is.
<P>
	One thing I would like to address is there are people who have 
killed. Perhaps they did not get murder one or murder two. 
Perhaps they got manslaughter for the convenience of the courts 
or whatever reason, but the point is there are people who have 
killed and have been sentenced for five or six years. With 
mandatory supervision or the legislated statutory release they 
will be out on the streets after two years.
<P>
	Canadians do not like to see that. They want some sort of 
protection. Maybe this person made a mistake and did not mean 
to do it but surely to god there should be some supervision to 
make sure it is not going to happen again.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned because there are people who do get 
out and are on the streets without any supervision. May I 
mention the name of Mr. Larry Fisher who is out wandering the 
streets without any supervision because the law does not allow 
that supervision. I would suggest that is what Canadians want 
this piece of legislation to do: make sure the streets are safer by 
protecting them from people like him.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-41 is yet another fulfilment of Liberal red book 
promises. It is part of this government's safe home, safe streets 
policy. This policy in connection with our plans and our actions 
in the direction of job creation and our fundamental respect for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6051"> 6051 </A></B>
<P>
human rights-I see the  member to whom I was addressing my 
remarks is leaving in any event-gives Canadians the comfort of 
the quality-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Regrettably I was 
not possibly paying as close attention as I normally would. 
Certainly with regard to the presence or absence of members in 
this Chamber, we well know the demands on our time for House 
duty, committee duty and so on. Therefore, we should all be 
mindful and respectful of one another in terms of our coming 
and going, presence or absence in the House. I would ask all of 
us to keep that in mind in our interventions.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, these policies dovetail together 
rather nicely to give Canadians the comfort of a better quality of 
life.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians trust our right hon. Prime Minister and our 
government to deliver on our promises. That is evident by our 
presence in the government and our strength in the government. 
Indeed we published these promises in the red book and 
Canadians can literally check them off as we deliver on them.
<P>
	Our job creation programs can be seen across the country in 
our infrastructure works which are completed and which are in 
progress. As promised by the Prime Minister the country is 
starting to feel better about itself. I might point out that nowhere 
is this more evident than in Windsor, Ontario where 
unemployment is down, welfare claims are down and crime is 
down.
<P>
	Jobs mean prosperity and prosperity reduces the stress in our 
society. Sometimes as is the case today it is necessary to deliver 
legislation which seeks to aid Canadians to feel safer and to 
correct inadequacies in the system where they exist. This is the 
reason for Bill C-41.
<P>
	Canadians need reassurance. Canadians need comfort. I 
would suggest that Canadians do not want this reassurance and 
this comfort to be at the expense of human rights. The 
government has consulted Canadians across the country and 
found out that Canadians are concerned about certain aspects of 
our criminal justice system. Canadians are not hysterical. 
Canadians are not narrow minded. Canadians believe that there 
are some injustices in our system. Canadians believe that 
aboriginal people for instance receive inappropriate sentences 
disproportionately.
<P>
	Canadians believe that poor Canadians are sometimes treated 
more harshly by the courts or by the system than Canadians of 
financial substance. Canadians think that we should seek some 
alternatives to custody in certain circumstances. We also know 
that Canadians do not want all crimes to be treated the same way. 
Canadians recognize that the quick fix is not possible.
<P>
	They recognize that there is a difference between crimes and 
they draw that distinction often based on the presence or absence 
of violence in a criminal act. They know that there are often 
compelling reasons to promote an offender's rehabilitation over 
his or her punishment. At the same time they want consistency 
in sentencing and a rationalization of the process.
<P>
	This bill comes to grips with these expressions of public 
opinion through amendments to the Criminal Code. First and 
foremost, these amendments set out a general statement of 
principles and purpose in the sentencing process which covers 
rehabilitation, the segregation where necessary from society of 
certain offenders. It covers restitution. It covers the actual 
promotion in a convicted criminal of a sense of responsibility 
for his or her acts and it denounces unlawful conduct while 
deterring both the offender and others. At the same time it 
recognizes certain fundamental principles that Canadians have 
told us they are interested in upholding.
<P>
	The sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offence. The 
sentence must reflect the degree of responsibility of the 
offender. The sentence must take into consideration aggravating 
or mitigating circumstances. The sentence must at least consider 
alternatives, especially for aboriginal offenders. When a crime 
is motivated by hate based on race, nationality, colour, religion, 
sex, age, disability or sexual orientation Canadians want it to be 
punished accordingly.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has considered all of these factors and 
has presented a bill which respects the wishes of Canadians and 
the rule of law. There is no quick fix. Our friends opposite would 
like us to think that there is a quick fix, a year is a year and a day 
is day. There are always circumstances that require flexibility. 
There are always circumstances that require us to take off our 
punishing hat and put on our rehabilitating hat.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest to our friends opposite that as they consider 
the fiscal bottom line they consider the difference between the 
cost of rehabilitating someone over the long term to our society 
versus keeping that person indefinitely incarcerated with no 
programs and no opportunity to recover.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce spoke eloquently 
this afternoon about attacking not only the results of criminal 
activities but also the causes of criminal activities. We hear 
nothing about that aspect from the benches opposite.
<P>
	Members opposite make it all sound so easy. Just throw them 
in a cell and throw away the key. This I would suggest is the 
result of simplistic thought and, quite frankly, knee-jerk 
reactions. The funny thing is it is not even what Canadians want.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6052"> 6052 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, I would suggest, hit 
the nail on the head when he said that crime is not just a justice 
issue, it is a health issue, a human resources development issue 
and it is a human rights issue.
<P>
	In Canada, sadly, some groups do not enjoy the same 
advantages as others because of social class, colour or a variety 
of other reasons. Canada is a much better and freer country than 
many others, most others for these people, but we have to 
recognize that not all of our citizens have the same advantage.
<P>
	Canadians have recognized this and Liberals have recognized 
this. That is why we do not offer these amendments in a vacuum. 
When we look at Bill C-41 we also have to look at the movement 
that we are making to rationalize the national health care policy 
and the extensive social safety net reform that will be introduced 
shortly. This social safety net reform is intended to deliver 
better social security in our country. The rest of the country can 
then follow the example of the greater Windsor area, less 
unemployment, lower welfare payments, fewer welfare cases 
and a lower crime rate.
<P>
	It is not as easy as our friends opposite make it. We cannot 
jerk our knee and solve the problems with a simple saying or a 
simple quote. We have to be versatile and we have to be flexible. 
I would suggest to members opposite that is exactly what the 
hon. Minister of Justice has done here and that it is consistent 
with what Liberals do and it is consistent with what this 
government has done and will continue to do in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make 
a clarification with respect to allegations made toward the 
Reform Party's view of this.
<P>
	I do not think that any of us have ever made the statement or 
even intimated that it is a simple thing, you just throw them in 
jail and throw the key away, as the hon. member stated. That is 
not an accurate description of the feelings or convictions of 
people in our party.
<P>
	I challenge the member opposite to think about the real issues 
that are involved here as we are trying to do. How do you solve 
the problem of crime? One of the most fundamental areas in 
which we have failed our young people, who then become older 
and at whatever age become criminals, is that we are no longer 
strongly teaching them by example and by word what is right 
and what is wrong. I am finding that even in present law making 
there is this intimation now that we are going to have laws that 
will prevent parents from spanking their children.
<P>
	I do not in any way condone violence against children but 
children will learn to obey and respect authority if they are 
taught in a loving way with firmness.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	That is how I was taught and that is very important. That is 
where we need to work in order to empty our jails. We need to 
make sure we have strong, loving  families. I would like to see 
this government really emphasize that end of it. Perhaps the 
member has some comments on what I have just said.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, one way we can ensure Canadians 
develop a strong, loving base in the home is to provide homes 
that are safe and prosperous. One of the problems we have that 
we see time and time again in our society is as there is less 
prosperity, as the economic and other stresses are placed on a 
family, when they cannot find food, when they do not have 
sufficient warmth, when they do not have sufficient shelter, 
when they do not have the basic, fundamental things that 
families require in which to thrive, then other things develop.
<P>
	Parents become busy working harder or trying to find ways to 
bring food into the home, to raise money to support their 
children. They have less time for their children. It is important 
to accept that the issue here is not the result of crime or the 
criminal act itself.
<P>
	The issue is making that go away, making this a better society, 
so we do not have to deal with it anymore. If we can do that by 
reforming our social safety net, by creating jobs and by making 
it a better country in which to live economically and socially, by 
acknowledging for instance that some crimes are motivated by 
hate and by trying to come to grips with those types of problems, 
then we can make it a better society, a better country, stronger 
families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not aware of whether I could get 
up twice in these situations, so thank you for that lesson.
<P>
	I am wondering if one of the pressures that we have control 
over-when I say we I mean the Government of Canada-is in 
the area of financial pressure. There are many parents who are 
forced to work because of the huge tax load they face among 
other things.
<P>
	Perhaps what we need to do as a fundamental root, way down 
deep solution to this problem is to manage our financial affairs 
to reduce the tax burden so that in those families where those 
stresses occur they could be reduced. Perhaps those who choose 
could then remain home with their children to provide them with 
a good, secure, solid, loving environment in which to grow up.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I happen to agree with the hon. 
member in terms of the basic premise that there should be lower 
taxes. I do not think there is anyone in this Chamber who would 
not like to be able to help lower taxes right away.
<P>
	I also agree there are families now forced to have two incomes 
in order to make the same sort of home that our parents perhaps 
made with one income. There is no question about that. Let us 
not cross that line. Let us not assume that all families have two 
working parents because one of them is being forced to work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6053"> 6053 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many families that exist today because two parents 
want to work and have careers. That is a part of our changing 
society. I see heads nodding. I see some agreement, which is 
pleasant.
<P>
	I must point out that without the social safety net we cannot 
provide the atmosphere in which these parents can work. That is 
why we need-this will be a little segue here-to have some 
form of national child care standards so we can make sure that 
families with two parents who want to seek careers can have the 
type of support they need for their children. Then they will know 
their children are secure and living in a healthy and safe 
environment and they can continue to pursue their total goal as a 
family unit.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I stayed down long enough to give 
everyone else an opportunity. I really want to challenge that 
because it is undoubtedly true that if we do pursue this goal of 
national child care, nothing is going to do more to drive taxes up 
and put pressures on families higher. We are defeating ourselves 
and I strenuously object to that.
<P>
	Certainly in the other areas, there are some families-I am 
thinking particularly of single mothers because we have so 
many of them now in our society-who have no choice. We must 
bend over backward to do what we can for them.
<P>
	I do not, however, buy into the premise that the only way it can 
be done is by the taxpayer being plucked by the government to 
provide the service. There have to be many other ways to solve 
those problems.
<P>
	Coming back to the bill that we are discussing, I would like to 
also say with respect to criminals that when they finish their 
time, we need to recognize that we are not going to put 
everybody in jail for life, no matter what they do.
<P>
	I agree certainly that we must do something to get them ready 
to integrate back into society. Here again I would have a very 
good low cost solution to propose, particularly for people who 
are guilty of non-violent crimes. I would propose that they be 
placed into the keeping of good loving homes. It is a 
requirement. It is their sentence. They would spend their time 
there instead of in a jail so that they get a model of how life 
ought to be lived.
<P>
	With that, I am going to quit this time. I promise.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Do not make too many 
promises now just for this time. Certainly I sense if this dialogue 
and debate went on between the two members who have been 
rising on the floor that we would find some points of 
disagreement.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel like I am going to a dance 
here. I thank the member opposite for allowing an opportunity to 
engage in this dialogue even though it is in a very structured 
environment.
<P>
	I must say that I cannot think of very many acquaintances or 
friends who would want to open their houses to persons such as 
my friend is suggesting. However, it is not an idea that should be 
dismissed.
<P>
	These are the types of creative ideas that I suggest this bill 
envisions. These amendments provide for great flexibility and 
versatility in terms of sentencing arrangements.
<P>
	In Windsor, which is where I am from as members know I am 
sure by now, we have some very creative and excellent judges on 
our provincial court and our general division benches. Some 
have worked very hard to find alternative sentences within the 
limits of the current legislation.
<P>
	As a result, we have seen in our community many 
community-based solutions that have been promulgated by 
those judges and by some programs and social workers whom 
we have in our community. The result is that we have had an 
opportunity in our community to look very closely at alternative 
sentencing structures.
<P>
	This has been an eye opener for me as a criminal lawyer, both 
as prosecutor and as defence counsel. These have been very 
productive types of programs. I would suggest that my friend 
opposite has an idea that is worth exploring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
document published in May 1993 from Ottawa the Prime 
Minister, in an election mood at the time, said: ``Safe streets and 
homes should be a basic right of every Canadian''. As he noted 
Canada's 40 per cent increase in violent crime he said: ``Since 
1984, the Conservative government has done almost nothing to 
combat the growing crime rate except half measures and lots of 
macho talk''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has served Canada in this House for over 
20 years. Perhaps some of the influence of the Conservatives in 
proposing half measures has rubbed off on the Prime Minister 
and his cabinet.
<P>
	Bill C-41 in its intent and as far as it goes has many things that 
are supportable. I submit, however, that with this as with other 
legislation currently before the House, the Liberals are 
consistent. They are moving. I believe that is because the 
Reform Party members are listening to their constituents and are 
saying things on the floor of the House of Commons that 
typically have never been said here before. Through the pressure 
of the voice of Canadians being brought to this Chamber by the 
Reform Party the government is moving but, I submit, in half 
measures.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us reflect also on what my leader, the member for Calgary 
Southwest, was saying in 1992. While speaking in Belleville, 
Ontario on the issue of reforming the criminal justice system he 
proposed the two following things:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6054"> 6054 </A></B>
<P>
	Number one: Reformers believe that a better balance should 
be struck between the amounts of public money spent on the 
apprehension, care and protection of the perpetrators of crime 
and the amount of public resource spent on helping the victims 
of crime. Combined federal and provincial spending on jails 
alone is about $2 billion a year. Police spending is $1.7 billion 
for the federal government alone. The court costs another 
several hundred million dollars each year, whereas the resources 
committed to helping or compensating the victims of crime are 
minimal.
<P>
	The second thing he said was that sentencing and parole 
procedures should be reformed. He said: ``We have proposed 
that automatic parole be eliminated altogether; that 25 per cent 
time off for good behaviour be the maximum amount by which a 
sentence can be reduced; and that sentencing guidelines for 
judges and juries be improved to ensure greater certainty and 
consistency in sentencing''.
<P>
	These proposals are in line with the recommendations made 
by the Canadian Sentencing Commission in 1987 but largely 
ignored by the federal government.
<P>
	I believe that in 1993 when my leader made those comments 
that they were reflecting the values and judgment of Canadians 
just as they reflect those same values today in a more 
substantive way than is evident in the bill currently being 
considered by the House, which I have judged to be a half 
measure.
<P>
	On the first issue raised by my leader that there must be a 
better balance struck between the money spent on criminals and 
their victims, I would like to present a couple of ideas. First, I 
think quite frankly that there is a problem in our wonderful free 
and democratic society with our news gathering systems and 
media. They have to set their own agenda and perhaps have to 
sell their newspapers or their advertising time on television.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we have articles, for example from the <I>Ottawa 
Sun</I> on March 12, 1994, a two-page article outlining 
communications telling of a complex person expecting to 
emerge from jail as though her past and her crimes will be 
erased. It published a whole series of Karla Homolka's letters. 
In those letters there appeared, for example: ``That card fits 
perfectly with my Mickey Mouse posters. Hey, I'm getting 
Sesame Street towels and sheets on Friday. My room is going to 
be the most juvenile in the whole institution but, hey, I like it 
that way.'' Another letter: ``I'm growing bangs, or at least I am 
trying to''.
<P>
	This kind of sensationalism by the news media in my 
judgment does a major disservice to this whole issue. I believe 
that the fundamental tenets of our society are based on freedom 
of speech and access to information. But I challenge the news 
media in the way that it takes that information, distorts it, twists 
it, sensationalizes it and sells more issues of its newspapers by 
so doing. I do not think that is excusable.
<P>
	However, there are responsible articles. I refer in the context 
of this speech to one from the <I>Toronto Star</I> dated June 26, 1994. I 
read in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rick Sauve, serving a life term for murder, is the first lifer in Canada to earn a 
university degree behind bars.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Friedman, one of the people who was an instructor to him and 
who used to teach classes inside prison, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The greatest reward is when I talk to someone who has gotten an assignment 
back and they have got a 65 per cent and they are pleased as punch and say `wow, I 
can compete with those guys'. It literally brings tears to your eyes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Claire Culhane of the prisoner rights group in Vancouver 
believes strongly that the public should support prisoners' 
attempts to get post secondary education. Our policy now is to 
warehouse them. If you are doing 10 or 20 years, are you 
supposed to sit there and vegetate? If they do not want tension in 
prisons they have to provide something for everyone.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The second part of the article is that in May Sauve was granted 
the right to apply for parole. A hearing will be held later this 
year.
<P>
	There are two fundamental problems here. I do not want to 
comment on the issue of this prisoner receiving the ability to be 
able to have the resources to get his university degree but I 
suggest that it is hard to imagine that the family of Rick Sauve's 
murder victim earned a university degree at government 
expense as a result of the loss of their loved one. What has the 
government been doing in terms of looking after them in the 
same way that the offender is currently being looked after?
<P>
	I am not discussing the issue of whether Rick Sauve should 
have worked for his university degree. The issue I am raising in 
this case, as in others like it, is how much time, money and 
government resource is put at the disposal of victims versus the 
money and resources put at the disposal of the perpetrators.
<P>
	The second issue is what my colleague from Fraser Valley 
West said on Tuesday. He made it very emphatic. Life is life, or 
at least it should be. Yet we see from this article that Rick Sauve 
was granted the right to apply for parole. We see a measure in 
this legislation that victims will be allowed to make 
representation at section 745 hearings.
<P>
	While this is an improvement I believe that section 745 
should be repealed in its entirety. The judge at the presiding jury 
or judge trial should have the ability to be able to set the 
sentence. The sentence should not be overridden at some future 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6055"> 6055 </A></B>
<P>
point in time by people who were not party to the case in the first 
place.
<P>
	This brings me to the second issue which my leader raised. 
Surely there must be some ultimate protection for law-abiding 
members of society.
<P>
	In a paper produced by the MacKenzie Institute entitled 
``Streets of Fear, the Failure of the Criminal Justice System'' the 
author, Brode, cited some very interesting examples of the 
problems with sentencing procedures in Canada.
<P>
	Two Nova Scotia cases recently underline the inadequate 
judicial response to attacks on women. In Regina v. Swinamer a 
man forced his estranged wife into a truck and threatened to kill 
her. She escaped. Charged with unlawful confinement he was 
released on condition that he have no contact with his wife. 
Again he captured her. He drove her to a secluded area and raped 
her.
<P>
	At his sentencing the court considered the offender's 
situation, that he had already spent five months in custody and 
had a good work record. His sentence, three months' 
imprisonment and 19 months' probation.
<P>
	In Regina v. Desmond the husband had severely beaten his 
wife, thrown her out of the house. She suffered a fractured 
shoulder and pneumothorax of the lung.
<P>
	Again it was the offender's situation that mattered for the trial 
judge considered that it was his first offence of this type and that 
he could lose his job if in prison. His sentence, 90 days to be 
served on weekends and two years' probation. This man except 
by the grace of God would have murdered his wife and he gets 90 
days' sentence and two years on probation.
<P>
	In my home town of Cranbrook this past weekend there was a 
march of citizens concerned about family violence. They were 
looking for changes in the criminal justice system and to see that 
inadequate sentencing for sexual assault is carried over into 
sentences for spousal abuse.
<P>
	At an Ottawa conference on women's safety a couple of years 
ago Chief Brian Ford said that a first offence for assault on a 
wife usually results in a suspended sentence. Those for drunk 
driving are stiffer. Inexcusable.
<P>
	What the government today is missing is the understanding 
that the late Judge Les Bewley observed, and I quote: ``The 
control or reduction of crime depends on three essential 
elements: the certainty of detection of the offender; the 
speediness of the trial; and the certainty of punishment''. He 
goes on to say: ``These were all observed and taken for granted 
30 or 40 years ago''. Not any more.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to introduce for consideration of members today 
the concept of retribution because the Liberal concentration has 
totally smothered this concept.
<P>
	Take for example events which occurred in 1989 and 1990 in 
Perth, Ontario. Kenneth McLean, the convicted killer of Ruth 
Moore, had originally been convicted of second degree murder 
and sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 
13 years. McLean had told friends: ``If I cannot have her, 
nobody else can''. He strangled her and then stabbed Ruth 24 
times.
<P>
	The Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a new trial because of 
technical errors in the judge's rulings. At his retrial McLean 
pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter and thereby 
became eligible for parole in another 18 months or released on 
mandatory supervision in three years. In effect, he would serve 
six and a half years for Ruth Moore's death.
<P>
	The victim's family was outraged and violence almost 
erupted in the courtroom when the new sentence was imposed. 
The presiding judge, Dan Chilcott, sympathized with the family. 
He told them he understood their feelings of outrage but then he 
added: ``Retribution plays no part in our system as far as I am 
concerned''.
<P>
	About retribution the Mackenzie Institute says: ``Retribution 
is the root of society's motivation to punish those who seriously 
breach our standards of accepted conduct. Retribution is not 
revenge, for revenge is arbitrary and self-seeking. Retribution 
is a measured response to a past offence imposed after due 
process and it is proportional to the gravity of the offence. It 
does not gratify individual loss. It enforces the legal order and 
reflects society's abhorrence to violence. To grant lenient 
sentences is to say that violent acts are acceptable and are not to 
be truly punished''.
<P>
	Again, there was a recent incident in my hometown of 
Cranbrook. An individual had been sitting with his 
ex-girlfriend. She decided to have a bath. Following an 
argument he went in and shoved her face down in the water. She 
smothered to death. I grant you he confessed to the crime, but 
after both the crown prosecutor and the defence asked for a 
five-year sentence for this murder, the judge in his wisdom said: 
``Oh, no that is not good enough. We are going to give seven 
years''. What is this? What is a life worth?
<P>
	When we have lost the concept of retribution, of making the 
penalty fit the crime, we have lost an essential element of our 
judicial system. All judges should understand they are on the 
bench to administer retribution. Courts do not exist to 
sympathize with the criminal, but to adequately punish for a 
wrongdoing.
<P>
	The greatest deterrent to crime is not necessarily the severity 
of punishment, rather it is the certainty of punishment. The 
prevailing system of parole and automatic remission of sentence 
has made punishment uncertain and in many cases unlikely. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6056"> 6056 </A></B>
<P>
danger lurking in the criminal's mind that he will pay the 
prescribed  penalty for his act simply is not there. He knows the 
parole system will spare him even in so-called life 
imprisonment. The criminal justice system therefore becomes a 
deception. It leads the public into believing that criminals are 
being punished and it shields the criminal from paying the 
penalty.
<P>
	I wish to introduce the major reason I will vote against this 
bill and in conclusion I want to briefly address the declaration of 
this bill, that where crimes are motivated by hate this is deemed 
to be an aggravating factor. The minute this House strays from 
the fundamental principle that all Canadians are equal 
regardless of race, language, creed, colour, gender or religion, 
we open up the entire Pandora's box of inequality.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me give an example which was reported in <I>B.C. </I><I>Report</I> 
magazine on September 12 of this year. George Mammolitti, the 
32-year old NDP MPP from Toronto who spoke out forcefully 
against Ontario's same sex benefits law before it was defeated in 
June has been the target of harassment, abuse and threats.
<P>
	The magazine reported that after the defeat of the bill Mr. 
Mammolitti received about 300 abusive and threatening phone 
calls often in the middle of the night. Many of the callers uttered 
racist epithets and told Mr. Mammolitti to go back to Italy. He 
was also sent a handwritten note containing a threat to kill him 
in front of his children. Police determined the note had been 
mailed near the legislature but were unable to determine who 
had sent it.
<P>
	Mr. Mammolitti has call display telephones in his office. As a 
result, Craig Smith, assistant to the associate culture minister, 
Shirley Coppen, was found to be responsible for at least some of 
the abusive calls Mr. Mammolitti had received. When Mr. Smith 
was approached he admitted to making the calls. He was 
suspended with pay for three days and no criminal charges were 
laid.
<P>
	The hate provision strides into very dangerous territory. It pits 
members of supposed majorities against citizens of appointed 
minorities. A victim is a victim and a perpetrator is a 
perpetrator. If the shoe had been on the other foot, if Mr. 
Mammolitti supposedly representing the majority of Canadians 
had been going after Mr. Smith supposedly representing the 
minority of Canadians, Mr. Mammolitti would have been in 
serious trouble. As it is, it does not work that way.
<P>
	What are we doing getting into this with this kind of judicial 
law? When a person's head is kicked in, it is kicked in. Curbing 
is a very gross action which I believe is coming out of the slums 
of New York or the American inner cities. The victim is put 
down with the back of his head to a curb and then someone 
applies boots to his forehead with great force. Something has to 
give. A murder of that type occurred in Coquitlam within the last 
three months.
<P>
	Now I ask: What possible service does this law serve? If the 
people going through due process are convicted of that crime, 
what possible service does it serve our society? Does it serve the 
victim's relatives? Does it serve the offenders if the judgment of 
the penalty is based on whether the victim was an identifiable 
minority? Clearly these people did it out of hate. Was the victim 
just an ordinary guy and these were a bunch of goofball fools 
who took this person's life? Well that is okay, we do not have to 
give them as tough a penalty I suppose but remember, the victim 
is still dead.
<P>
	We are entering into very dangerous territory with this 
particular provision in the bill. I truly understand the 
motivation, but my father said it best: You cannot legislate 
morality.
<P>
	In conclusion this is a situation of half measures. It is 
dangerous because it raises expectations of citizens. That leads 
to lost hope which when these half measures do not work leads 
to loss of faith in law and order.
<P>
	If I could have the attention of members opposite I will make 
them an offer. I will provide the Q-tips for cabinet if they pledge 
to use them so they can hear what ordinary citizens are saying. 
Canadians want an end to the half measures this bill represents.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to the 
period of questions and comments to the hon. member for 
Kootenay East, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to 
inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Yukon-Transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the rather 
sensationalist comments made by the hon. member when 
describing the various cases which have taken place either in his 
riding or elsewhere across Canada.
<P>
	What I heard in his exposé is that there is a lack of 
understanding of what kind of population we are dealing with. 
We are often dealing with illiterates. We are often dealing with 
people who never had a chance in life. We are not actually 
looking for solutions. Actually the only solution the Reform 
Party is looking for is basically to throw the key away and leave 
them to rot in prison for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	One of the best deterrents to fight crime in this society is 
education. Does the hon. member know the figures of illiteracy 
found among the incarcerated in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> So what are you doing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> I am asking him the question, Mr. Speaker. Can 
he tell us why there is a disproportionate number of aboriginals 
in our prisons? In many cases these people have been treated like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6057"> 6057 </A></B>
<P>
second class citizens. In many aboriginal communities more 
than half the population is 18 years or younger and have been 
given  very few chances. Many of them regrettably have turned 
to crime.
<P>
	It is not only the aboriginals. They are also pointing to 
immigrants, new arrivals to Canada, people who were not really 
given a chance. It is regrettable the hon. member does not look 
into greater detail on ways to prevent crime. That is the basis of 
the bill: To reorient our young Canadians or older Canadians for 
that matter to try to set them straight in order to make them 
better and more productive citizens.
<P>
	Obviously I am not going to hear the voice of reason and 
compassion on that side but they should recognize that those 
who are incarcerated in Canada today are often those who were 
not given the privileges of education, who were not given work 
in some instances and have had to turn to crime in order to 
pursue their lives. That is what is regrettable.
<P>
	As a government we are trying to turn this society around. As 
we very well know the rates of incarceration in Canada are 
second to those in the United States and they are much lower in 
Europe. These are things we have to look into. We should start 
looking into what is happening in Europe, not quoting Russia of 
1917 as one of his Reform associates did earlier. We have to look 
at what is happening elsewhere, what we can do and how we can 
improve the system.
<P>
	Of course being a compassionate society we understand what 
the victims are living through. I am sure it is a living hell for 
many of them. We cannot turn around and say: ``No. The only 
way we are going to solve this question is by throwing the key 
away''. There is the question of education. There is the question 
of trying to encourage Canadians to find other ways and means 
of earning their living.
<P>
	This is what we have to do as legislators, as members of this 
proud Parliament. We have to try to find ways to set the course 
straight for many of these people who regrettably turn to crime.
<P>
	What percentage are actually illiterate and what percentage 
come from different classes and different backgrounds? Could 
the hon. member come up with those percentages?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that virtually every 
time we have a debate on criminal justice reform we keep on 
hearing that the Reform Party is just talking about the 
sensational.
<P>
	We fully recognize there is a segment of the population that 
has gone through an unfortunate situation in terms of education, 
economics, or their upbringing which will have an impact. 
Everyone of those people who is in a disadvantaged state in 
Canada has the opportunity to move forward and get ahead.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Not all of them fall through the cracks. With respect to the 
specific question, of course I do not have that answer at my 
fingertips. With the greatest respect, I would suggest that 
probably the member having walked into this House as I did at 
some point in time today probably also does not happen to have 
those numbers at his fingertips.
<P>
	If this Parliament really wants to focus on reason and 
compassion, I wonder if just once this government might be able 
to have reason and compassion for the victim. I wonder if just 
once this Parliament would talk about bringing in the same kind 
of resources.
<P>
	I said in my speech very clearly that I was not critcizing the 
fact that this criminal behind bars had ended up getting his 
university degree. I was not criticizing that. I was asking what 
resources were made available to the victims of his terrible 
crime. I would suggest not many.
<P>
	The last time I spoke on this issue I believe we were talking 
about the Young Offenders Act. It was a Thursday. Perhaps some 
of the Liberal members will recall that this was immediately 
preceding their convention here in Ottawa.
<P>
	It was very instructive because we brought up what the 
members consistently called sensational things, that we were off 
base, that the only place where there is any problem with the 
Young Offenders Act is in the constituencies that have a Reform 
Party member, that we were completely out to lunch is exactly 
what we are hearing from the other side the entire day.
<P>
	It was really quite instructive that at the conclusion of their 
tête-à-tête in Ottawa the Prime Minister stood up and said: ``We 
have suddenly discovered on the basis of the input that we have 
received from these Liberal members that we have a problem 
with crime. Therefore this is what we are going to be doing''.
<P>
	It turns out that maybe the problem was not isolated to the 52 
constituencies that are represented by Reform. Maybe it is a 
problem with the balance of constituencies that do perhaps need 
the Q-tips I was offering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. friend from Kootenay East suggested in his remarks that 
retribution is not vengeance. I looked it up in the <I>Concise Oxford 
Dictionary</I>. According to the dictionary, retribution is 
vengeance.
<P>
	He was indicating that one of our members was treading on 
dangerous ground. When the member stands up and suggests 
that we should be basing our criminal justice system on 
retribution as opposed to basing it on the rule of law, he is 
treading on very dangerous ground.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6058"> 6058 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to make one other point, his arguments with respect to 
hate crimes. He is arguing as have other members of the Reform 
Party that we should not be drawing any distinction when it 
comes to crimes based on hate.
<P>
	We should all remind ourselves that this great country of ours 
is a multicultural country. It is made up of peoples from all 
around the world and that is one of the reasons why this country 
is so great and so strong. We have the best peoples from all parts 
of the world.
<P>
	We also have to say to all these people from all parts of the 
world that they are equal, they will not be the targets or objects 
of contempt, hate or prejudice, and that when we witness 
contempt, prejudice and particularly the acts of hate, the acts of 
violence of hate, we will express our dissent and our loathing in 
a very strong fashion.
<P>
	There are different kinds of violence and different kinds of 
crimes. Surely my friend from Kootenay East would not suggest 
that violence that comes from a drunken brawl is bad and no 
worse and no better than violence that comes from hatred.
<P>
	It seems to me that whether it is a woman, whether it is a 
person who belongs to a religious group or a so-called ethnic 
group harmed, and they are the victim of terrible violence only 
because that person belongs to a particular group, we as a 
society have to condemn and contend that strongly. That is why I 
disagree with the member from the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the motivation of the 
member and that behind this legislation. The motivation is to 
work against discrimination, to protect people who are of a 
visible minority within our society. I understand that 
completely.
<P>
	What Canadians want are safe streets. A person who is beaten 
up, a person who has cracked ribs, a person who has his teeth 
jammed down his throat with an iron pipe has his teeth jammed 
down his throat with an iron pipe. The minute this House walks 
away from the fundamental principle that all Canadians are 
equal regardless of race, language, creed, colour, religion or 
gender, and we make more worthy victims than others, we are on 
absolutely indefensible ground.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have exhausted the 
five-hour segment of the second reading of this piece of 
legislation. We will now go to the next stage of debate which are 
10-minute interventions without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-41 with all its original and recommended 
revisions is a manifestation of objectives, directives, purposes, 
even hopes and wishes that have been produced through a 
demanding problem solving process. By its very nature it can be 
classified as a democratic one, one in which information is 
gathered from a multitude  of sources, from publications, 
studies, research, reports, individual and group experiences, 
input from all aspects of society, each being driven and 
governed by their own agendas, personal beliefs and value 
systems-an extremely complex process which produces a 
declaration of intent, purpose or direction; in other words a 
statute, a measure, a rule, a regulation, a law.
<P>
	This government has used this complex democratic process to 
produce constructive reforms found in Bill C-41.
<P>
	As we listen to members of the opposition parties we hear 
their subjective presentations, each believing that they possess 
some segment of the perfect law. No law made by man is 
absolute or perfect. No law is safe from the forces of change in a 
dynamic society. Each change brought about democratically 
brings us closer to the more perfect solution.
<P>
	The justice department has heard the voices through the great 
country of ours and the outcome is a Criminal Code which is 
more balanced, fairer and rational than the codes of the past.
<P>
	The section of Bill C-41 that lifts the Criminal Code to loftier 
heights is the proposed statement of purpose and principles of 
sentencing. For the first time direction is to be provided to the 
courts on the fundamental purpose of sentencing which 
contributes to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe 
society.
<P>
	Revenge is no longer the basic purpose of sentencing one who 
has committed an unlawful act. Although this may be judged to 
be true by some, a sentence will still reflect the seriousness of 
the offence.
<P>
	To diminish the criticism of unjust sentencing the courts 
throughout the country must give similar sentences to offenders 
who have committed similar acts. A just law is one that is 
perceived consistently to be just and fair in every court of the 
land.
<P>
	Significant is the statement of principle that states when an 
offence is motivated by hate based on the race, nationality, 
colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability or sexual 
orientation of the victim, the offence must be considered as a 
more serious offence than in the past, thus demanding harsher 
sentencing.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill provides the courts with more options to distinguish 
between serious, violent crime requiring incarceration and less 
serious non-violent crime that could be dealt with more 
effectively in the community.
<P>
	It is in this area that I feel the most positive strategies can be 
created to rehabilitate the perpetrators of minor offences. 
Community service options which have been determined 
co-operatively with officials of the judicial system, community 
leaders 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6059"> 6059 </A></B>
<P>
and agents from various facets of society will without doubt 
produce the most effective results.
<P>
	Rehabilitation programs which keep the offenders from any 
semblance of normal societal structures, in other words 
segregated or isolated, rarely are permanently successful. The 
position of segregation or isolation has built in connotations of 
inferiority of being a second class citizen. The proposed changes 
within this bill will reintroduce the minor offender to the normal 
patterns of community life.
<P>
	Too often the poor are victimized by well intentioned rules or 
regulations. The 18th century law that jailed the offenders who 
could not pay their fines no matter how small the amount is 
finally being revisited and revised. Such offenders will be 
subject to other options such as community service or probation. 
This proposal will result in less crowded, safer prisons as well as 
decreased costs. Also, more human and financial resources will 
be free to deal with the more serious offenders.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have expressed their opinions 
regarding section 745 of the Criminal Code. Here violent crime 
victims are being provided the opportunity to present 
information which may influence parole decisions pertaining to 
the offender, a very worthy initiative that is also supported by 
police chief Karl Ratz in my constituency of Thunder 
Bay-Atikokan, as well as many others in the law enforcement 
segment of society.
<P>
	There is much that can be said about the proposed revisions in 
the Criminal Code and the relationship to a safer and more just 
society. Many assumptions can be made and shall be made 
regarding the various sections of the Criminal Code without 
seeing their relationships to other forces in society.
<P>
	It takes more than the breaking of a law to make a criminal. 
Criminal behaviour is precipitated by a myriad of social causes 
and ills. Desperate people often resort to desperate means in 
order to survive or to maintain the family unit. We must address 
the roles of poverty, racism, family violence, depression, plus 
many other factors to determine the relationship to criminal 
behaviour.
<P>
	We could add a million more laws to the Criminal Code and 
operate under the illusions that the more we have the better and 
the closer we will be to the utopian crimeless society. That is 
nothing but an illusion.
<P>
	Society must be proactive in the most aggressive manner to 
prevent crime, thus diminishing the need for impulsive, 
knee-jerk reactive measures. We must stop pretending. We must 
stop applying solutions of the 1930s to the problems of the 21st 
century. This bill brings us one giant step closer to a safer 
society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am very 
pleased to stand in the House today to speak to Bill C-41, an act 
to amend the Criminal Code with respect to sentencing of 
criminal offenders.
<P>
	Since the opening of the 35th Parliament on January 17, 1994 
this government has set in motion a number of initiatives to 
reform and strengthen Canada's justice system.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Amendments have been tabled in the House of Commons to 
revise the Young Offenders Act to crack down on violent youth 
offenders. Legislation has been introduced to reform the 
corrections and parole systems in order to improve our handling 
of sex offenders and, in particular, those who victimize children.
<P>
	Today we are discussing the initiative announced by the 
Minister of Justice to reform the sentencing process in the 
Criminal Code. Bill C-41 is a well balanced, wide ranging bill 
that not only reorganizes but rationalizes the sentencing system 
in Canada. These reforms provide a number of options that 
address the public's concern for safety and the victims' demands 
for restitution. They include an important principle that serious 
offenders should be treated differently from minor or first time 
offenders.
<P>
	Currently Parliament's role in sentencing is limited to setting 
maximum penalties for specific offences. The court systems in 
each province have been responsible for determining the 
purposes and principles of sentencing. As a result the values in 
sentencing structures in Canada's judicial system have varied 
from province to province.
<P>
	Under the proposal a statement of purpose and principles 
would be added to the Criminal Code to provide guidance to 
judges from coast to coast in the sentencing process. The 
statement describes the objectives of sentencing as follows. 
They help in the rehabilitation of offenders as law-abiding 
persons, separate offenders from society where necessary, 
providing restitution to individual victims or the community, 
promoting a sense of responsibility by offenders including 
encouraging acknowledgement by offenders of the harm done to 
victims, denouncing unlawful conduct and finally deterring the 
offender and other people from committing offences.
<P>
	This provision would allow the federal government to take a 
lead role in directing the courts on the fundamental purpose of 
sentencing, that is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful and safe society.
<P>
	Furthermore the proposed statement of principles would 
direct the courts to hand down sentences that reflect the 
seriousness of the crimes. The proposed statement of principles 
would meet the concern about hate motivated crime and crime 
committed by those in a position of trust or authority in society. 
It would state that these types of crimes must be considered 
aggravating circumstances, therefore carrying heavier weight 
when handing down a sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6060"> 6060 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 also provides amendments to the Criminal Code 
that would improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of 
the sentencing system. First it needs to amend the probation 
provisions of the Criminal Code. The proposal would encourage 
the transfer of important information to the courts during 
sentencing hearings.
<P>
	The Criminal Code would be amended to specify that basic 
information be included in pre-sentence reports, including the 
offenders' juvenile records, their criminal records, information 
about the offenders' employment and social history and active 
steps taken toward rehabilitation.
<P>
	Furthermore the bill seeks to strengthen the penalties for 
breach of probation. Strict time limits for reporting to a 
probation officer, for example, will be added to the Criminal 
Code. The penalties for breaking these conditions of probation 
would also be increased to bring more credibility to the 
probation system.
<P>
	Second, if the bill is adopted by the House it will work to 
decrease the work load of Canada's already overburdened court 
system. Like most Canadians, I shudder every time I hear of a 
case that has been thrown out of court because of delays caused 
by an exhausted court docket.
<P>
	The bill provides alternative measures to court proceedings 
that would prevent more criminal behaviour and would lessen 
the harm that can sometimes be done when minor offenders are 
dealt with through the courts. Furthermore alternative measures 
would involve the community and put greater emphasis on 
victim-offender reconciliation in court proceedings.
<P>
	A final area of concern addressed by the bill is the impact of 
criminal activities on the victims of crimes. I am pleased the 
Minister of Justice has listened to the needs and concerns of 
those citizens. Victims feel a sense of frustration and loss when 
dealing with the criminal justice system. They want their voices 
heard. In particular they want to be involved in the process and 
have their interests taken into account during sentencing 
hearings. Bill C-41 addresses these concerns.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In recent years our justice system has seen the development 
and limited use of victim impact statements. The bill would 
oblige judges in sentencing hearings to consider these 
statements when handing down their penalties. This would 
ensure that a victim has the opportunity to speak about the harm 
inflicted upon them by the offender and would ensure that the 
victim's experience was taken into account in determining 
whether the parole ineligibility should be reduced.
<P>
	We all know that crime is very costly not only to the judicial 
system but more importantly to the victims I speak of. Often 
expensive or cherished family heirlooms and personal 
possessions are stolen, lost or damaged during the commission 
of a crime. Currently if victims wish to seek restitution for 
personal or property damages  they must make a special 
application to the court or seek recourse through costly civil 
litigation.
<P>
	While they should not lose their right to follow a civil course 
of action, Bill C-41 would allow judges under their own volition 
to consider restitution to cover property and personal injury 
suffered by victims.
<P>
	We can be proud of these proposals. They are indicative of the 
government's commitment to the rights of the victims of crime.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to compliment the Nepean 
Police Services victim crisis branch for the work it has been 
performing for victims of crime since 1983. Staffed mainly by a 
large contingency of trained volunteers from my city of Nepean, 
the service provides direct crisis intervention assessment, short 
term counselling and referral to suitable community resources 
to individuals and families that suffer the effects of trauma due 
to crime.
<P>
	The mandate of the Nepean victim crisis branch not only 
operates in the best interest of the client it serves but follows the 
mandate set out by the Ministry of the Solicitor General of 
Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased to stand here today in support of Bill C-41. I 
would like to congratulate the Minister of Justice for having the 
heart and courage to listen to Canadians and for carrying out the 
promises we on this side of the House laid out in our electoral 
platforms. I am convinced that all who carefully examine the 
provisions of the bill will recognize that it is in the best interest 
of Canada and works toward restoring Canadians' faith in the 
safety of their homes and streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
on the Bill C-41 amendments to the Criminal Code respecting 
sentencing.
<P>
	It seems to me that the Liberal Party, as I mentioned earlier 
today in another speech, has been listening to the Reform Party 
but only with one ear. I say ``only with one ear'' because it has 
made a bit of a U-turn and is only halfway around the curve. If 
that party were to listen with both ears perhaps we would get all 
the way around the U-turn, get the job done once and for all, and 
get it done properly. As Reform members on this side of the 
House we feel the job is not being done by this bill.
<P>
	It would have been simple to get it done. Then we could have 
moved on to other things of equal importance such as 
unemployment and deficit control. Here we are talking about a 
little change to the Criminal Code that could be so much better. 
If I do have to praise the Liberals for their efforts in the bill it 
would be so faint that it would never be heard above the noise 
that sometimes comes from that side of the House.
<P>
	As Reformers we are serious. We want serious changes to the 
Criminal Code to recognize that victims deserve our sympathy 
and criminals are to be punished. This is a relatively simple 
statement of policy, but we find that the bill is into mind reading 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6061"> 6061 </A></B>
<P>
games in order to determine the  state of mind of a criminal when 
he commits a criminal act.
<P>
	I ask the mover of the bill and the government that is 
introducing the bill if they can tell me the difference from a 
victim's point of view between, for example, someone who is 
murdered out of hate or someone who is murdered because he or 
she happens to be an innocent bystander when a bank is being 
robbed and catches a stray bullet. In both cases the victim is 
dead. Perhaps this analogy is not very good because the victims 
in both cases are dead and their opinions would be hard to 
obtain. However let us think about that particular point. A 
victim is a victim.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	As my colleague was saying just a few minutes ago, if we are 
going to start differentiating between the motivation of the 
criminal in determination of the sentencing and what went 
through his mind when we determine sentencing, we are totally 
and absolutely forgetting the fact that the victim and society are 
what criminal law is here to protect. That is the number one 
objective. Canadians are equal in every sense under the law. If 
we are going to start differentiating between one class and 
another class then I agree with my colleague from Kootenay 
East that the country will have lost it.
<P>
	My point is that whether it is motivated by hate or any other 
reason the victim suffers. The whole reason we have criminal 
laws in our country is to ensure that society and individuals are 
protected.
<P>
	Any attempt to vary the sentencing according to the mindset 
of the criminal will not only do what I have just said. It will 
cause more avenues of appeal by the criminal and more money 
to be spent by the legal profession and the courts to review the 
case ad nauseam while the innocent victim is ignored, helpless 
and forgotten.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice will tell us that he is introducing 
victim impact statements. This is only a very small step in the 
recognition that victims have rights. I am glad to see they are 
introducing victim statements. It is the first acknowledgement 
we have had. The Reform Party policy states that where there is 
a conflict between the rights of the criminal and the rights of the 
victim, the victim's rights shall prevail.
<P>
	Here we have not only a small acknowledgement but the first 
acknowledgement that we should be hearing from the victim, 
that we should be considering what has happened to him. We can 
deal with the criminal. We can lock him up. We do not advocate 
that we throw away the key. We do advocate that we have 
rehabilitation, that we have punishment and that society has to 
be protected. That is part and parcel but let us remember the 
victim is number one.
<P>
	Talking about the review after 15 years, the very faint hope 
clause, the government is going to allow a victim impact 
statement when the criminal comes up for a parole hearing after 
an automatic 15-year period if he is in for longer. Again I think 
it is getting a bit late if we have to wait until then to hear what 
has happened to the victim.
<P>
	As I said, let us get the job done once and for all so we can 
move on to other things that are equally important. We feel we 
should talk about the debt and the deficit. Crime is important. 
The debt is important. If we get the job all wrapped up at once we 
could really improve the efficiency of the House.
<P>
	Another thing I want to speak about is that the court will 
become an offshoot of the credit bureau: if your credit is no good 
you are off the hook as far as fines are concerned. Taking a look 
at the bill, I quote from section 734.2 regarding fines: ``A court 
may fine an offender under this section only if the court is 
satisfied that the offender is able to pay the fine discharged 
under section 736''.
<P>
	We are only going to fine people if they can afford to pay. The 
rich get it in the neck and the poor get off scot-free. Is that what 
we are saying? Does this mean that destitute criminals are going 
to get a free ride, commit petty crimes and small thefts and get 
parking tickets and so on with impunity? If they have no money 
they do not have to pay. It says it right there. That is the section.
<P>
	Who is going to believe him if he is standing in dock saying: 
``Your Honour, I have no money''? Is the court going to say: 
``Let us set this case aside and launch an investigation into how 
much money is in his bank account and how much money he 
owes on his credit card''?
<P>
	Let us be reasonable. The law has to be applied to everybody 
regardless of their status in society. Not only are we talking 
about creating different classes according to their mindset, but 
we are talking about different classes according to their ability 
to pay. More pay for it, more avenues are appealed and so on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from May 6, 1994 consideration of the 
motion and amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, most 
people have heard the expression if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
This is what ran through my mind as I studied the wording of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6062"> 6062 </A></B>
<P>
motion before us and the previous debate which took place on 
March 18, 1994.
<P>
	If we were to limit solely to individuals the right to donate to a 
federal political cause, we would surely want to do so for a good 
and sensible reason. Frankly, I do not see that good and sensible 
reason.
<P>
	There is ample evidence that access to large amounts of 
money does not in itself ensure success in an election or in any 
other political activity for that matter. There is no need 
whatsoever to restrict the size of political donations.
<P>
	The traditional parties in this House authorized enormous 
sums to be spent on the yes side of the Charlottetown accord 
referendum but it was the no side with just a fraction of the 
resource but with all the logic on its side that won the 
referendum.
<P>
	As a result of the money spent by the yes side, there was no 
success in buying the result. As another example I use the 
National Party, which formed prior to the past federal election. 
It received a huge donation from just one person. I believe that it 
may have been in the range of $4 million to $5 million.
<P>
	I well remember the billboards going up all around Vancouver 
several months prior to the election. It was very clear that the 
National Party was being well funded and there was certainly no 
shortage of funds for the individual campaigns.
<P>
	Despite this abundance of funding, the National Party has in 
the last week or so wound up its affairs without electing a single 
member to this House. In contrast, if we look at the Reform 
Party of Canada, information from Elections Canada shows that 
Reform spent significantly less per person elected to this House 
than any other party in the last election.
<P>
	Reform also received virtually all of its funding from 
individual small donations. In my riding we raised between 
$40,000 and $50,000. If memory serves me only one donation 
was above $200. Well over 90 per cent were below $90.
<P>
	I see absolutely no need to limit the freedom of people to 
donate any amount they wish to political parties. As I have 
already said there are ample examples that money alone does not 
affect the outcome of an election.
<P>
	There is already full disclosure of donors to election 
campaigns and that is all that is needed for interested voters to 
track down the source of funds. The corporations and the 
organizations such as the Federation of Labour, which may 
donate to various political parties, are after all just groups of 
individuals. It does not take much work to find out who is behind 
the donations.
<P>
	The present system works pretty well but let us suppose for a 
moment that legislation were actually brought into this House to 
do what is requested in motion M-150, that is, to limit solely to 
individuals the right to donate to a political party.
<P>
	The law could easily be broken by a corporation which, as 
members will remember, is simply a group of individuals. All 
that would happen is that the individual board members would 
make individual donations to the party. Within organizations 
other than corporations such as unions, the new law could be 
circumvented simply by having the members make the 
donations.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	How would this avoidance of the law be detected? There is 
absolutely no point in putting in place a law which could be so 
easily ignored quite apart from the fact it would be an attack on 
our individual freedom to contribute to the special interest 
group of our choice.
<P>
	The previous government with the full co-operation of the 
opposition old line parties tried to muzzle organizations like the 
National Citizen's Coalition with laws similar to the one 
proposed in this motion. Thank goodness past attempts by the 
old line parties to do this have been struck down by the courts.
<P>
	Members in this House cherish their right to freedom of 
speech but sometimes some of them give the impression they 
would prefer if such freedoms were not extended to 
organizations such as the National Citizen's Coalition. Why? 
Simply because it could be embarrassing exposure of 
government waste which this House could easily eliminate if 
there were the will to do so.
<P>
	To anyone who thinks that way I say tough luck. Maybe the 
truth hurts but it is morally wrong to pass laws that attempt to 
muzzle the free speech rights of organizations like the National 
Citizen's Coalition. It is also morally wrong to try to control 
elections and referendums by restricting the ability of people to 
contribute financially to the parties or issues they support.
<P>
	Of course the supporters of this motion will argue that the 
corporations or the individuals making large donations are 
expecting something in return. The inference is that the elected 
person or government would reward with patronage or contracts 
anyone who supported their campaigns with large donations. 
The truth is that most people donate to parties and candidates 
because they believe that the policies and promises are 
consistent with their own political beliefs.
<P>
	Of course they expect rewards. These are not necessarily 
sinister or immoral in nature. For example, donors to the Reform 
Party obviously want Reform to form the government. This is 
because among other things they expect the reward of job 
creation, lower taxes and more disposable income that come 
with getting government expenditures under control.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6063"> 6063 </A></B>
<P>
	They expect the reward for their children to be a manageable 
rather than an out of control federal debt. They expect the 
reward of a return to sensible immigration levels and solutions 
to the refugee and crime problems. They expect the reward of 
direct democracy through the citizens' right to initiative 
referendum and recall, recall of an MP who is not properly 
representing his or her constituents. Are these causes not worth 
donating to?
<P>
	It is not the least bit surprising to me that people want to 
contribute to a party which will give them such rewards. I will 
not vote to restrict their ability to do so. I am prepared to let the 
free market decide what is philosophically worth supporting. I 
am prepared to let the free market then decide what is the 
appropriate level of support.
<P>
	My constituents can count on my protection of their right to 
support the party and candidate of their choice to the financial 
extent they believe is appropriate.
<P>
	Finally, in dealing with the proposed amendment I have the 
following comments. The amendment if passed could force 
taxpayers to contribute $1 per voter to each candidate in the 
riding. What a cash cow that would be. We would have 
candidates and parties springing up all over the place to climb 
into the trough for the guarantee of an $80,000 handout every 
time an election was called. The worst part would be that 
candidates would not have to earn the right to their donors' 
support. It would be the worst example of grants using 
taxpayers' money I would ever see.
<P>
	To support this amendment would be to support more 
government waste of tax revenues. How easy it is to give away 
other people's money. I wonder whether the supporters of this 
amendment would be prepared to give money out of their own 
pocket to support the amendment.
<P>
	I will vote against the amendment and the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member of 
the Reform Party who just spoke more or less supported the 
amendment. However, we feel the amendment contradicts the 
intent of the motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Richelieu. I may recall the wording of the motion, which says 
that the government should bring in legislation limiting solely 
to individuals-that is the operative word-the right to donate 
to a federal political party, and restricting such donations-this 
is also very important-to a maximum of $5,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I would like to start by commending the hon. member for 
Richelieu for introducing this motion in the House, because I 
think there are two objectives here, the first one being to 
improve our democratic system. I imagine and, in fact, I am sure 
that members speaking for the various parties want to maintain 
and improve our  democratic system. The purpose of the motion 
presented by the hon. member for Richelieu is to improve the 
system.
<P>
	The second objective is transparency, which ensures that we 
know who contributes to political parties and how much, 
because increasingly, people are saying that they feel cut off 
from government and from the decision-making process.
<P>
	Recently, <I>Enjeux</I>, a program on the CBC French network, 
described the situation very well. The impression was that 
although elected by their constituents, members were losing 
their ability to influence the government, whether they were in 
the opposition or not.
<P>
	According to public opinion, governments are mainly 
influenced by lobbyists working for big corporations. There is 
another factor as well. Many people say that since they are 
elected, members may be influenced by or mindful of the 
contributions they received in their riding or the contributions 
their party received.
<P>
	So what can we conclude from the report of the Chief 
Electoral Officer? The report now lists the names of those who 
made contributions, including companies, so we know where the 
money comes from. But I am not sure the general public is aware 
of the main items in the report.
<P>
	In the latest report by the Chief Electoral Officer, in the case 
of both the Liberal Party now in power and the Conservative 
Party, the statistics show that individuals are responsible for less 
than 50 per cent of the campaign funds raised by these parties, 
which alternated as the party in power. People wonder who is 
influencing the government, and they wonder whether 
contributions affect the way we are represented.
<P>
	This debate took place in Quebec 20 years ago, finally leading 
to the legislation referred to as Bill 2 on political party 
financing. Since it came into force, this legislation, according to 
many observers, has improved the public's confidence in 
government. I say this for the benefit of my colleagues in all 
political parties, because we all meet constituents in our riding 
offices.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I imagine that when someone who made a generous 
contribution asks for an appointment, it is harder to say no 
because these people probably think the way they used to in 
Quebec: Now look, I helped to get you elected and contributed to 
your party's campaign fund, so the least you can do is see me. 
Rightly or wrongly, politicians get a lot of criticism nowadays. 
It is often a matter of public perception, however. It may not 
happen in every case, and I do not want to tarnish the reputation 
of our parties, but my point is that it must influence what 
members or ministers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6064"> 6064 </A></B>
<P>
or governments do when they have to make a decision. At least 
that is what the voters think.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to the latest report from the 
Chief Electoral Officer, which says, for instance, that in 1992, 
the Progressive Conservative Party received only 41 per cent of 
its financing from individuals and the rest from corporations. 
The Liberal Party of Canada, the party in power today, received 
only 53.4 per cent of its financing from individuals. In the case 
of the New Democratic Party, only 41.1 per cent came from 
individuals, since the left-leaning NDP, if I can describe it that 
way, received more of its funding from the labour unions. 
Amounts of up to $300,000 were contributed by one major union 
and some smaller unions. Nearly 1,000 different unions made 
donations to the New Democratic Party, which certainly must 
have influenced the New Democratic Party's operations and 
policies.
<P>
	I was somewhat surprised to hear the hon. member of the 
Reform Party objecting to the intent of the motion of the hon. 
member for Richelieu, because in 1992, and I think this is an 
important point, 90 per cent of his party's financing came from 
individuals.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They agree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> No, I am referring to the hon. member who said 
that he was-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He was against the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Ah, he is against the amendment. I must have 
misunderstood.
<P>
	I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I was distracted by the noise in my 
vicinity.
<P>
	So, to get back to these figures, these are very substantial 
amounts. Perhaps I may start with the party in power. I am 
quoting again from the report of the Chief Electoral Officer for 
1992, to look at the extent of these contributions. The SNC: 
$78,417; Canadian Pacific: $63,000; Mr. John F. Bankes: 
$48,454; Imasco: $47,000. I will go a little faster: Royal Bank of 
Canada; $45,000; Bank of Nova Scotia: $42,000; CIBC: 
$42,258; Toronto Dominion Bank: $40,872. There are other 
banks as well, and banks certainly have a vested interest: 
mortgage rates, and so forth.
<P>
	As for the Conservatives, there was Bombardier: $70,480; 
Canadian Pacific, playing it safe again: $64,233; Bank of 
Montreal: $48,833; Bank of Nova Scotia: $42,000; Brascan 
Ltd.: $30,000; Baton Broadcasting: $28,833; BCE Inc.: 
$25,000; National Bank: $25,000. And there are more.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party also had a number of contributions over 
$5,000, although not as substantial. I also have another example. 
The Bloc Quebecois, although under no obligation to do so, 
decided to act in the spirit of the legislation passed in Quebec, 
when in 1993, it raised $3,500,000 donations from 70,000 
different individuals, the average donation being $50.
<P>
	When we talked about real power during the election 
campaign, that is what we meant. We wanted to represent the 
voters, first and foremost, and as far as I know, corporations do 
not vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this amendment which restricts individual 
donations to political parties to $1. It sounds like an extreme 
thing in the current political context and I guess it is, but I am 
not naive enough to believe that I will witness something like 
this happening in Canada in my lifetime. However, I do think the 
debate this afternoon allows me to enunciate a few principles 
which I believe in and which I believe should be applied to 
political fundraising.
<P>
	My friend from the Reform Party indicated a few minutes ago 
that he does not think the system is that bad and that it should not 
be fixed. He was not concerned about the use of money buying 
elections or buying a referendum. He pointed out the 
Charlottetown accord. We all know the yes side in the 
Charlottetown accord referendum spent more money than the no 
side. Despite that, it lost.
<P>
	Anybody with an ounce of brains knows that the presence of 
money in any election campaign is not a guarantee of success. 
We all know that. Again, I think anyone with an ounce of brains 
realizes that money can help and it can make a big difference 
under many, many circumstances. That is why political parties 
and politicians are constantly on the search for money. They 
know it helps.
<P>
	Let me ask my good friend from the Reform Party a question. 
How many candidates were there in the last presidential election 
in the United States? We know of three prominent candidates: 
Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot. They all did fairly well. 
Mr. Clinton won, but there were about 40 other candidates. How 
come we never heard about the other 40 candidates for the 
highest office in the United States? They did not have any 
money to provide a profile.
<P>
	The only person who could break that barrier was Mr. Perot. 
That was because he is a billionaire. He was able to literally buy 
a successful campaign, successful that is in the context of a third 
party candidate. He could not beat the established candidates 
from the Republican and Democrat parties, but he could put on a 
fair showing because he had enormous financial resources. 
Money can make a difference even in lost causes such as in the 
case of Mr. Perot.
<P>
	I support this amendment to the motion because I happen to 
believe that the business of political campaigns is public busi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6065"> 6065 </A></B>
<P>
ness. I believe that public business should be paid for by the 
public. It should be publicly financed not privately financed.
<P>
	I believe that democracy works best when we involve as many 
Canadians as possible and that includes the financing of election 
campaigns. We should not as democrats and believing in a 
democracy when calling an election turn that engagement, if I 
can call it that, over to private parties or private donors.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	When General Motors carries out certain private affairs, let us 
say looking for a new board of directors, does it come to the 
public and say: ``Gee, we have this little election campaign of 
our own to find our new board of directors and we would like 
you to help out''. General Motors does not do that. It does it on 
its own. It expects that particular private engagement to be paid 
for privately by the shareholders of General Motors. We should 
apply exactly the same logic when it comes to political 
campaigns. We should not be looking to private donors to 
finance election campaigns. But we do it.
<P>
	I am not suggesting for a moment that the system is fraught 
with corruption, that it is all broken down. But I think that we as 
politicians should constantly strive to do better, to improve our 
institutions including the largest and most pervasive institution 
that we have, the institution of democracy.
<P>
	In this particular era we often hear the term level playing 
field. We want a level playing field when it comes to politics and 
especially election campaigns. But when we have private 
donations there is an edge for those who have money.
<P>
	I will use the old jargon that when it comes to licking stamps, 
stuffing envelopes and knocking on doors and walking the 
streets the poor, the modest people, average Canadians are on 
equal terms with the rich. They are. They can walk as well and 
they can knock as well and they can lick stamps as well as 
anyone with a huge bank account. The one difference is that the 
rich have money and they can exercise influence. They can bring 
their clout to bear with money, something that most people do 
not have because most of us are not in relative terms rich. 
Therefore we should constantly look for a level playing field.
<P>
	Then there is the whole matter of perception. There is a 
perception out there that money does have a major influence in 
political decisions in our politics, in our governing. I do not 
happen to believe that it is as bad as some people believe, but 
there is that perception that if you have money, if you are high 
and mighty you are going to get a little closer to the politicians, a 
little closer to the decision makers and you are going to have 
access and influence that other people do not have. That is the 
kind of thing that we should avoid.
<P>
	Politicians and the people who work around politicians should 
not be spending a lot of time raising money. We should be 
spending our time governing the country, working on policy, 
working on legislation. It is not so bad in this country vis-a-vis 
the United States.
<P>
	We hear horror stories about how much time politicians in the 
United States have to spend on the road raising money. Is that 
why Americans send congressmen or senators to Washington, so 
they can spend 50 per cent of their time raising money? I do not 
think the purpose of politics is to go around raising money. Yet a 
lot of politicians in the United States have to do that.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that by moving toward a more 
publicly financed system in this country we would have a better, 
stronger and more representative democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
on the Liberal amendment to the motion that is before us today. 
The amendment is to reduce the $5,000 figure to $1. I thought I 
was going to have the privilege of agreeing with the hon. 
member for St. James. Unfortunately, as usual, they take an 
entirely different point of view from ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I was wondering if the hon. member actually understood the 
main motion in front of us. We are not talking here about the 
federal government financing political parties. If I read the main 
motion, in part it says: ``the government should bring in 
legislation limiting solely to individuals the right to donate to a 
federal political party, and restricting such donations to $5,000 a 
year''.
<P>
	That has been amended by the Liberals down to $1. We are not 
talking here about the federal government giving money to 
political parties. We are talking about the right of Canadians to 
donate to a political party of their choice. That would be 
completely denied apart from one single dollar by the 
amendment put forth by the Liberals.
<P>
	Perhaps they have a problem raising money. I took a look at 
some of the donations and donors in the last election. Some 
constituencies had donations from 300 or 400 different 
contributors. Multiply that by the money they are allowed to 
give and of course they were able to finance their campaign. 
Under this amendment the entire constituency split between 
several different parties would be able to spend $300, $400 or 
perhaps $500 in total.
<P>
	If he thinks we can get through to the electorate, publish 
brochures, purchase television advertising and split all that 
between two or three parties with only $500, the previous 
speaker must know something I do not know.
<P>
	He was talking about the concern of raising money. In the last 
election the Reform Party was able to raise almost $10 million 
or $12 million from small donors. Perhaps the previous speaker 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6066"> 6066 </A></B>
<P>
may wish to run under a Reform banner. Then money may not be 
that difficult to raise in future.
<P>
	We as Reformers believe that the federal government should 
not be in the business of financially subsidizing political parties, 
which is in direct opposition to the previous speaker.
<P>
	We believe that political parties and lobby groups should be 
self-funding, raise their own money, and be self-reliant. The 
level of financial support is going to be totally dependent upon 
the generosity of the people who support their cause.
<P>
	We had a demonstration outside the Chamber this afternoon. 
Several thousand people showed up to support their particular 
cause. There is no doubt that particular lobby is going to be 
effective in raising money to advance its particular cause 
because people support the cause.
<P>
	That is what politics and political parties are all about. 
Canadians say: ``This is the policy I want to see put forth. Here 
is the money I wish to use to support them. Go ahead and 
accomplish the objectives''.
<P>
	We are against the tax credit that makes political donations 
subsidized by the federal government. We hear so often in the 
Chamber about how we should subsidize the poor and we should 
subsidize the disadvantaged. However, when it comes to 
political donations, it gets turned upside down and the subsidy 
goes to the largest, the richest and the party that spends most 
money which quite often is the party in power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> They overspend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> They always overspend. They overspend on 
the budget. They overspend in every department. Now they 
overspend in the campaigns.
<P>
	Let us stop the federal subsidization of political parties and let 
them get on with it. If they can get the support of the people that 
way we will have a true representative democracy where people 
are prepared to put their money where their mouth is. That is 
what it is all about.
<P>
	In 1991 the main estimates show that it cost the taxpayer of 
Canada, whether he believed in politics or not, $11,503,800 to 
subsidize political parties, and that was not an election year.
<P>
	We do not have the numbers for the election in 1993, but I can 
assure the House that it is going to be a lot more than the 
$11,503,800 that taxpayers put out whether or not they think we 
should all be thrown out of office.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest to the mover of the main motion and to the 
mover of the amendment that they get their heads together and 
come up with a real policy, a reform policy that gets government 
out of subsidizing political parties.
<P>
	Let us put money where our mouth is and let us introduce 
some real legislation to get the job done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to close this debate on the motion calling for political 
parties to be financed solely by individuals who have the right to 
vote, thereby excluding unions, profit and non-profit 
organizations as well as corporations, so that only eligible 
voters have the right to donate to political parties.
<P>
	I think this is in keeping with the measures taken over the past 
two decades. We will recall that twenty years ago, party 
financing depended chiefly-95 per cent of the time-on 
corporations.
<P>
	Through changes to the election law, to allow tax credits for 
example, improvements were made, with the result that 40 per 
cent of the financing now comes from individuals. I think we 
need to take one more step toward a fully democratic system, in 
accordance with the electoral wish expressed by all the parties 
represented in this House to strive for fiscal consolidation. It 
seems to me that one way to achieve this is by limiting solely to 
eligible voters the right to donate to political parties.
<P>
	At present, the only purpose of the federal election law is to 
imposes a ceiling on election expenses. Our public financing 
proposal would complete existing regulations in that it would 
apply before, during and after elections.
<P>
	This motion is also consistent with the spirit of the bill. The 
hon. members remember the bill on lobbyists, Bill C-43, that 
the government introduced out of concern for transparency and 
integrity. I would remind the government that there is much talk 
in the red book of the need for restoring voters confidence, 
promoting integrity within political institutions and limiting 
conflict of interest and influence peddling. Would public 
financing not be a good way to implement the principles set out 
in the red book you brandished throughout the election 
campaign? Would it not be a positive step toward achieving 
these goals?
<P>
	Over the past three hours of debate, government members 
have referred repeatedly to the Lortie Report. Let us not forget 
that this report was commissioned by the Conservative 
government. Before the 1988 elections, Mr. Mulroney had 
promised to institute public financing at the federal level, like in 
Quebec. This announcement made the front page of <I>La Presse</I>. 
Following the elections, he decided to establish the Lortie 
Commission to release itself somewhat of its responsibility in 
that regard. The commission, which was established on 
November 15, 1989, and was presided by Pierre Lortie, tabled 
its report in 1991. In this report, Mr. Lortie indicated that the 
report itself showed that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6067"> 6067 </A></B>
<P>
certain donations might be made in hope of obtaining some 
direct material gain.
<P>
	That is on page 448 of the Lortie Report and the hon. members 
failed to mention it while on the subject of public financing.
<P>
	I also wish to remind you that public financing would induce 
many people who are in a conflict of interest position not to be. 
Section 121 of the Criminal Code clearly states that making a 
donation with the intention of receiving a favour from a 
government is a criminal offence.
<P>
	Consequently, every time someone gives $50,000 to a 
political party, there is a risk of that person expecting the favour 
to be returned. The Lortie Report makes that very clear.
<P>
	The report goes on to say that limiting contributions to 
candidates would have little impact on campaign financing but 
would provide a kind of ``insurance policy'' against any attempt 
to exert undue influence.
<P>
	Again according to the report, studies done on the financing 
of candidates' campaigns in 1988 show that outgoing members, 
especially ministers, receive a greater number of large 
donations than other candidates. Why do companies give more 
to ministers than to others? There may be some influence 
peddling.
<P>
	In this regard, I would like to quote from an article in the 
March 31, 1994 issue of <I>Hill Times</I>, which was itself quoted in 
the April 8, 1994 issue of <I>Le Soleil</I>. It says that the largest 
donations were made by the Seafarers' International Union of 
Canada, which gave a total of $31,500 split among 11 Liberal 
candidates. Six of them are now ministers or secretaries of state. 
The seafarers' union is closely followed by Burns Fry, Onex 
Corporation, Molson, three major communications companies, 
namely Rogers, Canwest Global and Unitel, and then 
pharmaceutical companies Merck Frosst, Apotex Limited and 
Magna International.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In all, some 24 ministers, including the Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister and six secretaries of state from the 
Liberal government, benefited from these companies' 
generosity. There is room for questions.
<P>
	We recognize that there is a danger. There is a risk of 
influence peddling, and limiting to individuals the right to 
finance political parties would address that problem. Of course, 
a lower ceiling could be justified, say from $5,000 to $3,000, 
and I, for one, would be open to reducing the amount. Still, 
$5,000 sounds pretty reasonable to me. We must draw a line 
somewhere. Some have also invoked the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, saying it would not allow us to limit corporate 
involvement.
<P>
	It can never be said often enough: it is not companies or 
corporate entities but citizens who vote in an election. The 
motion confirms the primacy of voters over public finances. Is 
this not in keeping with the spirit of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms? This is also aimed at giving all citizens a renewed 
taste for getting involved in  and controlling their political 
institutions whose credibility has been greatly undermined in 
the past, as we may recall.
<P>
	The Chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, Allan Taylor, in a 
speech given on February 26, 1991, argued that corporate 
funding of political parties does not contribute to the continuing 
democratization of and popular participation in politics. This 
quote is taken from page 446 of the Lortie report dealing with 
Mr. Taylor, Chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada. It is 
precisely this process of democratization and participation that 
we want to restore by proposing popular financing for political 
parties.
<P>
	Restoring confidence means minimizing the dependence of 
all candidates, whoever they are, on large donations and thus 
limiting the risk of breach of trust. Is financing by the people 
feasible now? Keep in mind that seven Canadian provinces and 
Canada have legislated on financing. Four provinces limit 
donations; four provinces and Canada require publishing the 
source of donations.
<P>
	Quebec is the most progressive in this regard since political 
parties there are financed only by the people. It is not something 
new, then, and in practice, one federal political party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, has put popular financing in its bylaws. No 
company, union or association gave anything to any Bloc 
candidate or to the national party during the election campaign, 
but we were still able to spend $3.5 million, with an average 
donation of less than $50 per contributor.
<P>
	Now, and I conclude with this, I think that two main principles 
guide me and my fellow members in the Parti Quebecois, who 
have been joined by our colleagues in the Reform Party, so that 
popular financing will be enacted soon.
<P>
	On the subject of transparency, voters want their elected 
representatives, their members of Parliament, to serve the 
common good and not vested interests. A voter who gives $20 
has much less clout than a company that gives $50,000. If people 
finance political parties, voters become important again and 
parties are forced to be closer to their constituents and be 
concerned about their needs. The membership is more valued 
and has a greater feeling of belonging to the party; it invigorates 
democracy in a society and also forces a party to decentralize its 
authority.
<P>
	I will close with this sentence, hoping that it might influence 
members in power and in opposition: ``Tell me who finances you 
and I will tell you whom you serve.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Richelieu reflects the general principles defined by the Parti 
Quebecois when it came to power in 1976, which included a 
more grass-roots approach to the way political parties operated 
and to government in general. I believe this was a reaction to the 
way certain politicians behaved in Quebec and in Canada, but 
especially in  Quebec, since the Parti Quebecois is a provincial 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6068"> 6068 </A></B>
<P>
party, when the public began to challenge the integrity of 
politicians.
<P>
	We all know the stories about the ``frigidaires à Duplessis'', 
refrigerators used to buy votes, and bottles of gin handed out 
during election campaigns. This was part of the political 
folklore, but there was also the story of the Liberal Party's 
Brinks trucks in 1970, in Quebec.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois wanted to clean up the system. I think we 
have seen what happened since that time, and today, even the 
Liberal Party of Quebec operates according to the democratic 
rules now in effect in Quebec. That does not prevent them from 
having a very substantial campaign fund, though it failed to win 
them the last election.
<P>
	The fact remains that all parties abide by this rule. Other 
governments in Canada have tried to imitate the system but did 
not go far enough, which is why the hon. member for Richelieu 
presented his motion.
<P>
	I think my time is up, Mr. Speaker.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSPORT">TRANSPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 
16, I rose to ask the Minister of Transport about his plans for the 
transportation system in this country which clearly seemed to 
indicate in large measure that they were plans to dismantle a 
national transportation system.
<P>
	The irony is that while the Liberal government is very proud 
of telling Canadians how much it has done in its infrastructure 
program-sewer systems, roads and highways-it is at the same 
time dismantling through the transportation policy that was 
announced by the minister earlier this year the most 
fundamental infrastructure system, the nation's air system.
<P>
	I was pleased to have received a letter from the Minister of 
Transport in which he stated in late June that he was interested in 
all members of Parliament consulting their constituents on 
transportation policy.
<P>
	Before I was able to undertake that consultation process, just 
three weeks after having received that invitation from the 
minister, the minister made a speech whereby he outlined his 
whole transportation policy.
<P>
	It seemed to me that it was not a serious attempt to have 
members of Parliament consult their constituents at all, because 
there was certainly not sufficient lead time on that. It led me to 
believe that the minister's objectives as he outlined in the 
response to my question were less than what I had seen actually 
happen in practice.
<P>
	When this national airports policy-one part of the 
transportation policy-was announced, it clearly demonstrated 
where the government was going. It was a transparent attempt to 
transfer responsibility for airports to municipalities, provinces 
and territories. It seems to me there is nothing national about 
that, leaving communities to fend for themselves.
<P>
	As a northerner, as a Yukoner, this is a particularly important 
question because it is very difficult for smaller airports in rural 
and northern areas of Canada to be self-financing. If a 
government is truly committed to a national air transportation 
system, that must be taken into account in any policy. Alas, I had 
not seen that in the minister's comments at the time of my 
question nor in his subsequent comments.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6069"> 6069 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many questions about what the impact will be of the 
national transportation policy on rural and northern areas, on 
costs both to consumer and to carrier and of course on safety 
costs as well.
<P>
	The government has decided to do a little word play by using 
the word commercialization instead of privatization but any way 
you slice it, it is privatization.
<P>
	I recently attended a regional consultation on the automated 
air navigation systems being proposed. While it was certainly a 
useful consultation by Transport Canada-I think it presented it 
well-having listened to the arguments and to the people who 
were there from the industry, it is clear there will be two results 
of this policy. First, the air navigation system will be privatized; 
second, the cost will go up to consumers and the cost will go up 
to the owners of carriers.
<P>
	There was no evidence to indicate this would cost less to the 
consumer or the owner of the carriers or even remain the same.
<P>
	There are many, many questions that have been left 
unanswered about the transport policy of the minister. The 
question that I am addressing tonight is one of them, but there 
are many more to be addressed. I must say that I have a lot of 
concerns that these are not being done in a fundamental way 
with a full broad based consultation. Privatizing simply to lay 
off federal employees is not the answer to the national dream of 
a national transportation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
you will agree that an efficient, reliable, safe and viable system 
of transport is absolutely essential for Canada's future growth 
and prosperity.
<P>
	What Canada must have is a national transportation system 
that emphasizes safety and reliability, that is efficient, that 
builds strong viable companies in all modes. It is time to give 
the frustrated Canadian taxpayer a break. It is time for those who 
use the transportation system to pay a fair share so that as a 
government we can better allocate our scarce financial 
resources.
<P>
	The budget called on Transport Canada to review the potential 
for the commercialization of a number of its major activities. 
This will be done in consultation with affected parties with the 
objective of improving efficiency and ensuring long term 
viability.
<P>
	Commercialization means users dictate what services they 
want to have provided and how costs can be controlled. 
Commercialization means that whatever option is selected it 
must allow market discipline to lead to more efficient service, 
greater flexibility and less dependence on tax dollars.
<P>
	Commercialization means that the goal must be higher quality 
and more efficient service to the user at less cost to the taxpayer. 
For instance the Minister of Transport recently announced a new 
national airports policy. Under this policy the operations of 
Canada's largest and busiest airports will be transferred to 
Canadian airport authorities made up of community interests. 
These airport authorities will be able to make the most of their 
airport's commercial potential and to explore new methods of 
finding financing and to achieve greater efficiency and cost 
saving and to match their services with the local demands.
<P>
	Commercialization will not dilute Transport Canada's 
priority ensuring and where possible enhancing the safety and 
security of all Canadians.
<P>
	Transport Canada does not have to be the owner and operator 
of a service in order to make sure it is a good service. The 
department's role can be defined by its role in policy and 
regulation.
<P>
	There is every reason to believe that carefully planned 
commercialization will mean major savings to taxpayers and 
better service to the clients.
<P>
	As the Minister of Transport said in responding to the hon. 
member's original question with commercialization: ``We will 
maintain the involvement of the Government of Canada in a 
supervisory, a regulatory and policy way''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
