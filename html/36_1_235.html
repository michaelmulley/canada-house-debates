so as to define in statute that a marriage can only be entered 
into between a single male and a single female.

Stoughton, Fort Qu'Appelle, Southey, Moose Jaw, Calgary, Edmonton 
and other places out west.

custody of their children by a legal process or be denied equal 
time.  They wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with their 
children, unless found by due process to be unfit under the laws 
of Canada.  No parent should be allowed to obstruct a child's 
relationship with the other parent or with other close family 
members unless that other parent or family member has been found 
by due process to be unfit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also believe that adversarial procedures should 
be avoided in favour of a more co-operative approach in divorce 
such as mediation and education in co-parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are asking the House of Commons to pass 
legislation as soon as possible incorporating these rights of 
children and principles of equity between and among parents.  I 
support the petition.

Indian Affairs and Northern Development reconsider her claim 
giving acres to the Caldwell Band in my riding.  Second, that a 
cash settlement be made for the Caldwell Band.  They certainly 
recognize the claim is there, but they believe that a cash 
settlement is the direction in which to go.  Third, that Treasury 
Board not advance funding for the settlement of this land claim.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </B> Mr. Speaker, 
Question No. 235 will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 235—<B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian underground economy, (<I>a</I>) what does 
the government estimate the size of this “non-reported” 
economy to be in monetary terms, and (<I>b</I>) how much federal tax 
revenue does the government estimate has not been collected due 
to the underground economy? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> The Federal government is extremely concerned 
about the underground economy. It attacks the fairness and 
integrity of the tax system and makes it difficult for the 
government to raise the revenue it needs to pay for the programs 
and services Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government devotes resources to improve its understanding 
of the underground economy so that efforts at combating it are as 
effective as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the size of the underground economy, the 
government has closely followed the work of academics and economic 
researchers. A key finding is that it is extremely difficult to 
measure the size of the underground economy. This is not 
surprising as by definition it consists of “hidden” economic 
activity. While several approaches have been developed to 
indirectly estimate this hidden activity, each has such serious 
limitations, limited confidence can be placed in the resulting 
estimates of the size of the underground economy and the 
associated revenue loss to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has used the information obtained within its 
limitations to better focus its actions to reduce underground 
activity and recover lost taxes. Revenue Canada`s actions in 
respect of the underground economy are an integral component of 
its balanced approach to tax fairness that dedicates resources to 
both facilitate compliance for taxpayers as much as possible 
while implementing responsible enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has taken the following specific actions with 
respect to the underground economy: In 1993, 1,200 additional 
employees were assigned to work on the underground economy and 
the 1996 budget provided resources for an additional 800 
auditors. More recently, the 1998 budget introduced a mandatory 
contract payment reporting system for the construction industry and 
federal government contracts, to encourage the self-employed to 
voluntarily report all of their income and to help Revenue Canada 
better detect unreported income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to both monitor and fight the 
underground economy through Revenue Canada`s underground economy 
initiative, voluntary compliance programs and other enforcement 
activities.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK30">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-32, an act respecting pollution prevention and 
the protection of the environment and human health in order to 
contribute to sustainable development, be read the third time and 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that 
there were times during the odyssey of this piece of legislation 
moving through the House of Commons that I and a few of my other 
colleagues wondered if we would ever arrive at this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you in particular, as well as 
the whips of the House for the very efficient way in which we 
dealt with the legislation at report stage last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's first environmental protection act took effect in 1988. 
After a five year review of that legislation in 1993 by the then 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, a 
considered government response and two presentations of amended 
legislation, we are close today to seeing a new Canadian 
environmental protection act passed through this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate will take its turn to review the legislation before 
it receives royal assent and is proclaimed law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation which we are debating at third reading 
today was introduced in March 1998 and, as many in the House can 
attest, the challenges have been numerous and intense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my comments at third reading today by 
thanking, first, my parliamentary secretary, the member for 
Burlington, for her diligence and commitment to the principles of 
the legislation and the legislative process.  Her assistance has 
been invaluable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I thank all members of the standing committee for their 
persistence, especially my own caucus members who have worked 
with me to bring about some significant improvements to the 
legislation I introduced in March 1998.  Thanks to their work, 
today we have a piece of legislation which is a significant 
improvement over the currently used CEPA legislation, new 
legislation of which we can all be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the legislation we are debating today will be reviewed by 
parliament in five years and will once again be improved, for it 
is the role of ongoing science, the development of new insights, 
technologies and values, and the dedication of committed 
environment department staff working with society and 
parliamentarians which will create the demand for new 
improvements to legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of my 
officials in my department who helped us move the yardstick 
forward on this CEPA legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the CEPA legislation all about?  It is about protecting 
our environment and human health from the inherent negative 
effects of some substances currently in use today.  The new CEPA 
legislation demands the screening of all 23,000 substances 
currently in use in Canada.  The screening is to be completed in 
seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those substances found to be toxic, I will have the 
authority to require the creation and implementation of pollution 
prevention plans following a clear and predictable time allocated 
process.  For those few substances found to be dangerously toxic, 
the legislation requires virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, of the 23,000 substances found in Canada, only 12 are 
considered to be dangerously toxic.  Some, such as DDT, have been 
completely banned from use and production.  Others, such as 
dioxins and furans, PCBs and hexachlorobenzene will be slated for 
virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing CEPA is based on the philosophy of pollution 
control.  However, we know that it makes far more sense for 
industry to design its processes in ways that prevent pollution. 
It makes more sense to find ways to avoid creating waste in the 
first place than it does to figure out what to do with waste 
after it has been created, and it costs less too.  We want 
Canada's industry to stop pollution before it happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is on the leading edge of environmental pollution 
legislation worldwide.  In fact, our review of similar 
legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, 
Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia shows that 
none of them address virtual elimination.  Only Bill C-32 commits 
to the virtual elimination of the most dangerous toxic 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the 23,000 substances in use today in Canada do not 
appear to pose any threats to our environment or health. 
Synthetic chemicals and metals are a basic part of our world 
today, essential to products which we all use.  The precautionary 
principle applied to their use is another important aspect of 
Bill C-32.  Too many substances have proven to have been found 
too late to have significant and negative effects on the health 
of people, other living creatures and our ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rachel Carson, in her book <I>Silent Spring</I>, drew public 
attention to the links between toxic substances and their effects 
on birds such as eagles and gulls.  I note that <I>Time</I> 
magazine recently ranked her as one of the most influential 100 
thinkers of this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science is at the heart of the new CEPA.  It instructs us on our 
environmental problems and guides us toward solutions.  Under the 
precautionary principle we will listen to the evidence that 
science reveals, but we will not wait for full scientific 
certainty before we take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that Bill C-32 was imposing important and new 
demands to achieve compliance, the federal government announced 
$82 million in new funding in the budgets of the last two years 
in order to support our commitment.  Last week I announced $11 
million in project research funding from a $40 million research 
initiative looking into such key areas as endocrine disrupters, 
persistent organic pollutants, metals in the environment, urban 
air quality issues and the cumulative effects of toxic 
substances.  A further $42 million will help us to manage toxic 
substances, including their assessment, regulation, tracking and 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we are determined to protect the health and 
environment of Canadians, for it is Canadians at the community 
level who are most affected by pollution.  This bill obligates 
the government to provide more information to Canadians on 
pollutants, using vehicles such as the National Pollutants 
Release Inventory and the Environmental Registry on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also expanding the mandate for increased public 
participation in other ways in this bill.  We want to open the 
door for people to have the right to sue if there has been 
significant harm to the environment and they feel the federal 
government has failed to enforce this law.  The legislation 
incorporates whistle-blower protection to employees and gives 
peace officer status to environmental inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation enhances the intergovernmental partnership that 
we have already built in Canada.  It ensures that aboriginal 
governments are participants in those partnerships and it values 
the traditional aboriginal knowledge that they will bring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new CEPA provides me with the authority to set engine 
emission standards for new vehicles and for other types of 
off-road engines, such as lawnmowers, generators and boat motors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 reflects the evolving state of Canada's international 
environmental commitments.  We will be able to step in to require 
pollution prevention plans to control Canadian sources of 
international air and water pollution.  This legislation also 
gives us the legal authority to fulfill our obligations under a 
range of recent international agreements such as those that 
address hazardous wastes and the import and export of hazardous 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the bill's legislative process the government has 
successfully introduced 90 amendments and fully supported 60 
other amendments made by the committee.  The report stage 
amendments which I introduced are ones that serve to ensure 
internal consistency of the bill.  They would ensure a proper 
degree of clarity throughout the act.  They would respect 
existing ministerial responsibility because protecting the 
environment and the health of Canadians is a shared 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of our polling indicates that Canadians care deeply about 
their environment, about the quality of the air they breath, the 
water they drink, their land and healthy ecosystems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 will enhance Canadians' confidence in government 
oversight, control and protection of their environment and health 
from the effects of toxic substances.  Our children's future 
security and well-being and our environmental health will be 
significantly improved with the passage of Bill C-32.  In passing 
this legislation we all can be justly proud of our contributions 
to an important piece of legacy legislation that we leave as a 
building block to a cleaner, healthier and safer future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House today to address Bill C-32.  We 
have been working on this bill for an awfully long time.  There 
has been an awful lot of input from the many, many people who 
came forward.  It is nice to see it come to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment issues facing us today are being addressed 
somewhat in Bill C-32, which deals with pollution control and 
human health.  That encompasses almost every activity that takes 
place on this planet.  Every morning when we get up and take a 
deep breath we are helping to pollute the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulation is needed and it has to be done in a balanced way. 
That is something that we tried to do, to keep that idea of 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask for unanimous consent to split my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There will be two 20-minute segments. 
The hon. member has 19 minutes remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  There were hours and hours of committee 
meetings.  We heard witnesses from across Canada in all sectors 
of society.  The clause by clause process was excruciating. I 
believe there were 560 amendments.  When the bill came to the 
House there were an additional 230 amendments.  The minister just 
mentioned how many were supported by the government.  Many of the 
amendments were supported and presented by members of the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through this debate there have been predictions of dire 
consequences if we do not toughen up the environmental protection 
act.  To some degree, I suppose, they are right, but I believe 
that in many instances they go too far.  A critical balance 
between activity and regulation has to exist, because if it gets 
out of whack either way it is harmful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the government the authority to research 23,000 
toxic substances and to clarify what these substances do to 
mankind, to life in general and how they affect human health.  We 
heard a lot about hormone disrupting substances during this 
study, as well as endocrine disrupters, gender benders, or 
whatever we want to call them.  Our party supported more research 
in this area.  We really have to know what the effects of these 
toxic substances are and we need to spend the time to find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To confirm problems we have to be able to find out the scope of 
what is happening when an action is taken and what is the 
reaction to that action.  Canadians want to feel that government 
is working toward solutions which will improve the environment. 
That is something which all members of the House tried to work 
toward in this bill.  We did it in our own different realms, but 
we all had the same focus in mind.  That is what Canadians are 
expecting from us and that is what they should expect.  The 
bottom line is a safer environment and sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting a little more close to home, last Sunday morning I was 
able to take a drive out to the country to have a look at my farm 
and the crops.  It is nice to be able to go out in the 
countryside at this time of year to see what a wonderful country 
we have.  The crops were in.  The ground had been tilled.  It had 
rained and it smelled fresh and just looked wonderful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must acknowledge that there are many areas in Canada where 
this has not happened.  My colleague, our agriculture critic and 
many others realize that there are areas in Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and other places in Canada where the crops are not in. 
The ground is too wet and they are still struggling in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get to the point where the agricultural community can seed 
its crops a lot of work needs to be done.  The soil has to be 
worked.  Fertilizer has to be applied.  In some cases chemicals 
are applied.  In all instances every operation that takes place 
is very expensive.  Chemicals and fertilizer are expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the best results the right amount must be applied.  This is 
done through soil testing and other methods.  I believe this is 
what needs to be taken into account when we talk about toxic 
substances. If they are used, if they are needed in manufacture, 
let us make sure the management of these substances is done 
properly and there is the minimal amount of exposure to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the preparation of the soil it should not be overworked 
and put into a state where erosion can take place.  This is 
something we have learned over the years.  We want to do as 
little as possible to alter the natural state of our environment. 
I believe, especially in the agricultural community, we are 
starting to see the results of science, study, and tremendous 
work such as that done at the Lethbridge research station.  We 
have started to produce more per acre than we have in years past. 
Over time the products we are producing will be more 
environmentally friendly and more useful to mankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of care and planning is used, always with the goal in mind 
of preserving if not improving our environment and producing more 
and more on the same land base to feed a growing population. This 
must continue and I am sure it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As lawmakers we need to support Canadians by having laws that 
will assist our agricultural industry, our manufacturers and 
others to provide food and the necessities of life in a way that 
Canadians find acceptable and which reduces harm to the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always to keep in mind sustainable development, the 
environment and human health because they have to be considered 
in any development.  As well social and economic aspects have to 
be taken into account.  It is important to take into 
consideration the impact on society or on the development of a 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must use sound science and research to achieve laws and 
regulations and we must back them up with enforcement.  We have 
learned through this process, through the environment committee 
and witnesses, that in some areas our enforcement is in dire need 
of a tune-up.  It is not happening.  It is not being done in a 
way that is congruent or in any planned fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada needs to have a look at its resources and 
direct them to the areas which need the most attention. 
Departmental review and putting emphasis where the emphasis is 
needed have to be done on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done a lot in the House recently, albeit not enough 
because of the time allocation that has been put forward. 
Hundreds of hours of committee work have been done.  I would 
suppose it involved millions of dollars in wages, work and 
support for all the people who appeared before us and the people 
who work for them.  We must keep in mind the expectations of 
Canadians.  We need workable and enforceable regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be in Canada at this time of year is an absolute treat.  We 
live in a great country, especially in the spring as we see 
things come to life, as we see wildlife such as the pair of geese 
with their goslings that I saw the other day, as we see blooming 
gardens, fruit trees coming around, crops going in, birds coming 
back and singing in our communities.  It is just great.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we work in an effective manner to preserve 
the country for generations to come.  The member from the NDP 
says consideration in the aboriginal sense is seven generations. 
We have to look at how any action that is taken by their people 
will affect seven subsequent generations.  That is a good rule to 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a high school graduation on the weekend and saw the 
excitement, the hopes and the dreams of the class of '99 as it 
goes out into the world.  I reminded the students that they 
needed to pay attention to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education aspect of environmental protection is important. 
All Canadians have to be aware.  I have great hope in future 
generations.  They are very much aware and will do a better job 
than we and previous generations have done in preserving the 
environment and making the country a far better place in which to 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all this time of year is very exciting.  Canada is one of 
the most pristine places on earth and we need to work to keep it 
that way.  We have made mistakes in the past and unfortunately we 
may make mistakes in the future.  We have to limit those mistakes 
and continue to make headway.  We have to be sure that we sustain 
life and human health and develop in a way that accomplishes 
that.  Certainly young people are very concerned about the 
environment.  They are very much aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different parties have brought forward different philosophies 
which sometimes do not lend themselves to full co-operation but 
allow for debate to be broadened to include how we as Reformers 
and how other parties feel about the environment.  The bottom 
line is that we appreciate what we have in the country but we 
need to work very hard to preserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure people understand I would like to indicate that we 
support sustainable development, which is human activity that 
combines economic, social and environmental considerations 
without compromising the well-being of existing and future 
generations.  This is very important.  We support the 
participation of effective local communities in environmental 
decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always talk about residual powers in the provincial and 
municipal governments.  They were discussed quite a bit in 
committee.  Who has the ultimate power?  We feel that the federal 
government has to be involved in the environment.  We believe 
constitutional challenges have stated such.  However, the 
provinces, municipalities and all Canadians also have a duty to 
perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the rationalization of federal and provincial 
environmental laws and the development of regional and national 
environmental standards where appropriate.  We also support 
integration of social, environmental and economic objectives into 
the management, philosophy, structure, procedures and planning 
where the federal government has constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take what we believe in and support each party's 
philosophy and policies, it will go a long way to creating a 
tremendous environmental protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support federal leadership for a commitment to sustainable 
development, including the creation of partnerships with 
provincial governments, private industry, educational 
institutions and the public to promote meaningful progress in the 
area of environmental protection.  This is where strong research 
is involved.  We must get everyone involved in getting the facts 
laid out for Canadians to consider and in bringing government, 
industry, community groups and municipalities into the fold to 
come up with the best possible balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the principle of establishing and regularly 
reviewing standards based on sound science which are technically 
and socio-economically viable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the removal of administrative and regulatory 
fiscal practices that discourage or detract from environmental 
responsibility.  I suppose that is coming at it from another way, 
that all regulations should be looked at from the point of view 
of their environmental impact and how they will affect the world 
in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the continuing development of commercially 
viable practices for the management of the environment.  We 
support the development of reasonable endangered species 
legislation, and I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee and in the House our party has tried to put forward 
the best balanced approach which we feel will do the most in the 
end for the protection of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this will be the last time I will get to address 
Bill C-32 in debate.  I will probably get involved in questions 
and comments a little later.  Going through this act has been an 
experience I will never forget.  Hopefully at the next review 
there will still be a few of us here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
basically my colleague has reviewed our party's position.  I 
would like to trace how the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
came to be and some of the problems we have had with the bill as 
it moved through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act was originally brought 
to the House in 1988.  Part of that legislation, which I think 
was extremely helpful, indicated that in five years time the bill 
would come back to the House for review.  That is what happened. 
Unfortunately it has taken about five years to reach today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-74 in the last parliament the government brought 
forward what it thought was the answer to reviewing CEPA.  It 
brought forward some amendments.  There were some flaws in that 
bill and it never reached the House in its final form.  In this 
parliament the government again brought forward the new Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the view of the Reform Party it was a well balanced act.  It 
looked after the needs of Canadians as well as the needs of a 
healthy environment and the needs of industry.  It was a well 
balanced act which then went to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was the make-up of the committee.  If either side of 
an issue, either the hang them high side or the other side, is 
loaded in any committee, the result will be skewed legislation. 
If the fisheries committee is loaded up with a bunch of fishermen 
there will be a skewed result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there was not a balance in the environment 
committee.  There were 560 amendments before the committee in an 
attempt to bring the legislation back to where it was in Bill 
C-74, which did not pass in the last House.  All of us in the 
House have spent thousands of hours collectively in committee 
dealing with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came back to the House it was a bill that even the 
government could not live with.  Another 235 amendments were 
introduced at report stage, with which we dealt yesterday and in 
the weeks before, to bring the bill back to basically where it 
was when it was introduced over a year ago.  This involved a lot 
of time and a lot of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a shot at any of the people on the committee, but I 
think it is a shot at the government.  A requirement of 
committees should be balance right across the board.  Whether it 
is fisheries, justice or environment, the make-up of a committee 
should be balanced.  In my view the environment committee was not 
balanced, which caused excessive hours of work on the part of all 
members and staff. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The staff behind the scenes basically spent a year keeping this 
process going.  It was extremely frustrating at times for all of 
us.  I would hope that in the future this could be avoided by 
having a balance of each committee across the spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was unfortunate that yesterday there had to be time 
allocation on this bill.  We were already at the seventh group of 
motions.  We could have had eight.  There were only eight groups. 
Basically it could have gone through.  It is unfortunate after 
all the time we have spent on it that we did not have the 
opportunity to at least voice our opinions in the House.  Then 
Canadians could have heard the different views and aspects each 
member had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague was talking about the graduation ceremonies, 
he commented that most Canadians are environmentalists.  The 
younger people are much more environmentally friendly and 
environmentally conscious than my generation. This is healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a grand country.  We need to look after it. This bill 
does that.  Three of the five parties in the House will support 
the bill this evening I believe. It is a bill that in my mind 
hits the balance.  I know others will say that it is not a 
balance.  We can have a vibrant and healthy environment and a 
vibrant and healthy economy. They are not independent.  They can 
be together.  That is what this bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will support the bill this evening.  It has 
taken a long time to get here.  As I said at the beginning, one 
of the strong points of the last bill was that it came back to 
the House.  This bill will also come back to the House in seven 
years.  There will be an opportunity to refine it and to move it 
along so that it remains timely and current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Davenport has initiated a very timely review on 
pesticides.  Part of the problem is we are dealing with 
pesticides that were registered 30 years ago and are out of date. 
By coming back to the House in seven years the bill will move 
with the times.  It will be current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill. We look forward to seeing its passage 
through the Senate and becoming law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to seek unanimous consent of the House to split my time 
with the hon. member for Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the House give its consent for the hon. 
member for Jonquière to divide her time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the 
third reading stage of Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at this stage because the government has decided once 
again to put a gag on a bill, in order to push its interests 
ahead of any others, without any consideration for the arguments 
of the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to give an overview of the events leading 
up to Bill C-32.  On December 15, 1995, the Liberal government 
proposed revising the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal by Sheila Copps, the minister of the environment at 
the time, was the government's response to the fifth report— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows very well that she 
must not refer to a member by name, only by title. I hope that 
she can comply with the rules in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> This announcement by the minister of 
the environment at the time was the government's response to the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, entitled “It's About Our Health—Towards 
Pollution Prevention”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the Bloc felt that a majority of the report's 
recommendations supported the centralizing tendency of the 
federal government in environmental protection matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois refutes the theory of the double safety net 
and contends that the environment would be better served if 
responsibility for its protection were given to one level of the 
government only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois firmly believes that the provinces, including 
Quebec, have greater knowledge of the specifics of the natural 
environment and are in a position to arouse the interest and 
encourage the participation of local residents, are more open to 
the claims of environmental groups, are able to conclude 
significant agreements with national and international partners 
and have indicated their desire to find solutions to 
environmental challenges and to contribute actively to 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position remains unchanged. Bill C-32 was tabled at first 
reading on March 12, 1998. It renewed the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, formerly Bill C-74, which died on the order paper 
with the last election call. It was, moreover, a promise in the 
Liberal Party's red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage of Bill C-32, it is important to underscore for the 
federal government the reasons why Quebec refused to sign the 
harmonization agreement of the Canadian council of environment 
ministers. With what we have just seen in recent days, Quebec's 
decision seems to validate them even more. Canada wants to go it 
alone, without giving any thought to the responsibilities 
afforded the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the meeting of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment of January 29, 1999, the Quebec minister of the 
environment, Paul Bégin, refused to sign the agreement so long 
as the conditions set by Quebec were not met by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions include among others recognition of Quebec's 
exclusive or at least primary jurisdiction in the areas assigned 
to the provinces by the Constitution. They also include the firm 
commitment by the federal government to pass the legislative 
amendments required, and of course the adoption by Quebec and 
the federal government of a bilateral agreement on environmental 
assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Minister Bégin also stressed that the declared 
intentions of the federal government as to the review of the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which would lead to a 
significant increase in federal powers, contravene the spirit 
and objectives of the environmental harmonization negotiation 
process, particularly that of preventing duplication and 
intergovernmental disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position of Minister Bégin reinforced the position taken by 
the Bloc Quebecois in its dissenting report of December 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 20, 1996, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment agreed in principle to the Canada-wide environmental 
harmonization agreement and to two subsidiary agreements on 
inspections and standards. The subsidiary agreement on 
environmental assessments was negotiated during the winter of 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement was to enhance environmental protection in a 
sustainable development context, while respecting each 
government's jurisdiction, in a more effective way. It was to 
have contained the general principles to be implemented more 
specifically through subsidiary agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always supported harmonization between 
the federal and provincial governments when it would serve to 
eliminate administrative and legislative overlap and duplication 
between the two levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore supported environmental harmonization so long as it 
did not serve to screen the federal government's continued 
meddling in provincial jurisdictions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that harmonization recognize the exclusive or 
primary jurisdiction of the provinces in the areas entrusted to 
them by the Constitution. The spirit of harmonization must be 
reflected in the changes the federal government is making to 
existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several recommendations were made in committee to improve this 
bill. I will mention a few in the course of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that ratification of the agreement and 
the three subsidiary agreements be postponed, first until all 
documents, namely the agreement and the 10 subsidiary agreements 
proposed, were available so the public would have a real 
opportunity to contribute and, second, until the committee's 
concerns and recommendations had been fully considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also recommended that the consensus requirement in 
the agreement and subsidiary agreements be replaced with a 
two-thirds majority vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to these two recommendations, the Bloc Quebecois 
believes it is premature for the federal government and the 
provinces to endorse the harmonization agreement and subsidiary 
agreements, and for the committee to report to the House of 
Commons, because we have not had the opportunity to observe any 
real desire on the part of the Liberal government to harmonize 
with the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be better to wait until the endangered species bill, 
the fisheries bill and the Canadian environmental protection 
legislation have been introduced. We will be able to fully 
assess the harmonization agreement when considering these bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, before considering any new subsidiary agreements, it would 
be better for the federal government and the provinces to deal 
first with the three existing agreements on environmental 
assessment, inspection and standards. In addition, we are 
proposing that the agreements be ratified by a unanimous vote 
instead of a two-thirds majority vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another recommendation, the committee suggested that a 
provision be included in the environmental assessment agreement 
stating that it will not require any changes to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. 
The subsidiary agreement will also have to specify that the 
objectives and requirements of the environmental assessment must 
meet the strictest standards and must meet or exceed the 
prescribed objectives and requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation is contrary to the principles of the general 
agreement, which states that governments may change their 
respective legislation as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Bloc Quebecois believes that only the Quebec 
environmental assessment process should be applied in Quebec. 
The federal government's willingness to achieve harmonization is 
supposed to be reflected in the legislation, and we consider 
that Bill C-14, an act respecting the safety and effectiveness of 
materials that come into contact with or are used to treat water 
destined for human consumption, does not reflect this spirit of 
legislative harmonization between the federal government and the 
provinces and represents another intrusion by the federal 
government in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that several 
recommendations in the Liberal majority report are contrary to 
Quebec's historic positions in the area of federal-provincial 
harmonization and that recent interference by the federal 
government does not respect the spirit of the accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois deplores is that the federal government 
refuses to give legislative expression to its good intentions 
with regard to environmental harmonization and chooses instead 
to hide behind the centralizing screen of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that consideration in committee of Bill 
C-32 began in the fall of 1998 and concluded in April 1999?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was studied over the course of some 60 sittings, and 
580 amendments were introduced.  The Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development therefore broke a record 
for the length of time any bill has been studied in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee adopted about 160 of these amendments.  All of 
this work seems to have been cancelled out by a government that 
is blowing with the wind, without any consideration for the 
environment.  As a result, the bill now before us is 
inconsistent in many regards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that many amendments were added in 
committee, but this government has decided either to not even 
consider them, or to alter their meaning and substance.  It is 
somewhat ironic to think that a process this lengthy has 
culminated in a gag order from the government and major changes 
to what was done in committee.  It is clear that the government 
has not respected what was done in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the two main changes made to the bill at 
committee stage, which were not respected by this government. 
First of all, a new definition of virtual elimination in clause 
65 has been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 65 now reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—virtual elimination means, in respect of a toxic substance 
released into the environment as a result of human activity, the 
ultimate reduction of the quantity or concentration of the 
substance in the release below the level of quantification 
specified by the ministers in the list referred to in subsection 
(2). 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new definition allows the federal government to change the 
limit according to the ongoing changes in scientific tests and 
measurements.  The ministers are the ones to draw up the list of 
levels for each substance but they must take into consideration 
all pertinent social, economic and technical factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could see there was a problem of harmonization among the 
various provisions in the bill relating to virtual elimination. 
The new definition has not been uniformly applied to all clauses 
concerning this issue. Accordingly, the Bloc Quebecois proposed 
amendments to respond to these inconsistencies in Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the committee eliminated all references to the 
cost-effective measures the government was to take under Bill 
C-32. The committee based its decision on the fact that the 
government did not want to explicitly define the word 
“cost-effective” in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this legal void, the committee decided it was 
simply preferable to eliminate the term, considering that, in 
the context of sustainable development, it is understood that 
governmental measures are to be cost-effective. In addition, 
federal departments are already subject to Treasury Board policy 
on the cost-effectiveness of federal regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wanted to make changes to the bill, which 
were not passed either in committee or at the report stage in 
the House. One of the main changes concerned the systematic 
presence of an agreement with the provinces prior to federal 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, under the original version of Bill C-32, the federal 
government was going to act in accordance with the intent of 
intergovernmental agreements. The Liberal majority softened this 
requirement by adding the word “endeavour” before the verb “to 
act”. The Bloc Quebecois maintains that the federal government 
must always keep in mind the prospect of harmonization with the 
provinces, to avoid duplication and overlap in the legislation 
and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By trivializing federal-provincial harmonization agreements, the 
Liberal government clearly shows that it lacks the will to 
respect the jurisdiction of the provinces with regard to the 
environment. 
The Bloc Quebecois therefore proposed the deletion of the word 
“endeavour”, as Bill C-32 currently stipulates, but to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At clause 9, the bill provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9.(1) The Minister may negotiate an agreement with the 
government ... with respect to the administration of this act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberal majority on the committee decided to make 
this agreement subordinate to the new clause 9(9), which would 
trivialize any future equivalence agreement with the provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9(9) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No agreement made under this section shall limit or restrict the 
carrying out of any action the Minister deems necessary for the 
administration and enforcement of this Act, including the 
conduct of possible inspections or investigations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this clause, the federal government is giving itself the 
powers to go over the heads of the provinces, even after 
reaching an agreement with a province. This is totally 
incomprehensible and unacceptable on the part of a government 
that claims to want to work in partnership with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in theory Bill C-32 recognizes the environment as a shared 
responsibility between the federal government and the provinces, 
in reality, this bill does not delegate any power to any 
province, including Quebec, which, of course, is contrary to 
what true environmental harmonization between the various levels 
of government should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 confirms that, with the latest supreme court ruling on 
environmental matters, the federal government is trying to 
broaden its powers in this area. Although the federal and 
provincial governments share responsibility for the environment 
under the Constitution, the Liberal government clearly wants to 
subordinate the role of the provinces to that of the central 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis is on pollution prevention as a method of priority 
intervention with the power to require pollution prevention 
plans, which are mandatory for substances included in the list 
of priority toxic substances and optional for others. A direct 
partnership must also be developed between the federal 
government and industrial sectors that are already partly 
covered under Quebec programs, such as the industrial waste 
reduction program that has been implemented in the pulp and 
paper industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures contained in Bill C-32 will allow the federal 
government to establish national priorities for intervention. 
Therefore, the provinces will have no choice but to adopt 
federal regulations, otherwise they will be forced to see the 
federal government serve the same clientele. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative and regulatory powers that the federal 
government is giving itself are very important.  While the 
Liberal government constantly talks about its willingness to 
work in partnership with the provinces, it nevertheless 
institutionalizes its powers in order to play a paternalistic 
role towards the provinces. That is one thing the Bloc Quebecois 
deplores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's claims about the importance of a 
national approach to environmental protection are contrary to 
the spirit of environmental harmonization.  It is sad that the 
supreme court is further contributing to the Liberal 
government's centralizing tendencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and contrary to the Liberal government, which argues 
the notion of the double safety net, two levels of government 
acting within the same jurisdiction, the Bloc Quebecois feels 
that this system diminishes the accountability of both levels of 
government by seriously complicating the assignment of 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the bill because, in addition 
to imposing a centralist vision, the federal government is 
making a grab for new powers and is interfering in provincial 
jurisdictions, when what it should be doing is working to 
further harmonization among the various levels of government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel it is 
rather special and significant to rise in this House during 
Environment Week to speak to Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32, which proposes to renew the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, is now at third reading.  We are opposed to this 
bill because it has all the aspects of a centralizing 
legislation and neglects certain areas of jurisdiction we find 
it very important to defend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by congratulating the hon. member for Jonquière for 
the work she has done on this issue.  After 60 sittings, the 
clause by clause study of the bill by the environment committee, 
580 amendments were introduced and 160 of them passed.  Much 
work was done in the standing committee on the environment, but 
with dubious results.  One must wonder why so. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because only one-quarter of all those amendments were retained, 
and in many ways the result has been a kind of patchwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has its inconsistencies, but what is even more 
troublesome is the lack of harmonization between the provinces 
and the central government.  This lack of harmonization results 
in duplication and in overlapping legislation and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is an intrinsic part of the lives of every 
person in this country, for it affects us all. 
Whether it be water, land or air, we all depend on these three 
elements. Harmonization is necessary so that everyone may feel a 
part of a large-scale project to make the environment healthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reservations about this bill because it denies the basic 
principle whereby the more people, municipalities and provinces 
involved, the greater the chances of interesting results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inconsistency in this bill leaves us perplexed, and I might 
add that the lack of harmonization and of agreements with the 
provinces may be very costly for the country. I am not inventing 
this lack of agreements, because I read the commentary from the 
Office of the Auditor General of Canada, which provides clearly 
that federal-provincial agreements on the environment do not 
provide the results expected. It basically says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit revealed that key elements of agreements were simply 
not implemented. In certain cases, the federal-provincial 
committees that were to manage agreements were never set up. In 
other instances, the federal government lacked the information 
it needed on provincial activities in order to be able to 
determine whether federal regulations had been applied. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, where do we go with results like that? It is rather 
embarrassing. In his report, the commissioner recommends that 
Environment Canada assess existing environment agreements and 
incorporate the lessons learned into new agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not advanced very far, if you want my 
opinion, and the Bloc Quebecois recognizes that the 
federal-provincial agreements on the environment are not perfect. 
They must be improved. That is vital. 
They are, however, an improvement over unilateral action by 
Ottawa, as proposed in Bill C-32, given the benefits of 
eliminating overlap and establishing a single window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the recommendations of the Bloc Quebecois. They are 
not to be found in text of the bill. These are good reasons to 
oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue my speech to cover three areas: the 
agri-environment, biotechnology and air pollution. We are 
trailing somewhat in agri-environmental projects, and I will 
quote from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada documents to show 
what the government is looking for in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document entitled “The Health of Our Soils” states in 
essence: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of sustainability—which is what the environment is 
all about—land management means that the land is used so as to 
maintain productivity without exhausting the resources or 
adversely affecting the environment. This type of management 
implies a change of mentality and attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The soil should be 
considered like a bank account. If we treat it like an 
inexhaustible resource, that is if we constantly withdraw money 
from our account, we will exhaust our reserves. On the contrary, 
if we use appropriate stewardship and renew the resources used, 
our account will continue to be balanced and to provide a good 
return. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada supports sustainable land 
management. Productivity, stability, protection and viability, 
these are the pillars of the approach suggested to preserve our 
land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing a comprehensive agricultural plan. What does 
this mean? First, we should make an inventory of the operating 
resources and practices, and then answer various questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions include the following: Does the farmer 
participate in a government agricultural plan? From what source 
does the farmer get the information on which he bases his 
decisions? Does the farmer have resources that he is currently 
not using? What obstacles impede the use of soil conservation 
methods? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for this year's proposal by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
with respect to soil health, I am delighted to say that Quebec 
has already been practicing this for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is the agro-environmental portrait of farms in Quebec: 
17,937 of them responded to a request from their union to 
analyse their operations.  This represents 88% of farms invited 
to participate.  This is a first in Canada, in Quebec and in the 
world.  This is where the commitment to saving our farms, our 
soil and our environment must begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By agreeing to answer questions about their practices, producers 
have shown that they are genuinely interested in protecting 
their resources. 
Anyone familiar with this sector will know that farmers are not 
necessarily thrilled about answering such questions.  Farming 
practices are always kept secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This response was an indication of a growing awareness that the 
future of generations to come depends on each one of us.  I keep 
mentioning harmonization, decentralization and the need to work 
together.  This is the only way to obtain results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farms surveyed were those affected by the regulations on 
reducing agricultural pollution, as well as apple growing and 
greenhouse growing operations.  This was a large step forward 
and will be pursued.  With results, one does not need to talk 
through one's hat, but can implement specific measures that are 
often very effective and much less costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to mention this project because I believe it is very 
important. Some of the federal-provincial arrangements for 
agriculture are very interesting. Minister Rémi Trudel said that 
the agro-environmental plant health strategy support program was 
developed as a result of the Canada-Quebec agreement on the St. 
Lawrence Vision 2000 action program. This five year program has 
a yearly budget of $2.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its purpose is to support technology transfer and development 
projects dealing with major crops, such as potatoes and apples. 
Its goals are very straightforward: to reduce pesticide use by 
50% and put 70% of cultivated land under integrated pest 
control. This is a tall order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked in this field I know how difficult it is to 
convince people to take part in this kind of initiatives. They 
have to completely change their farming practices. However these 
are concrete measures. Out of 49 projects submitted for 1998-99, 
37 got accepted, and partners are contributing financially to 
the study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Projects are based on local needs and linked to strategic teams' 
action plans. Because they are simple, these projects are 
useful, and people get on board. They are called pesticide free 
and pesticide reduced projects. They give a lot of visibility. 
These technology transfer and development projects deserve to be 
better known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec we had the Green Plan and technology transfer 
committees. In 1997 the Liberals did not renew the only program 
through which the federal government was funding 
agri-environmental projects. 
The agricultural component of the Green Plan expired on March 
31, 1997 and nothing replaced it. This is regrettable because 
these initiatives produced very positive results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I would also address biotechnology, because the essence 
of the Group No. 3 motions is to remove the powers of the 
Department of the Environment and the Department of Health to 
give the governor in council the exclusive responsibility for 
decisions on biotechnology projects concerning animate 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology is on everyone's lips and a major source of 
concern to many. Its results are often very interesting, but 
sometimes also very worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year, the federal government decided to 
renew its biotechnology strategy, which dates back to 1983. 
Last April, the Standing Committee on Agriculture undertook to 
hold hearings on agricultural biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It subsequently tabled a report entitled “Capturing the 
Advantage: Agricultural Biotechnology in the New Millennium”. 
The fifth of its sixth recommendations addressed the necessity 
for parliament to undertake a review of the Canadian policy on 
labelling with the participation of all the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official Canadian government response to the agriculture 
committee was as follows “Canadian policy provides for consumer 
choice by allowing food companies to voluntarily label whether 
or not their products have been derived from biotechnology”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing free choice to everyone, we end up without a code of 
ethics and also without labels for products derived from 
biotechnology.  The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of a complete 
re-examination of labelling policy, particularly where 
genetically manipulated foods are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The applications of biotechnology are multiplying constantly and 
at an increasingly rapid rate.  We therefore feel it is 
necessary to address this important matter more seriously, with 
a view to keeping an eye on the changes that are affecting our 
lives at present and those that will do so in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if my colleagues experience the same thing but, 
almost every day, I receive letters from people in every region 
of the country, including western, central and eastern Canada. 
These people say “We realize that genetically modified products 
in foodstuffs are here to stay. In that case, the label should 
tell us what is in the food item, because we want to preserve 
our health and the health of our children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add something about biotechnology. There are some 
rather disturbing things going on. Members are all aware of the 
cloning of goats by a company called Nexia. Such cloning raises 
once again the ethical issue relating to that procedure. These 
goats were cloned by using a technique similar to the one used 
with Dolly the sheep, in 1997. The same DNA was used in what was 
the first stage to develop a spider silk called biostyl from 
goat milk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This scientific breakthrough generated admiration, but also 
concern in Canada. It may mean that it is probably not that 
difficult to clone human beings. Fortunately, we just learned 
that Dolly is aging twice as rapidly as she should be. This may 
make cloners think twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Nexia officials appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, we asked them “Do you have a code of ethics? How do 
you operate? Is there an international or national code of 
ethics?” They told us, literally, that they were voluntary 
members of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. This is like 
saying “The humane society will give you an outline of the 
course of action to follow. Comply with it”. This makes no 
sense, from both a scientific and human point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this makes for a rather dangerous situation.

I agree with the warnings he gave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to my third point, which is air pollution. I have 
another document on the quality of the air that we breathe. I

pollution, is Canadians' main health concern, and Quebecers are 
worried about it most—

the people of this province and cost their health care system 
dearly.

12,000 other Canadians every year.

the focus of the Kyoto commitments and underlie the changes that 
we should be making.

respect to Bill C-32 on agriculture, biotechnology and air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we must remember is that the environment is not a 
government matter, it is an individual matter. Without a solid 
partnership and a solid harmonization agreement, we may not 
achieve our objectives and the primary goal—that of saving the 
planet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to clarify our role as Canadians and to highlight the 
whole journey of getting the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act to where it is now at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that we were quite discouraged with 
government members during the voting last night and with Reform 
members who voted with the Liberal cabinet in support of watering 
down environmental protection in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my hon. colleagues said that the youth of the country and 
the world are very cognizant of the environmental damage that the 
industrialized revolution and the industrial ways of living have 
diminished our health and our environment.  They are very 
conscious of changes that have to be made.  The youth are telling 
us this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have received letters in these last few days and hours 
telling us that a mistake was made last night in watering down 
the environmental protection of the country. 
Then an hon. member said that there was a mistake, that when the 
standing committee was formed and the way it did its 
parliamentary duties was overly environmental. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To Canadians, the youth who are listening, environment is life. 
We live off this land, off this water, off this air.  If we do 
not protect our environment, there is no future for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In industry, trade and manufacturing, people make their daily 
profits while they pollute and put their garbage into our 
environment.  It impacts on us.  If we want these people to sit 
on our environment committee and empower it on a balanced 
situation, future generations will struggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth are environmentally conscious.  They will dominate 
this House of Commons.  They will dominate all committees, 
including the industry committee and the trade committee.  Youth 
are our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night we made a major mistake.  We watered down this 
country's basic environmental protection law by adopting 
amendments that were proposed by industry.  The Reform Party was 
lobbied.  The Liberal cabinet was lobbied.  The parliamentary 
secretary and the ministers were lobbied.  They buckled and they 
watered down our environmental protection act.  It is the third 
reading debate today and the vote will be held tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put some quotes on the record and I will submit them 
to the Clerk.  This letter which was circulated highlights the 
key problems with Bill C-32 as revised by the committee. The 
committee worked on this for years under public review. In its 
report “It's About Your Health”, the standing committee made 
its recommendations to strengthen pollution prevention, not 
pollution control or pollution management, but pollution 
prevention, to stop pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what industry had to say about the committee's work: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Application of virtual elimination.  For reasons that are unclear 
to us, the Department of Environment proposed to the committee 
significant changes to the virtual elimination construct 
initially proposed in Bill C-32.  The new construct changes the 
virtual elimination definition so that it is now based on 
achieving releases below the limit of qualification, and 
incorporates two distinct measures to achieve virtual 
elimination: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The release number should be set by the governor in council and 
not by the ministers alone— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtual elimination planning based on achieving below limits of 
qualification releases is faulty public policy as it is fraught 
with operational uncertainty and would impose a huge regulatory 
overhang without any demonstrable reduction in environmental or 
health risks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtual elimination is a working qualification that we can 
continue to pollute to a measurable amount in this country.  The 
minister will allow these limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the preamble of the bill we wanted to have a phase-out of the 
toxic chemicals and toxins in this country.  We wanted to phase 
them out.  We did not get that in the operational side of the 
bill but we were successful in getting it in the preamble.  The 
front side of the bill says that we want to phase out eventually; 
the operational side says that the minister recommends virtual 
elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened after the industry put its foot down in sending 
out these documents is that “achieving virtual elimination” in 
the bill has been taken out.  It is only “limits of 
qualification will be set by the minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country is in a loophole. Canadians want to phase out 
chemicals and toxic substances.  The government says we will 
virtually eliminate.  Industry says just set the limit and let us 
continue to do our business. This whole issue of pollution 
prevention has been eliminated, completely phased out from Bill 
C-32 as it is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to highlight that the integrity of the 
standing committee has been tested not only by industry but by 
this government and the minister. 
The minister challenged us that in committee we should not change 
major clauses in the bill.  We made changes and she put forth 
many amendments to repeal the changes.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of getting even, so to speak, she also put an amendment 
that the next review of Bill C-32, the CEPA, would not be 
exclusively done by the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development.  The exclusive review 
could be taken by the committee responsible in the other place. 
The Senate could review the next bill if it is approved. That is 
a major detriment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this issue for all hon. members, my colleagues to my 
right, who speak on behalf of seeing an effective and elected 
Senate.  All members should be aware that the Senate does not 
have the exclusive right.  It does not have the democratic 
representation to review these acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has a process for creating acts and laws. The House 
of Commons standing committees have the first right to make 
recommendations and review ministerial drafts.  Then the bill 
goes through this House before it goes to the other place.  This 
process could be sidestepped with the amendment that was 
introduced last night and which is now in place.  I draw this to 
the attention of all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I raised and which the hon. minister highlighted 
was scientific certainty.  Cost effectiveness was a major concern 
for industry, that any measure taken to protect our environment 
should be cost effective.  The committee had eliminated this.  It 
was brought back in with an amendment by the Reform Party and the 
Liberal cabinet.  They want cost effective measures to ensure 
that industry has the profit driven derivatives as a priority 
over the environment and the health and safety of Canadians. Cost 
effective was a major battle in committee and inevitably industry 
won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of scientific certainty is aboriginal traditional 
knowledge which is a bold inclusion, but there is an oversight. 
We introduced an amendment yesterday which was defeated. 
Aboriginal people are not defined in the bill. We put forward a 
constitutional definition of who the aboriginal people are: the 
Indian, the Metis and the Inuit of this country, but the 
amendment was not approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the aboriginal people in this country have lived a 
sustainable life on the land.  Their intrinsic knowledge is oral 
based.  They know the plants, the animals, the waters and the 
effects on the environment.  All of this is an oral based 
tradition.  It is not a science based tradition.  Giving that 
equal weight is a bold move under CEPA.  We encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A huge group of aboriginal people have been taken out of the 
definition.  The Metis have been overlooked under the Indian Act, 
under the land claims and again under this bill. It would have 
been an opportunity for them to contribute to the betterment of 
our environment.  We wanted to raise that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment that was soundly defeated last night was the 
protection of our children.  We asked that CEPA consider the 
child specific reviews, studies and assessments of the toxic 
impact on our children in the school yards, at the beaches, in 
the parks, in the many shopping malls and playgrounds they 
frequent.  These are child specific areas. We asked that 
Environment Canada and Health Canada specifically study what 
impacts those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child's growth is more vulnerable than that of an adult with 
an immune system that is well in tact.  Children are still 
developing and toxins such as endocrine disrupters impact on 
them. If they are exposed at the wrong time at the wrong place 
the effects could be detrimental.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public participation is certainly a big section in this bill, 
but the public right to know and the public right to sue have 
been watered down because of industry's interests of cost 
effectiveness. If any toxins were released into our environment, 
the minister would have to prove the industry had knowingly 
polluted before she could publicly sue.  In terms of a loophole 
somebody could simply say that they did not know they were 
polluting. That would eliminate all the laws put forward in CEPA. 
“I did not know I was polluting” could be a statement of 
defence that would let every polluter off the hook.  Any cost 
recovery required by the minister would not carry any weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of biotechnology was highlighted in the bill.  Under 
the committee process we empowered the environment and health 
ministers to take effective decisions on biotechnology. It is a 
growing and very cautious industry.  It is also a very 
non-transparent industry.  Industry and government are at one end 
of the issue and the public and consumers are at the other end. 
Government has to protect the public and the consumers, not just 
the needs of industry.  We wanted the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of the Environment to look at the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of biotechnology we are going to be exposed to 
organisms that have been altered genetically in our food, in our 
environment, in our bodies.  The wish of the industry lobby all 
along has been to have these issues considered and the decisions 
made by the governor in council. Then industry would have a small 
group of people to lobby.  The cabinet ministers are a small 
group and they would be an easy target, but to lobby the 301 MPs 
in this House is too much of a task. This parliament has lost its 
power by giving the governor in council too much decision making 
on biotechnology which is a growing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the whole issue of the governor in council and the 
industry lobby, the precautionary principle was a major concern 
for industry.  I quote from the section on cost effectiveness: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill generally incorporated the notion of “cost 
effectiveness” in a number of sections (Administrative Duties, 
Information Gathering provisions and Pollution Prevention 
Planning provisions) and these references have been 
systematically deleted by the Parliamentary Committee.  The 
Committee has also introduced provisions into the Administrative 
Duties section ... that require the government to consider the 
benefits of taking environmental action, do not require it to 
consider the costs and even specify that if there are no benefits 
identified, this should not stand in the way of taking action. 
This creates an imbalance in the Bill that is inconsistent with 
the principles of sustainable development whereby environmental, 
economic and social considerations all have to be integrated. The 
original balance in the Bill needs to be restored by reinserting 
the previous references ... to actions having to be cost 
effective. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, parliamentarians, cost effective— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member intends to 
refer to Mr. Speaker rather than to ladies and gentlemen in his 
speech.  I know that was his intention and I would invite him to 
comply with the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am consumed by this 
emotional debate and I tend to forget to look at the Speaker. 
Sometimes it is Madam Speaker or Mr. Speaker and that is to whom 
I was referring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In highlighting the interest of cost effectiveness and balance 
we have to look at the beneficial side.  Some of the initiatives 
taken under the precautionary principle can lack scientific 
evidence and certainty.  We cannot balance everything through a 
cost effective screen.  We have to look at the beneficial screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the beneficial screens might be for children's health. 
It might be that the plastics in soothers or the nipples of 
bottles are not safe. 
This is a very small population compared to the adult population 
of the world.  However, if we do not look at the benefits of 
introducing measures for this small, susceptible subgroup, we 
cannot go forward and say that the sustainable development of the 
country and the world is protected under the bill.  Everything is 
measured under cost effectiveness and we cannot accept that.  We 
did not accept it last night and we are not prepared to accept it 
tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past week we have received evidence from the Commissioner 
of the Environment that the Liberal cabinet has taken the 
environment issue very lightly.  Since the 1993 election we have 
seen evidence of a decline in the program review of the 
Department of the Environment.  This department has gone from one 
of the top ten departments in the country to being one of the 
last.  Even ministers do not want to become the Minister of the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from what the new millennium should be.  We 
should be preparing the environment for the future of our 
children.  We should be empowering the Department of the 
Environment to be holistic in its cabinet affairs.  It should be 
part of the social caucus and economic caucus.  However, it is 
being shoved to the side and belittled every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are discussing the pesticide issue.  One of the major 
goals of the pesticide industry is to support and protect 
industry in the country.  However, its first goal should be to 
protect our health and our environment.  We cannot water down our 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all goes back to cost effectiveness.  If we put cost 
effective measures in the environmental bill nothing could take 
place.  We could end up with an economic disaster in the future 
if cost effective screens are not in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfriendly environmental lobby that has taken place in the 
last few days was certainly successful in getting the votes. 
However, I want to put on the record, for parliamentarians and 
Canadians, the letters that were submitted to us.  People can see 
that the changes made in the bill reflect the needs of industry 
not the needs of Canadians or the environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to final reading of Bill C-32, an act respecting 
pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and 
human health in order to contribute to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has come a long way from its first reading back on 
March 28, 1998 and I believe it faces a long road ahead in the 
Senate.  The environment and sustainable development committee 
spent eight months alone hearing witnesses and reviewing the 
proposed amendments in an attempt to improve the bill.  However, 
there is still a lot that can be done to make pollution 
prevention the cornerstone objective in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eleven years ago in 1988, the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act was first introduced by the Progressive Conservative 
government.  It was a significant part of our environmental 
record and part of over a decade of environmental progress from 
1984 to 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government promised “A Liberal government will lead 
in protecting the environment” in the red book, the truth of the 
matter is it has never had a plan to turn that promise into 
action.  This was empty election rhetoric coming from a party 
that no longer has any credibility on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken six long years to get this significant piece of 
environmental legislation to third reading.  It had to get there 
by invoking the dreaded debate killing, time allocation hammer, 
something the government has done 53 times since it has taken 
office in 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders what the Liberals are afraid to hear.  I have news 
for them.  There was no need to kill the debate.  The secret is 
already out.  Canadians already know the government does not 
intend to put consideration of the environment and human health 
first.  There is no need to pretend any more or to make any other 
promises.  The truth of the matter is that Canadians do not 
expect leadership on the environment from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's report tabled by the Commissioner of the Environment 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vision and leadership are the two essential ingredients for 
tackling environmental challenges that face the 
government...While Canada has demonstrated vision, it is failing 
in implementing it...The government is not keeping the promises 
it makes both Canadians and the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's lack of commitment to the environment is 
painfully obvious to Canadians.  Part of the problem is reflected 
in the cuts to the environment ministry budget and human 
resources.  It has gone from being the eighth largest department 
when the Progressive Conservative Party was in government to the 
smallest now of all 21 departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, our decade of governing is marked by significant 
progress on the environmental agenda.  We established a strong 
national voice for the environment and showed world leadership on 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment to remind Canadians what environmental 
progress really sounds like.  It was the government of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, the party of Tom MacMillan, 
Lucien Bouchard and Jean Charest, three consecutive environment 
ministers, which actually played a significant role with respect 
to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative's initiatives included developing 
international leadership known as the Montreal protocol.  This 
led to the international community signing an accord to eliminate 
or phase out ozone depleting gases.  Canada was a principle 
player in this 1987 accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives also eliminated lead in gasoline.  They signed 
an air quality accord with the Americans to control international 
air pollution.  Perhaps the achievement I am most proud of is the 
signing of an acid rain protocol with the Americans to ensure 
that factories located mainly in the United States do not 
contaminate the rivers, lakes and ponds located primarily in 
eastern Canada.  We did that by doing one initiative first:  we 
cleaned up our own act at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives also set up a UV advisory program.  They 
eliminated the excise tax on methanol and ethanol in blended 
fuels.  They signed a revised Great Lakes water quality agreement 
and introduced the first CEPA, the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  As the member for Davenport pointed out in 
committee, it was a pioneering bill in 1988.  It is the principle 
bill for control in the use of toxins in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the time we were in government the Prime Minister was 
once quoted saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At an unprecedented rate, we are stripping the earth of its 
forests, washing away its soil, creating vast deserts, 
eradicating untold species of plants and animals, despoiling our 
oceans and poisoning our skies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Elizabeth May, director of the Sierra Club of Canada, wrote an 
article on June 22 of last year saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years after he (Brian Mulroney) resigned as Prime Minister, 
I think of the amazing pace in environmental progress made by his 
government.  Those days are long gone.

year the following about the Liberals: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—with this sixth set of marks for performance by the federal 
government in meeting its Rio targets, it is clear that 
environmental issues have never been at such a low point on the 
political agenda. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now draw on the history of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  The original CEPA was a pioneering bill enacted 
to control the adverse effects of toxins in the environment; a 
concern first highlighted in Rachel Carson's thought provoking 
novel <I>A Silent Spring</I>. CEPA also included the need to 
review the bill and its effectiveness after five years.  This 
progress began in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first stage was an extensive review by the environment and 
sustainable development committee.  Its findings, detailed in a 
document entitled “It's about our Health”, reported 141 
recommendations for the government to consider in drafting the 
revised bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government responded in December 1996 with Bill C-74, a 
piece of legislation that was so flawed and raised so much 
controversy that the government elected to let it die on the 
Order Paper at the dissolution of parliament in 1997. 
Some individuals are concerned that this may actually be the fate 
of this particular bill should the House prorogue this fall.

is simply amazing that it has taken the government 11 years to 
get here and it still does not have the full support of the House 
for the bill.  I would like to point out that it does not even 
have the full support of its own caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was sent to committee, it had a possible record 
number of amendments put forward for discussion and debate.  Some 
400-plus proposed amendments were examined over a period of eight

pointed out, 560 amendments were actually tabled with respect to 
Bill C-32.  I will take the opportunity to point out to the 
parliamentary secretary that alarm bells should go off in 
people's heads.  If there are 560 amendments to a particular 
piece of legislation before we actually get a chance to review it 
clause by clause, maybe the bill is just a little bit more 
flawed.  If the parliamentary secretary wants to feed me a bit 
more information throughout my speech perhaps she can actually

chooses to be an asset to my remarks by saying there were 150 
government amendments.  After six years of being in government 
and two tries at actually doing the five year review of the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, what did the government 
have to do?  At the eleventh hour, 911 environmental management, 
it had to put another 150 amendments at the clause by clause 
stage.  I was actually shocked to hear about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years the government has not had one piece of 
environmental legislation.  It had two cracks at CEPA and it was 
still trying to amend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that you, Mr. Speaker, were paying attention last night 
when we voted on the report stage of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  Not only was the government doing 150 amendments 
at the clause by clause process, it was still adding more at the 
report stage.  I am shocked.  I do not know exactly what is going 
to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the amendments came from a number of individuals who 
are concerned about the environment.  We had an environmental 
coalition at committee in order to try to ratchet up the 
environmental protection aspects of the bill to protect the 
environment and human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to the members for Churchill River 
and Jonquière, critics from the NDP and the Bloc, who worked with 
the Progressive Conservative Party and some very devout, 
environmentally conscious members of the Liberal Party who sat on 
the committee.  Those individuals were the member for Davenport, 
the member for York North and the member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  I 
think Canadians should pay tribute to their personal sacrifices 
in that regard.  We know they took a fair amount of political 
heat from their own party members for their support in trying to 
ratchet up the protection aspects with respect to human health 
and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the review process I asked the Minister of Health if he 
supported the provisions in the bill which would enable him to 
control endocrine disrupters.  The parliamentary secretary said 
that I had prejudged the clause by clause process.  Perhaps at 
that time I had prejudged it.  Upon review, I may have actually 
had a bit of foresight in terms of what was going to happen at 
the clause by clause study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me is the fact that the parliamentary secretary 
responded to that particular question.  There are two co-sponsors 
of the bill:  the Minister of Health and the Minister of the 
Environment.  However, the Minister of Health chose not to 
respond to that very important question which indeed has human 
health aspects involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe for a minute that the Minister of the 
Environment, the member from Northumberland, and the government 
lack the political will to address the environmental concerns in 
terms of what we were trying to do at the committee and what her 
strong officials were trying to do at the departmental level. 
It is not her political will by any means.  I think it is the 
political will of the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Minister of Health did not respond to that 
question sends a signal to me.  He is a primary player in 
cabinet.  For him not to respond to that question, and to allow 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, 
who was quickly on her feet, to respond, makes me think, if he 
really is the co-sponsor of the bill, why would he not defend the 
quality of the bill with respect to human health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason, as most members of the House and the media have seen 
over the last number of weeks and months, is that this bill is 
under attack from all sides.  Whether they be environmentalists, 
concerned Canadians or industry advocates, this bill has made 
absolutely no one happy, especially before it went through the 
clause by clause process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the government made the Minister of the 
Environment bear the brunt of the political pressure on this 
issue all the way along.  The Minister of Health was absent and, 
to a large degree, the Prime Minister was absent as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday when the Prime Minister responded to my question in 
question period concerning the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, it was the first time he had stood to respond to a question 
with respect to this bill.  The members for Churchill River and 
Jonquière, as well as myself, have asked a number of questions 
with respect to this bill.  I know the critics for the Reform 
Party have asked questions, but still we have only had one 
response from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can do one thing for Canadians, we need to find more 
political support for the Minister of the Environment so that she 
will have more clout and more of her cabinet colleagues will pay 
attention to this very important file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never in my short time in elected office, in my lengthy 
parliamentary career of about 23 months, have I ever witnessed 
such flagrant attempts by the government to deny the 
parliamentary process the chance to operate and I hope I never 
see it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Louis, a former environment minister 
for the province of Quebec and a former parliamentary secretary 
to the minister of the environment, was repeatedly denied access 
as a voting member of the committee.  If we review the 
transcripts of the committee we will see that this situation came 
up time and time again.  He brought to the table a wealth of 
knowledge and experience, and the committee in many cases relied 
upon his wisdom and guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, during the excessive eight month period it became a 
challenge for the government to fill its needed nine committee 
seats with anybody but the member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  Other 
Liberal members used the clause by clause process to catch up on 
correspondence, read the newspaper and even take a nap.  It was 
the “anybody but the member for Lac-Saint-Louis campaign”, 
where even the government's deputy whip had to take her seat at 
the table when no other caucus members came forward to fill the 
much needed nine spots.  All the while the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis, rarely missing a meeting, was continuously told 
he could not participate.  He could participate in discussions 
only.  He could not move amendments.  It is obvious the 
government was afraid that his amendments might succeed in making 
significant improvements to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite those attempts, in some cases we succeeded in improving 
the bill.  The government is now obliged to gather information on 
endocrine disrupting substances.  This would not have been 
included in the act had it not been for the pressure placed on 
the government to recognize the harmful effects of these 
dangerous substances.  It was a small victory for the environment 
and human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that it was the definition of the 
member for Churchill River which was accepted under the 
information gathering clause of the bill.  It was his amendment, 
the amendments of the Progressive Conservative Party and those of 
the Bloc as well which challenged the government to put forward 
its own definition.  I am proud to say that it was the NDP 
definition that actually carried the day at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is how the political system is supposed to work. 
Something was left out of the bill, the opposition parties 
challenged the government to include something, and it was added. 
In that aspect I maintain a degree of faith in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is already a world leader in research on endocrine 
disrupting substances.  The strong definition and enshrined 
research clause that obligates the minister to act will set a new 
standard for other nations to measure against.  However, a 
significant shortcoming is that we have no means to ensure that 
the ministers will act upon any of their findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precautionary principle has now been institutionalized in 
the administrative duties section of the act.  This means that 
the minister will carry out his or her responsibilities in 
keeping with the precautionary principle where absence of clear 
science will no longer be a reason to postpone action. 
This was first included in the Rio declaration, a document our 
government fully endorsed in 1992.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act includes provisions allowing for civil suits. 
Individuals can now hold industries accountable for failing to 
abide by the law.  This is an initiative brought forward by the 
government and I applaud its initiative in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also includes provisions for pollution 
prevention plans, which was another initiative by the government, 
to challenge industries to ensure that their actions do not have 
a harmful effect on the environment and on human health.  This is 
a voluntary scheme that promotes pollution prevention by 
requiring certain industries to publish plans in order to curtail 
releases into the environment.  The affected industry is then 
left to find a workable solution to the problem.  If it does not, 
the minister is empowered to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pollution prevention plan is really a voluntary regulation. 
The government can say to industry “You know your industry 
better than we do.  We want you to control the releases that your 
process is causing”.  In that regard, if a pollution prevention 
plan does not do the job, the government is empowered to bring 
forth regulations.  It is a very valuable concept for the 
government to work in conjunction with industry, but industry 
must know that the government can act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, individuals who work in industry understand 
that it does not matter how much money they make because, 
ultimately, if we cannot drink the water, breathe the air or live 
in the environment, it does not make much sense.  Most industry 
officials subscribe to that concept, but it is up to us to ensure 
that we challenge them not to cheat in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the residual nature of the bill.  I 
would have preferred that the Minister of the Environment, the 
Minister of Health and one other minister would have the capacity 
to make a decision which would apply with respect to overlap and 
duplication as opposed to going to governor in council.  I think 
that would have been a better option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported the virtual elimination definition that was brought 
forth in Bill C-32 before the clause by clause consideration.  We 
thought it was a very workable definition.  It should not have 
been changed in the first place, but I am glad that we reverted 
to it last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our intention to support Bill C-32 tonight.  We think it 
augments what the 1988 CEPA did.  It is an improvement with 
respect to the precautionary principle, citizen suits, et cetera. 
However, having said that, there is still room for improvement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has 
made a number of claims which I could probably spend at least 10 
minutes refuting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated in his comments that pollution prevention under 
Bill C-32 would be voluntary, which of course he knows is 
incorrect; it would be on the authority of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also references Elizabeth May, who worked for a Conservative 
member, so that is always an interesting critique of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically he mentioned that this bill is not green enough.  I 
wonder how he can say that when he voted for some amendments and 
introduced other amendments at report stage which were not 
environmentally friendly.  How can the member stand and say that 
this bill is not green enough when he would have seen significant 
changes that would have altered this bill to make it less 
environmentally friendly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will address the last 
issue which the member brought up first, which concerns the 
amendments on virtual elimination.  I think those are the ones 
she is referring to. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government brought forth its own definition which 
did exactly the same thing and it supported its own amendment. 
It is already on side.  I hope the hon. member is not admitting 
that the government lacks environmental conscience in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to pollution prevention plans, I would say that she 
is 100% right.  They only come into play at the request of the 
minister, but it is a voluntary initiative whereby the minister 
can say “Hey, you guys tell us how you are going to clean up 
your act.  If you don't, we will do it by regulation”.  I did 
not mean to say anything different in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elizabeth May, who is a leader of the Sierra Club, has not 
necessarily been the Conservatives' best advocate, but she has 
pointed out that when she compares our record to their record, 
there is no contest.  Ours wins every time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member made quite a point of saying that this process has 
been undemocratic and that the procedure followed by the 
committee was undemocratic.  I think he is a person who would 
advocate justice, ensuring that the decisions which are made are 
based on rational, good, solid scientific evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said something to the effect that this bill does 
not require, in every instance, a basis on scientific fact.  On 
what basis would risk assessment take place if, in fact, it is 
not required that it be based on science?  Is he suggesting that 
perhaps certain political, capricious or spurious reasons could 
be introduced to declare something to be environmentally 
damaging?  What would be the basis on which a risk assessment 
would be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has 
brought forth a very constructive question.  This is an issue on 
which members of his party and our party do not exactly agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do agree on this issue, that science should be what drives 
the decision making process as to whether a government should act 
in a particular circumstance.  Science should be number one. 
However, when the science is headed in a very clear direction, 
and when we think that the use of a particular toxin or a 
particular process is causing harm to the environment or human 
health, the government should not have to wait for the last 
<I>i</I> to be dotted or the last <I>t</I> to be crossed before 
taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not necessarily agree on that particular point.  We 
support the precautionary principle.  If there is doubt, the 
government should be concerned with the environment and human 
health first before every <I>i</I> is dotted and every <I>t</I> is 
crossed.  The government supports that concept, as do we.  The 
Progressive Conservatives support that concept, as well as the 
NDP and the Bloc.  With respect, I invite my friend from the 
Reform Party to embrace that aspect of the precautionary 
principle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to raise a couple of questions.  One deals with the 
beginning of the act and the other with the end of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member how he could support the bill as it 
is. At the beginning of the bill, the preamble, which was amended 
last night, removes the phase-out period for toxic chemicals. 
The hon. member knows that highly toxic chemicals in this country 
do not require virtual elimination, they need to be phased out. 
The world is working toward that, but Canada will not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of his remarks he talked about democratic integrity 
and that the integrity of the standing committee should be 
respected.  It was not when all of these amendments were passed 
last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, at the end of the bill it states that the next review 
could be done exclusively by a Senate committee.  I do not know 
if he understood that last amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phase-out aspect and the review this of bill are very 
crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is a shame that 
the term “phase-out” was taken out of the preamble of the bill. 
We support the concept of virtual elimination.  Having said 
that, the intent, the language and the spirit of the bill must 
embrace the concept that those most toxic substances that exist 
should not exist.  When we are considering PCBs, DDT and those 
sorts of things, we need to empower the government to be able to 
completely phase-out those kinds of substances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we use is a risk based system.  That is how we manage 
our toxins.  We need to embrace the concept of virtual 
elimination as long as we are challenging industry on an ongoing 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word phase-out primarily addresses, as the member for 
Churchill River knows, issues such as POPs.  We should not send a 
negative signal in that regard.  It was an excessive reaction to 
a concern of industry.  It was concerned that the virtual 
elimination concept could be changed in that regard.  The 
minister should have the power in certain circumstances to make a 
call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the humanitarian review of CEPA, whether it is 
done in the Senate or the House my biggest concern is the fact 
that it be done in a timely manner.  We are reviewing CEPA 88 in 
1999, some 11 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised another issue with respect to the Senate.  I 
categorically support an elected Senate in every way, shape and 
form.  The concern of many Canadians is that by allowing only the 
Senate to review something, it is being given to an unelected 
body.  Until we have an elected Senate we actually water down the 
credibility of any parliamentary review which takes place, 
despite the fact that the senators engaged in the issue may be 
making a very valuable contribution on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alarm bells go off when it is given to an unelected body, 
which is something the country is ready to address and should 
address well into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
to advise the House that throughout this debate Liberal members 
will be splitting their time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are in the final hours of a four-year debate on Bill 
C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time has come to pass a final and overall judgment on a 
bill, there are two ways to go about it: compare the proposed 
legislation to the most desirable ideal legislation, or compare 
the proposed legislation to the current act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first instance, obviously there is a tendency to bemoan 
the fact that such or such an amendment was not passed because 
it would have improved the bill. In the latter, the question is 
whether the bill before us contains enough improvements to 
justify its being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not keep members guessing any longer. I am one of those 
who will support Bill C-32 because, in my view, it represents a 
marked improvement over our current environmental act, despite a 
few uncertainties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-32's renewal of our fundamental 
environmental act, it goes beyond pollution control, focusing 
essentially on its prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes direct aim at toxic substances through the virtual 
elimination of those most harmful to the environment and health. 
It focuses on the cautionary principle. It sets out a tighter 
and more efficient process for the evaluation and management of 
toxic substances. Also it improves the control of pollutants and 
certain waste categories. 
It strengthens enforcement of the act by giving public servants 
the same authority as a peace officer, fostering and encouraging 
public participation, and better protecting whistleblowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the bill deals more adequately with new realities such 
as biotechnology and long-overlooked historical realities, namely 
our relations with native peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the original Canadian Environmental Protection Act was 
passed in 1988, our vision of the environment has become broader 
and richer. 
We have entered the sustainable development era or, more 
specifically, a time devoted to the research and development of 
an integrated management model for our habitat and resources, 
which will gradually enable us to integrate environmental 
concerns into our economic and social decisions both 
domestically and internationally.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, Bill C-32 is a real step forward, as witness the 
fact that the environment and health ministers will no longer 
have sole responsibility for the quality of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other ministers, and often cabinet itself, will to have 
to appreciate the importance of a number of complex situations affecting 
exports, international air and water pollution, aquaculture and 
biotechnology.  This sharing of responsibilities is the only 
hope for the long term success of government management of 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the bill creates a framework that 
will allow the federal government not only to exercise its 
public health responsibilities but also to strengthen the 
necessary co-operation with other levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains dozens of clauses requiring the federal 
government to consult its partners, but it also provides that, 
after two months, the government must act in the public interest 
with respect to pollution problems, which cannot wait for the 
Canadian constitution to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has listened to a series of speeches from the Bloc 
Quebecois suggesting that the federal government is bulldozing 
over everything in its path with respect to the environment, 
when what it is in fact doing is negotiating with the provinces 
harmonization agreements that Quebec is refusing to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear the Bloc Quebecois tell it, the federal government 
should not be allowed to exercise its research, planning and 
regulatory responsibilities.  It should not be allowed to draw 
up a list of priority substances, or a national inventory of 
toxic substances, or take action with respect to exports, 
biotechnology, aquaculture, fuel, and so on and so forth, 
without the agreement of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, there is a consensus.  Environmental issues 
require increasingly close co-operation between countries but, if 
we are to believe the leading lights in the Bloc Quebecois, 
interprovincial boundaries and constitutional arguments here in 
Canada would take precedence over our primary responsibility, 
which is to manage our habitat safely for our own good and for 
the good of our descendants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am pleased that Bill C-32 provides a framework that 
will allow the federal government to exercise sound leadership 
in a spirit of active co-operation, not sterile discussions and 
apathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned that Bill C-32 also raised some 
uncertainties, which I want to discuss. I am taking this 
opportunity to emphasize the tremendous work of my Liberal 
colleagues who sit on the standing committee, and also the 
positive contribution made by several members of the opposition, 
who showed great tenacity regarding these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues include the following: What would be the 
effectiveness of the very complex procedure governing the 
establishment of the priority list? Will the Minister of the 
Environment have the necessary resources to do his job within the 
prescribed timeframe? What will be the true priority given to the 
prevention of pollution control in the strategy to enforce the 
act? What will be the true priority given to the principle of 
caution when facing partially unknown situations? Will the use of 
cost effective measures make the situation so complicated  that 
it will prevent the required actions from being taken? What will 
be the strategy of the industry lobby: will it fight tooth and 
nail or will it try to find ways to make businesses more 
environmentally friendly, while also making them more profitable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the government, there are also questions that need to be 
asked: will the Ministers of the Environment and Health be given 
any more support by their economic colleagues in cabinet?  Will 
those colleagues have an enhanced sense of responsibility as far 
as our resources are concerned, both economically and 
internationally? Finally, will the provinces really co-operate? 
Will the public reap the benefit of the new means at its 
disposal and require all the transparency and stringency of 
application this renewed legislation needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all questions the bill does not, and cannot, provide 
answers for. 
These are questions that time and people of good faith will 
answer.  People like ourselves, in their businesses, in their 
roles as elected representatives at other levels, in their roles 
as public servants, or merely as enlightened and critical 
citizens, will decide that environmental management is a true 
priority and that it is worthwhile pursuing a societal model 
with sustainable bases and perspectives.

Environment for successfully bringing this bill to maturity.  I

drafting and passage of this bill, whether behind the scenes or 
in more public roles.

listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say. I 
think I missed a small part of what he said about the matter of 
the responsibility of ministers other than the Minister of the 
Environment, and I think he mentioned the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for my information, could he revisit that section of his 
remarks to give us some idea of the roles of ministers other than 
the Minister of the Environment in the legislation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, it concerns instances in the 
bill where decision making power will not rest with the Minister 
of the Environment and the Minister of Health, the two sponsors 
of the bill, but will be transferred to cabinet, which will have 
to assess a number of complex situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when the time comes to reach agreements on the 
export of substances or dangerous waste with other countries, 
cabinet will have the final say. It is also true that there are 
issues relating to air pollution, internationally, when there 
are sources of pollution on both sides of the border. There are 
also issues involving international water pollution, binational 
water pollution in our case, by Canada and the United States. 
Here again cabinet will have to decide on the scope of 
agreements and of the measures to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in the area of aquaculture. If the government 
feels that other laws protect the environment sufficiently, the 
Minister of the Environment, at that point, does not have to 
intervene. This applies as well to biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain complex issues causing responsibility for 
environmental management by the government to be shared among a 
number of ministers. I know that some see this as a weakness, a 
potential source of conflict, misunderstanding, delay and 
blockage. This should be examined. I mentioned it in the series 
of questions I raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, if management of the environment is to take 
place within the perspective of sustainable development, all 
ministers dealing with these economic or international matters 
must themselves assume responsibility, which involves their 
staff and their department, for including environmental concerns 
in their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not then be just the Minister of the Environment or the 
Minister of Health, who would alone bear responsibility for the 
environment. Little by little, it would become a concern of 
cabinet as a whole. I gave this example as an illustration, I 
believe that this puts us on the road to sustainable development 
over the years. It will not be easy, but it is definitely the 
right road.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member on taking an active role through the 
whole review process.  He was there and saw the evolution of the 
past year in what we have before us today at third reading.  He 
made the bold statement that we do not have a perfect bill. 
Unfortunately that is what this process has created.  He also 
highlighted the fact that the bill was an improvement to the 
existing CEPA bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before we departed on the journey of reviewing Bill C-32, 
the standing committee indicated that enforcement of existing 
CEPA laws was very much in question, that the enforcement of 
existing laws lacked financial and human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on the enforcement of the bill 
which includes additional responsibilities and additional duties? 
Does he see the need for a major improvement to be made in terms 
of additional resources required for the enforcement of this law?

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my NDP colleague for 
asking how the legislation we are passing will be enforced, a 
question that concerns us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the committee, we all signed a report pointing out 
the weaknesses in the enforcement of certain aspects of the 
existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the challenge of vigorous and rigorous enforcement, there 
are two concerns I wish to share with with the hon. member. 
First of all, the legislation must assign powers and provide for 
enforcement and, in addition, the government must set aside 
appropriate funding in the budget for the Minister of the 
Environment to enforce the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates more favourable conditions by allowing 
enforcement officers to perform the duties of peace officers and 
to issue summonses, as required, when they come across 
unacceptable situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is more encouragement for ongoing public vigilance 
with respect to enforcement.  Ultimately, this holds out the 
most promise.  There are also additional measures to protect 
whistleblowers. So much for the legal angle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves the financial considerations.  The last two budgets 
set aside increased amounts for the Minister of the Environment 
to assume her responsibilities with respect to the analysis of 
toxic substances. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak and to ask a few questions 
about several areas that I find rather puzzling in relation to 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one that comes to mind has to do with investing 
millions of dollars in toxic research when the legislative 
vehicle provided by parliament sputters on three cylinders, 
panting along in a veritable obstacle race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition offers an interesting benchmark for 
analysing the bill.  Why would the official opposition support 
the bill?  Why is it that a regional party like the Reform, with 
no base in Ontario, Quebec and eastern Canada, would support the 
bill?  Is the Reform Party likely to support a bill strong on 
pollution prevention, strong on the elimination of toxic 
substances and strong on the definition of inherent toxicity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions for those who do not know the complex and 
technical bill that is passing through the Chamber right now.  It 
is to them that these questions are directed.  The political 
decision of Reform today to support the bill gives a clue to the 
real value of the bill as amended last night.  The Reform 
position, I submit, was written by industry, the very industry 
the bill is supposed to control through pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people claim that Bill C-32 will put Canada on the leading 
edge of environmental protection law worldwide.  This claim and 
other claims need to be examined closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much celebration of the fact that Bill C-32 places 
strict deadlines on the government to act to protect the 
environment and human health from toxic substances, namely three 
and a half years after a substance is determined to be toxic. 
Such determination alone may take many years and because of 
certain amendments adopted last night is likely to take longer. 
Even when action is taken it may be in the form of voluntary 
codes or other soft actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be trumpeting that the strict deadlines will 
result in strict controls or bans.  As for virtual elimination 
the claim that Canada is the first country to take the action of 
virtual elimination should also be considered very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we tried to make it as strong as possible, but 
following last night's report stage amendments the definition is 
a far cry from the original intention of the committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the intervention of industry there is no guarantee 
under the bill that virtual elimination would achieve zero or 
near zero emissions.  There is no requirement to push toward that 
desired result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What comfort is it to Canadians if toxic chemicals get 
catalogued and assessed but not necessarily eliminated?  All Bill 
C-32 can do for Canadians is reduce, perhaps one day, the release 
of toxic substances to a certain level but not necessarily to 
zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another claim to be examined is that nine of the dirty dozen 
toxic substances so far slated for virtual elimination have been 
dealt with.  When Canadians hear this claim, they would expect 
that these substances have been banned or at least their use 
severely limited by regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People hearing this claim in the context of CEPA might also 
expect that the substances have been dealt with under CEPA, 
especially since CEPA is often called Canada's cornerstone 
legislation for environmental protection.  In fact, the use of 
some of these substances has been voluntarily discontinued by the 
manufacturer.  In other cases the substance is regulated not 
under CEPA but under the Pest Control Products Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 could have been a reasonably good law.  Yet it is 
still a far cry from the red book promise on page 66 of the 1993 
document which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a new approach that focuses on preventing pollution 
at source.  Timetables must be set for phasing out all use of the 
most persistent toxic substances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from the commitment in 1993.  As I said, the 
bill could be a reasonably good one if the improvements made in 
committee had not been dismantled at the report stage; if 
business interests had not been put ahead of public health; if 
the official opposition had performed an effective role, which it 
did not; and if at the last minute, after the committee had 
reported to the House, cabinet ministers had not circumvented the 
good work of the committee by introducing last minute changes not 
examined in committee as in the case of nutrients and had not 
eliminated strong provisions thoroughly endorsed by the standing 
committee as in the case of inherent toxicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end what prevailed is the agenda of industry and of the 
Reform Party which is clearly in the pocket of industry.  One 
just needs to look at its amendments or read its speeches at 
report stage and today to see the Reform's determination to 
ingratiate itself to industry with the next election in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the Reform performance on Bill C-32 and its strict 
adherence to the pressure of corporate lobbyists, an interesting 
question arises on whether our electoral law should continue to 
allow corporate donations to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the member for Nanaimo—Alberni said 
in his speech yesterday that Canadians should be concerned about 
managing toxic substances, not preventing their use.  What a 
great commitment to the status quo.  The member's pronouncement 
reflects letters from industry lobby groups to MPs a few weeks 
ago, which we all received and must have noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me say that we missed many opportunities to 
have a strong bill.  We had strong articulation of the 
precautionary principle.  It was defeated.  We offered a strong 
vehicle for the Minister of the Environment to prevent pollution 
in the growing agriculture industry.  It was defeated.  We 
strived for a strong fast track for dealing with inherently toxic 
substances.  It was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed strong provisions allowing the Minister of the 
Environment to protect the environment and human health arising 
from the expanding biotechnology sector.  That opportunity was 
lost.  We proposed an assurance that federal ministers of the 
environment and health could act quickly, where necessary, 
unimpeded by federal-provincial political considerations.  It was 
defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed an assurance that the ministers could act quickly, 
where necessary, unimpeded by economic scare-mongering by 
industry lobbies and the Reform Party, unimpeded by members of 
cabinet with economic and not environmental mandates.  That was 
also defeated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we have this bill at third reading.  It could have 
been a reasonably good law.  It could have been a strong piece of 
legislation for the next 10 years.  It could have put health 
ahead of industrial interest.  It could have put the public 
interest ahead of investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most regrettable part of this entire debate is that somehow 
we conceptually fell into the trap of believing that we could not 
have strong environmental legislation at the same time as a 
healthy economy.  We were somehow distracted by the belief 
initiated and well promoted by lobby groups that we could have 
only one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the major drawback which has somehow been in the way of 
the committee's work and in the way of parliament achieving the 
kind of legislation of which we could be proud for the next 
decade in relation to the prevention of pollution as written in 
the title of the bill and in relation to the protection of human 
health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the position of the member for Davenport on the bill is 
obviously not being substantiated by many people in the House and 
across the country.  He is taking a minority position.  In his 
arguments he is bringing forward to us the idea that it is the 
Reform Party's problem and the Reform Party's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree the bill was put forward by the Liberal government 
and is being passed by a majority vote in the Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second question which gets down to the technicalities 
of the bill and concerns discussions about scientifically based 
decision making.  We have to be clear that international trade 
and issues dealing with pesticides are based on science only. The 
Europeans are denying beef access into Europe on a non-scientific 
basis.  Health Canada has denied rBST on a non-scientific basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on whose bill it is and clarify that it 
is in fact a government bill?  It takes government members to 
make sure there is a majority to get it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he also clarify that the bill is purely based on 
scientific decision making with regard to toxic substances?  The 
bill provides for a national ban on substances banned in other 
provinces or industrialized countries.  This abandons risk 
assessment as the basis for priorization and chemical control 
when it is the standard accepted internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the bill not undermine the necessity of requiring science 
based decision making? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake is asking two questions, each of which would 
require a considerable amount of time to answer.  I will try to 
start with the second one by saying that science is clearly 
ultimate in its conclusions and gives to humans on the planet the 
ultimate answer, the conclusive answer upon which we connect the 
laws of gravity, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a realm of science that covers a field in which there 
is no absolute certainty, for example the case of heavy metals 
where science cannot give us the ultimate answer.  This is why 
the precautionary principle was invented some time ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned over time particularly when it comes to toxic 
substances that have the potential capacity to damage human 
health and the ecosystem, that it is preferable to act when 
science is not completely conclusive on the assumption that it is 
better to act earlier rather than wait to see the smoking gun. 
This is as well as I can answer the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the other question which is a very legitimate one which I 
welcome, of course we know who proposed the bill.  We also know 
the role of the official opposition.  It opposes almost 
everything in the House and votes against almost every bill that 
comes through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is so important in relation to the corporate and the 
industrial world. Why is it that the official opposition finds it 
possible to support this bill in contrast to its traditional 
attitude and role of opposing it, which is part of the way 
parliament is designed?  Why did members of the official 
opposition propose amendments at report stage which were 
virtually word for word the same amendments proposed by the 
government?  Why is there this desire and readiness on the part 
of the official opposition not to oppose this measure but to 
support it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a very legitimate question. I hope the hon. 
member will reflect upon why his party and the Conservative Party 
have decided to support this measure the way that it is now, 
having dismantled the work of the committee at the report stage 
under pressure by industry and lobbyists here in Ottawa. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Surrey 
Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-32, an 
act regarding pollution prevention, protection of the environment 
and human health in order to contribute to sustainable 
development in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though other concerns have replaced the environment at the top 
of Canadians' list of issues, I am sure we will all agree that 
the environment will always be a serious matter across the 
political spectrum both federally and provincially.  Canadians 
who are unfortunately the most prolific users of water can be 
called upon to do the right thing to clean up and protect that 
resource.  They look to governments to provide leadership in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like recycling and conservation efforts in solid waste 
management, Canadians have shown themselves to be responsible, 
concerned and enthusiastic.  However, I do not think they have 
much respect for big buck, one size fits all, government imposed 
solutions that feature the federal government competing against 
and overriding provincial and local initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Reform Party have dispelled the notion that 
our party does not care about the environment and have made it 
very clear that successful programs to clean up the environment 
and keep it that way have to use a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As on so many issues that have a direct impact on the citizens 
of the country, the idea that one party or philosophy is against 
and their opposite numbers are for a certain item is simplistic 
and outdated.  There is nobody here in the House or in the 
country who is for dirty water or dirty air, or somehow in favour 
of the chemicals in our food and in our soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my corner of the country we struggle daily to grow the best 
quality food to feed Canadians and the world.  We are more than 
aware that water is a precious resource.  We are also aware that 
many government initiatives meant to clean up or control problems 
simply end up making things worse or creating new ones.  That is 
why we look at these massive bills and all their amendments very 
carefully. Quite often it is more important to put the right 
system in place than to have no system at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of this bill suggests that all the elements are here 
to address this issue properly.  But titles, like book covers, do 
not always tell what is inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act is meant to address prevention of pollution and that is 
a noble effort by all measures.  It would make our job so much 
easier if we had been successful in regulating chemical use in 
the past.  We want to protect the environment and human health 
which cannot be more important.  Then we see a reference to 
sustainable development which has become a bit of a political 
football between industry and environmental lobbyists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have successful legislation, we believe that all these 
elements must be included and that they must be addressed in a 
balanced manner. One way to do this is to ensure that what 
regulators and industry have at their disposal is good science.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen with the health protection branch that when big 
money interests combine with butt-covering bureaucracy the result 
is often the political use of science on a selective basis and 
the undermining of credibility for the whole process. When we are 
dealing with chemicals used for industrial and agricultural 
purposes, we have the potential for the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With billions of dollars at stake, it is vital that players on 
both sides and the consumers who have to live with the 
consequences are confident that the process of identifying, 
regulating and approving substances be open and accountable. As 
with the tax system, when producers and consumers lose confidence 
they resort to avoidance and to reactions that might make 
problems worse rather than better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no better when we have a powerful lobby on one side or the 
other.  The perception that big industry has government in its 
pocket is contradicted when environmentalists step up to the 
plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a few years ago when there was a panic in the U.S 
about the chemical alar.  This was sprayed on apples and other 
orchard fruit to keep them on the branch longer.  I am sure the 
developers of the chemical felt they had a good thing.  The fruit 
would be better developed and more nutritious the longer it grew 
on the tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody sets out to invent a chemical to cause human cancer but 
before long there were scientific tests that suggested that is 
what that chemical did.  Very quickly there was a panic. Millions 
of mothers stopped buying apples and a year's crop had to be 
destroyed at a loss of billions of dollars to the producers. 
Farmers in the American northwest were devastated and it took 
years to get their customers back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the so-called scientific basis for this panic?  Like 
saccharin just a few years earlier, doses of alar so high that a 
child would virtually have to eat the stuff by the plateful were 
fed to rats until they developed tumours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of a clause inserted in the Environmental Protection Act 
in the 1950s, any chemical that even hinted that it had anything 
to do with an illness of any sort had to be banned.  It did not 
matter that the chemical had to be ingested by the truckload, it 
was just enough that one rat in a hundred seemed to get sick as a 
result. Saccharin by the way is back on the market, although it 
will never catch up to some of the other products after its 
fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody might say “If it was your kid being saved, you might 
think it was worthwhile to ban certain chemicals before they got 
going”.  Maybe, if anybody could ever pin down exactly what the 
relationship was between any one chemical and any given illness 
or combination of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are tens of thousands of chemicals in the 
environment.  This fact is one reason for updating CEPA through 
Bill C-32.  We should also be aware though that there are 
millions of natural chemicals everywhere we look.  Just because 
they are from nature does not make them benign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco for instance does not contain nicotine for human 
enjoyment.  It is in fact a pesticide produced by the plant 
itself to ward off certain organisms.  Try as we might to tell 
people of the terrible damage that this chemical and the hundreds 
of others found in tobacco smoke can do to their health, millions 
still light up daily.  From that billions of dollars go to 
governments and multinational companies which shows what we are 
really up against here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be balanced to simply take the so-called right to smoke 
away from people?  There are plenty of non-smokers who might like 
to go that route.  But prohibition usually leads to increased use 
rather than the intended results, and governments would be forced 
to pay for an anti-smoking campaign at the same time as they were 
missing out on all those excise revenues they have come to enjoy. 
I am not suggesting that tobacco is a good example for Bill C-32; 
it is just an example of the jumble of health and economic issues 
that comes with most human activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider what to do about thousands of chemicals, we 
cannot assume that blanket prohibition based on an agenda driven 
science and backed by the arbitrary powers of ministerial orders 
in council will be the answer to environmental problems.  We need 
only look at the recent MMT fiasco to see where this leads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auto industry did not want MMT.  Some lobby groups did not 
want MMT.  But the producer of that chemical claimed to have 
extensive evidence that MMT was not the bogeyman it was made out 
to be. Millions of tax dollars later, the member for Hamilton 
East has another blunder on her record and the public is no 
closer to knowing whether or not there is anything wrong with 
this gasoline additive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are other gas additives out there that deserve 
closer scrutiny as well.  There are environmentalists who would 
approve of banning the use of gasoline altogether.  But unless we 
line up industry, consumers, scientists and regulators into a 
co-operative open system of examining chemicals and the processes 
that they are used in, the system will not work.  It will break 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may think it is good enough to put arbitrary powers in the 
hands of a minister, but ministers can be influenced by powerful 
friends.  We may think it is enough to hire scientists to do 
studies, but we have to be clear about what we are asking our 
scientists to look for and who is funding those results.  We may 
think it is good enough to shut down agriculture or industry 
because a few are not being responsible, but the suffering 
throughout the economy would be enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Bill C-32 we still have disagreements about who is 
responsible for what.  Industry hates uncertainty, and yes, that 
is important.  Empirical studies indicate economic prosperity 
leads to a cleaner environment. 
When there is a profit to invest in better processes, there is 
less pollution, less waste.

transmission systems that do not leak water at the rates we see 
in many jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and industry need profits to research and develop 
new products and technologies that will be more efficient. Anyone 
who thinks profit is a dirty word should think twice about what 
they are asking Canadian businesses to do or do without.  We all 
want to clean up the environment and we should all have input 
into how that is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I will be voting in favour of Bill C-32 with some 
caution.  The version of the bill that went to committee we feel 
was on the right track.  We want to see an environmental regime 
that reflects a multiparty approach to environmental issues. Ask 
all the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can leave a cleaner country to our grandchildren than the one

greatest good for the greatest number and a tradition of open 
participation and involvement of all the stakeholders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with considerable interest to what the member had to 
say.  I may not have heard correctly but it seemed to me that he 
suggested that the auto industry was opposed to the banning of 
MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My recollection is that it was quite the reverse. The auto 
industry was very concerned not only about the environmental 
effects of MMT but also about the effects of MMT on the 
diagnostic equipment which is now a part of every modern 
automobile.  That is the equipment which monitors the emissions 
to the atmosphere of everything that the car produces. If in fact 
MMT is damaging those diagnostic parts of the vehicle, a vehicle 
could in fact be polluting tremendously without the owner knowing 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I misheard but it seemed to me the member suggested that 
the automobile industry did not want to ban MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
clarification.  I did say the auto industry was against MMT, not 
for it, because of the diagnostic problems that would result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this morning it was a nice revelation to hear that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment said 
she knew the difference between not environmentally friendly 
amendments and environmentally friendly amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member know the difference between environmentally 
friendly amendments to this bill and not environmentally friendly 
amendments?  How many environmentally friendly amendments were 
proposed by his party?  They certainly did not succeed in 
supporting the amendments that we hoped would have strengthened 
the bill.  On the issue of phase-out that was deleted last night 
in the amendments, is the hon. member aware that the most toxic 
substances in the country should have been a priority in the bill 
and the amendments were deleted by the way his party voted last 
night? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was said earlier, I 
believe by the member for Churchill River, that this bill is not 
perfect and we certainly agree with that. As I said in my speech, 
we will be supporting the bill with caution.  We would still like 
to see some changes.  We would like to see further things done. 
This is an ongoing debate and it will be an ongoing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest thing we need to see in any legislation like this is 
balance.  Let us look at what the stakeholders are involved with. 
We saw that with the economic impact Kyoto had in my part of the 
country and the uncertainty that it creates for industry and so 
on.  Industry is what creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about environmental impacts we have to look at the 
economic environment and the impact on that as well.  There has 
to be balance in everything we do.  Right now a lot of the 
chemical companies and so on are almost in limbo waiting to see 
what is going to happen with this legislation.  Certainly they 
lobbied hard to keep the status quo in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some cases where things need to be changed and others 
where we need to take a more moderate phase-in approach as the 
member has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the actions in the reports must be based on scientific 
reports, not politics.  That is the basis where we are coming 
from.  It has to be a balanced approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has 
raised the issue of MMT. I would hope he would recognize that 
action taken previously on MMT was not under CEPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science will demonstrate the risks. Environment Canada is doing 
research on MMT at the University of Montreal with Professor 
Zayed.  We have the power to regulate fuels within this bill, I 
believe it is in section 140.  With the good CEPA that is being 
proposed today, we can do more on the fuels area. The Canadian 
Vehicle Manufacturers Association supported the changes that were 
being made in this area so we could do more. Does the member 
opposite recognize this fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again we would have to go 
back to having anything to do with products like MMT based on 
scientific fact, not on public uproar fueled by all the 
stakeholders.  It has to be a balanced approach. The idea that it 
can be regulated through CEPA is good.  It gives us an avenue we 
can work through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, there is a lot we can support in this bill 
but let us proceed with caution and revisit this as often as we 
need to in order to make it a better piece of legislation over 
the years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak to Bill 
C-32, the government's review of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, CEPA in short. Before I go any further I would 
like to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Battlefords—Lloydminster on the excellent speech he delivered 
in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 139 of the act requires a five year mandatory review of 
the administration of the act.  The review we are debating today 
began in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of Bill C-32 is to protect the environment and 
human health.  This legislation provides measures for the 
protection of the environment and human health, pollution 
prevention, management of toxic substances, virtual elimination 
of the release of the most dangerous substances and partnerships 
to achieve the highest level of environmental quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA replaces and incorporates several previously existing acts 
such as the Environmental Contaminants Acts, the Ocean Dumping 
Control Act, the Clean Air Act and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 regulates the use of toxic chemicals by industry.  It 
controls the importation, sale and disposal of dangerous 
chemicals including PCBs, dioxins and ozone depleting substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act was intended to fill regulatory gaps in certain 
environmental matters, for example toxic substances.  The act was 
also aimed at enabling Canada to fulfill international 
obligations. Bill C-32 is very complex and deals with aspects of 
pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports realistic measures that protect the 
environment and balance environmental concerns with economic 
concerns.  Reform believes that environmental considerations must 
carry equal weight with economic, social and technical 
considerations in the development of a project.  This is key to 
protecting our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes in public consultation, public participation and 
public commitment.  Governments must work together to ensure our 
environment is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-32 was introduced in the House of Commons we were 
pleased to note many changes had been made to improve the 
legislation compared to the bill that died on the Order Paper in 
the last parliament.  The previous bill reviewing CEPA was the 
Liberal government's attempt to do a five year review of CEPA and 
it failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over nine months the government's second attempt to review 
CEPA was under review by the Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development.  Over 400 amendments were tabled in 
committee.  Reform fought hard to maintain the original intent of 
the bill.  Over 100 amendments were passed which changed the bill 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need the tools for environmental protection. 
Amendments to this bill threaten to handicap Canadians with 
unrealistic and unworkable regulations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the key problems with the committee's amendments to 
Bill C-32?  This is the big question.  There are three main areas 
of concern.  One is ministerial power.  The Liberals want to give 
the minister too much autocratic power.  The second is science 
based decision making.  The Liberals are allowing politics to 
interfere with environmental decision making.  That is wrong. The 
third is a cost effective approach.  The Liberals have not been 
consistent in maintaining a cost effective approach to protecting 
our environment.  In fact, I do not think the concept of a cost 
effective approach exists on the benches on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 11 other areas of concern which follow after the 
committee amendments.  I will name only a few.  Among them are: 
pollution prevention planning; limitless power of ministers to 
interfere with exports; export of hazardous waste; environment 
emergency planning; and the precautionary principle.  All 
references to cost effectiveness in the bill have been removed. 
On the use of the word toxics the bill needs to focus on the 
management rather than the use of toxic substances. On residual 
powers, there are many areas of interdepartmental overlap and 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party put forward amendments to address all those 
areas of concern.  Canadians will support legislation that is 
practical and effective.  Canadians need the framework to provide 
for stability and economic feasibility.  Legislation must enhance 
our ability to improve environmental performance. Canadians must 
be able to implement sustainable development and remain 
competitive and profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach to the environment must be balanced. We need a 
strong healthy economy in order to take concrete action to 
protect our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports sustainable development which is human 
activity that combines economic, social and environmental 
considerations without compromising the well-being of existing 
and future generations. We support the rationalization of federal 
and provincial laws and the development of regional and/or 
national environmental standards where appropriate. We support 
the integration of social, environmental and economic objectives 
into Canada's environmental management, philosophy, structure, 
procedures and planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that strong federal leadership is needed for a 
commitment to sustainable development. This includes creating 
partnerships with provincial governments, private industry, 
educational institutions and the public in order to promote 
meaningful progress in the area of environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-32 we support the principle of 
establishing and regularly reviewing standards that are based on 
sound science and which are technologically, socially and 
economically viable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his comments on the bill.  I 
noticed my colleague talked about the need for sustainable 
development and how we in the Reform Party are very supportive of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is a new twist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  We hear quite a bit of chatter coming 
from the NDP, Mr. Speaker, but I am sure they will get up and 
make their comments in due course on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the hearings we had for the trade committee in Winnipeg the 
International Institute for Sustainable Development talked about 
some destructive policies that occur especially by the use of 
subsidies.  They said that can hurt our environment and hurt the 
drive for sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pointed to agricultural practices such as in the 
Netherlands and even in Canada where subsidies have had the 
negative effect of hurting the amount of topsoil in the last 100 
years. Half of our topsoil has been depleted as a result of 
practices largely encouraged by subsidies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about practices in the Amazon, in Holland and in 
Denmark in terms of how many nitrates go into the ground water as 
a result of the heavy subsidies that take place. The heavy use of 
nitrogen especially in agriculture practices because of the 
subsidies that are used to produce food in those countries is 
very destructive to our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague have any thoughts on how destructive these 
practices are and the need to get rid of subsidies and get back 
to a market economy rather than the use of subsidies as a way of 
dealing with things to help clean up our environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I highly appreciate the 
thoughtful question by the hon. member for Peace River.  He is 
innovative in his thinking and I always appreciate it when he 
asks intelligent questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development is a very important concept.  Whether it 
is in foreign aid, even in CIDA where we spend lots of money, we 
forget about the sustainable development part of it or the 
benefits we are able to retrieve.  Similarly on environment 
issues when subsidies are given to certain companies they 
lavishly spend them on fertilizers and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first degree is in agriculture.  That is my background. I 
understand the excessive use of these chemicals and how they 
imbalance the properties of the soil and their adverse 
environmental effects. I certainly agree with the hon. member for 
Peace River that this is a bad concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, sustainable development is a human activity that 
combines economic, social and environmental considerations 
without compromising the development of existing and future 
generations.  It is definitely our moral responsibility to take 
care of those things and hand over our environment and the planet 
to the next generation in the form that we got them.  That is our 
moral obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see all kinds of pollution taking place and all kinds of 
chemicals being leached into the water, into our streams and 
soil, and the air being polluted, it is a very important concept 
that we focus on sustainable development.  Whether it is 
subsidies or other factors, they should be well taken care of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we seem to be having a bit of a love-in today with members 
climbing on board the environmental wagon.  That is a good thing. 
Obviously the environment should transcend partisan lines and 
political differences so that we can pass legislation like Bill 
C-32 that will put some teeth into the areas of enforcement in 
dealing with toxic substances by giving the minister and the 
ministry the powers that are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat interesting though to hear members opposite 
criticize the bill from the point of view that it gives too much 
power to the minister or the ministry officials.  In question 
period they would be on their feet waxing somewhat indignantly 
demanding action and that someone do something.  There is a 
little bit of a contradiction there. However in the spirit that 
this debate seems to be exuding, I will try to stay away from 
those aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about a number of things.  It is about toxic 
substances, the testing, recognition and control of them, the 
planning on how to eliminate them and the damage they do to human 
health and to our ecology.  It is about air quality and water 
quality, things that are extremely important to all of us in our 
ridings and in our large urban communities. It is about enforcing 
and policing, which I think is long overdue, giving the 
appropriate authorities the tools they need to deal with people 
who violate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell stories about years gone by in Mississauga when 
certain chemical companies and others, and in fairness to them it 
was many years ago, were releasing some of their substances into 
the storm sewers. This was back in the days when I was on city 
council.  Downstream we had situations where people were 
panicking because there was foam bubbling up through the grates 
of the storm sewers. 
Kids were playing outside.  No one knew what it was; they were 
trying to figure it out.  Through the region of Peel we 
ultimately traced it back to the general area.  Even though in 
that particular case we were unable pinpoint the violator, we 
called a meeting of all industrial companies in the area to show 
them the damage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, I do not know if it was intentional, inadvertent or 
otherwise, but someone poured some substances into the storm 
sewer.  This can have a devastating impact downstream on all the 
creeks and streams in my community which ultimately lead into 
Lake Ontario, from which we draw our drinking water.  I should 
hasten to add that we put it through a cleansing system.  We do 
not drink it straight out of the lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of situation is extremely important.  It is important 
that we have a bill which gives the minister the authority to 
order some kind of planning by potential industrial polluters 
that could damage our water quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air quality is another issue I find quite interesting.  The 
solution to dealing with waste in our communities over the years 
in some instances has been to truck it out of the GTA into the 
Detroit market and put it in an incinerator, at which point it is 
burned and the prevailing winds bring it all back into Canada.  I 
am not sure that is a particularly intelligent way of dealing 
with waste disposal.  It is surely not an intelligent way of 
dealing with air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about pollution prevention and sustainable 
development, but before doing so I acknowledge the work by many 
members on both sides of the House.  I particularly want to say 
that we are all busy doing various things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role as an MP over the past several months has been to chair 
a task force on youth entrepreneurship.  I have been travelling 
all over the country.  I also work on citizenship and immigration 
issues.  I have not had time to attend the environmental 
committee hearings, but I have read them, followed them, talked 
with my colleagues, and listened to presentations at caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all of us are busy doing different things in our 
parliamentary lives, we rely on members who carry the torch and 
candle for any particular issue.  I would be remiss if I did not 
acknowledge the tremendous work of the parliamentary secretary, 
the member for Burlington, in the leadership that she has shown 
in shepherding the bill through committee, through report stage 
and on to third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the member for Davenport, a former environment 
minister and a man respected across the country for his 
dedication to environmental issues and his hard work.  The member 
for Lac-Saint-Louis who is sharing my time has shown great 
perseverance.  For some years I have known the member for North 
York to be totally committed to improving our environment, from 
dealing with toxic substances, air quality and water quality, to 
enforcement issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is the Minister of the Environment.  Those of us 
on this side are extremely proud of the efforts she has made at a 
time when raising the environment to the top of the political 
agenda was perhaps not as politically sexy as it once was. 
Because of financial constraints and for all of the wrong reasons 
the minister had to fight hard around the cabinet table. She has 
worked with her members in caucus and in committee to ensure 
these issues were brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the work of the member in our caucus who 
chairs the committee on sustainable development.  That is the 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies who has worked doggedly to 
bring forward and highlight these issues.  I very much appreciate 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that provisions throughout the bill acknowledge the 
roles of technology, technical knowledge and innovation in 
securing the protection of the environment and human health for 
Canadians today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently had the privilege along with the minister responsible 
for foreign trade of attending a team Canada trip with 62 young 
entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley. 
We visited the Alameda naval base, 1,700 acres of land in the 
valley area outside Oakland.  It is closed.  On the edge of that 
land is a landfill site full of toxic chemicals and live 
ammunition.  We actually had to sign a waiver before we went out 
there in case we stepped on something inappropriate.  I wondered 
why we were going but in any event we survived.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my story is to tell the House that there is a 
$160 million clean-up contract for that landfill site.  It is 
leaching right into the ocean.  There is a $160 million U.S. 
contract and there are eight companies involved in cleaning it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven of those companies are Canadian companies and the lead 
technology is from the University of Waterloo.  We can be 
extremely proud that in the area of environmental sciences this 
country is producing the technology and the technicians to lead 
the way in environmental clean-up.  The eighth company, the 
American company, is the one that hauled away the residue after 
the treatment had taken place.  We do have some things of which 
we can be proud in the areas of technology and showing 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on another area of the bill which I think is 
vitally important.  We tend to think the best way to solve 
problems is to wrap them around tax cuts or tax rebates for 
people who show leadership in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides the opportunity for an awards system.  It is 
my view that Canadians want to be recognized for contributing to 
their communities.  They want to be recognized for contributing 
to improving the environment.  What better way than putting it 
into the bill?  It allows an opportunity for an awards program. 
They can with great pride put a plaque on a wall in the office or 
in the study at home.  They can share with their families and be 
recognized for their vital contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is worth far more than some kind of income tax cut for a 
company.  It sends a message to all Canadians that we want them 
to buy into cleaning up the environment.  Some would say that it 
is trite to say, but we have simply borrowed this space for our 
children.  We can hope that we leave it in better shape. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act has been in force for 11 
years; it dates from 1988.  Five years have already gone by 
since the government presented its report recommending that the 
legislation be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 11 years, therefore, we have been talking about introducing 
legislation that would be more progressive and more consistent 
with the latest advances in society.  When the bill was referred 
to the parliamentary committee, it was deficient in every 
respect.  It was certainly not as far-reaching or strong as the 
previous bill, Bill C-74, which died on the order paper when the 
last election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the work done by the committee, the hundreds and 
hundreds of hours spent by colleagues from all parties, I think 
that we transformed a very imperfect bill into one that was 
certainly improved, that represented a reasonable compromise 
among members of all parties. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then sadly big business went to work.  When the bill came out of 
committee and reached the House at report stage, the formidable 
industrial lobby was in place.  Eleven large big business 
associations started to write letters to all parliamentarians 
which filtered through the offices of the establishment and 
started to level the usual threats at all parliamentarians.  I 
understand some members were reminded of the marvellous political 
donations these big industrial giants gave.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the usual threats was the threat of closure.  That is 
almost invariable.  The aluminium industry said that if the bill 
were not changed, it would physically close its aluminium plants 
and take them somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another industrial group of associations said that if the bill 
went through the way it was, all the wood burning stoves and 
waste incinerators in the fishing villages of Newfoundland would 
have to be closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we listened.  Sadly we always do.  We always worry 
about the formidable threats of the industrial lobby.  We are 
scared that it will move its plants and stop investments.  It 
always seems to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some very key areas industry wanted diluted, we diluted them. 
The precautionary principle, a key part of the bill, was diluted. 
Inherent toxicity, another key element of the bill, was diluted. 
Virtual elimination, which to start with was not very strong 
because it did not go as far as the 1993 red book commitment of 
phasing out the use of all toxic chemicals at source, only refers 
to releases.  Even then industry cried foul and it was diluted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's prerogatives in certain areas where our 
jurisdiction is very clear, such as international air and 
international water, was diluted in favour of the minister having 
to go to cabinet to justify reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened that in certain cases such as inherent toxicity 
the question never came up at committee.  We were happy with what 
was finally arrived at and suddenly there was a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to virtual elimination, the irony is that the 
definition accepted by the committee was the government's 
definition.  The government felt that the original wording in the 
act when it came before the committee was very confusing.  This 
is what we all felt.  With the help of people as highly placed as 
the deputy minister, it was rewritten and re-presented by the 
government in an amended form.  We did not think it was perfect 
but we agreed.  Then big business said it went too far and the 
government diluted its own amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We finally found out that a little clause crept in somehow which 
had to do with review of the act.  In the original bill it was 
supposed to be in place for seven years before being reviewed. We 
amended it to five years, as it presently is, but now we find out 
that the review might be carried out by either a House of Commons 
committee, a committee of the Senate or a joint committee. Before 
it had to be a House committee, but a little amendment was 
included to say that it could be here or there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What irony that a bill of the House of Commons, which has taken 
11 years to create, would perhaps not be reviewed by us.  If the 
government does not like all the environmental cracks in 
committee then it would send it to the Senate to be looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the cat came out of the bag.  My colleague refers 
to a love-in between Reform and the government today.  I am sorry 
to say it is like a blind date.  The introducer of the two lovers 
is big industry.  They have found a way to get together and agree 
on all the various amendments industry supported.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Nanaimo—Alberni made the admission, and I agree 
with him, that all the work was to bring back the bill to what it 
was when it arrived at committee.  He said that the committee 
must be balanced.  What we did was to bring back the bill to the 
point where it was before it went to committee, which means, in 
logical fashion, that the committee means nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say, as do Reform members, that there must be a 
balance between the economy and the environment.  Investment and 
business cannot suffer, as if they do when they are 
environmentally friendly.  All facts point exactly to the 
reverse.  I pointed out the other day that all of the firms which 
have been environmentally friendly have increased their profits, 
their investments, their presence and their labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3M company, since 1995 when it instituted Pollution 
Prevention Pays, has saved $800 million U.S. and tonnes and 
tonnes of pollution, as well as United Technologies, Baum in 
Germany, firms in Sweden and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is really about two points of view within a 
system:  the short term and the seven generations, the coin value 
and the common weal value, the public good.  In this balance 
human health must have priority.  It must always come first. 
That is the side I happen to be on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to have been able today to stand to say that I back 
this bill 100%.  I am a member of the government.  The reason I 
am here as part of the Liberal Party is because I believe 
strongly in its fundamental values.  However, I cannot live with 
the dilutions the government has brought forth on virtual 
elimination, on the precautionary principle, on inherent 
toxicity, on the minister's powers, and then the little sneaky 
amendment about the Senate committee.  I cannot live with those 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be at peace with myself, regardless of how much I 
suffer when I stand differently from my colleagues.  I would like 
to stand with them.  Sadly, I cannot support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw this morning a parade of Reform members saying how much 
they back this bill.  I remember the debate on climate change 
when they, almost like members of the flat earth society, said 
that the scientists who were saying that climate change was a big 
problem were wrong.  When I see them today endorsing this bill I 
say to myself that I must be on the right side.  I might be one 
of a tiny, tiny minority, but I believe in what I believe.  I 
think this bill is flawed and I will not support it.

appreciate what the hon. member opposite said this afternoon.  I 
think it is commendable that he used the word balance.  I would 
like to ask the hon. member, what exactly does balance mean?  I 
would suggest to him that perhaps it is not an either/or 
proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that to be environmentally friendly 
is a good plan.  It is economically sound.  It is of social 
benefit.  It is not an either/or proposition.  It is almost as if 
all industry has to be some kind of an enemy to the environment. 
That is not true.  I do not believe that and neither does he, I 
am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to clarify exactly what he believes the word 
balance means.  What kind of balance would he propose for 
industry and environmentalists? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this whole debate 
about balance is a red herring.  There is no such thing.  What I 
believe in is total integration, the holistic integration of all 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment and the economy are certainly not enemies or 
adversaries.  I never said that.  On the contrary, I pointed out 
that every business which has been environmentally friendly finds 
itself being a better business.  It makes more money and it is a 
better corporate citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, laws are not made for the people who observe them. 
If we all observed the laws the same way, we would not need laws 
about red lights.  We would not need laws about stopping at stop 
signs.  If everybody observed the speeding laws, there would not 
be cops to catch us.  We have to have laws for those who pollute. 
It is a minority that pollutes and the laws are directed to that 
minority, not to the environmentally friendly corporations.  It 
is to the minority that these laws are geared.

like to pose a question to the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis. 
We keep hearing about a lobby that was put forward by industry, 
but is it not true that members of the committee received letters 
from all sides on this issue and not just the one?  In fact, 
people passed along their views from all areas of society.  I 
know that I received those comments.  I would like the hon. 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course we received 
letters from all sides, but the interesting point is that the 
amendments reflected here on the key issues are not on the side 
in which I believe.  The side of big business was adopted almost 
word for word.  All of these letters threatened us.  They told us 
they were going to close the plants.  They told us they were 
going to shut down the wood-burning stoves and make us afraid. 
They even sent threats saying that they give political donations 
and that we should remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There it is.  The amendments that came in now, which I am 
fighting against, were not the amendments we received and to 
which I would subscribe.  They were the amendments that big 
business wanted.  They must be jumping for joy today.  That is 
the sad part of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
thanking the hon. member for his thoughtful analysis, I would ask 
him if he could once again elaborate on this issue of balance 
which seems to cause a conceptual problem to members of the 
Reform Party who have raised this issue all morning and who do 
not seem to understand what really is the role of the environment 
in relation to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole issue has to 
be the total integration of the environment and the economy.  It 
goes back a long way, to the Brundtland report of 1987 and before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our aboriginal brothers and sisters have understood this for 
10,000 years.  They talk about the concept of seven generations, 
that Mother Earth is one and that everything is connected to 
everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This business of saying that we have to have balance so that 
nobody loses is completely passé.  It has no place in society. 
What we want is a holistic society of values, where all of these 
things are interlinked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If corporate business conducts itself in the manner of being a 
good neighbour to the next door plant, the next door individual, 
the next door stream or the next door lake, there is nothing to 
worry about.  There is no need for balance then.  They will be 
happier.  They will make more money.  They will be better 
corporate citizens.  They will not have people such as the hon. 
member for Davenport or myself on their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are against is those who breach environmental laws and 
pollute the atmosphere.  That is why we have toxic dumps like the 
Sydney tar ponds and the arsenic leaching out of Giant Mines. 
These are the people whom we are addressing in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My balance, in those cases, is very much in favour of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
continuing the debate at third reading of the Bill C-32, an act 
respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the 
environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With praiseworthy and environmental objectives, this new 
legislation represents, once again, a centralizing focus in 
which pollution prevention becomes nominally a national 
objective, that is pan-Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that the environment is a shared 
jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over the environment is no doubt the 
broadest and most encompassing and covers vegetation, animals 
and humans. It includes the great planetary phenomena and the 
smallest micro-ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution cannot give the federal government alone total 
jurisdiction over natural resources, energy, agriculture, waste 
management, international treaties, fish stock management, air 
and water quality, animal protection, land management and the 
list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and the provincial governments therefore share 
responsibility according to the more specific nature of each of 
the issues. Nevertheless, generally speaking, as the dissenting 
opinion of the Bloc Quebecois pointed out judiciously in 
response to the report of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, including Quebec, have greater knowledge of the 
specifics of their natural environment and are in a position to 
arouse the interest and encourage the participation of local 
residents, are more open to the claims of environmental groups, 
are able to conclude significant agreements with national and 
international partners and have indicated their desire to find 
solutions to environmental challenges and to contribute actively 
to sustainable development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of government closest to the reality experienced by 
Quebecers is certainly not that of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the inheritors of Trudeau thought opposite, 
believe the contrary. Ottawa knows best. By way of illustration, 
let us consider what the Liberal majority did during 
consideration of Bill C-32 in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original version of the bill called for the federal 
government to act within the spirit of the intergovernmental 
agreements.  The Liberals on the committee modified that intent 
by amending it with the addition of the words endeavour to, so 
as not to oblige or constrain the federal government to 
co-operate with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faithful to their old ways, the federal Liberals prefer to see 
the federal government dominate the provinces, instead of 
working in close collaboration with them.  They would have had 
trouble finding a better example to demonstrate once again the 
Liberals' obstinate refusal to respect the provinces' 
jurisdiction over the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This syndrome of dominant federalism lies, moreover, at the very 
heart of the whole piece of legislation we are debating. 
Starting with the preamble, the Liberals want to set out 
national environmental standards and codes of practice relating 
to ecosystems and environmental quality. 
The preamble states that the presence of toxic substances is of 
national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also states that environmental protection is a national 
goal and to that end it creates a national clearing house on 
pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it gives the government the authority to establish a 
national fuel mark, and a national mark for motors that comply 
with these standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, what is better for stimulating the old Liberal reflex 
of reliving the past, than a statement that everything is in the 
national interest, in order to more easily invade areas of 
jurisdiction by setting national standards, while of course the 
National Assembly will not have a word to say in the matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory, Bill C-32 acknowledges the environment as a shared 
federal and provincial responsibility. In practice, however, it 
is aimed at reinforcing the preponderance of the federal 
government, the government of the best country in the world as 
far as environmental protection is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind its noble facade, Bill C-32 is, in reality, nothing but a 
reproduction of the duplications, overlaps and encroachments 
into areas of provincial jurisdiction.  In order to justify such 
a waste of energy and public funds, the federal Liberals are 
taking refuge behind a supreme court decision, the Solicitor 
General of Canada v. Hydro Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue in that case was the jurisdiction of the federal 
parliament over the environment. All the courts that had heard 
the case before the supreme court had ruled that the federal 
order was invalid. As a last resort, the federal government 
turned to the supreme court and, surprise, even the friends of 
the federal government issued a judgment that was not unanimous. 
Four of the nine judges concluded, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granting Parliament the authority to regulate so completely the 
release of substances into the environment by determining 
whether or not they are “toxic” would inescapably preclude the 
possibility of shared environmental jurisdiction and would 
infringe severely on other heads of power assigned to the 
provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the five other judges were more in line with the 
centralizing vision of the federal government. 
Contrary to the arguments put forth by the four judges of the 
supreme court, the Court of Quebec, the Superior Court and the 
Quebec Court of Appeal, the majority came to the conclusion that 
it was wholly within parliament's power to enact laws on the 
environment, under the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ruling violates the very principle of equality between the 
federal government and the provinces regarding the protection of 
the environment. It states on the contrary that the provinces 
have a role to play in this area only if it complements that of 
the federal government. So, the supreme court tells us that if 
there is a dispute between the federal and provincial 
governments, it is Ottawa that has the final say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the federal government is using that ruling to increase 
its legislative powers regarding the environment. 
As usual, the Liberal government is forgetting its fundamental 
legislation, the Constitution, which recognizes that the 
environment is a shared jurisdiction, in order to subordinate 
the role of the provinces to big brother in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a concrete example of the ridiculous 
situations in which we will find ourselves if this bill is 
passed.  The legislation puts the spotlight on pollution 
prevention and includes the power to require pollution 
prevention plans.  This implies the development of a direct 
partnership between the federal government and the industrial 
sectors targeted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that such partnership programs already exist 
between the Government of Quebec and certain industrial sectors. 
One example is the program to reduce industrial waste, now 
operating in the pulp and paper sector.  Duplication?  Certainly 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal government hopes to do is force the provinces 
to adopt its regulations, or it will deal directly with the 
individuals, organizations or industries concerned.  Overlap? 
No, no, no.  In order to get what it wants, the Liberal 
government is barging in and upsetting the very consensus it 
should be trying to create in as sensitive and troubled a field 
as the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, this disagreement over Bill C-32 is rooted in two 
visions of the same reality, two ways of doing things that have 
nothing to do with any failure to respect the Canadian 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Short of eliminating the provinces, the Liberal government must 
at all costs impose an effective centralizing power in order to 
maintain political cohesion in the rest of Canada.  The Bloc 
Quebecois respects this vision, and the rest of Canada has 
already accepted it with the social union agreement, for one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that Quebec as a nation would be better 
served if it had one fully responsible government, rather than 
eleven with partial responsibility.  Hence our notion of 
partnership with the rest of Canada, with respect for our 
different ways of seeing and doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, Bill C-32, with its heavy dose of paternalism 
and domination, would no longer have a place.  Two sovereign 
nations would mutually agree to emphasize prevention and 
protection of the environment and human health in order to 
contribute to sustainable development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I rise today to address what very well 
could be one of the most important pieces of legislation the 
House deals with.  I make that statement due to the fact that 
there is no greater issue any government could address than that 
of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few pieces of legislation that touch every facet of 
Canadian life and this is one.  I would hope that all members of 
the House recognize this indisputable fact.  If we recognize 
this, I would then suggest that the debate be centred around the 
support of the legislation and the responsibility that we have to 
Canadians.  To do otherwise simply states that we are not 
prepared to safeguard our country nor our planet for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The buck stops here.  If we cannot demonstrate the vision 
necessary to ensure our children are provided with a better and 
healthier environment, we should ask ourselves what we are doing 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are groups that will try to convince members, through 
misleading statements, accurate facts and through nothing more 
than fear-mongering, that the legislation is not necessary.  They 
are wrong.  They are not doing a service to the country or to 
future generations by opposing such an important and critical 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1988 the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, commonly 
known in the House and across the country as the CEPA, has been 
the cornerstone of federal environmental and health protection 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most critical components of the bill allows for the 
control of toxic substances, a topic that many members are well 
aware is near and dear to my heart.  It will be in this area that 
I will concentrate my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in regard to Bill C-32 that they take full advantage of 
the advancements in environmental science, policy and law over 
the past decade.  Concepts like sustainable development and 
pollution prevention have been widely accepted and needed to be 
incorporated in our laws.  We are quite simply strengthening the 
CEPA in line with these concepts so that the government will be 
better able to protect the environment and the health of 
Canadians from the dangers of toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many toxic substances do not stay put once they are released 
into the environment.  Toxic substances, such as mercury and PCBs 
for example, have been found in the blood of aboriginal peoples 
in communities high in the Arctic located far away from 
industrial development.  One might ask how this could happen. 
Substances are transported to remote areas and pristine 
environments through air currents.  They have long term adverse 
effects on the health of the people and wildlife who breath the 
air, drink the water or consume the food contained therein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about the risks that toxic substances 
pose to their health, to their children's health and to the long 
term environment of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will Bill C-32 do to reduce or eliminate this threat?  The 
good work that is already underway to identify and manage toxic 
substances will continue.  The bill will introduce innovations to 
allow more efficient and effective government action in carrying 
out these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the amendments made during the committee stage, 
the bill requires the Ministers of the Environment and Health to 
conduct research on hormone disrupting substances.  I should add 
that the government has already acted to meet the requirement 
under a $40 million toxic substance research initiative, a 
commitment the government is very proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires that all 23,000 substances in Canada 
are looked at to determine if they are toxic.  Committee 
amendments require the first stage, and the biggest step of this 
mammoth undertaking, to be completed within seven years. 
It also incorporates into the legislation key features of the 
federal toxic substances management policy which sets out 
precautionary, proactive and accountable rules for dealing with 
toxic substances; an absolute must, I suggest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 incorporates the precautionary principle.  This means 
that the government will not have to wait for full scientific 
certainty before acting to prevent an environmental harm.  Quite 
simply, our aim is to take all reasonable precautions to reduce 
or eliminate the exposure of Canadians to toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 will impose new deadlines for the development of 
preventative or control actions.  It will require the Minister of 
the Environment to propose concrete actions to prevent or control 
the release of substances within two years of declaring a 
substance toxic.  These preventative or control actions must be 
finalized within the following 18 months.  These are the kinds of 
checks and balances we must have and they are the kinds of checks 
and balances that the Liberal government puts forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of virtual elimination is a new term to the CEPA.  The 
Government of Canada recognized in its 1995 toxic substances 
management policy that our traditional approach of managing the 
release of toxic substances into the environment through their 
life cycle is not sufficient in the environment today.  Toxic 
substances that require stricter management actions result 
primarily from human activity.  They persist in the environment 
for long periods of time and are referred to as bioaccumulative. 
They are toxins that are stored in living tissues.  Quantities of 
these substances may build over time to levels that have serious, 
long term adverse effects to the environment and to human health.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>WORLD POPULATION DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, July 11 is 
World Population Day, a day for us to reflect on the issues that 
challenge us globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key issue of population and development is access to education 
for the 1.06 billion people, almost 20% of the world's population 
between the ages of 15 and 24.  This is the largest generation of 
young people ever in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people have enormous potential to effect the 
development of their countries and we must support efforts that 
encourage their positive involvement in building strong 
societies.  It has been demonstrated that in emerging nations, 
access to education results in slower population growth, better 
hygiene and improved economic circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore encourage the Government of Canada and the Canadian 
International Development Agency to support initiatives to ensure 
that young people, especially in developing countries and in our 
native communities, receive adequate primary education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-55 is going through the Senate now with last minute amendments 
to reflect a so-called deal reached with the Americans to provide 
subsidies to the Canadian magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is one thing the government seems to have 
forgotten. We have commitments under NAFTA and the World Trade 
Organization which promise something called “national 
treatment”.  Any subsidy we give to the Canadian publishers must 
automatically be made available to American and foreign 
publishers that are operating in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely ludicrous that the government would 
seriously commit to throwing away hard-earned taxpayers' dollars 
in this fashion.  Does the government not understand the 
international agreements that it has signed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say we should forget the subsidies.  Let the magazine industry 
compete on its own merit.  We should have more confidence in the 
abilities of our Canadian publishers to carve out lucrative 
Canadian markets for themselves without coming to Ottawa cap in 
hand.

June is Leukemia Awareness Month.  An estimated 3,300 Canadians

Canadians will die of leukemia in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately relatively little is known regarding the causes of 
leukemia.  Health Canada is currently studying the causes of 
leukemia as part of the department's ongoing enhanced cancer 
surveillance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia accounts for almost one-third of all new cases of 
cancer in Canadian children and teenagers and is the most common 
cause of death.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death 
after injuries in Canadian children and adolescents aged one to 
nineteen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's childhood cancer surveillance and control 
program will contribute substantially to improved childhood 
cancer control in Canada through an ongoing surveillance of 
treatments, outcomes and studies of cancer patients and healthy 
controls.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I regret to inform the House that the farm income crisis on the 
prairies has resulted in tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I was informed that a Saskatchewan farmer who was 
struggling to keep his farm operation going committed suicide. 
That is how bad it is on the prairies.  This farmer was willing 
to take his own life and leave behind his family including two 
young boys because he could not no longer deal with the struggles 
of farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture minister has said that his new farm aid package, 
AIDA, as well as NISA and crop insurance were enough to get 
producers through this crisis.  Evidently it was not enough for 
this farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm income crisis is far from over.  Grain prices are not 
improving and input costs continue to rise.  The number of calls 
coming into the Saskatchewan farm stress line in 1999 is already 
well above the monthly average for 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to wake up.  Help is needed on the 
prairies and its current solutions are not working.  How many 
more tragedies does it take before the government realizes that 
its farm disaster program is not helping the farmers who need it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more Canadians are growing dissatisfied with the way 
our electoral system works.  They want a system that encourages

them to vote for what they want instead of what they do not want

</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I ask the Prime Minister this.  The first 
past the post system does not do this and lately has tended to 
regionalize our political parties in parliament. Would the Prime

complains about mud slinging.  I ask him a decent policy question

As they cannot win with that system, they want another one.  I

who are able to write budget speeches.  Yet the minister paid 
$104,000 of taxpayers money to three outside consultants to 
polish a 29 page speech.  That is at a cost of $3,500 a page. Let 
us hope the minister does not catch a case of verbal diarrhea; he 
would bankrupt the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister is obsessed with his image, but can he tell

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say that it was not for speech writing.  Certainly 
it was part of the reason, but in addition there was an entire 
communications plan, an entire strategic plan laid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, in the busiest four months before the budget there was 
the whole question of setting up the website.  We were one of the 
one of the hottest websites in North America following the 
budget.  I would recommend to all members after the next budget 
that they look at our website.  It is really worth while.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE DOUGLAS HARKNESS

<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with sadness but also honour that I rise today to 
pay tribute to the late Hon. Douglas Harkness who died in Calgary 
at the age of 96. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His gallantry during World War II was recognized by the awarding 
to him of the George Medal, truly an exemplary accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Harkness was elected to the House of Commons in 1945 and 
retired in 1972 as the member for Calgary Centre.  Those 27 years 
of public service were ones of great change and great challenge 
in Canada.  He helped mould those changes on both sides of the 
House and in the cabinet room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members who came to parliament after the second world war 
must have been a very distinct breed.  They came from the 
battlefields directly into the House, determined to build a great 
nation.  They recognized the debt owed to their comrades in arms. 
They had a vision of a better country and they set about to bring 
that vision to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was reflected in Mr. Harkness' first speech in this place. 
He had served in the Royal Canadian Artillery and yet his first 
act when he appeared in the House of Commons was to make a plea 
for better treatment for the foot soldiers in the Canadian Armed 
Forces, the lowest paid men whom he regarded as being part of the 
most significant effort in the war in Europe.  He championed 
better pay and conditions for the services which are more in 
keeping with the risks they run and the conditions they endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada that we see today is different from what we saw in 
1945.  Douglas Harkness and his family, his wife and son who 
predeceased him, helped build this into a better nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to stand in this place and express the thanks 
of Canadians for his decades of public service and express our 
regrets and sympathies to his family on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer a 
tribute on behalf of the government to the Hon. Douglas Scott 
Harkness who served his country with integrity and conviction 
both in the military arena of World War II and in the political 
arena of the House of Commons between 1945 and 1972. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from Alberta, I am particularly honoured to 
recognize the political and military contributions of Mr. 
Harkness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Douglas Harkness distinguished himself at war through his 
courage.  Indeed he was awarded the George Medal for bravery for 
his actions in helping to evacuate troops when a flagship he was 
aboard was torpedoed.  He earned the respect of his superiors and 
was promoted to lieutenant colonel and served as a commander 
during the invasion of Normandy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon his return from the war Douglas Harkness demonstrated his 
leadership qualities by helping to shape the political landscape 
of his country.  First elected as MP for the riding of Calgary 
East in 1945, he was returned after the redistribution of seats 
as the MP for Calgary North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Prime Minister Diefenbaker, Douglas Harkness served in a 
variety of portfolios, including Minister of Northern Affairs and 
Natural Resources, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of 
National Defence.  For a time he was Alberta's only 
representative in cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his legacies as Minister of Agriculture was to bring a 
degree of stability to agriculture by establishing the Prairie 
Farm Assistance Act.  He maintained his attachment to the land 
and was very proud of it.  In fact, even as he represented his 
constituents in Ottawa, he continued to file his income tax as a 
proud farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that for which he will be most remembered politically 
is his stand as Minister of National Defence on the issue of 
nuclear arms.  At odds with then Prime Minister Diefenbaker as to 
whether Canada should arm its Bomarc missiles with nuclear 
warheads, Douglas Harkness tendered his resignation.  In his 
statement to the House on February 4, 1963, he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resigned as a matter of principle.  The point was finally 
reached when I considered that my honour and integrity required 
that I take that step. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a division, a stand which would lead to the defeat of the 
Diefenbaker government. 
For only the second time in Canadian history a government was 
overthrown by a vote of non-confidence in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Teacher, farmer, soldier, legislator, Douglas Harkness 
exemplified the ability to both serve and lead.  Having left an

country, he was inducted as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 
1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government I would like to ask all colleagues 
to take the time to reflect on the contributions of a former 
politician, a man of principle, a fellow Albertan, who made a 
real difference in the country's history. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to salute a great Canadian and Calgarian, 
the Hon. Douglas Scott Harkness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Douglas Harkness has been described as a man of gracious 
character, of steely resolve and a true gentleman, a good 
combination.  He was a teacher and a farmer, an outstanding 
soldier, politician and statesman, so he fully deserves the 
appellation “great”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Harkness developed an interest in politics while teaching 
school.  Small wonder perhaps, for the school's principal was 
William Aberhart, the first leader of the Social Credit movement 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While overseas in 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Harkness was proposed 
as the federal candidate for Calgary East.  He was notified by 
cable and accepted the nomination after consulting with his 
fellow officers.  He was elected in Calgary East in 1945 and 
returned to parliament in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1952 redistribution he was elected in the 
constituency of Calgary North, the riding I now represent as 
Calgary—Nose Hill.  Mr. Harkness was elected in that riding in 
1953, 1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1968.  Nine election 
victories are a testimony to the high regard in which Calgarians 
held Mr. Harkness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appointed to the cabinet in 1957 he subsequently served as 
Minister of Agriculture.  He took great pride in securing 
programs to assist the farming community.  Mr. Harkness was 
appointed Minister of National Defence in 1960 at a time when 
Canadians were vigorously debating foreign and defence policy, 
particularly surrounding the cancellation of the Avro Arrow and 
the introduction of the Bomarc missile with its nuclear warhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, Minister Harkness took 
a politically courageous and very responsible decision to place 
the Canadian military in a state of high alert despite the 
indecisiveness of the prime minister of the day.  Mr. Harkness 
continued to disagree with the prime minister on issues of 
national defence and resigned from the cabinet.  The government 
fell in a non-confidence motion the next day.  Mr. Harkness was 
re-elected, as pointed out earlier, and served in the opposition 
until his retirement in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military career of Mr. Harkness, while briefer, was as 
brilliant as his political record.  A militia officer, he went 
overseas in 1939 as a captain in the artillery.  He served in 
Britain, Sicily, Italy, France and Northwest Europe, the last 
year as a lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the fifth 
anti-tank regiment in the fourth armoured division.  He was 
awarded the George Medal in 1943 for his action in organizing the 
evacuation of a troop ship that was torpedoed on route from 
England to Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more could be said about this wonderful man, his early 
years, his distinguished family, his combat record and his 
achievements in the community.  I have only touched the surface. 
I am honoured to have been able to stand here and pay a brief 
tribute to Mr. Harkness, a most outstanding and remarkable man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with others in the House and in Canada in extending 
condolences to the family and friends of this great Canadian.

pay tribute to Douglas Scott Harkness, former member and 
minister, who died on May 2 at the age of 96. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Harkness was born in Toronto in 1903. He studied at the 
University of Alberta, after his family moved to that province 
in 1910. He was a teacher and a farmer. During the second world 
war, he served in the armed forces in Europe from 1940 to 1945. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was, in fact, while he was in Europe that he received a 
telegram asking him to run as a Conservative in the general 
election of June 1945. 
He was first elected to the House of Commons to represent the 
voters of Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his career in politics, he served as northern affairs and 
natural resources critic. In 1957, he was appointed Minister of 
Natural Resources and acting Minister of Agriculture. He served 
as Minister of Agriculture until 1960, when he was appointed 
Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, he took part in the important debate that caused such a 
furor at the time on the appropriateness of the Canadian Armed 
Forces having nuclear weapons. The position he defended on this 
did not prevail and he accordingly resigned his post in 1963. 
He continued to represent the voters of Calgary Centre until 
1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After retiring from political life, Mr. Harkness returned to 
agriculture. In 1978, he received the Order of Canada.

Commons in expressing our condolences to the family of the late 
Mr. Douglas Harkness and in saying a few words of tribute to his 
career in this place, to his service to his country during World 
War II and to his work as a teacher and a farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the night Mr. Harkness resigned.  I was only 12 years 
old but I was paying attention to politics at the time.  I 
remember that when Mr. Harkness resigned it precipitated the fall 
of the Diefenbaker government in 1963.  This was something to be 
noted, not the resignation per se or the fall of the government, 
but the fact that somebody would resign on a matter of principle 
knowing the consequences for himself personally and knowing the 
consequences for the government led by his own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that happens rarely in Canadian politics, too 
rarely I might say.  I am sure there are occasions when this 
would have been the thing to do but it is not done any more.  It 
is a tradition of Canadian parliamentary life which has fallen on 
bad times and is no longer thought to be the thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that with respect, even though the principle on which 
Mr. Harkness resigned is not a principle I shared with him.  I am 
sure my NDP colleagues at the time did not agree with him with 
respect to the arming of Bomarc missiles with nuclear weapons. 
Nevertheless it was a principle he held and upheld and was 
willing to go to the wall for politically.  We have to admire 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay tribute to that and to his 27 years in this place, to his 
distinguished military career.  As I said before, we extend to 
his family our sincere condolences.

act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the 
environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development, be read the third time and passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleagues for waiting with bated breath over question period 
to hear my closing remarks on the issue of Bill C-32 and more 
specifically concentrating on the toxic substance contents of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was mentioning, the quantity of these substances can build 
up over time.  They cause long term, serious, adverse health 
effects both to the environment and to people.  Once in the 
environment these substances will continue to damage our health 
and the health of our ecosystems over many generations through a 
subtle effect of endocrine, immune, reproductive and other 
sensitive biological systems. Virtual elimination is necessary to 
protect our health and that of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 allows for creative approaches in controlling toxic 
substances to achieve results faster and to provide greater 
flexibility.  A reactive or control management approach is often 
costly and time consuming.  In some circumstances traditional 
regulations remain the best solution.  However, they are only one 
of several tools that Bill C-32 places at our disposal. These 
tools include pollution prevention plans, voluntary initiatives 
and economic instruments such as tradable permits to control 
toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new tools focus on environmental results rather than the 
means by which they are achieved.  They give operators the 
flexibility to incorporate cost effective measures that suit the 
needs without the direct intervention of the government as long 
as the required environmental protection objectives are met. This 
results often in a greater reduction in toxic emissions that 
would otherwise be achieved through traditional regulatory 
approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can learn from actions of other countries as well.  For 
example, Bill C-32 requires the federal government to review the 
decisions and control actions of toxic substances taken by other 
countries to determine if they are relevant and applicable to 
Canadian situations.  The government will regularly review 
decisions taken by provinces in Canada or by member countries of 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to 
substantially restrict toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to the concerns of Canadians about toxic 
substances.  I believe the environmental legislation before us 
today addresses these concerns.  A strengthened CEPA will provide 
the Government of Canada with the tools needed to protect the 
Canadian environment and the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to support the legislation and give it speedy 
passage so that Canada will be an environmental leader in the 
21st century.  It is our responsibility as members of parliament, 
as the Government of Canada and as proud Canadian citizens to 
make sure this piece of legislation goes through. Our children 
and our environment are depending on it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
a couple of years ago a concerned citizen came to my office in 
the riding of York North.  He was very concerned about the health 
of the trumpeter swan in the Wye Marsh.  He was very concerned 
about what was happening around lead contamination.  I understand 
the member for Simcoe—Grey has some of the Wye Marsh within his 
riding. I was wondering what he was doing to help his 
constituents on this very important problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. colleague 
for her question.  It is an issue that is certainly near and dear 
to my heart and impacts my riding as well as ridings all across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As late as about three weeks ago I introduced a private member's 
bill banning lead sinkers and jigs.  Although it was deemed to be 
a non-votable item at that point in time, we were successful in 
securing the support of the Minister of the Environment.  At this 
time I would certainly like to thank her and congratulate her for 
rising to the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lead sinkers and jigs issue that is impacting Canadians all 
across the country is a crucial issue and it is a hidden issue. 
Most people in the House and in fact all across the country did 
not realize the severity of the situation regarding the deposit 
of lead sinkers and jigs in our Canadian waters. At that time I 
drew a scenario.  It is actually taking place as we speak today 
and throughout most of the year. It boils down to that this 
legislation will help through community buy ins, support in that 
sector and identifying it as such a toxic substance as it is in 
Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 500 and 600 tonnes of lead are deposited in Canadian 
waters every year. 
The analogy I used was approximately 500 half-ton pick-ups fully 
loaded with lead lined up bumper to bumper.  That is the kind of 
situation which is taking place with respect to lead being dumped 
in Canadian waters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud to address that issue on behalf of not only the 
constituents of Simcoe—Grey, but also people who are impacted in 
all areas of Canada.  That is certainly one measure where I think 
the government has been very proactive and will continue to be 
so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
three weeks ago 28 experts, scientists, medical doctors, 
researchers, environmental lawyers and public policy experts 
gathered on Parliament Hill and met with members of parliament 
and senators at EcoSummit '99.  The summit examined air 
pollution, the link to human health and what is required for 
healthy public policy development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two very important messages emerged.  First, the health and 
scientific experts unanimously agreed that medical and ecological 
information clearly indicates that we face pressing health 
problems as a result of airborne contaminants.  Second, we as 
parliamentarians have a responsibility to act and we must act now 
in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EcoSummit participants, eminent leaders in their fields 
including a former Royal Society president, felt it was crucial 
to bring their research to the attention of parliamentarians. 
There is a fundamental need to develop a relationship of 
collaboration between scientists and parliamentarians to promote 
healthy public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. David Bates, a pioneer in and an internationally renowned 
expert on the study of air pollution in human health for over 50 
years asked tough questions about Canada's readiness to take up 
the challenge of effectively dealing with the problem of airborne 
contaminants and human health.  In his important book 
<I>Environmental Health Risks and Public Policy: Decision Making 
in Free Societies</I>, Dr. Bates provides an approach for better 
integrating medical and health public policy making.  Dr. Bates 
clearly takes a stand on the side of public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his book he quotes American Senator Edward Muskie and 
principal author of the 1970 Clean Air Act amendments.  Senator 
Muskie said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility is to establish what the public interest 
requires to protect the health of persons.  This may mean that 
people and industries will be asked to do what seems impossible 
at the present time.  But if health is to be protected, these 
challenges must be met.  I am convinced they can be met. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so am I.  Unfortunately, Bill C-32 will not do this. 
Throughout this debate I have implored my colleagues on both 
sides of the House to consider very carefully the impact of the 
amendments that we had before us at report stage.  Now I ask my 
colleagues to very carefully consider the effect of this 
legislation in its final form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget our duties and obligations as 
parliamentarians.  We must first establish what the public 
interest requires to protect the health of persons.  This is our 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question before us now is, is Bill C-32 written 
as if the health of Canadians mattered?  How each of us in the 
House responds to this question as our words are recorded in the 
<I>Hansard</I> of this debate or in the way we vote tonight on 
third reading will define us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members in the House say that we must balance the 
environmental concerns with economic concerns, that without 
economic growth and profit we will not have the resources we need 
to protect the environment.  This is absurd.  They forget that 
without a healthy environment the economy will suffer.  Have any 
of the members opposite heard anything about the Atlantic and the 
Pacific fishing industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trickle down economic policies have not worked for the poor.  To 
the contrary, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. 
Trickle down environmental protection will not work either.  The 
connections among economic, equity and ecological factors are 
inextricably woven.  It is in fact a seamless web of 
interdependency.  It is irrational, foolhardy and dangerous to 
overlook this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aggressive industrial assault against any positive 
environmental measures in Bill C-32 is precedent setting.  The 
fact that parliament has so fully incorporated their concerns is 
shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of three Liberal members who has worked on this bill from 
before its inception during the original CEPA review in 1994, 
through the government response in Bill C-74, CEPA 1996 and the 
committee process reviewing Bill C-32, CEPA 1998, I would have to 
say that the bill currently before the House is a pale reflection 
of the piece of legislation it could be, a bill that has been 
fought over by this unprecedented industrial lobbyist assault, by 
the machinations of other government departments and by pressure 
from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has finally emerged is a bill weakened by a thousand cuts, 
a bill so anemic it cannot be supported.  My decision not to 
support Bill C-32 has been made after much thought and 
deliberation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past five years I have spoken with leading experts from 
the fields of health, ecology, law and economics, and it is very 
clear that most recommendations that would make this bill a good 
bill were ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months during committee hearings and now during the days of 
debate in the House some of my colleagues and I have continued to 
raise issues of concern.  Unfortunately there are many.  I would 
like to reiterate only some of the most problematic ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a weakening of the virtual elimination 
provisions.  The residual nature of CEPA has been emphasized by 
restricting the authority of the Minister of the Environment to 
act in relation to other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional barriers to action by the federal government have 
been created by lining the bill with the harmonization agreement 
with the provinces.  Overall new hurdles have been created on 
acting in a precautionary way.  There has been a shift away from 
pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are elements in Bill C-32 that would improve the 
existing CEPA, for example the electronic environmental registry, 
legislation of the National Pollutants Release Inventory and new 
powers for enforcement, these do little to overcome the 
cumulative damage made by all the other changes that weaken Bill 
C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to rewrite Bill C-32 I would ensure that it was real 
pollution prevention legislation, that there was a focus on 
generation and use, not just releases.  I would ensure that 
pollution prevention plans were mandatory and automatic once 
toxic substances have been identified and not have to wait for a 
listing of toxics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution prevention planning leads to eco-efficiency for firms, 
which means better toxics management, reducing costs for industry 
and government.  As well, the Ministers of the Environment and 
Health should be the ones making environmental and health 
decisions, not economic ministries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anything, if I were to rewrite this bill I would make 
sure that CEPA respected subpopulations such as children. 
Children are not small adults.  If we set environmental standards 
which created healthy public policy, as if the health of our 
children mattered, then everyone would gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other groups of Canadians who require special 
attention.  Canada's northern people live with the consequences 
of toxic chemicals that are created outside of their homelands. 
They catch food that is contaminated and mothers' breast milk has 
unacceptable high levels of PCBs.  If we respect these Canadians 
we must write environmental legislation as if their health 
mattered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to rewrite this bill I would listen to the hundreds of 
witnesses, from aboriginal people to scientists, to medical 
doctors and researchers, to lawyers and labour groups, to health 
child specialists, experts on learning disabilities, 
environmental groups, enlightened industry representatives, who 
gave us a wonderful and rich set of recommendations to choose 
from when the committee wrote the review and put forward very 
clear and damning criticism when the legislation was before 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all of these incredibly hard-working individuals 
who, with few resources but with much wisdom and foresight, 
provided the committee with the evidence to make this a better 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though some say we have failed because this bill is a mere 
shadow of what it could be, I say that we have succeeded in 
creating a benchmark against which all of us in the House will be 
measured.  It is a legacy that some day we will return to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that politics is the art of the possible, but I say 
that the art of possible is doing the seemingly impossible.

congratulate my colleague for the hard work she and others have 
done in contributing to the debate on Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose there are some of us in the House who have supported 
the bill.  I would point out that in terms of an industrial 
barrage of lobbying, I know that I have seen in my time here 
lobbying that was much more intense, for example, the lobbying 
over the bank mergers, and yet our government decided to disallow 
bank mergers at this time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lobbyists and we have lobbyists.  I am sure there are 
lobbyists on the environmental protection side of the issue. 
Therefore, to say that this bill is the result of an intense 
industrial lobby is perhaps somewhat unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience in the forest products industry we had a number 
of concerns with legislation that was introduced by the Ontario 
government during the NDP period which concerned the use of the 
best available technology.  What that legislation did was to say 
that, notwithstanding the cost, if there was technology in place 
that would allow the removal or elimination of certain 
pollutants, then the law required that the best available 
technology be implemented.  For example, if emissions could be 
reduced by .000 and it cost $1 billion, to use a ridiculous 
example, the legislation said that would have to be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are differences of opinion on this issue in the 
House, but on the concept of virtual elimination I think there 
was a legitimate concern by industry that we were going to be 
chasing molecules or those pollutants that are not measurable by 
any reasonable standard and investing millions of dollars of 
capital to reduce pollutants which are really having no 
significant impact at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with my 
colleague that $1 billion to change technology to deal with an 
environmental issue is absurd.  Certainly that is the kind of 
absurd sort of scaremongering that we were subjected to by the 
industrial lobby assault against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to my colleague that the issue of 
virtual elimination, the definition itself, as originally posed 
in Bill C-32, was so incomprehensible that it could have led to 
three different kinds of interpretation.  Uncertainty for 
industry is a big issue.  However, it was the deputy minister of 
Environment Canada who put forward an amendment through the 
government which changed the definition at committee.  The 
definition is exactly the same as it is in the toxic substance 
management policy.  In 1995 stakeholder groups, including 
industry stakeholder groups, signed on to the toxic substance 
management policy, which has exactly the same definition as Bill 
C-32.  They agreed with it.  I have not seen industry pouring out 
of the country in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague says that we should not be chasing the last 
molecule, which is true.  That is what it says in the toxic 
substance management policy.  However, what industry lobbyists 
tend to forget is what happens on the second page of the toxic 
substance management policy, which is to say that the ultimate 
objective is to go toward virtual elimination without 
consideration for sociological and economic factors.  That has 
often been missed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-32 is undoubtedly a major bill, but it is very 
disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing to Bloc Quebecois members and to those 
Liberal members who are most involved in the environmental 
field. I can think of the hon. member for Davenport, who is also 
the chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis and 
former Quebec environment minister, who also voted against the 
bill, and the hon. member for York North, who also sits on the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those Liberal members who are most involved in the 
environmental field voted against Bill C-32, as was the case 
yesterday, does it mean that all Liberal members who have some 
common sense should follow suit? These are members who have put 
a great deal of time into studying the bill clause by clause, 
and now they are voting against it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed the member 
opposite sat through many hearings and was involved with the

much he cares about the environment because of the contribution

who understands it and who knows the legislation inside and out, 
to say that this bill is not good enough.  I have decided that in 
my own conscience, because of my own feelings and my own 
understandings.  It is not good enough for the people of York 
North.  It is not good enough for the people of Canada.  This is 
a democracy and I have the right to express my opinion in the

unanimous consent to extend the question and comment period for 
another five minutes.  This is such an important bill and such an 
important debate that we on this side of the House would like an 
additional couple of minutes to ask a few questions of the member 
for York North.

Valley—Eastern Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a continuation of the Liberal agenda to 
deregulate.  It is a total corporate agenda, a cave-in to a lobby 
group.  In effect, what we have is a virtual environmental 
protection act.  The term virtual has come to mean that it is not 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard all day that this bill is supposed to be balanced. 
We are trying to accommodate the economy as well as the 
environment.  We have heard members of the Reform Party say that 
they are in favour of sustainable development, as well as Liberal 
members.  In fact, they are having a love-in with the Reform 
Party in support of this environmental protection bill, which in 
fact is not going to protect our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to accept the virtual elimination of the most 
deadly poisons and toxins known to man, when what we need is the 
phase-out of persistent organic pollutants.  These are heavy 
metals.  They are DDTs.  They are truly unmanageable poisons and 
that is why we do not want them in the environment.  We cannot 
accept any level of these toxins because we cannot manage the 
effects of them.  We cannot manage the effects of endocrine 
disrupters.  How low will we allow sperm counts to go before we 
say no, we cannot accept this any more?  How many mutated embryos 
will we accept before we say no, we have to stop the actual 
generation and sale of these poisons because we cannot manage 
them within our environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newer research is clearly showing that we are affected by very 
low levels of toxins; not just megadoses of poisons that cause 
cancer, but very low doses of common poisons in our environment, 
such as nitrates that we use as fertilizer and soaps that we use 
in cleaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst thing is that we do not know what the combination of 
these toxins will do to our children and to our health.  We do 
know that it is not a benefit for us to have them within our 
environment.  If we ignore the effects we will be propagating 
them by not going forward with environmental protection that is 
preventive and not crisis oriented, trying to clean up the mess 
at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the north, the Arctic contaminants report has 
clearly stated that the north and the people of the north are 
disproportionately affected by these poisons because they stay 
there.  They do not go anywhere else.  We have lead, mercury and 
DDT levels that are unacceptable in mothers' breast milk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who live in the north do not have the opportunity to 
go to a health food store to get organic produce.  People who 
live in Old Crow, who want to buy some milk for their child, are 
looking at triple the cost which is paid by those living in a 
southern community.  It is just not reasonable to expect these 
people, if they are concerned about their health and the levels 
of contaminants in their environment, not to live off the caribou 
and the fish which are coming more and more sparsely up the river 
to Old Crow.  They have to depend on the country's food, the 
indigenous food, to bring up their children in good health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not show concern for the northern people and the effects 
that these poisons have on them.  They have no control over how 
or when those toxins arrive in the north because they come 
through the winds and evaporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill where the minister is going to limit her own 
powers to protect the environment.  The minister's power will in 
fact be dissipated to the Minister of Industry.  Maybe the 
Minister of Finance is not going to like how the minister wants 
to protect our environment.  That minister will no longer have 
the ability to make a decision and say “No we cannot do this. 
This is unacceptable.  The cost to human health is far to high”. 
That is exactly what the bill does.  It dissipates the power, 
the focus and the concentration on protecting our environment in 
the best interests of our public.  The best interests of the 
health of these citizens have become subordinate to corporate 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard this over and over again today from some of the 
members who have spoken and, I think, at great personal cost.  It 
certainly must be heartbreaking to stand up and not vote with 
their party on a bill that they have worked on for years in the 
belief that as citizens they could protect our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will jump back to the north.  The bill is not about good 
corporate citizens.  It is about those individuals and those 
corporations who will not and do not clean up after themselves. 
They do not look ahead to the cost to the environment and to 
health through the process they use in their industry or the 
product that they produce in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the DEW line, the distant early warning sites across the 
north that the U.S. was heavily involved in.  It abandoned those 
sites leaving behind barrels of DDTs and other toxins.  It 
sometimes buried them and sometimes left them exposed.  What has 
happened to the sites?  They have not been cleaned up.  The 
Liberal government made an infamous deal to trade used military 
equipment for cleaning up the north, which means of course that 
those sites do not and will not get cleaned up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations have gone through the Faro mine one after the 
other.  It will cost over $100 million to clean up the toxins 
that were left behind.  Who is responsible for that and who is 
going to end up cleaning it up?  The people who live there or the 
government of the country will have to clean it up? As it stands, 
the mess is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a $300,000 fine for a company that left behind a 
mess.  Guess what?  That company is out of business.  Who is 
going to clean that up?  Who is going to live with the 
contamination? The indigenous people in that remote area who are 
going to have to live with the poison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Oak mine in the Northwest Territories has gone out of 
business.  It will cost over $100 million to clean up the leaking 
arsenic in that area.  Who is left with that?  It is the Canadian 
citizens.  Obviously with the company out of business it is not 
going to be cost effective to clean that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this whole idea that we will not clean up our 
environment or expect business to be responsible for what they 
have produced because it might not be cost effective.  What is 
the definition of cost effective?  How many lives will we abandon 
to sickness or death on the terms that it would be too costly to 
put in any kind of preventative measures on their behalf? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I had the good fortune of listening to David Suzuki 
when he was on Parliament Hill.  It was very impromptu.  Members 
of parliament had the chance to listen to him.  What he 
emphasized, and I suppose has emphasized throughout his career, 
is:  that we somehow think our economy is independent from the 
earth that we live on; that we depend on the ozone layer for 
protection; that we depend on our sea for fish; that we depend on 
our lakes for fresh water; that we depend on the earth to grow 
our wheat; and that somehow we think that as a species we can 
live independently of our environment.  This is something we 
cannot do.  In order to have an economy we have to have an 
environment and we have to protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation does not protect the environment.  It does not 
prevent the poisons that are being generated in great numbers by 
our society.  I would suggest that this is pushed by greed and 
not by the concern for a quality of life on this planet that we 
truly can sustain for further generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join my colleagues in sadly not supporting the environmental 
protection act because it does not do what it said it would do. 
It has become a virtual protection act.

for over nine years, I understand completely what the 
hon. member for Yukon has just been talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aboriginal communities that she deals with on a regular 
day to day basis, can she not allay some personal concerns that 
they have addressed to her in regard to the Faro mines, the 
porcupine caribou herd and other instances of where we have 
abandoned those people when it comes to the environmental 
protection of the beautiful Yukon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the end of February, I 
travelled with the caribou commons project, which is an 
environmental lobby to protect the calving grounds of the 
porcupine caribou herd.  The people in the north depend on this 
caribou herd which has calved on a very small coastal plain just 
across the border in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they have, in effect, is this sense of powerless to protect 
their way of life and the sustainability of their economy which 
is one that depends on the fish, the berries and the caribou both 
spiritually and physically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what they could be facing in terms of cost 
effectiveness, someone might think that it would be a a heck of a 
lot more profitable to have oil fields than to depend on caribou 
for a living.  Under that logic, it would be perfectly acceptable 
to have roads through the habitat of the caribou, through their 
calving grounds and through their wintering grounds where North 
America has just one range left for the migrating herds. The 
north is then completely overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would stress again that the effects of toxins are 
disproportionately dangerous for the people who live in the north 
as compared to the places where they are actually produced. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the concerns I have about the legislation is that Canada 
is currently heading up a process to negotiate protocol on 
persistent organic pollutants in international protocol.  My 
concern is that some of the elements that parliament fixes in the 
legislation may find its way into that international process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has been involved with some of the Inuit 
organizations in the north, I have had the opportunity to travel 
in the north and to meet with some of these people.  I share a 
lot of their concerns around contaminants leaking their way into 
the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns does the member opposite have around persistent 
organic pollutants, how do some of the people in her riding deal 
with these issues and what would they like to see coming out of 
the international process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the effects of those 
pollutants are really insidious.  They are hard to diagnose. When 
a person goes to the doctor, the doctor will not be able to say 
that the person is suffering from heavy metal poisoning because 
of persistent organic pollutants.  It just does not happen. 
However, I happen to know there are very high rates of cancer, 
strange tumours, odd infections, people with chronic fatigue and 
environmental sensitivities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think this legislation does is it sets a standard.  How 
can we expect to go to an international arena and say that we 
have to phase out these pollutants when we have set a national 
standard that calls for virtual elimination, or that we will 
tolerate this much or three-quarters of this level in our 
environment rather than looking at them as something deadly which 
we cannot accept at all, period?  We have to get them out of 
production and not allow them to affect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing the legislation we set that standard.  If we set it 
for ourselves, how can we hold an international arena to a higher 
standard?

speak on behalf of my constituents of Sackville—Musquodoboit

legislation facing us probably in the history of my career as a 
politician, being a new one in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill came out of committee it actually had some teeth 
to it.  However, after the Liberals got a hold of it—with the 
exception of the members for Lac-Saint-Louis, Davenport and York

could not have this.  I find this absolutely disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not happen today or even tomorrow, but eventually down 
the road my children are going to ask me why our environment is 
more polluted than it was in 1999?  I will tell them that it was 
because the government of the day, along with the official 
opposition, sat back and did absolutely nothing.  They caved into 
industry standards and industry wishes and wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children will one day ask me what I did to stop them. I will 
reply that I tried to do everything in the parliamentary 
atmosphere to raise the issue.  The member for Churchill River, 
the member for Yukon, our leader from Halifax and the entire New 
Democratic Party, federally and provincially across the country 
from coast to coast to coast, have been raising the issue of the 
environment for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee members a $1,000 Canadian that nobody on the

was a woman with all the courage in the world who stood up to big 
polluters and big corporations in the early 1960s, when it was 
not popular to be green, and told the world what was happening to 
our natural environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to talk about a few things the government has been 
doing.  We have had three consecutive environment committee 
reports critical of inaction and non-protection.  This is a 
government that leaves sick children in their homes for over a 
year beside the Sydney tar ponds and Sysco site until the toxic 
goo shows up in their basements.  The Liberals say they are 
moving these people, not because of health reasons but for 
compassionate reasons.  It is absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not have the courage to stand up and accept 
responsibility for major catastrophic failures when it comes to 
the environment.  This is a government that chooses to leave over 
one million tonnes of radioactive waste leaking into Great Bear 
Lake in the Northwest Territories.  This is a government that 
says it takes protecting Canada's freshwater resources seriously. 
Unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great Bear Lake is Canada's fourth largest supplier of 
freshwater.  Rather than act, the government pays lip service to 
the community and promises and re-promises action.  Still nothing 
has been done to contain or remedy the problem.  The waste is 
on a federal government abandoned site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that last night voted, with the exception 
of three Liberal members, against evidence presented by its own 
scientists that hormone disrupting substances have been found 
leaving pig farms and entering into waterways.  No action was 
taken.  The Liberals voted against this information.  Whatever 
the Liberals do they do not want to upset the polluter.  My God, 
we would certainly not want to upset the polluters who have 
destroyed our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to protecting Canadians?  Why not place a warning 
that this is an occurring and recurring action?  Why can we not 
tell Canadians the truth about what we are doing to our 
environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP proposed a series of motions to follow the effort of the 
United States to provide a safer environment for their children. 
All we asked was to include consideration of the special 
susceptibility of children faced with environmental contaminants 
as a reference point when investigating substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members of the Liberal government or the Reform Party had 
a green bone in their body or morals beyond the lobby pockets, 
they could have acted proactively.  The choice to defeat this 
proactive precautionary measure was made on the same day an 
article appeared in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> dealing with the 
growing concern of pesticide risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote Julia Langer, toxicologist for World Wildlife Fund 
Canada: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the regulatory process is deeply flawed.  Pesticides are based 
on the average adult male's exposure and sensitivity to a 
product, a system that overlooks the vulnerability of children 
and women, and does not take into account a person's total 
exposure. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion would have been to consider children when spending 
the millions of dollars on research, with specific considerations 
proposed in the United States and other countries. The Liberal 
government says it will spend millions of dollars on research. 
What will the government do with the information when it gets it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous statement I gave mirrors the executive order signed 
by President William Jefferson Clinton in 1997, to direct 
government agencies to consider children's vulnerability and 
susceptibility in policy and regulatory considerations in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the environment minister to stand before Canadians in the 
House, or on television, and state that Bill C-32 is the best 
environmental legislation in the world is a statement that needs 
to be clarified. 
It is really the best polluter protection legislation in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 21, 1997 the President of the United States ordered by 
the authority vested in him as president by the constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America that a growing body of 
scientific knowledge demonstrated that children might suffer 
disproportionately from environmental health risks and safety 
risks.  He said that these risks arose because children's 
neurological, immunological, digestive and other bodily systems 
were still developing; that children eat more food, drink more 
fluids and breathe more air in proportion to their body weight 
than adults; that children's size and weight might diminish their 
protection from standard safety features; and that children's 
behavioural patterns may make them more susceptible to accidents 
because they are less able to protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, he said, that to the extent permitted by law and 
appropriate and consistent with the agency's mission, each 
federal agency should make it a high priority to identify and 
assess environmental health risks and safety risks that might 
disproportionately affect children and should ensure that its 
policies, programs, activities and standards addressed 
disproportionate risks to children which result from 
environmental a health risk or safety risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a postcard today from a friend of mine, Mr. Derek 
Jones of Newellton, Nova Scotia.  His big concern is the effects 
of dragging and the technological gear that we use when it comes 
to fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Off the east coast of Nova Scotia in Shelburne are some of the 
most beautiful coral reefs in the world.  Some of those reefs are 
called the bubble gum coral, the bushy acanella and the black tip 
coral.  They take hundreds of years to grow. In a few minutes a 
dragger will come buy and sweep these things away.  There is 
absolutely nothing in the bill to protect those species with 
which we share the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the government one last time.  I have two young 
daughters, Jasmin Aurora who is 11 and Amber Ocean who is 8.  My 
wife and I named those two children after the environment: Aurora 
for aurora borealis, the northern lights, and Amber Ocean because 
of the colour when the sunset goes down on the water.  It turns 
it into an amber colour and we call her Amber Ocean.  We believe 
firmly, strongly and lovingly in our environment, that the 
environment protects us.  The environment is us.  It is 
everything that we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For parliamentarians and legislators to fail in the protection 
of our children and other species with which we share the planet 
is an absolute disgrace.  I ask every member of the House to vote 
with theirs hearts, with foresight and with conviction, not to 
vote with what the cabinet said or what some industry person 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should do the right thing for once in their lives and vote 
against the bill, send it back to the committee, allow the 
committee to revamp it the way it was when it came out of 
committee, and not allow any more amendments to the bill from the 
government side.  All they did was water it down and weakened it. 
Instead of protecting our environment, in essence it protects the 
industry and the polluters of the country.  It is an absolute 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill River and his assistant, Mr. Dave 
Campbell, have spent a tremendous amount of time working on this 
bill and its amendments.  They have worked with various 
environmental groups, other agencies and industry to come up with 
solutions or a long term fix to our problems.  Mr. Campbell 
worked tirelessly on this portfolio day after day, month after 
month.  There is probably no one in the country who has worked 
harder on it than Mr. Campbell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Churchill River knows exactly what I am 
talking about because Mr. Campbell works for him.  They have 
formed a great team.  On behalf of the New Democratic Party from 
coast to coast to coast I wish to publicly thank the member for 
Churchill River, the member for Lac-Saint-Louis, the member for 
York North, the member for Davenport, and the other members who 
assisted in getting the bill out of committee as it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government got its hands on the bill 
afterward.  It changed it and made it much weaker.  The bill does 
nothing to protect the livelihood of aboriginal people, children, 
farmers, fishermen, and other people who use our resources on a 
day to day basis.  That is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not learn from history, we will reap what we sow and we 
will rue the day we made this decision.  Again I ask the Liberals 
to have a free vote, vote with their consciences, do what is 
right and think of their children.  In the words of my aboriginal 
friends from the Mi'kmaq nation of Nova Scotia, let us think in 
seven generation principles, think of our great, 
great-grandchildren before we vote today.

know the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
speaks very earnestly about the environment.  We all care about 
the environment.  I for one am concerned about air quality in 
Toronto where I live.  I also know the member opposite is a very 
practical person because I have had the pleasure of participating 
with him in extracurricular activities outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a hypothetical question for him.  Let us say that the 
hon. member is chairman of a company.  His chief executive 
officer or president makes a presentation to the board of 
directors on a project which, after all the analyses, will cost 
$600 million and involve 1,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chairman he would go over all the analyses and ask about the 
toxic chemicals being produced, whether they are satisfied with 
the level of toxicity and whether they have done all they can to 
ensure a clean environment in the factory site.   Then the 
president would answer that they are down to .0001, that they 
have the best available processes in place, and that they are 
following all the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if someone came up with a new measuring device which found 
something in there that was .000005?  Could they shut them down? 
Could they stop them from operating?  Could they force them to

the member feel if he could not be given that assurance?  What 
would you say then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind all members 
to address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member 
that if I were chairman of the board of a major industrial 
company the first objective of my company would be environmental 
protection at all cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, working in concert with the municipal, provincial and 
federal governments, I would ascertain the most environmentally 
friendly sustainable way not only of maintaining the environment 
in a sustainable manner but working with labour groups and all 
other groups to make sure we do not harm the environment in any 
way, shape or form.  That is the seven generation principle, and 
that is what we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should know that instead of eradicating pollutants the bill 
will allow the government to set the level of pollutants.  It 
gives extraordinary powers to the environment minister, he or 
she.  We know this one may not be around long after the next 
shuffle.  The government may set a level which does not meet any 
scientific or biological long term evidence to protect our 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were chairman of the board I would be working in concert

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we certainly heard a lot 
of rhetoric from the member opposite.  That is a very gentle way 
to describe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that the bill explicitly recognizes the right of 
aboriginal governments to participate directly in advising the 
minister on the operation and implementation of the act?  Does he 
recognize that this bill, unlike any other bill or anything we 
do, obligates the minister to conduct science on emerging issues 
like gender benders or endocrine disrupters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that the government provided money toward 
remediation for the community action group in Sydney to clean up 
the tar ponds, almost $40 million after lots of investment in 
terms of science? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is predicated on the principle of pollution prevention 
so we never have to get into these circumstances.  How could the 
member opposite say that he would vote against implementing and 
operationalizing pollution prevention?  How could he stand here 
today and say he will do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of the Environment has a way of leading 
a question with her chin.  Why did she override the amendments of 
the members for Lac-Saint-Louis, Davenport and York North which 
would have made the bill stronger?  Why did you do that?  Did you 
do it because of what you cared for or did— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Don't forget me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to say a few words about Bill C-32, 
the legislation to renew the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act or CEPA as it is commonly known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my remarks on the critical issue of enforcement of 
the law.  Effective enforcement of our environmental laws is 
something that Canadians have a right to expect.  It has been a 
matter of interest to many members of the House and of the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 represents a significant step forward because of the 
new enforcement tools it will provide.  This will translate into 
improved enforcement and better protection of our environment and 
our health.  CEPA is the cornerstone of federal environmental 
protection legislation.  It allows the government to set tough 
but fair standards for the benefit of all Canadians to protect 
our environment and our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its regulations CEPA sets rules that must be obeyed. The 
enforcement provisions of Bill C-32 will provide the powers to 
ensure these rules are indeed obeyed.  It provides authority to 
conduct inspections that are the backbone of our enforcement 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspections serve several functions.  First, they help to create 
an enforcement presence, evidence of the government's commitment 
to ensuring compliance by regulatees.  Second, they can identify 
specific environmental problems.  Third, they serve to identify 
non-compliance for further investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 expands investigative powers in CEPA to make sure that 
our enforcement officers can enter and inspect any place where 
there might logically be substances or activities regulated under 
CEPA.  Enforcement officers will now be able to seek inspection 
warrants from the courts when they are refused entry at a 
commercial site or when they arrive and find that the premises 
are locked or abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant improvement in the bill is the changes that 
will provide peace officer status to CEPA enforcement officers. 
These new powers will greatly improve their ability to detect 
environmental crimes.  It means, among other things, that CEPA 
enforcement officers will be able to seek warrants to conduct 
video surveillance or intercept private communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other peace officer powers, such as the authority to serve court 
summonses, issue notices to appear in court and seek search 
warrants by telephone, will allow enforcement officers to do 
their job more quickly and efficiently, especially when they are 
ensuring compliance in remote areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 not only introduces innovations during the inspection 
and investigation phase.  It also introduces changes for dealing 
with situations where CEPA has been violated.  Once there has 
been a violation of an environmental protection law, our goal is 
to return the violator to compliance as quickly as possible, 
without further recurrence of the violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally we have relied on criminal courts to order 
violators into compliance once they have been convicted of an 
offence.  Current thinking has led governments in Canada and 
elsewhere to supplement this process with other statutory tools 
designed to ensure compliance without burdening the courts with 
lengthy trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the most important additions to CEPA in this area are 
environmental protection compliance orders and environmental 
protection alternative measures.  Environmental protection 
compliance orders work like injunctions.  They allow an 
enforcement officer to order a person to stop violating the law 
or to follow the requirements of the law where the enforcement 
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that there is a 
violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with the principles of justice, there are limitations 
to the use of this power by an inspector.  The steps laid out in 
the order must be reasonable.  They must be consistent with 
protection of the environment and public safety.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum period that a compliance order can be in effect is 
180 days.  Nevertheless, environmental protection compliance 
orders are very powerful tools.  To ensure that they are used 
fairly, a person who is the subject of an order can appeal the 
order by asking for a review of that order by an independent 
review officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other major new type of enforcement tool is the 
environmental protection alternative measures, or EPAMs. 
Alternative measures are not new in Canadian law.  They already 
are present in the Criminal Code as well as the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection alternative measures are essentially 
negotiated settlements to criminal charges.  They are negotiated 
between the accused and the Attorney General of Canada. Bill C-32 
sets out strict conditions surrounding the negotiation of such 
alternative measures including that the measures can only be 
negotiated after charges are laid in the court.  The accused 
therefore knows that the government has thoroughly investigated 
the violation and has evidence to support these charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiation of EPAMs is voluntary, both for the attorney general 
and the accused.  The attorney general can choose not to offer 
negotiated EPAMs after taking into account the seriousness of the 
violation, damage to the environment and efforts made to correct 
the damage, the compliance history of the accused with CEPA and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the accused must freely consent to negotiate an EPAM 
after being advised of their right to be represented by legal 
counsel.  They must also accept the responsibility for their 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EPAMs are not backroom deals.  They are negotiated after the 
charges are made public and the agreements themselves are filed 
in the court and they too are public documents.  If the accused 
does not live up to the terms of the EPAM, the original charges 
can be reactivated.  On the other hand, if the terms of the EPAM 
are fulfilled and the accused is again in compliance with the 
law, the charges can be suspended or withdrawn entirely. There is 
no recorded conviction; there is no criminal record and there is 
compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also provides new guidance for the courts when 
sentencing convicted offenders.  The bill includes sentencing 
criteria that take into account such things as the cost to remedy 
the damage done to the environment.  The maximum under CEPA 
continues to be a fine of $1 million a day or up to five years 
imprisonment. A court can also levy a fine equal to any profits 
earned as a result of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 takes an innovative and progressive approach toward 
enforcement.  It greatly extends the powers of enforcement 
officers so they can ensure compliance with the law.  Overall, 
Bill C-32 strengthens CEPA so that we will be able to better 
protect both the environment and the health of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her fine speech. I have a 
number of questions for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of this comes from the work by the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development who excoriated the 
government in many ways on its failure to co-ordinate 
interdepartmental activities on the issue of sustainable 
environmental management and on the issue of developing a common 
policy and a hearing for those policies. The indictment was quite 
scathing.  It went all the way from a lack of interdepartmental 
co-ordination to a lack of agreement. In fact the commissioner 
said that the single greatest impediment to fulfilling and living 
up to our agreements within our country is interdepartmental 
warring, a lack of co-ordination between departments on a 
horizontal level and within a department on a vertical level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague what does her government 
plan on doing to rectify this very important problem that we have 
within the government today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the position the member 
refers to was actually established by the government. Many of the 
recommendations have been implemented in this bill.  It is 
something that the government will continue to take seriously as 
it moves toward protecting the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in the vote last night, one of the amendments took away the 
statement of phasing out toxic substances in the preamble.  The 
issue of phase-out was a major commitment made by the Liberals in 
the election campaign.  In the fading red book the only thing 
that stood out was this environmental promise. Since this promise 
has been broken and only three of the Liberals stood up to oppose 
CEPA, maybe the member could comment on why the phase-out of the 
deadliest toxins in the world is not in effect in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would just underscore 
the hon. member's comment that it was in the preamble and not 
actually part of the bill. The bill says we will virtually 
eliminate all detectable levels of the specific toxins.  That is 
virtual elimination.  I would go back to my comments about the 
strict enforcement of the CEPA bill itself and the fact that it 
will lead to better environment control and better protection for 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member for Kitchener Centre for 
her interest in and commitment to this particular topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her remarks the member talked about the issue of enforcement 
and implementation.  There are roles here for the federal 
government obviously in the context of federal statutes and laws, 
but also for the provincial governments and the ministers of 
environment, particularly in Ontario.  We have heard a lot of 
discussion and debate about the lack of commitment by the Ontario 
government in its cutbacks to the environment.  With respect, we 
have had to do some cutting back in our own federal Department of 
the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could comment on how well we are 
positioned in Ontario and in Canada to enforce the laws and 
regulations that we do promulgate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question and acknowledge that when we have a joint 
responsibility such as enforcement, this is something on which we 
will move with the provinces.  We have to have their buy in to it 
as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has over 64,000 buildings, over 25,000 
vehicles and disposes of over 90,000 tonnes of waste every single 
year.  It was also stated that the government could save over 
$300 million over 30 years if it was able to adhere to the 
principles of sustainable environmental consumption that it 
agreed to but is not fulfilling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the hon. member's government going to ensure that the 
federal government and the ministries themselves adhere to sound 
environmental principles and save $300 million and a lot of 
waste? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would point out that 
CEPA actually is an attempt by the government to put its house in 
order as well as to bring into alignment the environmental issues 
it deals with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his concern.  I wish he and his 
party would bring these concerns to question period and ask the 
minister herself these very important questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the

prevention and the protection of the environment and human health 
in order to contribute to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my formal comments I would like to thank the very 
many officials who have dedicated their energy, time and 
enthusiasm to this process.  Without them we would not be here 
today voting on this bill.  The minister and her staff and my own 
staff have made sure that this process has gone smoothly and that 
we have the best bill possible to vote on tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last 11 months Bill C-32 has been debated by all 
sides in the House.  After thoughtful consideration and often 
lively debate both in committee and in this chamber, Bill C-32 I 
believe gives Canadians environmental legislation that protects 
the health of Canadians today and for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some seven federal departments are touched by this bill: 
environment, health, agriculture and agri-food, fisheries and 
oceans, natural resources, industry, and intergovernmental 
affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need and deserve legislation that deals with the 
challenges of today and prepares for the challenges of the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the clause by clause process we spent some 93 hours, a 
Canadian record, examining the clauses of this bill.  We 
considered some 560 different amendments, some of which 
overlapped and 157 of which were passed.  The government proposed 
90 amendments.  It supported 60 amendments from members on all 
sides.  As the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies said “Let 
us look at this bill and see how it is an improvement on the 
current legislation and something that all of us as Canadians can 
build upon”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is founded on the concept that preventing pollution is 
better both for the environment and for the economy than trying 
to clean up after the damage has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA, the current legislation that is enacted in Canada, came 
into place in 1988. Our thinking about the environment has 
evolved since then. Science and technology have evolved since 
then.  Environmental law has advanced. Concepts like sustainable 
development and pollution prevention have become widely accepted. 
The environmental challenges are increasing rather than 
decreasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is a significant and positive step in renewing the 
current legislation.  It is on the leading edge of environmental 
protection legislation worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to their dire predictions and doomsday scenarios, at 
the end of the day this bill will ensure that industries in 
Canada will be more competitive and their employees will live in 
a healthier environment.  After years of debate, a clear 
framework will exist once this bill is passed.  Canadian 
businesses will meet the challenges.  There are environmental 
businesses in my riding that depend on strong regulatory 
frameworks.  That is what this bill will ensure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes a clear framework for managing toxic 
substances. It operationalizes pollution prevention, especially 
after amendments were requested by the environmental lobbyists 
who appeared before the committee.  It ensures cleaner air and 
water. It deals with fuels, engine emissions, sources of 
international air and water pollution.  It establishes a clear 
regime for environmental matters related to emergencies.  It 
deals with emerging biotechnology issues guarding against the 
adverse effects of biotechnology.  It deals with federal 
government lands and operations and aboriginal lands.  It 
introduces strict enforcement regimes and new peace officer 
status and powers for stricter enforcement.  It encourages public 
participation.  There is a new environmental register that is 
fully accessible on the Internet.  These are good things.  It 
will lead to good change in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important things is getting the worst toxic 
substances out of our environment.  This bill establishes a more 
efficient process to identify, screen, assess and manage toxic 
substances.  It virtually eliminates the most dangerous of those 
toxic substances.  It puts in a fixed timeframe to put in place 
controls and obligates the Minister of the Environment and this 
government to do research on emerging issues like gender bending 
or hormone disrupting substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might I remind all members that we have encouraged and left in 
place the amendments the committee brought forward, contrary to 
what members of the House are saying.  That the amendments last 
night somehow brought the bill back to before the committee 
process I say is hogwash.  This bill is a good bill.  It was 
improved in the process and we have maintained that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new authority will improve control of pollutants and waste. 
It will monitor motor vehicles and other engine emissions to 
develop a new national emissions mark for engines meeting 
emission requirements.  It will provide a national fuels mark to 
show that fuels meet environmental standards.  It will provide 
better protection of the marine environment from land based 
sources of pollution and will increase the power to control the 
transboundary movement of hazardous waste and hazardous 
recyclables.  It will provide the power to control the import and 
export of non-hazardous waste and the authority to require 
reduction plans from exporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an increased role for aboriginal peoples.  It improves 
the opportunities for public involvement.  There is comprehensive 
whistleblower protection provisions that will encourage more 
Canadians to report CEPA violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk a bit about virtual elimination. 
Virtual elimination means reducing releases to the environment of 
a small number of the most dangerous toxic substances to levels 
where these releases cannot be measured.  It relates to the most 
toxic substances.  It is a leading edge process and it puts in 
place Canada's toxic substances management policy.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extremely small releases of certain substances to the 
environment create problems that are extremely costly or 
impossible to correct.  It is particularly true for substances 
that are toxic as defined under CEPA and are primarily the result 
of human activity.  They are persistent, meaning that they take a 
long time if ever to break down and they bioaccumulate.  They 
collect in living organisms and end up in the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about DDT, an insecticide introduced in the 1940s 
into Canada.  It was responsible for causing drastic reductions 
in many bird populations, especially those in the higher levels 
of the food chain.  We banned DDT in 1970 in Canada and still it 
is being detected in the breast milk of people in our northern 
regions.  It is still causing havoc for the birds and the bald 
eagles which like to nest in the Great Lakes area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot always accurately predict at precisely what level 
these very dangerous substances pose a significant risk, but we 
have put in place the precautionary principle.  We base the 
decisions on science but we do not require full scientific 
certainly.  That is what the legislation ensures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The virtual elimination provisions of Bill C-32 are entirely 
consistent with the government's toxic substances management 
policy in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about gender benders or hormone disrupting 
substances.  Some chemicals disrupt the hormones in our bodies. 
Some of them have a long term effect and some of them have a 
short term effect.  Beer would have a short term effect.  Other 
things might have a longer term effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing research.  We are making sure our researchers are 
doing the best job.  They are part of international panels.  They 
are doing the research in my riding of Burlington.  They will 
better understand this emerging threat and other threats that we 
do not even know about.  They will evaluate toxics against this 
new emerging information.  They will protect the health of 
Canadians and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the existing CEPA, Bill C-32 places strict deadlines on 
the government to act to protect the environment and human 
health.  The bill is consistent with the government's commitment 
to sustainable development when making decisions.  The new CEPA 
requires consideration of environment and health effects.  Unlike 
the existing laws, CEPA provides several opportunities for 
consultation and to develop more effective measures to protect 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members stand in the House tonight, they can stand and vote 
for the bill with confidence because it gives the government new 
tools and powers.  The bill is about pollution prevention.  The 
bill has public input and as a final bill it protects human 
health.  It focuses on pollution prevention and it introduces and 
ensures a strict toxic management regime.

where it does not even have 1% of true quality left.

preamble and an interesting question.  I think somewhere I was 
called unthoughtful but I am not sure.  I will try to ignore that 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this is yet again the Bloc's interpretation of federal 
and provincial responsibilities.  The bill is not about 
duplication.  The bill acknowledges that the federal and 
provincial governments have some responsibilities.  In some cases 
they overlap.  We are working to have a seamless across the 
country of laws which will create, ensure and improve the 
environment and the human health of Canadians.  I urge the hon.

Speaker, I have a question for the parliamentary secretary. There 
are over 23,000 substances in the country today.  Many were found 
acceptable prior to the 1960s when our ability to analyse their 
effects on human health were less than they are today.  What does 
the parliamentary secretary feel about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departments have made commitments to engage in sustainable 
environmental actions but only 11% of those actions are being 
fulfilled.  What will the government do to ensure that 
governments live up to the commitments they said they would live 
up to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32 places some 
strict timelines on the evaluation of the 23,000 substances in 
existence in Canada.  It ensures they are evaluated against the 
potential health and environment risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to general government policy, the member should know 
that the last two budgets included some $40 million for this 
evaluation.  We recently announced a project the other day. I am 
glad the member will be heralding that in news releases in his 
riding.  It ensures the government is doing research on some of 
these very important substances.  Health Canada, Environment 
Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada are involved because we 
all know this environment is the only environment we have.  We 
must protect the environment and the human health of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-32.  After what I 
have heard today I must say the government is falling far short 
of the commitments it has made.  I bring to the attention of the 
House numerous studies on the abysmal activities of the 
government on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I only have 10 minutes so I will get to the heart 
of the matter.  The Department of the Environment has been an 
utter failure in the enforcement, monitoring and control of the 
environmental policies it has enacted.  I will divide the 
environment into two sections: domestic and international. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development 
put forth a very concise and specific report with specific 
solutions on how to revamp and improve the environment within our 
country and our activities abroad.  After all, as we know, the 
environment is transboundary.  It affects not only ourselves but 
other countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first part, managing toxic substances, over 23,000 
substances have been approved.  Many of them were approved before 
1960, which means we really do not know the effects of these 
substances on human health.  We need to re-examine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest obstacles toward a sustainable environmental 
program is the lack of co-ordination between departments and 
within departments.  Turf wars, lack of co-ordination, lack of 
common vision, lack of agreement and lack of a dispute resolution 
mechanism on agreements have ensured that the agreements reached 
are unenforceable, are not being listened to, and are simply in 
many cases not worth the paper they are written on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an issue of public service, public management and the 
failure of management in many of the ministries today.  There is 
the lack of monitoring and the unfulfilled commitments. 
Commitments are made but not adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have a sustainable environmental policy when the 
government's own departments are simply not listening to what 
they have been told to adhere to?  Furthermore, no one is 
monitoring them and no one is saying that if two departments are 
not agreeing on something an independent dispute mechanism will 
be put in place to ensure that they do.  If that were to happen 
it would go a long way to fulfilling the commitments we have made 
on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no common vision and there is a lack of consensus among 
departments.  The commissioner said that the single greatest 
impediment to a sustainable environmental policy was the lack of 
departmental co-ordination which exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of federal-provincial agreements there is no 
ongoing analysis of whether the federal and provincial 
governments are actually fulfilling the commitments they have 
made.  No one is watching them.  There are no dispute resolution 
mechanisms among provinces or between the federal government and 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitments are made and no concrete action is taken. Only 11% 
of the commitments made by departments have been fulfilled.  Some 
89% have not been fulfilled.  There is a lack of co-ordination 
among departments and inadequate review is endemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to turn talk into action.  The federal government has 
64,000 buildings, 25,000 vehicles, and disposes of 95,000 tonnes 
of waste every year.  The commissioner said that if the 
government were to adhere to the principles that have been put 
forth it would save taxpayers some $300 million over the next 30 
years, not to mention making our streets, our air and our land a 
lot safer for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We can look at what is 
happening in other countries.  In the Netherlands and Denmark the 
agricultural sector has done an outstanding job of putting 
together concise environmental plans.  The World Bank is starting 
to do it.  South Africa has done an outstanding job with respect 
to its endangered species legislation and in terms of garnering, 
improving and expanding habitat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the consent of the House I will be sharing my time with 
the member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally we have to look at what will happen in the 
future.  There is an increasing population growth rate. Currently 
our world population is 6 billion people.  In the middle of the 
next century the world population will hit 11 billion.  How will 
we make sure that we have an environment that is liveable with a 
population of 11 billion?  People will strive for an improved 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest democracy in the world, India, has an incredibly 
expanding middle class that will number over 300 million people 
in the next century.  Approximately 300 million people, 10 times 
the population of Canada, will be demanding the same standard of 
living as we have.  That will put an extraordinary demand upon 
not only renewable, but also non-renewable resources.  If we do 
not institute sustainable environmental policies and adhere to 
those policies we will have a degraded environment in which it 
will simply not be worth living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some, such as Tad Homer Dixon from the University of Toronto 
Institute of Conflict Studies, have claimed that the diminishing 
of non-renewable resources will result in conflict. We can see as 
an example the water situation in the Middle East and how this is 
an issue on which wars may be fought.  It is something that we 
need to look at and, indeed, the countries in the area need to 
look at very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of endangered species the government's behaviour is 
abysmal.  This issue affects not only the federal government, but 
also the provinces.  Because of the balkanization of our country, 
how things have been divided between the federal government and 
the provinces, there is an enormous amount of overlap between 
those two levels of government, as well as the municipalities, 
and endangered species are not being protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's great tome to endangered species is to 
protect less than 5% of the land in this country.  That is 
nothing.  Species rely upon land to survive.  The degradation of 
land, damage to the environment and the shrinkage of their 
habitat are the greatest threats to these species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are members across the way who feel very 
passionately about this.  The federal government clearly needs to 
work with the provinces in developing a strategy that will 
involve a much larger area of land over which the federal 
government or the provinces, one or the other, will have distinct 
control so that laws can be applied, people will adhere to them 
and the laws will be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two topics I would like to broach.  One is 
co-ordination between government and the private sector.  Not 
enough has been done about that.  Again I bring up the subject of 
South Africa.  The people of the province of KwaZulu/Natal have 
done an outstanding job of marrying the needs of the private 
sector and the public sector.  Co-operation between the private 
and the public sectors has led to a huge increase in habitat and 
has greatly improved the safety of the flora and fauna.  It is 
the last repository for large mammals in that area of the world. 
If it was not for what has been done in that province, many of 
these mammals would have been extinct a long time ago, as well as 
much of the flora. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to look at the innovative ways in which 
South Africa has engaged in public-private partnerships and 
conservancies and how the parks and habitat have been used to 
benefit the people in the surrounding area.  This has done a 
great deal for the sustainable environment program, which has 
benefited people as well as the flora and fauna and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to turn talk into action.  It needs to 
implement the strategies.  It needs to monitor the strategies. It 
needs to establish clear targets.  It needs to develop 
interdepartmental co-ordination, not the hodge-podge situation we 
have now, with the infighting which is making the environmental 
policy of the government a pox on its house.

I listened with interest to the member's speech and particularly 
to the part where he talked about a project in South Africa, 
which I think is an excellent example of public and private 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday evening I had a chance to attend the state dinner 
hosted by the Prime Minister for the President of Colombia.  I 
happened to be sitting beside a gentlemen and his wife who live 
in Bogota and own a small coffee plantation.  These individuals 
are from a well established family.  The gentleman was telling me 
that the U.S. based Smithsonian Institution is prepared to 
certify plantations such as his because he is willing to invest 
money in his plantation to assist with the migratory bird 
problem, a problem resulting unfortunately from deforestation in 
the tropical areas of South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In line with the member's comments, I thought it was an 
excellent example of economy and ecology working together to 
provide a better situation, not only for our animal life but for 
human beings as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The certification of his plantation by the Smithsonian 
Institution will allow this individual to sell coffee at a higher 
price because it will be certified by the institution.  Resources 
will then be available for this man to invest in his plantation 
to improve the trees and the husbandry of the plants for the 
benefit of the migratory birds who need that type of forest 
cover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member could comment further on that type 
of partnership.  Does the member believe that Bill C-32 will not 
allow that kind of thing?  I believe it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my view Bill C-32 
misses the mark completely.  Sustainable environmental management 
are pretty words but they lack substance.  What the World 
Wildlife Fund did in Belize, Central America, and what was done 
in KwaZulu/Natal are models of sustainable environmental 
management.  Unfortunately we have not adopted this in our 
country.  We have not embraced the concept, nor have we, in my 
view, engaged companies in the private sector to make them 
understand the benefits on their bottom line of having stable 
socioeconomic conditions and a stable environment.  If that 
stabilization takes place, it will translate into more money on 
their bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to speak to the member at length, but I draw 
his attention to those examples because they have saved dozens of 
species of flora and fauna and indeed have improved the health 
and welfare of the people, which has resulted in greater profits 
for the companies working in those areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members have indicated that such objectives could never 
be met by the bill and by the environment department.  I would 
like the hon. Reform member to tell my why he and his party 
would vote for Bill C-32 when it is the total opposite of what he 
is calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supporting this bill because something is better than 
nothing.  We are putting forth constructive leadership solutions 
that the government can take if it chooses, which exist not only 
within our country, within our own departments, but also 
internationally.  These measures could dramatically improve the 
environmental programs which I hope the government would like to 
pursue.

we are not doing.  Again, pragmatic solutions exist.  They are 
found in South Africa, Central America, Europe, Denmark and the 
Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Bank is starting to institute some fine programs. 
Indeed, the World Bank is engaging in a very innovative program 
of marrying the private sector with the public sector.  It has 
taken as an example what UNICEF has done in Botswana, which has 
taken a leadership role on this issue.  I encourage the 
government to look at what Dr. Steve Simon, the UNICEF 
representative in Botswana, has done on this issue.  It has been 
really innovative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
delight to be able to rise to speak to a matter which is of the 
greatest importance to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that every member here, especially all those myriads 
of Liberals on the other side, represented mostly by their green 
suits today, would definitely agree that we want to protect the 
environment.  We want to protect the people of our country from 
being poisoned.  That really is what environmental protection is 
about.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who would 
disagree with that basic fundamental principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may be so bold, Mr. Speaker, I would like to open my 
favourite magazine to the centrefold.  It happens to be the blue 
book of the Reform Party.  Right in the centre is our policy on 
pollution and the environment.  I would encourage people to get a 
copy of this book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am holding it so the camera does not pick it up.  It is not 
being used as a prop.  It is not even as bad as a flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage people to pick this up because there is much 
misinformation about Reform's commitment to the preservation of 
the environment.  The reason is that some people keep 
perpetrating the myth of what they think they would like to 
criticize us for, instead of looking at the facts.  The facts 
are, what are the policies and principles— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not wish to interrupt the hon. member, but he has 
made reference to the Reform Party's blue book.  I wonder when he 
is finished using it for his speech if he would be so kind as to 
table it so that all hon. members could— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order, but I am sure the hon. member for Elk Island will find 
it very hard not to comply with the invitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite willing to table 301 
copies with the clerk.  We do not need 301 because 59 of us 
already have them.  Certainly they are available.  They are in 
the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may want to have it quicker than that.  Maybe there is 
somebody right now in the wonderful provinces of Alberta or 
Saskatchewan listening to this speech, saying “I sure wonder 
what the Reformers say about the environment”.  Get on the old 
Internet and go to www.reform.ca and there it is.  Our blue book 
is right on our web page and anybody in the country can look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that there are some very important 
principles that are given here.  I will read a few of them 
because I will not have time in my limited time to read the whole 
section.  It is a wonderful centrefold.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the principle of establishing and 
regularly reviewing standards that are based on sound science and 
which are technologically and socio-economically viable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only responsible statement that can be made on the 
environment.  People can become extremists on one side of the 
story or on the other, saying on the one side that we do not care 
about the environment, or that we will not allow anything on the 
other side.  There has to be some reasonable middle ground.  We 
need to balance all of these various factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening all day to the debate and it has been very 
interesting, especially because of the different points of view 
that have been presented.  While I was listening to these 
speeches today I wondered what we would really have to do to make 
our planet totally pristine again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would definitely have to stop using vehicles which pump an 
awful lot of pollution into the environment. It is now generally 
known that I am now six-tenths of a century old, but in my short 
lifetime I have noticed how much we have decreased the amount of 
pollution per vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a car when I was just a young man with a family.  I will 
not mention the make because it is not nice to pick on any 
particular make or model.  However, it regularly delivered 15 
miles per gallon.  I did a little calculation.  Every time I 
drove that vehicle 100 kilometres, although we did not measure 
distance in kilometres in those years, I would use 18.8 litres of 
fuel with the corresponding amount of pollution that came from 
them.  This was at a time when we were bringing in non-leaded 
fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have purchased one or two or three cars over the last 34 
years.  The big car we have now uses exactly half as much fuel. 
The old one got 15 miles per gallon; this one gets 30.  It is 
still a reasonably big car suitable for four or five people.  It 
uses 9.4 litres every 100 kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to use the name of my little runabout because it is a 
wonderful little car. I will do some advertising for them.  My 
little Mazda 323 gets about 45 miles per gallon.  That is 6.3 
litres every 100 kilometres.  We are down to approximately 
one-third as much pollution for every 100 kilometres driven. That 
came about without any government regulation and without any 
inspectors.  There are hundreds of vehicles like mine that are 
now being driven on the streets of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proudest moment is when I hop on my little Honda 125.  It has 
a nice little 4 cycle engine.  It is totally clean burning.  It 
is difficult to believe, but I get 100 miles per gallon with it. 
That works out to around 3 litres every 100 kilometres.  When I 
am going somewhere all by myself I use that bike or my slightly 
larger bike which is just a little less economical in fuel.  I 
feel so good when I do that because I am not polluting the 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that it is a personal responsibility to do whatever we 
can individually.  I agree with legislation like Bill C-32 which 
says we should have regulations to prevent those who would 
blatantly break the law.  There are some.  I have met them myself 
as have all other members, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard speeches today by people whom I have seen just 
outside the doors here huffing and puffing on a cigarette.  It is 
incredible.  It is the greatest concentration of air pollution. 
Those burning leaves are approximately 20 centimetres from the 
nose and mouth. The smoke is being sucked in instead of blown 
out.  It is absolutely absurd.  Yet they are here talking about 
pollution, Bill C-32 and regulating the environment.  Let us get 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very good when I use my little vehicles and I do not 
pollute the air.  That is a personal responsibility.  Just as 
with cigarette smoking we ought to improve education in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our school rooms across the country more and more attention 
is being paid to educating and informing our young people not 
only about the evils of smoking and that form of pollution but 
all different kinds of pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to believe, looking at me sideways, that I am a 
physical fitness nut.  My favourite form of transportation is my 
bicycle.  I used my bicycle to go to work for many years, long 
before it was fashionable. There were not even bicycle racks at 
the place where I worked when I started using my bicycle to go to 
work every day, 6.8 miles each day.  It was a wonderful physical 
workout.  That is why I am in such fine aerodynamic shape today. 
It was wonderful to travel along and to realize there was almost 
zero pollution when I was using my bicycle, depending on how 
close someone was following me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember also when catalytic converters came out.  I really do 
not know what it is about them but I have had the personal 
experience of travelling behind vehicles with them.  For part of 
my trip I had to go on public roads. I was pumping away and 
breathing hard because to get this old motor going uses a lot of 
oxygen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I got behind one of the old vehicles, even though it felt a 
little uncomfortable it did not stop me from breathing.  When the 
catalytic converters came out they choked me.  All the scientists 
said it was much better, but I still remember when I was 
following a car up the hill from the high level bridge in 
Edmonton that if a car passed me with a catalytic converter I had 
to drop right back because I could not breathe it in.  My body 
rejected the pollution coming from that vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do what we can in order to reduce pollution.  I 
recommend that we go to bicycles, every one of us. This week for 
the first time I was surprised to see a fellow member of 
parliament on one of the city's buses.  It happened to be a 
fellow Reformer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed.  We talk about it but who uses public transit in 
order to reduce pollution?  Each of us likes to get in individual 
cabs or big limousines and drive around.  We use these large 
vehicles one at a time.  Why do we not personally take the 
responsibility, as I do whenever possible, to use public 
transportation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know where things are headed today, but something is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member has just said that the only platform 
that could be a responsible statement on the environment is to 
be found in his party's blue book.  It contains all the answers, 
if I understood him correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to ask the Reform Party member why he is 
going to support Bill C-32.  Will he say, like his colleague with 
whom he shared his time earlier, that half a loaf is better than 
none, and that that is why he supports Bill C-32? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the short time I had I could 
only speak on one topic and I chose to speak about 
transportation, one of the larger contributions to pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are industrial processes and others that use chemicals. 
Bill C-32 begins to address in a realistic way some, not all, of 
our concerns with industrial processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to tell the member and others that in my riding I have 
some very important petrochemical industries.  If we are to be so 
hard on them that they can no longer operate, are we then ready 
to stop flying our airplanes, driving cars and having houses 
heated with hydrocarbon fuels?  Will we put out our fireplaces 
and our bonfires?  They are also a form of pollution.  There is a 
limit to how far one can go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is a step in the right direction.  It does not perhaps 
go as far as it ought to in some areas.  Again, looking at me 
sideways, better half a loaf than none. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member raised the topic of regularly reviewing 
environmental regulations based on sound science.  The evidence I 
have seen in committee over the past year leads me to believe he 
is referring to political science.  By no means have they 
strengthened the CEPA bill as it has been presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closing clause of the respective amendment says that a 
review would take place in the other House.  The next review of 
CEPA may not take place here.  By that time the Liberals could 
dominate the other place and elected members would not have a say 
on what the next CEPA review would be like.  Could the hon. 
member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a very firm advocate of 
sound science as I am a math-physics major and I know just enough 
about chemistry to get me into trouble. 
The member is absolutely right when he says that about the Reform 
Party.  We are committed to that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a personal view which I do not think is 
in our policy.  I would like to see an auditor general of the 
environment, totally independent of the political world, so that 
decisions on the environment are not based on who has the 
strongest lobby group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about my little Mazda.  I did not replace the spark 
plugs for 75,000 kilometres.  Then I put the same ones back in 
because they were still good and used them until 100,000 
kilometres.  Yet I was being told that MMT, which was in the fuel 
ever since that vehicle was new, would foul these things up in 
20,000 kilometres.  That is not sound science. If that were true 
it should have happened right away and it did not.  I believe in 
sound science. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, did the member opposite 
get his information or a copy of the bill on the government green 
lane at www.ec.gc.ca/cepa? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the member opposite at our committee hearing the other day 
when the auditor for the environment, the person we put in place, 
Mr. Brian Emmett, the Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, made his report?  He audited the 
government and made recommendations, some of which we have 
already followed through on and many of which are in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was he thinking about the red book commitment which we fulfilled 
when he was talking about that auditor position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is wishful thinking. I 
have not read the pink book.  I think it is starting to fade a 
little, with some of the records in it going awry. Unfortunately 
I have other duties in committee.  I am on the finance committee 
and I seldom get to the environment committee.  It is really 
quite a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the commissioner is that he is a political 
appointment.  There is a problem with that because one knows 
where one's bread is buttered.  I would like to see a totally— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Shame on the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Am I wrong?  If I am wrong I want to be 
corrected.  I think that position should be totally 
non-political, apolitical, dedicated to accurate and true 
science. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know in a couple of minutes we have to break for the 
vote.  I would like to be on record, as I will later when we 
vote, as being in support of Bill C-32.  It is a very important 
step in the history of improving the relationship between people 
and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a famous Chinese proverb which says that a journey of 
1,000 miles starts with the first step.  This is not a first 
step.  Previous governments over the years have tried to deal 
with the needs of society and the needs of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill certainly is not perfect.  Maybe it will take 
generations for us to find the best way to deal with the 
environment, but it is important that Bill C-32 pass and that 
this very important step be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My northern Ontario riding includes the north shore of Lake 
Huron and the eastern shore of Lake Superior.  It is a beautiful 
area.  It is important to my constituents that strong, effective 
environmental legislation be in place.  I have confidence that 
Bill C-32 will be that important step which my constituents need 
as we enter the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my communities depend on the forestry and mining 
sectors.  At all times we have to balance the need for jobs and 
economic development with the needs of the environment.  We 
cannot go back to the days when the population was small, when 
numbers were few.  We are where we are.  I believe that Bill C-32 
provides us with the best balance possible at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues across the way to support the 
government in this initiative.

of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
knowing how I tend to speak I will take the four minutes instead 
of the three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I was indicating to the House the importance of 
the motion put forward by my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I indicated how we in this 
party would be supporting it.  We had introduced very similar 
legislation through a private member's bill by the leader of our 
party, the hon. member for Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked a little about those of us in mining communities, those 
of us who come from towns where we know the price paid when mine 
safety regulations are not adhered to.  I was concluding by 
saying that what we need is not further study on this.  That is 
the only criticism I have of the motion. What we need is action. 
That is exactly what the bill put forward by the New Democratic 
Party would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who will wonder whether or not other nations 
have legislation.  They do.  I point out briefly in the short 
time I have that both Australia and Great Britain are taking 
steps to address the problem of illegal criminal actions by 
corporations that result in the deaths of their workers. The 
focus here is Westray but it could apply to many other industries 
and many other corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy among many tragedies in Westray was that the 
victims' families sought to see justice done.  They sought to see 
the major players in that corporation brought to court and tried 
for determination as to their guilt or their innocence. 
Unfortunately, the Canadian judicial system could not do that 
because there is no law that holds a corporation liable for the 
murder of its workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have indicated that Australia and Great Britain are moving in 
that direction.  The Australian criminal code of 1995 allows 
corporations to be held liable for criminal conduct if it can be 
proven that the practices or culture of the company encouraged or 
at least did not prohibit the alleged offence. Had we that piece 
of legislation in this country, then the corporate owners who in 
the finding of Justice Richards wilfully neglected the welfare of 
their workers, could have been brought to justice by Justice 
Richards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Law Reform Commission in 1996 recommended to 
parliament in that country the creation of an offence of 
corporate killing where the behaviour of the corporation falls 
below that which would be expected of a corporation in the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the government when they are considering the 
changes to the Cape Breton Development Corporation that they bear 
in mind by divesting themselves of their responsibility, they 
move the mining legislation to the provincial legislation and the 
same accident can happen in Cape Breton that happened in Westray.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to 
Motion No. 455 regarding accountability for workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion raises an issue that is of interest to 
a great many of us in this House.  I would like to thank him for 
bringing this matter before the House and for drawing attention 
to the question of safety in the workplace, an important issue 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the hon. member's concern and sadness for the Westray 
disaster.  None of us can look back on that event, especially 
after hearing the results of the public inquiry that followed, 
and not want to do something to prevent a similar disaster from 
ever happening again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to know that I share his desire to 
act and that I am in support of the spirit of this motion which 
has the goal of ensuring that corporate executives and directors 
are held properly accountable for workplace safety. That said 
however, I cannot support Motion No. 455 because of its possible 
implications beyond federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at ways to achieve safer and healthier workplaces, 
legislative change is one way to address the problem of 
accountability.  Legislative change such as the hon. member 
opposite is proposing is quite complex and not easily achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there are 14 different jurisdictions covering 
occupational safety and health.  Legislation on these matters is 
covered by the federal, provincial and territorial governments 
which makes the situation very complex.  For example, the North 
American agreement on labour co-operation, a labour side 
agreement to NAFTA, still has not been ratified by all of our 
provinces and territories even after several years.  In other 
words, securing an agreement for legislative change at the 
federal level is one thing but implementation is a different 
matter entirely due to the issue of jurisdiction. This is not to 
say that occupational health and safety does not require our 
attention as members of parliament.  Certainly not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 on average one out of 18 Canadian workers was injured in 
the workplace meaning that a workplace accident occurred every 
nine seconds.  There were a total of 800,000 injuries that year 
with 18 million working days lost, the equivalent of one year's 
work for 71,000 Canadians.  Sadly, workers between the ages of 15 
and 24 are most at risk for work related accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the high human cost, there is also a significant 
impact on the economy.  In 1997 workplace accidents resulted in 
$5 billion in direct compensation payments to victims and an 
additional $5 billion in indirect costs to the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numbers like these are cause for concern for all of us. Given 
the human and economic costs involved, we should explore the 
potential need for new legislative approaches to ensure health 
and safety in our workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the hon. member opposite that we are looking at 
the Westray tragedy specifically.  My colleague the Minister of 
Justice has written to the Attorney General of Nova Scotia 
offering her commitment to study recommendation 73 of the Westray 
report.  As well she is instructing federal officials to develop 
options for legislative reform. A number of stakeholders and 
experts will be consulted in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The explosion in the Westray mine on May 9, 1992 killed 26 
miners.  A public inquiry clearly established that incompetence 
and mismanagement created the unsafe working environment that was 
the direct cause of this terrible tragedy.  The inquiry's report 
also set out 74 recommendations for improving mine safety and 
preventing such a sad accident from ever happening again. The 
last two recommendations deal with corporate accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 74 suggested that the Government of Nova Scotia 
review its occupational health and safety legislation to ensure 
that corporations are held accountable for any failure to secure 
and maintain a safe workplace.  This recommendation is outside 
the scope of today's debate but I mention it because it 
illustrates the role that provincial legislatures have to play in 
the area of workplace safety and corporate accountability.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 states that the Government of Canada, through 
the Department of Justice, should institute a study of the 
accountability of corporate executives and directors for the 
wrongful or negligent acts of the corporation, and should 
introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to the 
legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives 
and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have noted, this recommendation is being studied both in 
terms of the responsibility of the corporation itself and also 
the liability of the people it employs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is not the only way to address the issue of 
workplace safety.  We can also achieve great benefit by working 
proactively to promote a better understanding and awareness of 
its importance.  Over the years, we have seen the correlation 
between increased education and awareness and an improved 
occupational health and safety record.  By focusing more 
attention on training and education, we can and will reduce the 
incidence of accidents.  There is no question that educating 
people, teaching them how to work safely, is a key component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that the government has already made a 
priority.  In recent years, the labour program has worked closely 
with its partners in the public and private sectors to raise 
awareness about the rights and responsibilities for the health 
and safety in Canadian workplaces.  The emphasis has been on the 
prevention of injury and illness.  By seeking to increase 
awareness and understanding among employers and employees, as 
well as the public at large, we reinforce the message that 
individual actions can be just as important as legislation when 
it comes to improving workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Guelph—Wellington there are several examples of 
the effectiveness of using education and awareness to improve 
workplace safety.  For example, Blount Canada continues to 
implement and expand its three year old ergonomic improvement 
process aimed at preventing injuries, not only by improving 
equipment but also by providing additional training opportunities 
to its employees.  Blount has seen that even a small increase in 
awareness translates into a big improvement in safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 16, Genesta Manufacturing, also located in 
Guelph—Wellington, will celebrate three years without a single 
lost time accident.  Its systemic health and safety system, 
combined with weekly staff safety meetings, monthly safety audits 
and monthly management reviews have made safety everybody's very 
first priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Huntsman Corporation, another example from my riding, involves 
all of its employees in its health and safety initiatives.  Its 
joint health and safety committee meets three times more often 
than is required by law.  Hunstman also has a safety recognition 
program for the employees who remain accident-free.  This 
commitment to safety carries over into the community by working 
closely with the local fire and police departments and other 
municipal officials to develop emergency response plans in the 
event that an accident does occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of Motion No. 455 is commendable.  The goal of 
creating a safer workplace is one we all share in all parties, 
whether we use legislation, education or, most effectively, a 
combination of the two.  I wholeheartedly support the idea of 
working on the problem and know that the government will continue 
to address the issue of workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, safety is a concern to all of us.  Education is one 
of the most important components and we will continue to 
investigate this area.  We must. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member opposite speaking about 
the motion and her idea that she could support the principle of 
the motion but not the motion itself.  I think there is something 
wrong with that logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened with interest to the member of the NDP who 
talked about a similar NDP motion and how they supported this 
motion in principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it should be made very clear to the members of the House 
and to all the people listening to this debate that the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough filed this private member's 
bill during the first month of parliament.  The New Democratic 
Party waited a full six months before it filed a similar bill. 
It is important to get that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise for the second hour of debate on behalf of 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to discuss Motion 
No. 455, a motion introduced by my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain what happened on that dreadful morning 
back in May 1992.  It may help everyone in the House gain a 
better understanding of what provoked this motion.  On May 9, 
1992 at 5.20 a.m., a violent explosion ripped under the tiny 
community of Plymouth, just east of the town of Stellarton, Nova 
Scotia.  The explosion occurred in the depths of the Westray coal 
mine, instantly killing the 26 miners working there at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 455 was introduced to ensure that something like this 
never happens again.  Workplace safety must be the norm across 
the country no matter what profession one chooses.  Every 
Canadian has the right to feel safe at work, and every corporate 
executive must take the initiative to ensure those standards are 
met.  Motion No. 455 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 in the report of the inquiry commissioner, 
Justice Peter Richard, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study of accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of 
the corporation and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada 
such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable 
for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see nothing in that proposed bill that would prevent any 
member of parliament from supporting this excellent piece of 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 does not endorse any particular legislative 
action by parliament.  However, I will proceed by stressing that 
Motion No. 455 wishes to address the concerns referred to by 
Justice Peter Richard in his report, with an emphasis on the 
personal liability of key corporate officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to create a new criminal offence for corporate 
officials for failing to maintain safe workplaces would, by 
definition, require adding new provisions to the Criminal Code. 
This could be done by adding new sections to the Criminal Code 
under sections 467.5 and 467.6. Section 467.6 would extend 
criminal liability for this corporate failure to every officer or 
director of the corporation who knew or ought to have known, 
based on their experience, qualifications and duties, about the 
unsafe conditions in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to address the matter would be to amend the Criminal 
Code provisions which define criminal negligence, section 219, 
and culpable homicide, section 222, in a way which specifically 
addresses death or bodily harm caused by a failure to maintain 
workplace safety on the part of a director or an executive of a 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drawback to this approach, however, is that it does not deal 
with situations where death or injury do not result.  As well, if 
one wished to strengthen the accountability of corporate 
officials for workplace safety violations of their corporations, 
one could amend section 149.2 of the Criminal Code to include 
additional circumstances in which their liability would be 
triggered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members are aware that most corporate officials 
support and foster safe working conditions.  However, others have 
a more cavalier attitude toward fair labour practices and 
workplace safety.  This approach cannot be condoned in any 
capacity.  As Canadians and as workers, we are entitled to wake 
up and go to our place of work, wherever that may take us, and 
know that our well-being as individuals is protected and our 
workplace safety is reinforced and upheld on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in many situations the almighty dollar overshadows the 
secure working environment to which we are all entitled. Of 
course, the bottom line of any business is to make a profit at 
the end of the day, and that is a very normal mindset for anyone 
who operates a business, large or small. 
If there is no profit at the end of the day there will be no 
business shortly thereafter.  In short, profitability equals 
sustainability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must not let employers allow profits to take 
precedence over workplace safety.  This mindset is precisely what 
sets the tone for workplace tragedies and creates unsafe working 
conditions. Businesses must ensure that their employees are 
adequately supervised and consistently updated on safe work 
practices.  Sadly, in the past we have all witnessed poorly 
trained officials doing jobs they were not properly trained to 
perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that companies take the time to train employees 
so that additional risk is limited for that employee and those 
around them.  Management must also ensure that their employees 
have an appreciation for any special dangers inherent at the job 
site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Westray coal mine specifically, many of the 
tradesmen were prone to perform unsafe tasks or to take dangerous 
shortcuts in their work.  In many cases there was no question 
that management was well aware, or ought to have been aware, that 
safe mining practices were not being performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in Justice Richard's report: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there was no question that Westray management knew that the 
levels of methane underground at the coal mine were hazardous. 
Under section 72 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, such 
conditions mandated the withdrawal of workers from the affected 
area, and that is the primary reason, management in this instance 
chose to ignore the fact. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a case in point, to make matters even worse, this same 
management purchased farm tractors to work underground in a 
potentially explosive environment.  These same farm tractors went 
directly from the lot to the mine and were not explosion proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this situation, as in all situations, the open door policy of 
management could have helped prevent the death of 26 coal miners 
that devastating morning.  No employee ever wants to feel as if 
their safety concerns are falling on deaf ears.  A collaborated 
effort between upper, middle and lower management must be invoked 
to create an environment that is hazardous free for every 
employee in Canada.  Of course, accidents happen, but measures 
must be in place to minimize the risk of death and injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No single environment is 100% danger free but in most cases the 
risk of danger can be significantly less with a bit of common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the Westray coal tragedy, the inquiry set out the 
following:  the occurrence of the explosion that resulted in loss 
of life; whether the occurrence was preventable; whether any 
neglect caused or contributed to the explosion in any way; and 
finally, whether the mine was in compliance with the applicable 
statutes, regulations, orders, rules and directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions that were investigated at the time of the 
inquiry are many of the same questions that should be reviewed 
with business executives on a daily basis to ensure that they are 
operating a safe company.  As well, it would be a good 
opportunity to ensure that businesses are in compliance with the 
current regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As representatives of the federal government, we have to ensure 
that accountability is upheld in the country so that situations 
such as Westray and others do not repeat themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation of Westray will be felt for many years in the 
tiny community of Stellarton and indeed in all of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, on behalf of every individual affected by this horrible 
tragedy, I ask members to lend their assistance to this motion 
and give it their strongest consideration and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon every member of parliament in the House to 
look at the motion as it has been put forth.  It is a very strong 
attempt to curb such an accident from ever happening again in 
Canada.  I think the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
deserves our support and the support of the House for the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
for bringing this motion to the attention of the House, and his 
efforts to bring up the motion so that members can reflect on its 
intent and the issues that it raises for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know only peripherally the tragic circumstances that bring the 
motion forward, but the hon. member needs to be congratulated 
again for making that effort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is to amend the Criminal Code or other appropriate 
federal statutes to ensure that corporate executives and 
directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety.  I 
understand there is an amendment to the motion to include the 
phrase “following a study by the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights”. I understand that to be an amendment by a 
Bloc member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is an active member of the justice committee.  I 
have spent quite a number of hours with him on the justice 
committee on a variety of issues. I know he is keenly engaged in 
justice issues.  I also know his background as a crown attorney 
and I dare say a very good crown attorney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the work of a crown attorney the question comes up, if there 
is an incident, what will the charge be, what can we prove? The 
police come forward with their evidence and say that a particular 
charge needs to be laid. The crown will test the evidence to see 
whether it is sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question here is whether the circumstances as generated by 
the Westray disaster show some deficiency in the Criminal Code or 
in some federal statute. Were I a crown attorney or were he a 
crown attorney in those circumstances, the first question that 
would need to be asked is whether there is current legislation 
that adequately deals with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be brought out in the debate that the Canada Labour 
Code already provides for officer and director liability. The 
code provides that directors and officers of corporations found 
guilty of an offence are to be liable on summary conviction to a 
fine not exceeding $100,000.  In addition part II provides for 
the possibility of conviction on indictment for a fine not 
exceeding $1 million and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may quibble with whether those are adequate sanctions in 
circumstances such as the Westray disaster, but it is not as if 
the legislation in Canada is silent on the matter. It clearly 
provides for director liability.  I wish to make a distinction 
here between director liability which is somewhat frequently 
removed from the incident itself and the tests that usually go on 
with criminal liability where the individual has to have actually 
done the action in order to be liable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the crown chose not to proceed by way of the Canada Labour 
Code for whatever reason, is there some basis for the charge 
under the code as it presently exists?  Criminal negligence is 
defined in section 219 of the Criminal Code:  “Everyone is 
criminally negligent who in doing anything or in omitting to do 
anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless 
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons”. I will 
repeat for the purposes of emphasis “in omitting to do anything 
that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for 
the lives or safety of other persons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not as familiar with the facts of the Westray disaster as 
is my hon. friend.  However from what I do know of the Westray 
disaster, that appears to me to be the charge which a crown 
attorney might reasonably lay in the circumstances. If the facts 
established that the directors or officers showed a wanton or 
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons and 
if the crown decided not proceed under the Canada Labour Code for 
whatever reason, I would have to question why we would want to 
amend the Criminal Code if that is present.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 220 concerns criminal negligence causing death: “Every 
person who by criminal negligence causes death of another person 
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable”. In section 
221:  “Every person who by criminal negligence causes bodily 
harm to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit there is adequate provision in the Criminal Code 
as it presently stands for liability of a director or an officer 
of a corporation who shows wanton or reckless disregard for the 
lives or safety of other persons.  I am therefore in the 
situation of sympathizing with the issue that is raised by 
recommendation 73 in the inquiry, but I am hard pressed to know 
how the laws of Canada as they are presently written both in the 
Criminal Code and in the Canada Labour Code are inadequate to 
address the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing the issue of being able to address how there is a 
deficiency, I cannot see how we could support the passage of this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary may I say that I commend the hon. member for his 
response to a disaster in his community which has implications 
that are really only remotely understood by us. Having said that, 
I am at a loss to know how there is an inadequacy in the 
legislation, both in the Criminal Code and in the Canada Labour 
Code, which would not adequately respond to the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the issues I wanted to raise in response to the 
motion.  I would find myself in difficulty in supporting the 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak to 
Private Member's Motion No. 455 which asks the government to 
amend the Criminal Code or other federal statutes to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors be held accountable for 
workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion also asks the House to pay particular attention to 
recommendation 73 of the Nova Scotia Westray mine disaster 
inquiry.  It calls on the Government of Canada through the 
Department of Justice to study the accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for wrongful or negligent acts.  The 
recommendation asks for the amendment of legislation to be 
introduced as necessary to ensure the accountability of these 
executives and directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians know the solemn background to the introduction of 
this motion.  The Westray mine disaster claimed the lives of 26 
Canadian mine workers.  These disasters are a devastating event 
for any mining community. Our hearts go out to the families and 
friends of the victims of the Westray disaster.  It was a very 
sad event in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to learn from this disaster and prevent or at least 
prepare for the next disaster.  We want to establish lines of 
accountability.  If we can prevent a tragedy, then we want to 
know who is responsible for not preventing one and what as a 
society we are going to do about it.  That is the intent of the 
motion we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this motion is that it has deviated from the 
recommendation made by the Westray inquiry. The inquiry asked for 
the matter of accountability to be studied.  The motion jumps to 
Criminal Code amendments. The NDP leader's Private Member's Bill 
C-468 is similar to what the present motion is asking us to do. 
This smacks of political opportunism to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mistake in the motion is that it does not reflect what the 
commission of inquiry wanted and I think it is premature. 
Let us consider a few things that need to be examined and what 
this misdirected motion is missing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must consider the position of unions.  What about union 
executive responsibility and accountability?  What about shop 
stewards and their responsibility for on-site safety and health? 
What about the responsibility of federal and provincial labour 
inspectors?  What about other government and ministerial 
responsibilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would smaller companies be hindered or hurt if only the 
executives were held criminally accountable for an unsafe or 
hazardous worksite? On the other hand the government should 
protect our small businesses that are creating jobs and are the 
engines of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown in Nova Scotia currently has the power to prosecute 
negligent mine managers who are on-site and responsible.  This is 
true across Canada.  Yes we should study our laws and make them 
stronger if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contacted the B.C. Workers Compensation Board with respect to 
this motion.  In British Columbia the Workers Compensation Act is 
being changed effective October 1, 1999.  The changes include 
dealing with penalties for corporate directors whose companies 
are in violation of health and safety regulations.  These changes 
come from recommendations made by the royal commission that 
studied the Workers Compensation Board in British Columbia.  The 
commission recognized the need for personal responsibility under 
prescribed circumstances on the part of senior management in 
order to enhance workplace health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 37 recommends that the province's 
occupational health and safety statute allow the occupational 
health and safety agency to apply to the courts to obtain an 
injunction.  Until October 1, 1999 the Workers Compensation Act 
does not grant the board the authority to obtain an injunction 
when it feels that the health and safety of workers is not being 
looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of getting such an injunction may be available through 
other legislation, but in British Columbia we felt it necessary 
to put the authority to get an injunction into the Workers 
Compensation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Injunctions allow an agency to take prompt action to address 
potential or existing harm.  They can be obtained quickly, often 
without advance notice.  Injunctions allow us to rely on our 
courts for enforcement power.  If the injunction is disobeyed, 
the breach can be converted into civil or criminal contempt 
proceedings.  I believe this is what the current motion is trying 
to obtain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look closely at what prosecutions can be pursued. I quote 
from a document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prosecutions can occur when a recommendation for a more stringent 
sanction arises out of an accident rather than merely a hazardous 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the greatest shortcoming with prosecution as an 
enforcement option has been the relatively high chance of 
acquittal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, the chances of an accused successfully defending 
an occupational health and safety prosecution and being acquitted 
have always been relatively good.  Most prosecutions are against 
employers, and the low conviction rate reflects the fact that 
judges are not keen on convicting employers, except in cases 
where management has clearly been at fault ... (Fault) should not 
usually be the relevant legal criterion for deciding whether 
someone has breached an occupational health and safety statute. 
What sometimes happens in practice, however, is simply that the 
judges interpret the facts and the law in light of their own 
perceptions about the value of health and safety prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another disadvantage from a compliance perspective is that 
judges can choose to impose fines and/or imprisonment that falls 
short of the maximum a statute might permit.  In addition, 
prosecutions do not provide a direct remedy for affected workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of prosecution as an enforcement option is that a 
monetary penalty and/or a term of imprisonment can make a very 
strong impression on any offender, employer and worker alike, and 
send a strong message of deterrence.  In addition, the stigma 
associated with prosecution can have a profound effect on a 
corporate or non-corporate employer concerned with its public 
image.  This effect may extend beyond that realized by the 
financial penalty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support the recommendations of the Westray mine

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I reiterate that the government is committed to promoting the 
fundamental right of Canadians to a safe and healthy work 
environment and to considering new ideas and suggestions which 
would help us to meet those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion being presented is certainly worthy of note and 
interesting to consider.  I am therefore pleased to join this 
debate and to share some of my thoughts on the motion and the 
amendment before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the tone of the debate on this motion so far, it seems that 
members on all sides of the House share a concern for Canadian 
workers.  We know that to be true.  Certainly it is an important 
issue that we on the government side share.  We also share a 
desire to see safer and healthier workplaces.  We want to reduce 
the cost of workplace accidents and illness in both human and 
economic terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year approximately 800,000 workers are injured or contract 
illnesses while doing their jobs.  Millions of work days are lost 
because of illness or injury. Accordingly the cost to the 
Canadian economy runs to an estimated $10 billion annually. There 
is no question in both human and economic terms these costs are 
too high and require our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we may be in accord on the desire for change, we need to 
look at possible solutions a little more carefully.  For example, 
Motion No. 455 asks that we amend the appropriate federal 
statutes including the Criminal Code.  This is easier said than 
done.  Proposals to amend federal statutes relating to labour 
matters can have far-reaching implications and we need to look 
more carefully at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that it is within federal power to create new 
offences under the Criminal Code, but we have to be cognizant of 
the fact that such changes could infringe on the jurisdictions of 
the provinces and territories to legislate in areas of workplace 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House are well aware of the sensitivity of 
federal-provincial concerns in areas of economic and social 
policy.  I dare say we would not want to initiate any changes to 
federal legislation which would have an unattended impact.  In 
this case, for example, while the intent of the motion is one 
thing, the impact of the changes it proposes is quite another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since amendments to the Criminal Code that have implications for 
provincial labour jurisdiction would require the support of the 
provinces and territories, we need to know how we to obtain that 
kind of support.  We need to study this aspect very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To start with, we need to look at what legislation is already in 
place such as under the Canada Labour Code, for example.  As hon. 
members will recall, legislation concerning occupational safety 
and health in the federal jurisdiction is part of the Canada 
Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code covers a broad range of industries under federal 
jurisdiction.  The best examples are railways, highway transport, 
telecommunications, pipelines, shipping, radio and television 
broadcasting, banks, and a few other areas.  In addition, the 
code covers employees of the federal public service including 
employees of some 40 crown corporations and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code is of particular interest to 
us because it deals with occupational health and safety.  It is 
under part II that we already have legislation in place to deal 
with workplace safety, at least in the federal jurisdiction. 
This legislation is intended to prevent accidents and injuries to 
health arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of 
employment which is subject to federal jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, part II of the existing Canada Labour Code 
already includes provisions for standards for workplace safety as 
well as sanctions and penalties for those who are found to be in 
contravention of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we consider this issue it is very important to look at what 
is already in the Canada Labour Code, specifically part II of 
that code.  Even if we eventually look to solutions beyond the 
Canada Labour Code, we will need to keep in mind the three 
principles set out in the code as fundamental rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the right to know about known or foreseeable hazards 
in the workplace, the right to participate in identifying and 
resolving job related safety and health problems; and the right 
to refuse dangerous work if the employee has reasonable cause to 
believe that a situation constitutes a danger to him or her or to 
another employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code also includes a set of occupational safety and health 
regulations that prescribe standards and procedures for both 
employers and employees to follow.  Part II of the labour code 
says that corporate executives and directors will be held 
accountable if these standards are not met.  If company directors 
and officers are found guilty of an offence under the labour 
code, they will be liable on a summary conviction to a fine of up 
to $100,000.  For a conviction on indictment the labour code 
calls for a fine of up to $1 million and/or imprisonment for a 
term of up to two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal jurisdiction we already have sanctions in place 
which govern workplace safety issues and hold corporate officers 
and directors liable for their actions in cases of negligence or 
wrongdoing.  Although we have legislation in place under the 
Canada Labour Code, we must recognize that it does not cover the 
majority of workers in Canada.  It only covers those who fall 
under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that we have more work to do in the area of 
legislating workplace safety.  Instead of referring the matter to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights as proposed by 
the member, I would prefer to see the matter referred to the 
Minister of Justice for further study.  In other words, I cannot 
support the Motion No. 455 as proposed and I think the majority 
of Canadians in reviewing this matter would agree with my 
position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will elaborate a bit on something my colleague from 
South Shore alluded to earlier when he talked about the 
initiative we are discussing tonight.  We are discussing a motion 
that was put forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  With reference to the 
initiative by the New Democratic Party, I would like to declare 
that our initiative is of a legal nature. Although the motion 
will hopefully gain the willingness of the House, our initiative 
provides the legal means to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to defining in one crystal clear example the 
principle which underlines this motion, the principle is clear in 
the Westray mine disaster of 1992.  Seven years ago more than two 
dozen men went to work and died there. They died horrible deaths, 
deaths made more terrible because they were completely 
unnecessary and made more tragic because those men died, 
according to what some believe, to boost the company's profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aftermath of the disaster fingers were pointed by all 
sides, including the accusation that the men who died were found 
responsible for their deaths.  The commission rejected that 
assertation, as well it should have, and pointed the finger of 
blame at a culture of greed which permeated the company. Ignoring 
the dangerous nature of the business, the owners tried to extract 
every cent they could from a workforce desperate for work, from a 
community where any job would receive 100 applications.  I am 
providing these details because I believe they are critical to 
achieving an understanding of what truly occurred in May 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will always be the first to stand in support of good business, 
large or small, that treats its workers with dignity and respect. 
What I aim to do here is to expand the definition of a 
successful corporation to make it include the successful and safe 
guidance of any workforce through their working lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this motion is based on one of the strongest 
foundations of our law which states that we are all responsible 
for our actions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years this basic rule of law has been stretched, 
twisted and manipulated.  Some would say we must remember that 
those who stretch, twist and manipulate the law are individuals 
who make choices, who decide they will overlook flaws in their 
equipment, who will cut back on safety training, and who will 
knowingly send their workers into dangerous environments.  Those 
individuals should be held accountable for those choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the closing years of this millennium we have finally reached 
the stage of evolution in our civilization where we no longer 
allow the excuse of I was just following orders to stand as a 
valid defence for knowingly causing harm to others.  When it 
comes to the behaviour of our military and our government 
officials, we now expect that every individual will make a moral 
decision based not on what they have been told but on what they 
know to be the difference between right and wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the motion will expand this welcome step forward and 
could possibly be a prelude to the legal initiative that has been 
put forth by the New Democratic Party, so that in the future it 
will not be possible for a mine manager to say that the company 
president forced him to order the alteration of safety reports or 
for his CEO to be protected from blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to responsibility equality is a foundation stone of 
society.  We may never achieve it but it remains a goal, an ideal 
toward which we all strive.  By allowing one significant segment 
of our society to remain protected from our law is a flagrant 
violation of the principle of equality.  Is a violation easily 
healed, a problem easily solved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, my party is not seeking a witch hunt as 
we have no desire to increase the cost of doing business.  We all 
hope to achieve by the passage of the motion an increase in 
profitability as a small number of unscrupulous firms that keep 
their prices artificially low by exposing their workers to danger 
are forced from the market.  That opens the way for responsible 
firms to increase their competitiveness and to increase not only 
their bottom lines but the standard of living of their workers, 
their communities and their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever this measure is discussed or contemplated by anyone in 
the House, I hope the memory of those 26 men who died seven years 
ago in Nova Scotia will stay with them.  There are those citizens 
and business people who can and do know what it takes to run a 
responsible and safe enterprise and who put those beliefs into 
practice every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliament we have a responsibility to set the moral course 
for our government.  When it comes to the motion before us I urge 
all members to support it for success and decency and to reject 
those who would cover their failures with the bodies of their 
workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 455. 
The motion says that we should amend federal statutes, including 
the Criminal Code, in order to address the issue of 
accountability and liability for safety in the workplace in 
relation to recommendation 73 of the public inquiry of the 
province of Nova Scotia into the Westray disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt if anyone in the House would not share the member's 
concern for the victims and for the families of the victims, 
those who were so tragically affected by the Westray disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray disaster was a tragedy that captured the attention 
of the whole nation.  Although it happened some time ago it 
remains in our minds and underlines the need for all of us in 
public office to be sensitive to the concerns of workers and to 
the need to ensure safe and secure workplaces.  Workers are the 
backbone of our economy.  Fatalities, injuries and illnesses in 
the workplace cause them and their families to suffer both in 
human terms and economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of workplace accidents is high.  It is estimated that 
on top of all human costs, the dollar costs to our economy are as 
much as $10 million a year.  These costs are too high and we need 
to look at ways to bring them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member opposite for introducing the motion.  It 
provides us with an opportunity to look at the situation of 
workplace safety in Canada and to consider what needs to be done 
by the federal government to ensure safe and healthy workplaces 
for Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes that we need a new legislative approach to 
workplace safety.  Legislation is clearly one option, but so is 
education.  There are many experts in the field of occupational 
health and safety who feel that prevention through education and 
training is every bit as important as intervention through 
legislation.  These people understand the value of promoting 
education and training in order to reduce the incidence of 
illness and accidents in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national day of mourning was held last April, for example, 
and we asked Canadians to remember workers who were killed or 
injured as a result of occupational accidents or illnesses.  The 
Canadian flag was flown at half-mast on Parliament Hill in memory 
of all those workers who lost their lives or who were injured on 
the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, governments and organizations throughout North 
America annually co-operate to hold North American occupational 
safety and health week.  This year North American occupational 
safety and health week was marked from May 17 to 23.  As part of 
this occasion the Government of Canada joined with the 
governments of the United States and Mexico to promote awareness 
of workplace safety throughout North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canadian organizations, such as the Canadian 
Society of Safety Engineering and the Canadian Centre for 
Occupational Safety and Health, are working in partnership with 
the federal government and others in Canadian society to promote 
safe work practices.  These organizations produce excellent 
material to help labour, business, governments and others 
interested in occupational health and safety to learn about 
working together to identify and implement new approaches to 
promote workplace safety.  The educational information is 
distributed broadly to employers and employees.  The Canadian 
Centre for Occupational Safety and Health has also created a very 
useful website that has gained an international reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour program is very supportive of these activities. 
Indeed, for the last several years the labour program has played 
a leading role in emphasizing education and awareness as a means 
of promoting better workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, there is a wide variety of initiatives 
under way under the leadership of Canada's Minister of Labour, 
initiatives that provide useful information and focus the 
attention of employers, employees and the general public on the 
importance of preventing injury and illness in the workplace 
through education and awareness.  Although the motion does not 
talk about the use of information to create safer work 
environments, it is important to keep in mind that education and 
awareness are also important aspects of our existing approach to 
promote workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the approach, of course, is legislation.  It 
was some 30 years ago that the federal government developed the 
occupational safety and health legislation to cover employees and 
workplaces under federal jurisdiction.  Over the years federal 
legislation and regulations relating to occupational health and 
safety have been consolidated under the Canada Labour Code.  As 
we consider the motion, we also need to consider what is in place 
under the Canada Labour Code, especially under Part II of the 
code.  Part II of the code concerns occupational safety and 
health for employees working in organizations under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code establishes three fundamental rights for 
workers.  First, the right to know about unsafe conditions. 
Second, the right to participate in workplace decisions relating 
to safety.  Third, the right to refuse dangerous work.  The code 
also includes a set of occupational safety and health regulations 
that prescribe standards and procedures for both employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government inspectors visit workplaces, respond to 
complaints, conduct investigations, prohibit access to workplaces 
deemed hazardous and can impose fines for non-compliance.  If 
company directors and officers are found guilty of an offence 
under the labour code, they will be liable on a summary 
conviction to a fine of up to $100,000.  For a conviction on 
indictment, the labour code calls for a fine of up to $1 million 
and/or imprisonment for a term of up two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, with the Canada Labour Code we already have a 
model in place to cover the enforcement of safety in the 
workplace.  The problem is that the Canada Labour Code covers 
only those employees who are working in industries or 
organizations that are subject to federal legislation. 
That is only a small part of the working population in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have an effective model in the Canada Labour Code, it 
does not cover the whole population of workers, most of whom are 
under provincial or territorial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with the idea of extending the federal model to 
include workers outside the federal jurisdiction is that 
constitutionally workplace safety is also a provincial concern. 
Any moves at the federal level to encroach on provincial or 
territorial legislative turf on workers' rights might not be 
viewed positively by those other levels of government.  Amending 
the Criminal Code, for example, as the motion proposes, would 
clearly run into this roadblock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find an approach that would accommodate 
federal-provincial interests and that would also combine the 
educational and legislative approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question of studying the liability of 
corporate executives and directors, recommendation 73 of the 
province of Nova Scotia's public inquiry into the Westray 
disaster specifically recommended that the federal government, 
through the Department of Justice, institute a study of the 
accountability of corporate executives and directors.  Although 
the member is well intended, the Westray report recommended that 
the Department of Justice review this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is a contentious area.  I myself have a private 
member's bill which suggests that under the Canada Business 
Corporations Act directors be allowed the defence of due 
diligence in the conduct of their activities.  Therefore, the 
issue does require further study, not by a parliamentary 
committee as proposed by the amendment to Motion No. 455, but 
instead by the Minister of Justice as recommended by the Westray 
inquiry report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, while I support the idea of a study I do not support the 
amendment.

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an issue that 
should distress every single Canadian, especially those in 
British Columbia and those affected by the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I asked the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans about the 
Pacific salmon treaty and, with the secret negotiations that he 
has ongoing with the Alaskans and the Americans, will it be in 
the best interest of British Columbians.  His answer was, 
“Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indications are that the minister is not coming fully clean on 
this particular treaty, and here are the reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is negotiating a secret 
deal on the Pacific salmon treaty without consulting the major 
stakeholders in British Columbia, without the advice of the 
Government of British Columbia, without the advice of the Coastal 
Communities Network, without the advice of the UFAWU, without the 
advice of the environmental groups which have spent so much time 
and effort in conserving and protecting these very precious 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this minister is in secret negotiations tells a 
lot of Canadians, especially British Columbians, that they should 
be very nervous.  Not one single member of parliament on the 
Liberal government side or on the opposition side has been 
consulted on this treaty whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coastal Communities Network has asked time and time again 
that before any treaty process is settled or signed there be open 
and transparent hearings, at least in committee, as to exactly 
what should be in the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stated to a <I>Times</I> 
columnist in Victoria on May 29, just a few days ago:  “I asked 
Dennis Streifel”, who is the Minister of Fisheries for British 
Columbia, “for the provincial position back in January.  I 
repeated that request 10 days ago and I am still waiting for 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries for British Columbia, Mr. Streifel, 
did indeed send the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans his response 
months ago and back on May 3 the Minister of Fisheries for 
British Columbia sent the federal fisheries minister copies and 
indications of exactly what the Government of British Columbia 
wants to see in this particular treaty. 
Again the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans turned another 
blank eye and another deaf ear to the request.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coastal Communities Network has sent pages and pages of 
requests, documents and information that the government could use 
in its negotiations, which has been ignored and probably not even 
read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute outrage that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans for Canada can turn around and make a secret deal that is 
so very vital to British Columbians and all Canadians.  Salmon 
stocks on the west coast are a common property resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the federal government, along with the 
provincial government and many other stakeholders, have worked 
tirelessly over the last few years to preserve and protect those 
stocks.  They certainly cannot stand around and allow the federal 
government to give away fish for fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important principles of previous treaties signed 
with the Americans, with Strangway and Ruckelshaus and all of 
those other deals, is the fact that British Columbian spawned 
fish belong first to British Columbia.  When they come back they 
belong to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to have a deal where the minister apparently will trade 
off one for one on the fish.  That means the Alaskans will obtain 
more fish than British Columbians.  That goes against the three 
treaties that were signed.  It goes against the principle of 
equity.  I ask the parliamentary secretary how he can stand in 
the House to defend that position when the minister is indicating 
that he will give away our fish stocks.  I cannot wait for his 
answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
talked at the beginning of his remarks about distress.  What is 
distressing is the kind of games that the B.C. government has 
been playing over this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the member opposite talks about secrecy, 
yet he elaborates constantly on unfounded rumours.  The time for 
rhetoric is past.  That is why the minister is negotiating so 
intently.  The time for rhetoric is past and the time for getting 
the job done is now.  It is time to settle.  It is time to 
negotiate a Pacific salmon treaty that builds for the future, in 
the interests of the fishery, the coastal communities, the 
province of B.C. and all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to the facts for a moment.  The lack of agreement 
under the Pacific salmon treaty has been a concern for all those 
who care about salmon.  We did not reach an agreement last year 
with Alaska.  However, interim agreements with the state of 
Washington in 1998 resulted in a 75% reduction of their harvest 
of our threatened Thompson River coho.  Clearly, co-operation 
with the United States is a crucial issue to ensure a future for 
the salmon resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's goal has been to take our domestic approach to put the 
fish first and translate it into new arrangements under the 
Pacific salmon treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is encouraged to report that the talks are 
proceeding well.  They are being conducted on a 
government-to-government basis, as recommended by the special 
advisers.  In these discussions we have been guided by three 
objectives.  First, to adopt more effective conservation regimes 
that put the needs of fish first.  Second, to restrict the 
interception of Canadian bound salmon and move fish to Canada. 
Three, to secure improved bilateral co-operation on science and 
salmon management.

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to address 
again an issue that should come as a real shock to most 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, through Canada's Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, through the CSC, has this insidious plan 
that it wants to release 50% of the inmate population by the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been looking at this issue at the justice committee.  We 
had the privilege of having the CSC commissioner, Ole Ingstrup, 
bless us with his presence the other day.  He still denies that 
this is even a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolutely shocking.  This is a malodorous plan that was 
hoisted upon an unsuspecting public some time ago.  If this is 
allowed to happen, once again the Canadian public will be 
affected by this.  It will be an absolute disgrace if this is 
allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there have been internal memos circulated by CSC 
officials setting out specifically that there are targets.  The 
unfortunate language used was that there are numerical goals, 
balanced distribution, a reintegration agenda, plan or process, 
achievable numbers, release objectives, equalization between 
institution and community population, and agreed upon goals. 
They are very careful never to use the word quotas, though, but 
we do know that a quota is a quota is a quota.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act does it 
ever talk about numerical goals, targets or redistribution.  Yet 
this is the type of language that very clearly sets out this 
insidious plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner was very reluctant to admit that this has 
happened.  Yet it is very clear that there was a plan to open the 
doors of the jails and let 50% of the inmate population back out 
on to the street without following the proper process that is put 
in place to determine the criteria as to whether inmates should 
be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very disturbing point about it is that it is completely 
contrary to law.  There is no acknowledgement whatsoever that it 
is even happening, although in fact this documentation clearly 
shows that there has been directions given to corrections and 
conditional release officials.  There is obviously a disincentive 
for wardens not to follow the directives which have come from 
deputy commissioners such as Brendan Reynolds in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are even specific numbers referenced for the province of 
Ontario:  660 inmates are to be released by December 31, 1999. 
It is absolutely unbelievable that this could be going on at a 
time when our law enforcement community is working harder and 
harder with less resources, at a time when the public confidence 
is perhaps at an all time low in our justice system.  Yet this 
plan is hatched in a very secretive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When confronted with irrefutable evidence that these statistics 
are referenced in internal documents, the commissioner simply 
says unfortunate language was used.  There is a complete denial 
on behalf of the solicitor general's department that it was even 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although their knuckles have been rapped and this has been 
exposed for what it was, which is an absolute sham, the 
government is now saying it never happened and that it was not in 
place at all.  I suspect the government will slink away with its 
tail between its legs and simply proceed in perhaps some other 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely dangerous initiative.  What has taken place 
should come as a great shock to anybody who is working currently 
in corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt that this plan was afoot.  The 
parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general will rise 
shortly and tell us that it was not happening.  We know it was 
happening.  Thankfully, through the diligence of the opposition, 
we have exposed it.  Through the diligence of Ontario victims 
services, it has been exposed for what it was.  We hope it will 
be changed.  We do not want to see it proceeding any further.

colleague, who got the answers he was seeking from all those he 
put the questions to, is back in the House today putting the 
same questions, because what interests him is not the content of

way inmates to be paroled will be reintegrated into society. All 
this effort is based on very solid programs, which are science 
based. The programs are not extemporaneous.

criteria that ought to be used to evaluate the way inmates will

on April 23, the day after Earth Day, I asked the Parliamentary

government initiatives to keep the earth a healthy place for all 
to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 100 years ago the idea of protecting the environment simply 
did not exist.  Technology was advancing rapidly and North 
American factories were booming.  We did not know to what extent 
we were harming the environment, the ozone layers, the water and 
the wildlife.  We now know that such careless activity can ruin 
our beautiful planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our thinking patterns have evolved considerably in the last

need to go further.  With the new millennium around the corner we

something economically to change it or to change their lifestyles 
to better the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is still a top of the mind issue for Canadians. 
I would argue that it is or should be top of the mind around the 
world.  Canadians and other global citizens want, need and expect 
a strong commitment to environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many studies have shown that our health is directly linked to 
the quality of our water, our soil and our air.  We must work 
hard to ensure that these resources stay clean for all humans. 
Canada already has a great reputation for being a leading country 
when it comes to the environment.  We are known across the world 
as producers of safe, healthy and nutritious food.  Our 
collective care about the safety of our food has made Canada 
among the safest producers in the world.  We must continue to 
improve and modernize the methods we use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Canada has a large portion of the world's 
freshwater.  We work hard to keep this water clean, but once 
again we must continue to advance these efforts to ensure that 
our lakes and rivers can continue to be used by our children and 
generations to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government must take action in this area.  We know the 
environment is very precious to all.  It is a necessity for human 
life.  Too many species now reach extinction every day. Too much 
air, water and soil is being polluted.  Although Canada is one of 
the world's leaders in this area we need to continue to work hard 
at saving and protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, our government must work to involve other countries 
in the struggle to save the earth.  The world sees Canada as a 
protector of human rights and a leader in finding solutions to 
problems affecting other lives.  We need to use this kind of 
approach in the environmental area again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary to take this opportunity to 
explain to all of us what the government is doing to ensure that 
the earth's environment is being protected, especially as it 
relates to water.  What is Canada doing and what will we continue 
to do to make sure the earth will remain a beautiful, clean and 
healthy place for all of us to live?

essential element of the planet's life support system and one 
that we cannot take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington and all Canadians are 
concerned about the long term security of freshwater.  They want 
governments to act, to conserve and to protect this precious 
resource.  As the member knows, the government is acting to 
protect this precious resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 10 the government announced its strategy to prohibit 
bulk removals of freshwater, including removals for the purpose 
of export from all major drainage basins in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy respects the primary responsibility of the 
provinces for freshwater management and the ecological integrity 
of drainage basins.  It is consistent with our international 
trade obligations.  The strategy lays the groundwork for 
Canada-wide protection of its freshwater resources.  Progress on 
that federal strategy has been significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be reassured that the federal Minister of the 
Environment is working diligently with her provincial and 
territorial colleagues to achieve a Canada-wide prohibition of 
bulk water removals from the major drainage basins in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington noted, ground water 
is a very important issue for Canadians and the government. 
Provinces are responsible for the management and protection of 
ground water.  The federal government is committed to working 
with all provinces and territories to protect all waters in a 
comprehensive way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some time ago I asked the Minister for International 
Trade what he would be doing to consult Canadians concerning the 
upcoming World Trade Organization negotiations that will be 
taking place in Seattle some time in November of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time he responded that he would be asking the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee to conduct a study in 
Canada to report to parliament concerning this and to report to 
him so that he would be in a better position to prepare Canada's 
negotiating position in respect of these important negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations will be important.  Canada is a very open 
economy.  It is a trading nation unlike many others.  Something 
like 40% of our GDP is dependent on exports and something like 
over 30% is dependent upon imports.  In some ways we are 70% 
dependent on trade in one way or another.  Canadians are very 
knowledgeable in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of its travels across the country the committee 
had the opportunity to consult Canadians from all walks of life 
in such diverse areas as agriculture and the agri-food business 
with all its complexities and differences from different products 
that are sold and now manufactured into important exports, to the 
issue of tariffs and industry access in other countries and how 
we deal with our trading partners, to the new agenda that is 
there in trade and the problems in intellectual property.  We 
have found in the course of those consultations that there is an 
extraordinary degree of expertise because Canadians are deeply 
involved in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canadians shared with us and with the committee 
their concerns about what is happening in the world trading 
situation.  They shared with us their concerns that if trade is 
allowed to continue in a way where issues involving the 
environment, human rights, labour standards, or the guarantees of 
the diversity of culture are not addressed, there would be a real 
problem in the world.  We would not be able to have a responsive 
trading system which would meet the needs of Canadians.  As I 
said, they are aware of these issues.  They are also aware that 
in many areas they are able to make a real contribution to these 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is determined to consult Canadians, either through 
the committee process, through the SAGIT or through the important 
consultations with the provinces.  I encourage the ministry to 
continue in this area to make information available, whether 
through the Internet or through traditional means, and to 
encourage the import of knowledgeable Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate if the parliamentary secretary would inform the 
House tonight on any other additional initiatives the minister 
intends to put into place to ensure that when we go into the 
negotiations in Seattle at the end of this year our negotiators 
are fully apprised of the rich diversity and important opinion we 
have available in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we welcome the 
remarks of the member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale.  He can be 
assured that the minister in his capacity as chairman will be 
creating a considerable amount of work for the member for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member on his committee's work in the past. 
He has done his utmost to involve Canadians and to seek their 
advice.  The minister certainly wants to encourage his continuing 
to do that in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 12 it was stated in the House that the Government of 
Canada placed the utmost importance on public consultations.  In 
Seattle later this year the 135 members of the World Trade 
Organization will launch another round of trade negotiations.  At 
a minimum it will address the agriculture and service sectors. 
These are sectors are very important to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prepare for this round, the government believes it is 
important to hear from civil society: Canadians, non-government 
organizations, business and industry groups as well as the 
provinces.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
May 11 I asked the environment minister to explain why the 
Canadian Environment Protection Act amendments proposed by the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development were being stripped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister to explain why the strong CEPA was being 
rejected by the Liberal cabinet after one of the lengthiest 
parliamentary reviews in history, a review that provided a rare 
opportunity to improve the environmental standards that protect 
the Canadian public and our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, Bill C-32, provides 
the cornerstone for environmental protection in Canada.  The 
legislation covers toxic substances, air and water pollution, 
biotechnology, ocean dumping, hazardous wastes, fuel standards, 
public participation, regulatory enforcement and other 
environmental matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The link between the environment and human health are well 
proven.  The chemical contamination of our air, water and 
lands are the legacy from the past century.  This parliamentary 
review was a chance to learn from the mistakes of this century and 
begin the next century with an improved protection law for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the committee proceedings, environment and health 
groups presented irrefutable evidence and testimony that the 
legislation offered little, if any, protection for the 
environment and health of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point by point and clause by clause, improvements were made to 
the legislation.  Committee members from the New Democratic 
Party, the Bloc Quebecois, the Progressive Conservatives and some 
Liberal members initiated a comprehensive non-partisan effort to 
strengthen the environmental standards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as amended by committee, presented an improvement in 
standards for our children and future generations.  It is 
unfortunate that these democratic recommendations have been 
rejected by the Liberal cabinet and the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under intense pressure from the industry lobbyists many 
improvements made to improve the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act were reversed.  A series of motions endorsed by 
industry lobbyists and proposed by the Liberal Party and the 
Reform Party removed virtually every committee improvement to the 
original legislation, including the following points that could 
have ensured environmental protection for this and future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point was the loss of the phase-out consideration.  A 
motion endorsed by the committee called for the phase out, the 
total elimination of the most persistent and bioaccumulative 
substances known to man.  As of today, the total elimination of 
these chemicals will not be required in Canada.  Only the virtual 
elimination of toxics substances is offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, I asked the Prime Minister why he, like 
environmental protection, was becoming a virtual Prime Minister. 
Virtual is not appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point was that Canadians had lost the basic essence 
of the precautionary principle.  Before measures to protect the 
environment or human health can be taken, they must be proven to 
be cost effective.  Strings are attached.  For example, it was 
not cost effective to move sick children from living beside a 
toxic site in Sydney, Nova Scotia until toxic ooze entered their 
homes.  It is not cost effective to clean up millions of tonnes of 
radioactive waste from leaking into Canada's fourth largest 
freshwater lake, the Great Bear Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberal government promises Canadians that water quality 
is important, its actions say otherwise.  It has watered down the 
environmental standards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canadians are increasingly concerned about 
biotechnology and asking for more information and transparency, 
the Liberal government has passed into law that decisions on 
biotechnology environment and health risks must be decided by 
the Liberal cabinet behind closed doors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the 
matter is the industry wish list does not come first.  Children's 
health comes first. Let us get some facts straight about what 
Bill C-32 really does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is on the leading edge of environmental protection 
legislation worldwide.  It focuses on pollution prevention, which 
is the most effective means of protecting our environment and the 
health of Canadians including our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 strengthens the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
It enhances our authority to take action to protect the 
environment and human health.  Our ability to go after polluters 
will be strengthened.  The bill puts the environment and the 
health of Canadians first by requiring that we follow the 
precautionary principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 demands that the government examine all 23,000 
substances in Canada to assess the risks they pose to the 
environment and to the health of Canadians including children. 
The bill places new deadlines for taking action where we identify 
concerns.  It provides us with the authority to virtually 
eliminate the most dangerous toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is aware that hormone disrupting substances are an 
emerging concern for the health of Canadians.  Bill C-32 is the 
only legislation in the world that requires that research be done 
on those substances.  This research will provide the Minister of 
the Environment and the Minister of Health with the information 
needed to take action to protect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is a win for the environment, a win for the Canadian 
public and a win for the health of Canadians including our 
children.  The member opposite should be applauding this leading 
legislation.

Standing Order 24(1).
