	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the Right 
Hon. Roméo LeBlanc, who has just been sworn in as Governor 
General of Canada. Mr. LeBlanc is clearly an excellent person 
for the job.
<P>
	He has worked tirelessly and unstintingly for a united and 
prosperous Canada. In his speech this morning, Mr. LeBlanc 
expressed his love for Canada. As he said, it is up to us to build 
our future together as Canadians.
<P>
	The choice of Mr. LeBlanc is an honour for all Acadians. As 
you know, he is the first Acadian to be appointed to the position 
of Governor General. We are proud of him.
<P>
	I would like to wish His Excellency the Right Hon. Roméo 
LeBlanc and Mrs. LeBlanc success and happiness throughout 
this mandate.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to acknowledge, on behalf of the official opposition, 
the swearing in today of Roméo LeBlanc as the Governor 
General of Canada. Following his long career as a member of 
Parliament, minister and Liberal senator, his appointment as 
Governor General recognizes a life dedicated to politics.
<P>
	Just as the Leader of the Opposition congratulated the Prime 
Minister in the House when the appointment of Mr. LeBlanc was 
announced, we also congratulate the Prime Minister on 
choosing, for the first time, an Acadian as Governor General.
<P>
	We hope the Governor General will play a role in promoting 
the rights of francophone and Acadian communities in Canada. 
We acknowledge and respect the Governor General's right to 
defend Canadian unity, just as we must recognize the right of 
sovereignists to defend their plans because, when all is said and 
done, the decision is for Quebecers to make and for them alone.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in her Standing Order 31 statement yesterday the hon. 
member for Brant attributed to me ``comments denying any 
racism in the video depicting conduct of some members of the 
Canadian Airborne Regiment''. I assume the hon. member took 
this statement, out of context and misrepresenting my position, 
from a media report.
<P>
	Now I consider calling someone or an organization racist to be 
a very serious charge and demand factual evidence before 
levelling such a charge.
<P>
	It is one thing to have my position misrepresented in the 
media but quite another to have it misrepresented in the official 
records of this House of Commons.
<P>
	I make this statement to make clear that I did not and will not 
condone racism in any form. However, neither will I join the 
politically correct in flinging charges of racism before I know 
all the pertinent facts.

Speaker, I rise in the House today to pay tribute to Project 
Preservation, an environmental youth group in my riding of 
Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	Recently the group was honoured with the Ward Smith 
environmental youth award. This award is presented by the 
North Bay-Mattawa Conservation Authority for outstanding 
youth contributions to the local environment through awareness 
and action.
<P>
	Project Preservation was established in the fall of 1986 as a 
response to the growing need for an active environmental group 
dedicated to education.
<P>
	Within the past eight years, the need to protect our 
environment has grown and Project Preservation has evolved 
with it. Project Preservation's main focus is the publication of a 
bimonthly newsletter called ``Nature's Plea''. ``Nature's Plea'' 
<P>

optimistic outlook to the problems we face.

numerous tree plants, litter clean-ups, benefit music festivals 
and campaigns such as the bad mail campaign, a project to 
combat junk mail.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, federal public servants are the government's most 
precious resource; they implement its programs, deliver its 
services and apply its regulations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If there are to be program cuts or service cuts of any kind in 
the coming budget I ask that the government privatize or 
contract out these activities and give first crack to those public 
servants affected. I also ask that the government change the 
Superannuation Act to permit those affected from age 50 and on 
to be able to take voluntary early retirement without penalty.
<P>
	Let there be no public servant penalized because of public 
service renewal.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
were very surprised to hear that Quebec's Minister of Finance 
completely changed his mind last Monday about assuming a 
share of the debt if Quebec separates.
<P>
	Minister Campeau stated that an independent Quebec will not 
be forced to accept something that undermines its economic 
development especially because ``it is not our debt, it is 
Canada's debt''.
<P>
	The minister's recent statement basically contradicts a 
statement he made in 1994, that Quebec was worried when it saw 
the cumulative national debt reach $550 billion as of March 31, 
1994, because Quebecers have to pay 25 per cent of it.
<P>
	The uncertainty created by such statements can only 
undermine the efforts of those who are working hard for the 
country's economic recovery.

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
the Prime Minister only too ready to make disparaging remarks 
about federal civil servants, who according to him are sitting 
around and doing nothing, and with the government poised to 
slash public spending, four Liberal MNAs for the Outaouais 
prefer taking it easy in the sun to defending the interests of their 
constituents.
<P>
	The stakes have never been higher for the federal public 
service in the Outaouais, as it faces the worst cuts in its history. 
Outaouais residents are worried about privatization, reduced 
services and the loss of their jobs. And while they worry, MNAs 
Middlemiss, MacMillan, Lafrenière and Lesage are away, 
indifferent to what is happening and doing nothing to stop it.
<P>
	What sort of political commitment is it when these Liberal 
MNAs would rather relax in a warm climate than look out for the 
real problems of those they represent?

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
serious allegations have been made concerning the business 
activities of the member for St. John's West for some months 
now. The Liberal government has been advised of the situation 
and a petition for recall has been circulated throughout her 
riding.
<P>
	The <I>Evening Telegram</I> in St. John's has reported on this fiasco 
at length. CBC St. John's this morning made public that she is 
indeed the subject of an RCMP investigation.
<P>
	This government talks so much about ethics, but will not walk 
the walk when its own members are involved. Since this 
government refuses to allow the ethics commissioner to report 
to Parliament or investigate individual MPs, then recall 
legislation introduced by the Reform member for Beaver River 
which was turned down by this government is now more 
important than ever to the people of St. John's.

writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is only one kind of event that will motivate the government to take notice 
of what mainstream Canada wants-soaring Reform Party memberships.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A burgeoning ``card carrying membership'' is far more effective than protests, 
letter writing, petitions, or other traditional types of lobbying.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know you will understand why this is true.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not know why it is true. It is a flagrant misuse of taxpayer 
supplied stationery and franking privileges. It totally 
misrepresents the impact of petitions, letters and our work here 
in this House. It certainly makes me wonder why the member 
stands up to present petitions.
<P>
	To all Canadians, especially to my constituents, I will listen to 
their opinions, whether they have a party affiliation or not. All 
Canadians have the right to be heard. They should continue to

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, results of the Léger &amp; Léger poll published today 
clearly show that a No vote in the Quebec referendum means the 
exact same thing to English Canadians as it does to Quebec 
sovereignists.
<P>
	Far from being a bargaining chip, a No vote is construed as a 
No to any constitutional change and any form of renewed 
federalism. The poll found that scarcely 10 per cent of 
respondents were not opposed to a special status for Quebec. In 
fact, two thirds did not recognize Quebec as a distinct nation.
<P>
	The poll also shows that half of those surveyed feel that 
Canada should recognize Quebec as a sovereign nation should 
the Yes side win. In addition, some 58 per cent of Canadians are 
in favour of maintaining economic ties with an independent 
Quebec. Beyond the calculated threats of politicians, Canadians 
are saying clearly that they want to build a partnership that is 
sound and productive for everyone.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Immigration and Refugee Board is out of control.
<P>
	In January, Boujan Inthavong was released from prison in 
B.C. and ordered deported because of his role in a brutal gang 
murder. Knowing the system, he got himself a lawyer and 
delayed his deportation by making a refugee claim. 
Unbelievably, the IRB gave refugee status to this dangerous 
criminal in a 15 minute hearing. Now he is here forever.
<P>
	The IRB completely disregarded his crimes. But even more 
unbelievable is the stated refusal of the minister of immigration 
to intervene and stop this ridiculous refugee claim which has 
made a mockery of justice and a laughing stock of the taxpayers. 
He had the power to halt the hearing before it got started but 
decided not to. He went on record to say that he would not even 
attempt to overturn the decision.
<P>
	Canadians are used to the stupidity of the IRB, but for the 
minister who refused to act when he had every legal right and 
responsibility is itself nothing short of criminal.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would urge all of us in our

	With the rapid globalization of capital, the people of the world 
need more than ever institutions committed to democratic

sustainable development which promote social and economic 
justice including global health and education, energy 
conservation, renewable energy, micro-enterprise, sustainable 
agriculture and forestry, mass transit and the reversal of 
economic degradation.
<P>
	Canada is hosting the G-7 in Halifax in June. We can begin 
this important process by taking a lead role as the host nation in 
calling for and working toward a full and fundamental review of

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, following allegations that the Reform Party had been 
infiltrated by a CSIS agent, the Prime Minister said repeatedly 
in the House that federal intelligence services had no mandate to 
spy on politicians, whoever they happened to be.
<P>
	On December 16, Michel Robert, acting chairman of the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee, stated there was no 
file on the leader of the Reform Party. However, in a letter dated 
January 27, the executive director of the SIRC confirmed that 
since October 1989, there had been a file under the name 
``Preston Manning''.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Why 
did the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, in 
October 1994, say in the House that no intelligence service had a 
mandate to spy on politicians, when we now know that CSIS 
actually has a file on the leader of the Reform Party and has had 
one for five years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this matter was explained fully in a letter to the 
parliamentary subcommittee by the chair of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee.
<P>
	He said that the file in question did not relate to the leader of 
the Reform Party but rather to a low level investigation about 
possible financing by a foreign country of the election campaign 
in question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9325"> 9325 </A></B>
<P>
	When it was found that this was not the case, the 
investigation was terminated. The heading on the file did not 
accurately relate to what the file was about. It was not a file 
involving an investigation of the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was probably a coincidence that they picked the 
name of Preston Manning for their investigation. Just a 
coincidence, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I want to ask the Solicitor General how Canadians and 
Quebecers can be expected to trust the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, after its chairman denied the existence of a 
file on the leader of the Reform Party in December 1994 and its 
executive director confirmed, in January 1995, the existence of 
a file, that happened to be under the name ``Preston Manning''?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should give complete information to 
the House. What the executive director of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee said was that in spite of the 
initial name of the file, it did not relate to the leader of the 
Reform Party but rather to the investigation of possible 
financing of an election campaign by a foreign country, which 
did not turn out to be correct.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should give the whole story to the 
House. It would help us have a better question period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> 
Exactly, Mr. Speaker. We would like to have the whole story in 
the House. We wonder why the SIRC first denied the existence 
of the Preston Manning file before committee members and then 
confirmed that there was a file on the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Would the Solicitor General agree that the only way to get to 
the bottom of this, as he claims he wants to do, is to set up a 
genuinely public and independent commission of inquiry?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish the hon. member had listened to my answer 
instead of reading out the question he had already prepared.
<P>
	My answer made it clear that based on information provided 
to me by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, the file in 
question was not about an investigation of the leader of the 
Reform Party but about the possible questionable financing by a 
foreign country of an election campaign.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee, under the 
statute creating CSIS, is in effect a permanent royal commission 
with a specific mandate to keep under review the activities of 
CSIS. The quality of its work has been demonstrated by the 
comprehensive report of the Heritage Front affair that brought 
to light the issue about which the hon. member is talking.
<P>
	While the Security Intelligence Review Committee operates 
at arm's length from the government, I would think that if the 
subcommittee wanted to hear further from the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee on this subject it would be 
happy to come back to the subcommittee.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On March 16, 1994, I asked the defence minister in this House 
how senior officers at CFB Petawawa could let 2nd Airborne 
Commando members go around the base displaying Nazi flags 
on Canadian Forces vehicles as well as white supremacist and 
Ku Klux Klan insignia. Almost one year later, the broadcasting 
of revealing videos spurred the minister into action.
<P>
	Can the defence minister assure us that the board of inquiry's 
mandate will not be limited to the events in Somalia because, if 
it is, we must conclude that dismantling the Airborne Regiment 
will allow the officers and NCMs who have committed 
unacceptable acts to avoid punishment by being redeployed to 
other regiments or even decorated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
already announced publicly that the inquiry will begin as soon as 
the last court martial is concluded, which will be about the 
middle of March. It will deal with the Canadian Armed Forces 
deployment to Somalia in 1992-93; how the regiment was 
prepared for that deployment; how particular incidents which 
occurred in Somalia were reported, investigated and handled, 
both on the ground in Somalia and here in Ottawa at national 
defence headquarters.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member and Canadians generally 
that all of the concerns that one might have about the incidents 
in Somalia and our engagement there will be subject to the 
inquiry's terms of reference, once the inquiry is established. As 
I said before, that inquiry will begin as soon as the last court 
martial is concluded.

	My second question is this: Does the defence minister 
confirm that, in a recent investigation, the military police seized 
a third videotape whose content may be more violent and even 
more shocking than the two previous ones? Can the minister 
promise that this new tape will not be destroyed like some of the

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many months ago the Minister of Human Resources 
Development launched his much touted review of social 
programs. He promised to radically transform our social safety 
net to make it more efficient and restore hope to those entrapped 
within it. Now, months later and millions of dollars later, 
nothing. The minister has failed to deliver on any of his 
promises and his failure will cost Canadians dearly in the 
budget.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Given the 
government's failure in this regard, what plans does it now have 
to reform social programs and when can Canadians expect the 
results?
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the hon. 
member is attempting to cast a very important initiative which 
has been very broadly and strongly endorsed by the Canadian 
people to help reform social policy in a light that only reflects 
his own particular pessimistic view of things.
<P>
	The government is very much committed to continuing with 
social reform. We now have the committee report which has a 
number of recommendations in it. We are looking at that report 
very carefully. We will be responding to it within the time 
required by the House in terms of a specific policy and we are 
going forward with our plans to bring in legislation this fall.
<P>
	Social policy is well on track, unlike the policies and 
positions of the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the failure of the social program review has a direct 
impact on the spending in the budget.
<P>
	As the government knows, over 60 per cent of its spending is 
in the social area. The budget cannot be balanced unless both 
social programs and social spending are substantially reformed.
<P>
	Will the government not acknowledge that the primary reason 
the finance minister is now considering tax increases, which he 
was not doing two months ago, is because the human resources 
development minister failed to deliver on social programs and 
social spending?
<P>
	In other words, will the government acknowledge that it is the 
taxpayers who are going to pay for the human resources 
development minister's failure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will repeat the answer 
once again for the hon. member. I recall very well that during his 
election campaign he was a strong advocate of listening to the 
judgment of the people. Since he has been elected to the House it 
seems he no longer has much faith or trust in their judgment.
<P>
	We still do and that is why we undertook for a period of four 
months a very serious, very extensive, very broad based 
discussion with Canadians. Over 100,000 participated in one 
way or the other.
<P>
	Our reforms will be based on the judgment of the people, not 
on the curious and strange ideology of the hon. member 
opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has not yet provided any satisfactory 
explanation for the failure of the social program review. Surely 
one of the reasons is that the minister handed out millions and 
millions of dollars to liberal thinking special interest groups to 
lobby for the status quo and against spending reductions.
<P>
	This is becoming the Achilles' heel of the government. The 
parole board has been weakened by patronage and special 
interest politics, as has the IRB and the social program review.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Instead of 
excusing and justifying patronage and special interest politics, 
when is the government going to acknowledge that it is this 
addiction which weakens the government's integrity and do 
something to correct it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the member calls an 
addiction 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9327"> 9327 </A></B>
<P>
to special interest groups could much more properly be 
expressed as a real interest and willingness to find out what 
Canadians believe and what they say.
<P>
	The proof of the value of having that kind of broad based 
discussion with Canadians is demonstrated in the kind of 
recommendations that the majority members tabled when the 
committee reported this week, unlike the Reform Party's 
recommendations.
<P>
	The member for Calgary North, a member of the committee, 
is quoted today as saying that she hopes people do not 
misinterpret aspects of the Reform Party's report on social 
policy, admitting ``they were not thought through very well 
before they were rushed into print''.

<P>

<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice confirm that his department 
recently stopped dealing with a Cowansville law firm and gave 
its business to the law firm of Eugène Bachand, who is the

the law firm of Liberal candidate Denis Paradis was allowed to

<P>
	In Brome-Missisquoi and in places across the country the 
Department of Justice, since the election of the government, has 
reformed the process of selecting legal agents to ensure that they 
are properly trained and supervised, that they act without 
conflict of interest, and that services are provided in accordance

question is for the minister of Winnipeg, or is it western 
economic diversification?
<P>
	I recently released a critical study of his department which 
showed conclusively that his home town of Winnipeg was 
receiving a disproportionate amount of WED dollars. This 
report, which was based on information obtained directly from 
his department officials, showed that Winnipeg received five 
times more than Vancouver, seven times more than Calgary, and 
seventy times more than Regina between November 1, 1993 and 
November 15, 1994.
<P>
	Why is the minister funnelling far more taxpayer dollars into 
Winnipeg than any other western city?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, as

reliability of Reform Party reports are somewhat questionable. 
We can see it even more so in the report cited by the hon. 
member wherein the statistics were based upon only 20 per cent 
of the actual approved projects for western Canada.
<P>

demonstrate to Canadians that they are the soul of rectitude 
when it comes to finances, it seems to me they should learn to 
count.

writers. I would ask the hon. minister if he would withdraw the 
word ``liars'' used in that context. Would you please withdraw 
that word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
seeing that it is a saying I learned at my mother's knee, I would 
certainly not want to have it refer to that specific member. I was 
using it as a general philosophical saying.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we cannot go from quoting 
great writers to our mothers' lullabies. Would the minister 
withdraw forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly withdraw any specific reference or any interpretation 
that the hon. member was a liar.
<P>
	I will seek to refer to Bartlett's quotations-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. minister would go directly to 
his answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
to answer the hon. member directly, I would first point out that 
in this past year, if one looks at the geographical allocation 
which of course we do not do because we have been promoting a 
strategy that tries to look at projects on a pan-western basis to 
benefit all regions, the province of British Columbia received 
close to 50 per cent of all funding coming from western 
diversification.
<P>
	One member alone who happens to be a Reform Party member 
received upward of $37 million in one grant. He takes the cake 
for having the largest allocation of any member. I congratulate 
the hon. member for his effectiveness. However, when we make 
city to city comparisons, I would also like to say to the regret of 
my Manitoba colleagues the city that benefited most per capita 
from investment from western economic diversification was the 
great Queen city of Saskatchewan. I compliment the members of

Quebec, where such a tax is felt to be utterly contrary to the

Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it came time to make the 
appointment of Mrs. Meyer and others, I had the opportunity to 
consult with a broad variety of people across the country, 
including senior representatives of farm organizations. I 
indicated who I had in mind to appoint. The recommendations I 
was about to make were very well received by the farm 
organizations.
<P>
	I suggest that if the hon. member wants to put his credibility 
on the line on who is the most popular in Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, I will take him on any day.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very good question, unlike the members on the 
other side.
<P>
	My question is addressed to the Minister of National 
Revenue. Canadians are made to believe by the Reform Party 
that their income tax goes only toward the federal government 
because there is no deduction shown for provincial taxes on 
paycheques.
<P>
	In the case of Ontario the provincial tax box is blank. 
However, I believe this is misleading. What action can the 
minister take to make sure Canadians know which government 
is really getting their money and by how much?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has raised an important point 
and I thank him for it.
<P>
	The design of the form is ambiguous in certain respects. In 
Quebec, which administers its own individual taxes, the amount 
is shown in a separate box on the form but in the other provinces 
and territories, which harmonize with the federal government, 
the taxes collected are shown as a single lump sum.
<P>
	I can assure him that this process is the most administratively 
efficient. It does lead to some misunderstanding and there is no 
intention to mislead Canadians concerning the amount of 
provincial tax paid.
<P>
	We will take his representation and I will have the department 
look at it with a view to redesigning the form so that we can deal 
with this confusion that does exist with respect to which level of 
government receives the taxes individual taxpayers pay.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, N.D.P):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Yesterday over 500 members of the RCMP marched for the 
first time ever on Parliament Hill to denounce the attempt of this 
government to deny them collective bargaining rights and to 
punish them for even talking about collective bargaining.
<P>
	In view of the fact that this bill was condemned yesterday by 
the Liberal chair of the justice committee who said the bill was 
slid by the Liberal caucus and is an attack on the civil rights of 
RCMP members, how can the minister continue to defend this 
dictatorial, jackboot approach to dedicated members of the 
RCMP?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while the chair of the justice committee can speak for 
himself, I understand that he feels his comments were not 
completely and fully reported by the press. I would suggest that 
my hon. friend take that into account.
<P>
	Also, there are 15,000 uniformed members of the RCMP. 
They have had their own labour relations system since 1975. 
They elect representatives to work on their behalf full time to 
protect their interests vis-à-vis management. I ask the hon. 
member to take that into account as well.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	The study of Bill C-58 is beginning this afternoon in the 
appropriate committee. I think at that time it will be confirmed 
that the bill simply confirms the basic position with respect to 
the management of the RCMP. It does not add to the powers of 
the commissioner and it does not take anything away from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9332"> 9332 </A></B>
<P>
members of the force. That is why the House gave it second 
reading.
<P>
	I commend it to the committee and to the House. It is designed 
to protect and enhance the position of the force as the prime 
policing organization in Canada and perhaps in the world.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMENTSINQUESTIONPERIOD">COMMENTS IN QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I raised a question of privilege on November 2, 
1994 regarding an incident that arose from question period on 
November 1, 1994.
<P>
	As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister 
quoted from a letter I wrote to the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
regarding a concern of one of my constituents. This was done 
without my prior knowledge or permission or the prior 
knowledge or permission of my constituent.
<P>
	At that time the Deputy Prime Minister stood in the House and 
argued that the letter was public domain. It was on this argument 
that the matter was dropped.
<P>
	Since then I have received a copy of a letter from the CRTC to 
my constituent which was in response to my letter. In the letter 
from the CRTC the manager of correspondence and complaints 
division writes: ``In accordance with your rights and the CRTC's 
obligations under the Privacy Act, unless you advise the 
commission otherwise, within three weeks of the date of this 
letter it will follow the usual practice of placing a copy of all 
correspondence related to your complaint on the licensee's 
publicly accessible file''.
<P>
	Clearly the CRTC regards the correspondence relating to my 
constituent's complaint as private as defined in the Privacy Act.
<P>
	The letter from the CRTC is dated December 13, 1994. 
Considering the three-week requirement before making the 
correspondence public, my letter to the minister was not a public 
document until January 3, 1995.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister quoted from my letter relating to 
my constituent's complaint on November 1, 1994, two months 
before the letter was deemed a public document.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	In light of this new information, Mr. Speaker, I ask that you 
reconsider the matter. If in your deliberations of whether what I 
raise today constitutes a prima facie question of privilege, I ask 
that you consider the following.
<P>
	By making my private letter available to the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Canadian Heritage breached 
confidentiality. In so doing he interfered with my ability to 
function as a member of Parliament by calling into question 
whether issues on which constituents asked my assistance will 
be made public.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you find this to be a prima facie 
question of privilege. If you do so find, as is the usual practice of 
the House, as described in Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
118, I will move that this question of privilege be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are two points for the Chair to consider. I 
submit this does not constitute a valid point of privilege.
<P>
	The allegation is that there was a breach of confidentiality by 
the CRTC in giving information to the Deputy Prime Minister 
and that this may have been a violation. This is not 
acknowledged by our side at all. Even if it was, it would 
constitute a dispute in law on whether that law was breached. It 
is not something that the Speaker usually rules on. The Speaker 
has made the point on several occasions in the past that his role 
is not to discuss whether an issue is legal or otherwise but only 
whether the privileges of members of the House have been 
violated.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9333"> 9333 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that if the member has 
such a complaint with the CRTC he should file an appeal with 
the Privacy Commissioner and indicate in his appeal that he 
believes, if such is the case, that the privacy of his constituent 
has been denied.
<P>
	In either case, this is not a matter for the House to deal with.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I read some place over the 
holidays that I usually take some time to deliberate.
<P>
	The hon. member did raise this point in November. At that 
time I invited him to come back with new information if he had 
it. I wonder if the House would again extend to me its patience. 
If necessary I will come back to the House on this matter of 
privilege.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order in accordance with Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, page 111, citation 374. In a Standing Order 31 statement 
yesterday the member for Brant attributed to me comments 
which I assume were taken from a media report. The media 
report had taken me out of context and completely 
misrepresented my position.
<P>
	It is one thing to have erroneous comments in the media, but it 
is quite another to have it read into the official record of the 
House of Commons. I respectfully request that the reference to 
me in that statement be withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member gave me notice that he was 
going to raise a point of order. I would like to review not only the 
``blues'' but also the television tapes so I can ascertain precisely 
what was said and in what context. I will return to the House if it 
is necessary.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORALQUESTIONPERIOD">ORAL QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you refused a question from the member for 
Saint-Hubert during question period. This question pertained to 
a matter which I will state, and I would then ask you why you 
refused it. This question dealt in part with appointments made 
by the government, thus pertaining to the role of government, 
and secondly, with the possible reasons for these appointments, 
pertaining therefore to the ethics of this government and of this 
Parliament. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister 
alike are to serve as guardians on matters of ethics, as was 
emphasized at the very beginning of this session.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	So we are curious to know why this question was refused 
since, it would seem, such appointments and ethics are issues of 
government.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> May I remind the hon. member that the Speaker 
does not normally have to state his reason for refusing a 
question, but I may say that it seemed to me at that moment, as I 
indicated, that this question did not pertain to the specific 
responsibilities of this minister of the government. I made that 
decision in good faith and I hope you will accept it as such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, would it be possible for us to 
meet so you might explain to us-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Certainly. If the hon. member or the hon. 
member who asked the question would like to discuss it with me, 
I will be pleased to meet with them in my chambers.

<P>
	The committee requests a response from the government 
pursuant to Standing Order 109. I have a very short comment.
<P>
	The committee travelled to many points in western Canada 
including Edmonton, Hay River as well as places like Garden 
Hill. We heard from over 100 witnesses on this very important 
issue.
<P>
	The committee report is an attempt to strike a balance 
between the conflicting needs of those who are served by the 
Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation, in order to assure those 
who feel that their interests are not being best served. They 
actually can aspire to success and those who are successful can 
continue to be so.
<P>
	It is with a great deal of pleasure that I make this report from 
the fisheries committee to Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me to mention that the hon. member for Gaspé, who is 
vice-chairman of the fisheries committee, was present each 
time the committee sat, went to all of the hearings in 
communities out west and was very active in the drafting of the 
report.
<P>
	Since he is absent today because he is a member of the 
important committee on the draft bill on Quebec's sovereignty, I 
will present the Bloc Quebecois' dissenting opinion. Overall, 
the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the committee's report and 
agrees that responsibility for processing and marketing 
freshwater fish should be transferred to the provinces.
<P>
	However, we have a problem with the conditions of the 
transfer. Since the committee recommends that responsibility be 
transferred, we think that now is not the time to change the rules 
on marketing freshwater fish, before even consulting the First 
Nations, the provinces and the territories which will be affected.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, given the difficulties fishermen in remote areas are 
experiencing, the Bloc Quebecois recommends that, at the first 
possible opportunity, the federal government jointly study with 
the provinces and the territories the possibility of granting 
special vending permits to remote communities throughout the 
transition period.

Thompson. April 11, 1995 is the date that has been set for his

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to 
present four petitions from the riding of Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley all to do with the issue of euthanasia.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that Parliament ensure that the present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no 
change to the law which would sanction or allow the aiding or 
abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
	The first petition is from the Mennonite Brethren, Nechako 
Community Church in Vanderhoof, B.C. The second petition 
dealing with euthanasia is also from Vanderhoof, B.C. The third 
and fourth petitions are from Prince George, B.C. I am pleased

	Therefore, the petitioners humbly pray and request that 
Parliament not amend the human rights code, the Canadian

request that Parliament not amend the human rights code that 
would change in any way and indicate society's approval for

<P>
	The petitioners request that the present provisions of the 
Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be

without serious cause place obstacles between the child and the 
grandparents and that failing agreement between the parties the

	The petitioners request that the Government of Canada not 
amend the human rights act to include the phrase ``sexual 
orientation''. The petitioners are concerned about including the 
undefined phrase of sexual orientation in the Canadian Human

interpretation open to the courts, a very dangerous precedent to

<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the 
following. Whereas the majority of Canadians are law-abiding 
citizens who respect the law; whereas the majority of Canadians 
respect the sanctity of human life; whereas the majority of 
Canadians believe that physicians in Canada should be working 
to save lives, not to end them, the petitioners pray that 
Parliament ensure that the present provisions of the Criminal 
Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced 
vigorously and that Parliament make no changes in the law 
which would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide 
or active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present a number of petitions.
<P>
	First, I have a petition which is signed by residents of a 
number of communities in British Columbia, including the 
Fraser Valley. The petitioners draw the attention of the House to 
the fact that the current Criminal Code denies people who are 
suffering from terminal or irreversible debilitating illness the 
right to choose freely and voluntarily to end their lives with the 
assistance of a physician.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9338"> 9338 </A></B>

	They therefore call upon Parliament to amend the Criminal 
Code to ensure the right of all Canadians to die with dignity 
by allowing people with terminal or irreversible and 
debilitating illness the right to the assistance of a physician in 
ending their lives at a time of their choice, subject to strict 
safeguards to prevent abuse and to ensure that the decision is 
free, informed, competent and voluntary.

Second, Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition 
which has been co-ordinated by the Hellenic Canadian Congress 
of Canada and signed by hundreds of Canadians of Hellenic 
origin and friends in British Columbia.
<P>
	The petitioners note that Canada has strong and enduring 
economic, political and strategic ties with Greece, being its ally 
during every major conflict in this century. They comment on 
the historical evidence with respect to Macedonia having been a 
part of the Greek nation for over 25 centuries that Greece has no 
claim on the territory of Fyrom. They express concern about 
Fyrom hostile propaganda campaign against Greece and its 
hostile constitutional provisions.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to refrain from 
taking any action involving recognition of Fyrom until such 
time as its government renounces the use of the name 
Macedonia, removes objectionable language from its 
constitution, abandons the use of symbols implying territorial 
expansionism, ceases hostile propaganda against Greece and, 
finally, adheres fully to the norms and principles of the 
conference on security and co-operation in Europe.

the Senate of Canada.

the people of Canada and therefore calls upon Parliament to end 
this wasteful use of taxpayers' money and abolish the Senate.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-47, an act 
to amend the Department of External Affairs Act and to make 
related amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendments) from the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Lib.) </B>moved that Bill C-47, an act to amend the Department of 
External Affairs Act and to make related amendments to other 
acts, as amended be concurred in at the report stage.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley (for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in this House today 
in support of Bill C-47, as amended by the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to thank the official opposition 
and the Reform Party for their co-operation in improving the 
bill by suggesting certain technical changes. This is what I enjoy 
about Parliament, when parties can work together to improve a 
bill.
<P>
	This bill contains housekeeping measures related to the 
Department of External Affairs Act. As I have previously stated 
in this Chamber, the government made a commitment to 
Canadians to change the name of the Department of External 
Affairs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.
<P>
	This change in name reflects the accomplishments and 
independence of Canadian foreign policy since World War II 
and Canada's maturity from a colony to a dominion, to a 
sovereign nation. It embraces the contemporary mandate and 
responsibilities of the department. The changes to the 
Department of External Affairs Act contained in this bill are not 
substantive. The bill changes the legal name of the department, 
titles of the minister and titles of senior officials.
<P>
	Under this act the Secretary of State for External Affairs will 
become the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The title of the Minister 
for International Trade will remain unchanged. The title of a 
junior minister, the Minister of External Relations, will change 
to become the Minister for International Co-operation.
<P>
	The official opposition had some concern with that, why have 
that position if it is not filled? The government would like the 
flexibility in case there is a need to appoint such a minister in the 
future.
<P>
	The titles of senior officials, including the term 
under-secretary, will reflect the changes made to ministerial 
titles. For example, the Under-Secretary of State for External 
Affairs will become the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The amendments passed by the committee following second 
reading of Bill C-47 were housekeeping measures as well. 
Clause 7, for example, was amended at the request of committee 
members of the official opposition to more clearly define the 
roles and responsibilities of the minister as they related to aid 
and trade. This was done.
<P>
	Government members sponsored amendments to clauses 18 
and 19 of the bill. Clause 18 of the bill was amended due to a 
technical error in the drafting of the bill. Clause 19 was amended 
so that it would concur with amendments that have been passed 
by Parliament to the French version of the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	Bill C-47 makes no substantive changes to the structure of the 
department. Rather, the change in name contained in this 
legislation reflects the current mandate of the department and 
the modernity of the Canadian statehood as reflected in the 
government's response to the special joint committee reviewing 
foreign policy that was tabled here yesterday in the House by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and also by the Minister for 
International Trade.
<P>
	Both of these reports highlight how important foreign policy 
and this department are to Canadians. At home and abroad the 
employees of the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade serve and promote the interest and values 
that Canadians hold dear. Let us join together in congratulating 
them on many years of excellent service and their continuing 
commitment to Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	The Governor General this morning at his installation 
complimented and praised our peacekeepers and the good they 
are doing and the positive image they are giving Canada around 
the world. I would like to take this opportunity to give the same 
recognition to our foreign service members who work abroad, 
all of them, whether it be in the external affairs section or 
international trade, because Canada does have an excellent 
image. Anywhere you travel around this globe or in speaking to 
the diplomatic corps here in Ottawa, you will hear nothing but 
the highest praises for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We all can take some credit. The people representing Canada 
around the globe especially deserve a lot of credit for the kind of

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have before us today, in third reading, Bill C-47 to amend the 
Department of External Affairs Act. This is a bill of very little 
substance, containing almost nothing but changes in wording. It 
is not very innovative, and does not drastically change the way 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
operates.
<P>
	All in all, this is a bill of little significance, which fits in 
nicely with the general level of the bills introduced by this 
government so far, since the opening of the session, in January 
1994. Like the GATT agreements implementation bill, Bill 
C-47 makes cosmetic changes. It is therefore without much 
enthusiasm that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill which, 
after all, rejuvenates somewhat the old Department of External 
Affairs Act by giving it a more modern name.
<P>
	However, the government could have taken this opportunity 
to make changes that could have had the merit of eliminating 
grey areas and clarifying certain aspects related to the purpose 
of Canadian foreign policy. We would have liked the new 
legislation to streamline the department's corporate structure by 
removing a few positions that have remained vacant since the 
Liberals came to power and which cannot be all that crucial if 
they have not been filled. I am referring to the positions of 
minister responsible for international co-operation, associate 
deputy minister, and co-ordinator for international economic 
relations.
<P>
	I believe the position of Minister for International 
Co-operation is totally useless, since the current government 
does not deign to attach enough importance to international 
development to include in a piece of legislation the mandate and 
the principles governing the responsible agency. Why appoint 
another minister, or leave that possibility open, if that minister 
is going to be accountable to another department? Canadians no 
longer have the means to afford illusions. The government does 
not want to abolish positions which are deemed useless since 
they are currently vacant. Is its insistence that these positions 
remain in the act due to the fact that it wants to preserve its 
authority to make discretionary appointments? Do the Liberals 
have friends looking for jobs?
<P>
	It is true that, considering the social program reform which 
they want to impose to Canadians, the Liberals probably do not 
wish to see their friends out of work. On a more serious note, I 
will try to show that the government missed a great opportunity 
to clarify its objectives in the context of official development 
assistance.
<P>
	The day after the government tabled its foreign policy 
statement, it is appropriate to remember that there are three key 
objectives that will guide the government's activities on the 
international scene: the promotion of jobs and prosperity; the 
protection of our security in a stable international framework; 
and the sharing of our values and our culture.
<P>
	Among the values that the government wants to promote, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs referred, in his speech here 
yesterday, to generosity, compassion and co-operation. As well, 
the majority report of the joint committee reviewing Canadian 
foreign policy proposes that the government set the reduction of 
poverty in the world as the first objective for official 
development assistance.
<P>
	That being said, how are we to interpret clause 7 in Bill C-47, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister may develop and carry out programs related to his powers, duties 
and functions for the promotion of Canada's interest abroad, including the 
fostering of the expansion of Canada's international trade and commerce and the 
provision of assistance for developing countries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In committee, the clause was split in two: A and B.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	How can a foreign policy focus on promoting Canada's 
interests and at the same time claim that eliminating poverty is 
to be the goal of its official development assistance?
<P>
	During the foreign policy review, many witnesses and experts 
stressed the need to clarify the objectives of official 
development assistance. The joint committee also reminded the 
government that it was not CIDA's role to promote trade. 
Unfortunately, clause 7 appears to maintain these 
inconsistencies. We would have liked to see another amendment 
to the existing legislation, specifically on international 
development. The official opposition in this House has already 
suggested that a specific legislative framework was needed for 
the Canadian International Development Agency. We believe 
that Bill C-47 could have provided for these changes. In fact, in 
our dissenting report on Canada's foreign policy review tabled 
last fall, we recommended such changes.
<P>
	There would have been a number of advantages to adopting 
enabling legislation for CIDA. Separating Canadian official 
development assistance, once and for all, from any involvement 
in international trade is a prime example. In fact, the confusion 
today within the Department of Foreign Affairs about interests 
and objectives as they affect international development exists 
because there is no separation between trade and aid. The 
Auditor General made that clear in his latest report.
<P>
	We certainly do not want to give the impression that it is 
wrong to promote Canada's trade relations. On the contrary. We 
too are aware of the fact that over 20 per cent of jobs in Canada 
are tied to our exports of goods and services. What we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9341"> 9341 </A></B>
<P>
agree with is the government's refusal to separate what should 
be  separated, thus making official development assistance 
dependent on commercial interests. This is no doubt why the 
government made no commitment either in its policy on the 
gradual elimination of tied aid, despite the recommendation of 
the joint foreign policy review committee. The same 
recommendation was made by the development assistance 
committee of the OECD.
<P>
	The official development assistance budget is suffering in all 
this confusion. Too many Canadian businesses are currently 
benefiting from CIDA funds that should go instead to 
international development, because of the ambiguity 
surrounding this issue. The priorities of the aid program simply 
cannot be linked to the objectives of Canada's trade policy. It is 
vital that CIDA be protected from the influence of the various 
departments it regularly deals with, often to the detriment of the 
aid itself.
<P>
	CIDA's mandate should also have been clarified in a 
constituent act. However, we understand from the government's 
recent statement on Canadian foreign policy that such an act is 
not one of its objectives.
<P>
	Yet the special joint committee responsible for reviewing 
Canadian foreign policy recommended, in response to pressure 
by Bloc Quebecois members of the committee, that Parliament 
pass a bill establishing the fundamental principles of 
development aid. It also recommended in its majority report that 
such development aid provided by the government be subject to 
regular review by committees of the House and of the Senate.
<P>
	The response of the Canadian government was that, while the 
intention was noble and justified, the government did not intend 
to pass such a bill on the grounds that it would not necessarily 
serve the goals of aid and would reduce program flexibility. In 
other words, the government was of the opinion that legislation 
on development aid would be too restrictive.
<P>
	By clearly establishing the goals of development aid and the 
mandate of the agency responsible for carrying out international 
cooperation programs, the government would evidently be 
forced to follow strict rules of conduct. It would probably no 
longer be possible to promote international trade via 
development programs or, at least, this would be somewhat 
awkward for a government which prides itself on being in charge 
of one of the most generous countries in the world.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Small gestures most often reveal the underlying agenda of a 
government, and, in this regard, clause 7 is quite revealing. 
Although the ministers of this government make speeches about 
eliminating poverty and reducing the gap between rich and poor 
countries, when bills are tabled in the House of Commons, other 
considerations always take precedence over Canadian and 
Quebecois values, even though the government claims it wants 
to promote them.
<P>
	This comes as no surprise, considering that, in its February 
1994 budget, the government cut the official development 
assistance budget, tightened unemployment insurance 
eligibility and forgot to address the inequities in the tax system 
that the official opposition had been pointing out for months.
<P>
	It was with the same agenda that the government claimed to 
go ahead with social program reforms, while its real goal, which 
was finally announced by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, was to cut the social program budget by $15 
billion over 5 years.
<P>
	Therefore, the government's method is the same whether it is 
dealing with domestic or foreign policy: it says one thing, but 
does another. Thus the meaning of the slogan of the foreign 
affairs committee's former chairman is becoming clearer: 
foreign policy reflects domestic policy and domestic policy 
reflects foreign policy.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois criticizes the government 
for not having clarified in this bill where it is going with its aid 
programs for the poorest countries of the planet. Instead, it 
satisfied itself with simply changing the name of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs. Instead of checking into a spa to 
rejuvenate and revitalize, it preferred to slap on more make-up. 
We can only wait for the next attempt.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure and some degree of surprise that I rise in the House 
today to debate Bill C-47, an act to amend the Department of 
External Affairs Act.
<P>
	I would like to tell the House why I am surprised to be 
speaking today. It is because I was not told until 4 p.m. yesterday 
that the bill would be up for debate. The government did not 
bother to tell our House leader's office until 3.30 p.m.
<P>
	Is it another example of how the government wants to act in 
matters such as this one? It possibly handles the country like this 
as well. Even more surprising, Bill C-47 was not an upcoming 
government bill on the House of Commons Order Paper for 
Monday.
<P>
	Only yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Government House Leader attempted to lecture my esteemed 
Reform colleague from Peace River and myself on a point of 
order about how hard the government was working to give us 
advanced warning of upcoming events.
<P>
	If less than a day is what the government considers to be 
plentiful warning time, I suppose the member for Kingston and 
the Islands was right. However, with the bill going into third 
reading the government has no real reason to spring it on us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9342"> 9342 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask the government to give us an informal call in 
the future so that we have a fair chance to prepare ourselves. 
After all, if we cannot have serious, well prepared debates in 
Parliament, Canadians will not be getting the service they 
deserve.
<P>
	Getting to the issue at hand, Bill C-47, the Reform Party will 
be supporting the bill. It modernizes the Department of Foreign 
Affairs. Although Bill C-47 will not bring about major changes 
in substance to the way the Department of Foreign Affairs is 
operated, it shows an evolution of the department to reflect the 
needs and values of Canadians in the 1990s.
<P>
	I would like to highlight what I think Canadians expect from 
the Department of Foreign Affairs. Many people do not even 
realize it is of much importance to them. My constituents will 
ask why we are spending so much time working on that 
committee and in that area. I could ask them what they watch in 
the newscast at night, what their jobs are or what many of their 
jobs are related to. In my constituency we have a large 
petrochemical industry, almost 90 per cent of which goes to 
foreign areas. We have agriculture, a great deal of which goes to 
the United States and other places. When those matters are 
mentioned they realize the importance of foreign affairs in their 
everyday life.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	As a result we have hopefully encouraged more interest in 
foreign affairs. At least now I am asked on occasion: ``What is 
happening in foreign affairs?'' The modernization the 
government is undergoing in Bill C-47 provides an opportunity 
to highlight the directions in which we think foreign affairs 
should go as the people of Canada are telling us from a 
grassroots level.
<P>
	Canadians want to think of us as a middle power, as being in a 
middle power position. They want to be proud of Canada. In 
many cases we are a bit laid back when it comes to talking about 
how great our country really is. Only when they travel outside 
the country and talk to others about Canada do they realize what 
sort of country we have and what sort of profile we have. We 
need to use that profile to develop a far thinking foreign affairs 
policy to help us utilize not only opinions from outside but what 
we have going for us on the inside.
<P>
	In yesterday's statement I was disappointed in not seeing 
emphasis being put on the use of more of our multicultural 
benefits, our people who are trained, who know, who have 
relatives and understand other countries. I was also 
disappointed that we did not make more use of our foreign 
students and Canadians we send to universities around the 
world. They are a great asset we do not keep track of and we do 
not utilize.
<P>
	I hear on the streets that CIDA needs to become more 
accountable. Certainly people want a transparent agency. They 
are not prepared to hear about the terrible mistakes made in that 
agency or about the ridiculous projects that are funded such as 
the underwater breeding of water buffalo in Thailand. They do 
not particularly want to  fund projects unless they see some 
value to them for the people they are trying to help.
<P>
	There has to be accountability. There has to be a reporting 
mechanism to Parliament. There has to be a greater utilization of 
NGOs in that whole area. One of my colleagues will be talking 
about that later. We certainly need to target what we have to do. 
We cannot do everything for everybody, and we recognize that.
<P>
	In looking at the bill, we should be concerned and asking 
questions about administration from the top. We should be 
asking if the minister really needs under-secretaries. Do we 
really need the deputy positions? At this point in our financial 
crisis we need to be asking: Should we not be cutting from the 
top instead of doing it the easy way by cutting from the bottom? 
Often we cut from the bottom up instead of from the top down. 
We should emphasize to the minister that we want it to be 
different in the Department of Foreign Affairs. We should be 
examining under-secretary and deputy positions long before we 
talk about cutting people in the field.
<P>
	As far as world organization is concerned, I agree with the 
hon. member opposite who said that our foreign service is doing 
an excellent job. I have had the opportunity to visit a number of 
our foreign consulates and will continue to visit them. We have 
some great leadership out there and people who are doing the job 
for us. I will come back to that point in a minute. The world is 
now divided into three units. It consists of the EU, developing 
and working together, becoming a very important economic, 
political and in some cases military unit.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The second unit is the Asia-Pacific region. It started out with 
one tiger, then two. Now there are seven tigers that are really 
moving forward in the world. We must recognize that and learn 
how to deal with them.
<P>
	The third unit is the Americas, which have been ignored by us, 
with the exception of the U.S., for a long time. Now we are 
starting to look at these countries, at Mexico and Central and 
South America. They become the third major unit of the world 
with which we will be dealing.
<P>
	It is important that we put into place our role in the Americas. 
It is important that we become a leader. When talking to people 
in some countries, particularly in South America, they say: ``We 
want Canada to be our mediator, to be between us and the 
elephant. You are used to sleeping beside that elephant and 
dealing with it. We want you to take a leadership role in helping 
us to know how to deal with the U.S.'' They are looking for us to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9343"> 9343 </A></B>
<P>
show leadership. At this point they are basically saying that they 
have not seen us take that role as strongly as we might.
<P>
	I mentioned peacekeeping. That is a very important area and 
one in which Canada has a high profile. It is important that we 
thank all those peacekeepers for the fantastic ambassadors they 
are to the world. I believe we all agree on that. As well, we must 
recognize that we need to know where we are going and what we 
are doing when it comes to peacekeeping. We just cannot be 
everywhere. Therefore, we must develop criteria.
<P>
	The old threat of the cold war is gone. Now we have a much 
more difficult threat to our security. We have all kinds of things 
like health problems, the AIDS epidemic and many other health 
problems that threaten our country.
<P>
	We also have environmental problems. Countries like China 
are proposing to build coal generating plants which could affect 
the environment around the world. We need to be leaders in that 
area and show that leadership to other countries of the world.
<P>
	Immigration, migration and refugees are also problems we 
have to deal with.
<P>
	We are concerned that 80 per cent of trade is with the U.S. We 
realize we must diversify. Unfortunately, a great many people 
say: ``Okay, I deal with the Americans. They speak the same 
language, they understand us and it is very easy''. However 
when times get a little tough, companies start looking offshore 
for trading arrangements and then as soon as times get better in 
the U.S. they drop those connections and go back to the U.S. 
Industries must be encouraged to change.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity over the last year and a half to meet 
a lot of different people. I recall some members here met with a 
Kuwaiti group of MPs. The one question we had from the 
Kuwaiti MPs was: why did Canada not get more contracts? 
Obviously we were there and we tried to do our share in that 
whole situation in Kuwait, but we did not get the contracts. We 
were there to do everything else but we did not get the business 
contracts for the rebuilding of the country. Why? There was one 
answer which was that we are not aggressive enough. We are too 
passive, too laid back. We do not push this country they way we 
need to.
<P>
	I met with the ambassador to Chile and received much the 
same message: Why are you not more aggressive? Why do you 
not take more action?
<P>
	This summer I was in London, Sweden and Paris and I asked 
the question: ``How could we do more business? What more 
should we do?'' I was told: ``You need to become more 
aggressive''. That is the message the world is giving us. As MPs 
we must then carry that message and certainly foreign affairs 
has to get that message out.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Foreign affairs is important to Canadians. It now represents a 
couple of million jobs in this country. It represents 30 per cent of 
our GDP. Therefore when we talk about its importance we 
should not have any trouble convincing anyone.
<P>
	The new arrangements replacing GATT with the World Trade 
Organization will go a long way in helping us market our 
products. I really believe this will be a forward moving process 
for us as Canadians.
<P>
	The expansion of NAFTA obviously is of significance, 
something that the Canadian government should greatly 
encourage. It should be part of any foreign affairs policy and one 
that should be greatly emphasized.
<P>
	We cannot underestimate the importance of the Americans. 
They have largely been responsible for our becoming the 
seventh largest trading nation while we are only 31st in 
population. While Canadians strive to diversify their trade, we 
must continue to emphasize the importance of our relationship 
with the U.S. Therefore the trade aspect of foreign affairs is 
extremely important.
<P>
	In the embassies I have visited I have found they now put 
more and more emphasis on the trade aspect. It must be 
encouraged and continued. We have to be a little careful as well 
because someone in France raised an interesting point with me. 
We have about $6 billion in trade with France and about $6 
billion in trade with Korea. But 60 per cent of the trade with 
France is in sophisticated fine tuned instrumentation. With 
Korea about 95 per cent is raw materials.
<P>
	Before we change the whole emphasis of foreign affairs and 
get rid of our European connections to go rushing to the new 
markets of South America and the Orient, we have to be a little 
careful and look at what we are selling. We will run out of raw 
materials. That is not where the jobs are. That is not the area we 
should be emphasizing. Trade is an important part of foreign 
affairs. The Canadian people expect it to be an important part.
<P>
	We have mentioned other areas that we should discuss very 
briefly, certainly UN reform. The United Nations is 50 years old 
today. It is disappointing to look at the document we got 
yesterday to see a lack of any sort of forward thinking in terms of 
what we mean when we say that we are in favour of UN reform.
<P>
	What do we mean? What are we going to do? How are we 
going to be leaders to change the UN? We can make many 
suggestions but the same terminology comes out of foreign 
affairs or any department of government. We must look at 
efficiency, accountability and effectiveness.
<P>
	We hear the horror stories. People like Major-General 
MacKenzie talked about phoning the UN on a Friday afternoon. 
``We have the troops pinned down. What do we do?'' He was 
told: ``Call back on Monday''. Then the system was reformed. 
They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9344"> 9344 </A></B>
<P>
put in a fax machine. We  could then have written confirmation 
that he was in trouble. He still had to wait until Monday 
morning.
<P>
	The United Nations needs to be reformed and it should be 
done from the top. We need some ideas. We need to start off. We 
need to force countries to pay their dues. I do not blame the 
Americans for not paying their dues because they are saying: 
``Get your act together and then we will pay our dues''. We have 
to be in a position where we can be leaders in those reforms.
<P>
	The UN needs an early warning system. My wife and I toured 
Rwanda and stayed in villages in 1985. We knew then a conflict 
was brewing and that the two tribes were having problems. We 
have had all kinds of peacekeepers and all kinds of NGOs tell us 
about the problems brewing but we did nothing. I applaud the 
government for mentioning in its statement yesterday that it 
needed to develop an early warning system. Then I noticed that 
the government totally forgot about the bad idea it had about the 
sort of UN force where we would lose our sovereignty. While 
that idea was floated it certainly died, fortunately for all of us.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	We need to deal with international criminals. The people who 
commit these atrocious crimes need to know that they are going 
to be punished by the world. They need to know that the UN will 
deal with international criminals and that it will be much faster 
than our criminal justice system.
<P>
	We need to have a whole administrative reorganization and 
we can be leaders there. Also, we need to examine our 
membership and we need to push for a much higher role in the 
United Nations.
<P>
	As well, we should look at the reorganization of the whole 
Department of Foreign Affairs and, most important, our foreign 
missions. We are opening more and more of them but we need to 
examine the job they are doing. We need to set some criteria.
<P>
	Last year I visited nine embassies and I asked them: ``If you 
were on the foreign affairs committee what would you want to 
change?'' Almost to the very last person and almost to the clerks 
they said: ``We want a definite direction; leadership from the 
top; set an example and stop sending mixed messages. One day 
you are this way; the next day you are that way. We do not know 
what we are supposed to represent Canada as being because we 
are getting mixed messages from the top''.
<P>
	I am emphasizing leadership and that is what we should be 
getting out of the reform of Bill C-47. We should be coming up 
with major ideas for that leadership.
<P>
	Again mentioning peacekeeping, criteria must be developed. 
It is so important. How long are the peacekeepers going to be 
there? What is it going to cost? What exactly are we trying to 
accomplish? We have a great many hot spots on the burner right 
now. Places like Burundi, Nigeria and the former Soviet Union, 
just to  name a few, are potential hot spots where we may have to 
get involved. We need some very important planning.
<P>
	The last couple of days we have heard a lot about grassroots 
public input. I get a little upset when I read in the reports that we 
have spent five days debating major foreign affairs issues. The 
problem is that we could have read the results or what was going 
to happen in the newspaper the day we were preparing our 
speeches. The decisions were released early. They came out at 
the United Nations. We had already confirmed we were going 
back to Bosnia but we were debating it.
<P>
	As rookies we can probably take that, but I guess after we 
have been here a while we start saying: ``Yes, we want 
consultation, but do not make up your mind until you hear it''. 
That has to be the message that goes through when we start 
talking about reforming foreign affairs and the way it is handled. 
Listen to us. Do not make decisions beforehand.
<P>
	I understand that in the next week-and we probably will not 
find out until the day before-we are going to be debating 
whether we should send our troops back to the former 
Yugoslavia. It would be nice to think that every member in the 
House could talk about that; could give their point of view on 
whether we should renew our return over there or has the 
government already decided? I hope that it has not.
<P>
	When it comes to public input I go a bit further and look at the 
national assembly that we had, the group which met here. We 
invited 125 people. The only problem was that they were 
academics. They were the elite of the country. They were not the 
grassroots. They were all by invitation and it was pretty 
disappointing.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Why do we not use our 295 MPs to go out in their 
constituencies and talk to their people, give them some 
information and get the people's opinions? Do not just go to the 
elite and get that answer from them.
<P>
	Canadians expect foreign affairs to be a leader, to be an honest 
broker for dispute resolution and effective multilateralism. We 
should be a respected and effective middle power. Canada can 
make a special contribution. Let us make sure that we do make 
that. Let us make sure that when we say we are modernizing the 
whole department we really mean that. Let us live within our 
means. Let us be proactive and effective in showing fiscal 
responsibility. In that role we can add a great deal.
<P>
	In looking to the 21st century a lot of good things are going to 
happen. As we heard this morning in the swearing in ceremony, 
let us talk about some of the good things.
<P>
	We in foreign affairs will have the advantage because Canada 
has such a good reputation. Let us use that. Let us play on that. 
Let us make the very best of that. Let us make Canadians start 
feeling better about themselves as well. We tend to be shy. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9345"> 9345 </A></B>
<P>
tend to be apologetic. We do  not tend to be as strong as we 
should in the area of foreign affairs.
<P>
	I felt the committee report was excellent. We worked well 
together. I felt the information we gathered was of high quality. I 
felt the report process was successful.
<P>
	However, I was disappointed yesterday because I saw things 
like we will some day try to achieve 0.7 of GDP. The reason I 
have problems with that is let us face it, today and for the 
foreseeable future we are probably going to go to 0.3. It is not 
even feasible that we can maintain 0.4 where we are 
approximately today. Why put in 0.7? That sends the wrong 
message to the NGOs. It sends the wrong message to foreign 
governments. It does not show leadership. I feel that is 
incorrect. That is a bad image and that is how we are going to 
tarnish that image of Canadians.
<P>
	I feel as well totally ignoring the CIDA problem is at the peril 
of the government. People are saying cut off aid. We know that is 
wrong. We know that is not just. We know they do not really 
mean that. We have to explain it to them. What are the 
advantages of aid? What is the advantage of CIDA? Let us make 
sure that it is not just a government slush fund for the minister 
and Prime Minister when they travel abroad. I think that is a 
vital part of the selling job that should be done.
<P>
	As far as culture is concerned we would really like to see 
business get involved in that. If it is really as useful as we say it 
is I am sure business will want to be involved.
<P>
	The reform of the international monetary system and looking 
at the IMF is an area that was not touched. We have again a great 
opportunity to show leadership this year in Halifax in June when 
the G-7 meets to talk about the reform. I know that we are going 
to deal with that in the committee. I hope it will be looked at and 
thought about more clearly than our foreign affairs report was.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I have said we are going to support this 
motion. We are supporting this bill because it is a 
modernization. We hope it will also go much further to really get 
into what Canadians are thinking and to really put forward a new 
approach going from this century into the next one. I am sure 
that will make Canada an even greater country than it is today.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-47, a bill to 
change the name of the Department of External Affairs to the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	We have no opposition to this bill at all and therefore no 
position to oppose it whatsoever. It does not change the resource 
allocation within it, nor any significant restructuring. However, 
as we broker no opposition to it, let me talk about some concerns 
I have about the department and let me give some hope and 
constructive suggestions we have to perhaps change its focus  
somewhat, making it an even better organization than it already 
is.
<P>
	I preface what I am about to say by reaffirming what my 
colleague said, that we have only had a few hours to address this 
bill. We hope that in the future the government will give us more 
time to do that.
<P>
	First and foremost, if we are to have a Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade it must be one that lives within 
its means. Currently, as we know, the government is spending 25 
per cent more than what it takes in. The department must, as all 
departments must, make an effective cut to its budget.
<P>
	As I said before, the government is now spending over $40 
billion more than what it takes in. If the department of foreign 
affairs were to make at least a 25 per cent cut, then we would 
have a department that would be able to live within its means.
<P>
	The joint committee had an ideal opportunity to go ahead and 
do this. It could have given the Minister of Finance a hand by 
putting forth some constructive suggestions to do this. 
Unfortunately 20 out of the 60 recommendations that were put 
out asked for more money, if not explicitly then at least 
implicitly.
<P>
	This does not make any sense whatsoever. It does the 
department and the people who worked very hard on the 
committee a grave injustice. I cannot emphasize this enough. I 
hope in the near future the department will take it upon itself to 
put forth the constructive cuts required to make it sustainable in 
the future.
<P>
	I will not put forth criticisms without putting forth some 
constructive suggestions in some areas of budgetary cuts. One 
of the areas that our party has put forth is that bilateral 
government to government aid should be decreased or 
eliminated.
<P>
	Unfortunately, when we go out in the field we see that a lot of 
the aid Canadians and our government give in good faith to help 
those people who need it the most tragically does not get there. I 
have seen foodstuffs given by the Canadian government being 
sold over the counter to various areas or being bargained for 
arms and ammunition. This is not where the Canadian 
government or people want this aid to go.
<P>
	Another thing we have to do and which we did not do in the 
committee, although we listened to a lot of NGOs, is to 
determine which NGOs are doing a good job and which are not. 
Which are giving the money they are given to the people who 
need it the most and which are not? We need to determine 
criteria that can be applied to the NGOs to tell us which NGOs 
are doing a good job and determine ways in which we can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9346"> 9346 </A></B>
<P>
measure this in the future. This has never been done but it is 
something we must do in the future.
<P>
	Another thing we have not done as a country and that no 
country has done is determine which international organizations 
we should and should not be members of. Currently we are a 
member of a vast number of international organizations, in 
many of which there is a lot of duplication.
<P>
	If we are having difficulty in being a member of these 
organizations, so are other countries. No country in the world 
has taken the initiative to try to streamline these down. Canada 
has a unique opportunity to do this. We ought to go ahead and 
determine which organizations are duplicating themselves and 
which are not, making some constructive suggestions to the 
international community to determine where we can co-opt the 
functions of these organizations into one or fewer. It would save 
us money and would therefore save a lot of other people money.
<P>
	Another thing we ought to, which this bill gives, is a method 
to streamline the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade. By changing the name perhaps we can use 
this as a stepping stone to amalgamate various areas within the 
ministry to save the taxpayers a significant amount of money.
<P>
	Another area we need to address is one that I recently had 
some experience in, the Department of International Trade.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of exporters in this country who have 
spoken to me about the fact that they would like to be able to 
capitalize on international markets more effectively. They are 
not able to do this for a number of reasons.
<P>
	One thing the Department of International Trade can do is 
inform Canadian exporters about places where our exporters can 
capitalize, where we have an expertise that other countries do 
not.
<P>
	Currently the biggest problem is getting the information out 
in a timely fashion. As a result other countries can get contracts 
on the international stage that really should belong to 
Canadians. They are jobs that could be brought home, jobs that 
we can do as well or better than other countries.
<P>
	I would ask that people in the department look for ways to tell 
our exporters in a timely fashion about opportunities that exist 
abroad that they can capitalize on for themselves and for 
Canadians.
<P>
	One area that we have not used enough is our embassies. We 
can utilize our embassies internationally to be the eyes and arms 
for our exporters abroad. They are in the trenches and they can 
tell the department what is available to our exporters.
<P>
	I will move on to a slightly different focus. If we stand back 
and look at the large threat that exists today we will see that the 
world is not a safer place in the post cold war era. Last year there 
were at least 120 conflicts in the world. Over 90 per cent of these 
conflicts were internal. Why is this so? There are a number of 
reasons. One  essential reason is the burgeoning world 
population that has been out of control for decades.
<P>
	From 1950 until the present, a short period, we doubled our 
population; a population that took from the beginning of time 
until 1950 to develop. In the next 25 years we will double that 
population again.
<P>
	There are those who say this is not a problem, that we will find 
ways to deal with this. I would submit that right now we have no 
way to deal with it and there has been nothing in the recent past 
to prove otherwise.
<P>
	Out of this expanding population will be an increasing 
conflict for limited resources. Out of that conflict will come a 
migration of people. We have seen recently on television the 
horrible genocide and carnage.
<P>
	In the trenches all of the foreign aid and development that 
countries such as Canada and other principle countries put forth 
will go for nothing. We will wind up back at square one. It makes 
absolutely no sense whatsoever not to address this threat to 
security if we continue to give aid. It has to be addressed before 
our development needs are addressed.
<P>
	Security not only involves the military aspect, which is what 
we have had over the last hundreds of years, but also security 
involving the environment, economic and resource 
management. This is the single most important threat not only to 
foreign security but also to our own. Many people in this country 
would argue who cares what happens half a world away, put a 
fence around them, let them kill each other. This has sometimes 
been said about Bosnia.
<P>
	If we want to argue independent of humanitarian terms, argue 
on what affects us, let us say that what happens half a world 
away will one day wind up on our doorstep. These conflicts 
produce a number of things, a migration of people, a demand on 
our resources through international trade and also on defence. It 
also puts our people in harm's way, our defence personnel who 
have provided exemplary service in the past.
<P>
	There is one way to deal with this in the near future. It is 
something that no country has ever taken the initiative to do, but 
I think Canada can, the aspect of preventive diplomacy. This 
country has a unique opportunity to go around the world and 
develop a consensus to try to address these conflicts before they 
blow up. Once they blow up we get into the very expensive 
aspect of peacekeeping and peacemaking and everything it 
entails. On the other hand preventive diplomacy is cheap by 
comparison.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Why Canada? As our new Governor General mentioned this 
morning in a very eloquent speech which I thought was one of 
the few speeches that brought us together and concentrated on 
our similarities rather than on our differences, we are one of the 
few countries in the world that has managed to bring together a 
truly historic mosaic of people in a peaceful setting.
<P>
	That reputation should not be undersold by anybody in the 
House because it is internationally renowned. We may not 
realize it, but people in countries around the world look to 
Canada as the example of a country that has managed to merge 
different people from different walks of life, different colours, 
different religions and different ethnic groups into a peaceful 
and relatively harmonious mosiac.
<P>
	We can and we must take the initiative to act as the honest 
broker to bring together NGOs, academics, politicians, the 
United Nations and international financial institutions to 
determine a series of reproducible measures that we as the 
international community will enforce when conflicts are about 
to blow up. This is fundamental to international security in the 
future and, as I said before, cost effective.
<P>
	Finally I will concentrate on a few specific issues I have had 
recent experience in and, as I have seen before, cause a great 
deal of tragedy. One is the trafficking of small arms. People may 
not think it is much of a problem, but I was recently in a third 
world country where the destabilizing effect of small arms is 
dramatic. I was in areas where an AK-47 could be bought for as 
little as $20. In these areas resources are depleted, populations 
are growing and small arms are proliferating. The result is a pot 
ready to boil over and an area that is very unstable.
<P>
	We must act as a world leader to develop an international 
consensus on how we are to go about severely restricting the 
production, sale and movement of small arms. Canada should 
act as a leader in banning two things: first, mines and, second, 
anti-personnel devices. These weapons have absolutely no 
place in warfare. They are meant merely to destabilize a civilian 
population and are meant to kill civilians. I have seen it with my 
own eyes.
<P>
	Unfortunately, when a so-called war is over, because of the 
proliferation of the aforementioned a country is unable to get on 
its feet for decades. The cost to the international community is 
in the billions of dollars. It is one of those things we can pay now 
or pay later. I would submit it is a lot better to get involved in 
this early than late.
<P>
	I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department 
of International Trade will take these suggestions into 
consideration in their future endeavours. I know people on this 
side of the House are prepared to work toward furthering those 
suggestions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask a question of the hon. member who just spoke. Because of 
his experience in being abroad and seeing some of the firsthand 
work our money is doing around the world, I wonder whether he 
has any insights to share with respect to how we can produce 
some long term results in some of the countries in which we are 
putting money.
<P>
	What could we do that would finally make these people 
independent and contributing members to the world society 
instead of drawing from it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. If I had that answer it 
would certainly be wonderful.
<P>
	There are a few things, I would submit in my humble 
experience, we could do. One would be to address the 
international security aspects. We cannot get a country back on 
its feet until the security aspects are dealt with. As I said before, 
that involves freeing the country of mines and putting in place a 
strong judicial system, as well as the necessary foundations of 
democracy to have a populace with confidence in its 
government. We are a democratic country, one that is well 
respected for our democratic institutions. We can and have done 
a lot to help these democratic institutions.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Another fundamental aspect is how we channel our aid. I think 
we will find a lot of agreement in the international community 
that international aid must go through NGOs as opposed to 
through governments. Much aid in the past has gone directly 
into the hands of foreign governments and in turn has become 
parts of personal bank accounts in Switzerland and other 
countries, or has been used to build people's personal empires 
through the purchase of arms and bribery. That is completely 
wrong and is not where our international moneys were meant to 
go.
<P>
	As I said before in my speech, we need to look at the NGOs to 
determine which ones are doing a good job and which are not. 
We have to determine a set of criteria. We have to determine an 
end point that we want to address through committee reports. 
That is something the government agrees on. We wish to help the 
poorest of the poor. We can do that but we have to determine 
which NGOs are doing a good job and which are not. Once we do 
so, we can determine where we are proportioning our money.
<P>
	It is an interesting and an exciting project, one that I hope the 
government through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the 
Department of International Trade will take up. If we can do 
that, we can effectively channel the aid money Canadians give to 
other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9348"> 9348 </A></B>
<P>
	I will finish by saying that many people in my riding and 
other ridings ask: ``Why are you giving money to people half 
a world away?'' If we want to argue purely on selfish grounds, 
the economic impact in a positive way to our exporters is very 
great because we are generous on the international stage. We 
take part in international organizations in an effective fashion 
and we bring forth to the international community some sense 
of peace, stability and sensibility.
<P>
	If we continue to do so we will have on the international stage 
a clout far greater than what our population would normally give 
us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment and then a fairly quick question.
<P>
	One point is on the saleability of foreign assistance and why it 
is necessary. The member struck on a very important point. It is 
becoming increasingly difficult to convince people that we 
should be spending increasing amounts of money on foreign 
assistance. Yet, for some of the reasons the member mentioned, 
it is still important.
<P>
	Could the member comment in general terms on the 
advisability of increasing spending on primary education in the 
third world as part of our aid package as opposed to university 
education?
<P>
	One report I read mentioned that basic education in the third 
world decreases the number of children in a family from an 
average of four and a half or five to three or three and a half. The 
reason is that a basic education allows a person to get a job, to 
understand basic birth control methods, to expand their horizons 
in business and so on.
<P>
	As opposed to a very costly university education that we 
support around the world, does the member think we should 
emphasize or spend more of our money on the basic education 
aspect?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague hit on a very important point. We do get more 
bang for our buck by investing in primary education versus 
expensive post-secondary education.
<P>
	We cannot have a stable country without a stable populous. 
We cannot have a stable populous unless the populous has a 
vested economic and social interest in the country in which it 
lives.
<P>
	One primary way of doing it is to enable the people to have the 
rudiments of an education: give them some literacy and give 
them the ability to take care of themselves. If we give them the 
knowledge to take care of themselves we have helped to create a 
sustainable situation.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It is also more difficult for individuals to sway a population 
for their own illicit gain if the population is educated. It is easier 
to reason with a population that has the rudiments of education 
than one that is living in a  primitive state of affairs. That has 
borne itself out time and time again.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague just mentioned, one of the great benefits 
of providing primary education is that we see a population 
reduction. We see a reduction in the number of babies born. It 
gives women control of reproduction, which is fundamental in 
enabling them and their families to get control of their economic 
and social lives.

	The House resumed from February 7 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-65, an act to reorganize and dissolve certain 
federal agencies, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-65 which makes an attempt at 
reorganizing and dissolving certain federal agencies. The one I 
will be talking about is ACOA.
<P>
	The attempt in the bill is to reduce the number of board 
members from 18 to 7. I want to talk about whether or not that is 
truly effective. Another thing I want to talk about with respect to 
the bill is patronage, about which we had a long discussion 
yesterday.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Burin-St. George's said yesterday 
that there will always be patronage. Whilst the Liberals main-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9349"> 9349 </A></B>
<P>
tain that there will always be patronage, perhaps there will be 
people whom we know to be competent who should go into 
certain jobs. I call into question whether or not patronage is 
appropriate in some positions. I have for a long time been rather 
outspoken  about patronage appointments to the Senate. The 
Reform Party has been rather clear about a triple E Senate, 
which is elected, effective and equal.
<P>
	We have seen time after time Liberals and Conservatives 
putting their friends in the Senate where they are paid until age 
75 and live rather well on the backs of the taxpayers. It is time to 
give up on those kinds of patronage positions which give your 
friends truly a more advantageous position in life than those 
who are equal and even perhaps more qualified for the positions.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Look at the recent Senate appointments which fly in the face 
of the vast majority of Canadians. There were five Senate 
appointments made by this Prime Minister to the Senate. One of 
them indeed was a sitting member of Parliament. I question the 
anti-democratic move of doing that. This individual was elected 
in his own riding and now the Prime Minister just fetches him 
out of it and says: ``I am going to run one of my buddies in here 
and see if we can get him in as well''.
<P>
	That flies so much in the face of what people believe. I cannot 
believe this government is reproducing what the Conservatives 
did. And the Liberals yelled and screamed about that when the 
Conservatives were the government. Even the Governor 
General's appointment is basically patronage today. That speaks 
for itself.
<P>
	I have had a great deal of experience with refugee boards 
which are again political appointees. They make a pretty good 
salary and make what really amounts to life and death decisions. 
Some of the decisions have been far from credible. Some of the 
individuals on those boards are far from credible and do not 
meet the qualifications, skills or abilities in some cases.
<P>
	Yet we still have patronage. Members from the opposite side 
say patronage will always be. I have to question the logic of that. 
Many people are questioning the logic of it and what we get is 
more patronage.
<P>
	I have to question the patronage in parole boards. I have to 
question the patronage of immigration adjudicators, the 
patronage in harbours, boards, commissions across this country. 
Why can we not publicly advertise for these positions and take 
people based on their qualifications, skills and abilities?
<P>
	There is a recent patronage appointment that we complained 
about two days ago. We would have complained about it again 
today but we could not get it on in question period because we 
only had five questions and it was number six.
<P>
	Let us look at the individual who was most recently appointed 
to the CRTC. The Prime Minister stood up in the House 
yesterday and talked about that very position. He talked about 
the need to look at people for skills and abilities and so on.
<P>
	When we checked on that appointee we found there were 
problems. In fact the Prime Minister said himself that if we 
found certain problems with this perhaps the government would 
not make that appointment but it has made the appointment. We 
find problems with it. If we really dig deep in a lot of these 
positions it sways, it gets away from skills and abilities and 
qualifications. That is wrong for government.
<P>
	We have to look at the damage that creates in the parole board, 
in refugee boards, and so on. We have to look at the victims and 
the common ordinary citizens who by the way never get this 
opportunity unless they have been a member of a Liberal 
campaign committee and so on and so forth. What opportunity 
does the average law-abiding Canadian citizen get for these 
kinds of jobs? It does not happen.
<P>
	Let us look at the cost of these positions: $85,000 and $90,000 
for some of them. Why not advertise for these positions? Why 
not do what any other corporation does? Crown corporations do 
it.
<P>
	I really want to talk about ACOA. It is my favourite thing to 
look at in this country. I was glad to hear the minister today 
announce that he is doing away with grants altogether. I would 
not give the minister much credit for that. The announcement 
was made subsequent to when we disclosed all of the bad grants 
in ACOA. While it is nice that the minister did that we will take 
credit for it in the House of Commons and throughout this 
country.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Now to reduce the ACOA board in members only is actually 
laughable. Just think about this. The minister says that what is 
going to happen is that ACOA will no longer give grants. It will 
basically be giving loans. They will not be forgivable loans but 
repayable loans as far as I understand it from yesterday's 
discussion. It is venture capital basically.
<P>
	FBDB does the same thing. Why is it we are just reducing the 
number of boards? Why can we not just collapse this 
organization, get rid of its administration and allow FBDB to do 
the job?
<P>
	I asked that question yesterday of the member from Halifax. 
On December 8 I asked a question in the House about FBDB 
versus ACOA. I did not get a satisfactory answer from the 
minister so I asked the same question last night in what we call 
the late show. I put the question clearly and distinctly.
<P>
	What I received from the member for Halifax who answered 
the question was a two minute speech, your basic Liberal 
rhetoric on issues about ACOA, but it did not answer the 
question. Therefore, I am going to come  back to that and I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9350"> 9350 </A></B>
<P>
going to ask it again and again and again. Hopefully the member 
for Halifax will not be answering because I do not think she 
knows much about it.
<P>
	The question has to be: Why are we reducing the number of 
board members in ACOA? Why are we not eliminating ACOA? 
What we are doing here in C-65 is surface scratch. One does not 
have to go very far with this Liberal government to look at 
surface scratch. One only has to look a little at the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	The majority of people in this country are concerned about the 
Young Offenders Act. They talked, we talked and many people 
talked about lowering the age, about advising citizens out there 
of sexual offenders and so on. The Minister of Justice came up 
with a ridiculously weak, limp act for young offenders.
<P>
	Gun control was the same thing. In trying to address crime the 
government went to gun control. The budget was the same thing. 
The Liberals did nothing on the budget last year and they are still 
spending money like Mad Hatters over there. We demonstrated 
that today in some of the ridiculous research grants.
<P>
	Bill C-44 did all but nothing in immigration because in the 
final analysis they will not be removing the bad guys anyway. 
That is what I call surface scratch.
<P>
	When somebody brings in a bill like Bill C-65 which states 
that the number of board members is going to be reduced from 
18 to 7, I ask what is wrong with these folks across the way? 
Why can they not go out and do the job fully? Why are we 
surface scratching?
<P>
	We have to look at a new vision here. There are a lot of 
documents now that mention a new vision. In his book the leader 
of the Reform Party talks about a new vision. Lots of documents 
refer to a new vision in Canada.
<P>
	What we have here is a traditional party entrenched in an old 
vision. So old is that vision that when they tried to come up with 
something new in HRD with the social programs, it collapsed. 
They stand in here today and have the gall to try to tell people 
that is what they want. We heard it all across the country. They 
said that is what they want, no change, which is exactly what 
they received with this government because this government 
lacks vision. It is vision that we need.
<P>
	Bill C-65 is not a new vision, it is traditional. They are talking 
about saving money but it is surface scratch. There is hardly any 
money in this.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	If you want to get rid of an organization, get rid of ACOA and 
save some money. The administrative travel expenses within 
ACOA are a national disgrace. It is all over the country. 
Everybody knows about it. There is nothing touched in it. They 
just reduced the number of directors.
<P>
	Let us not talk about surface scratch here. Let us talk about 
new vision. We had an admittance yesterday that the Liberals 
have practised ``corrupt patronage''. That is a quote in <I>Hansard</I> 
and came from a Liberal member by the way. I believe it was the 
member for Burin-St. George's.
<P>
	I would agree with that. You only have to look at some of the 
patronage appointments. I will refer to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. I 
think everybody across the country has read this by now and are 
shaking their heads about patronage appointments.
<P>
	Look at this: A tax court judge was an MP. Here is an 
individual, former provincial candidate in Mississauga, 
southern Ontario. Here is a fellow, a candidate in Quebec in 
1993, one from Calgary Northeast and a three time candidate in 
Edmonton. On and on and on it goes. It cannot be a coincidence 
that all of these past candidates in 1993 have the skills, abilities 
and qualifications for the job. That cannot be the case. This is 
clearly padding your friends and it is totally wrong.
<P>
	In 1992-93 ACOA wrote off in excess of $53 million. I would 
like to ask members opposite what the difference is between a 
repayable loan that is written off so that the borrower does not 
have to pay, and a grant.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is no difference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> There is no difference 
between a grant and a loan that is never repaid. If ACOA is now 
into repayable grants many of which are written off, then 
collapse ACOA. Fold it. Do not just get rid of the directors, get 
rid of ACOA. Save the taxpayer a whole bundle of money. Save 
them $50 million in write-offs for certain and then let FBDB 
take its place, or the banks. Has anybody ever thought of dealing 
with the banks?
<P>
	Yesterday another speaker opposite said that we already have 
a very efficient government. I have to ask, if the Liberals think 
they have an efficient government then they are really out to 
lunch. That is what the change is all about. That is why the last 
party from Jurassic Park sits with two members here. That is 
exactly the mentality that is going to have this second party join 
Jurassic Park in the next election. The assumption that it already 
is an efficient government is totally erroneous.
<P>
	I cannot say much more about this because I could run down 
all of these other reductions in boards and institutions but they 
are basically all the same. This is surface scratch. The 
government does not really intend to save a lot of money here. It 
is just taking out a few things to make it look good. It has done it 
time and time and time again in the last year.
<P>
	The question is: Who does the government really think it is 
kidding over there? There are people actually watching and they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9351"> 9351 </A></B>
<P>
are a lot smarter today than they were before. Bill C-65 is 
surface scratch. It is Liberal do nothing legislation, much like 
Bill C-44 was.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if in questioning the hon. member whether he 
would consider the appointment of the National Parole Board, 
for instance. The new chair of the National Parole Board is a 
career civil servant with no political connections. He came 
through the ranks, was appointed on the basis of his 
qualifications after being interviewed. I wonder if he would 
recognize that as something the government has started, and is 
that what he considers to be a patronage appointment?
<P>
	Does he want us or the government to leave the Senate 
completely dominated by the Tories, holding back the Pearson 
airport deal as an example? Is that what he expects to do?
<P>
	Also, does he not recognize that in some of the appointments 
the Prime Minister is making, such as Ed Broadbent and so 
forth, that there are no pensions, no double dipping, that with 
any new appointments by the Prime Minister people like Ed 
Broadbent are being asked? Does he not realize that Roméo 
LeBlanc, a man for all seasons, a fair, honest Acadian, a person 
who fits the Prime Minister's style was a good appointment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, when making 
so many patronage appointments, the obvious thing has 
happened with governments over the past decades. They make 
some that are good, naturally; they even make some from other 
parties, I suppose. That covers them for making the majority, or 
many of them, their friends.
<P>
	Look at this list. A member of Parliament's campaign 
manager in Vancouver Centre was executive assistant to the 
ministers of justice and energy, mines and resources in the 
eighties; assistant to a former Nova Scotia Liberal leader; 
assistant to various Ontario MPPs. These are Liberal Party 
hacks.
<P>
	Of course some will be made based on qualifications, skills 
and abilities so exactly what has happened here can be done. A 
member stands up and says: ``Look at this one; let me identify 
this one; what do you think of it?'' That particular individual 
may be good based on qualifications, skills and abilities. I do not 
know the particular individual and his qualifications, skills and 
abilities, but I do know there are many people on parole boards 
who do not have the qualifications, skills and abilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I think I just have. He 
asked me if this particular person on the parole board had the 
skills and abilities. I do not know that particular person. My 
answer is there are a lot who do not. I can tell the hon. member 
that.
<P>
	The next question I believe the member asked was on the 
Senate. He asked whether-it is a wise thing I suppose-there 
should be more Conservatives than Liberals in the Senate. I 
think he has missed the point. We are talking about the ability to 
have an elected Senate so that perhaps the senators could be 
neither Liberal nor Conservative; what a novel idea, not a party 
hack.
<P>
	That is the problem. It is like firing your brother or your sister. 
They get them into the Senate. These governments are not going 
to change. As soon as the Liberals got in the whole country new 
darn well they would start putting Liberals into that Senate. The 
only way to stop that is to get a party into this government with 
no friends in the Senate, none at all, so we will not be marrying 
off: ``We need some to offset the Conservatives and the Liberals 
in this Senate''. Talk about traditional thinking, that is 
traditional thinking. What is wrong with a triple E Senate?
<P>
	I am sorry, I am not sure what the third question was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Roméo LeBlanc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Roméo LeBlanc, the 
Governor General. That position is considered by most as the 
highest plum on the plum tree. Whether or not his skills and 
abilities fit the job, I am not really sure what his skills and 
abilities are.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I will say right now I am not in favour of having a Governor 
General position in this country, nor am I in favour of Lieutenant 
Governor positions in this country. That is why I was not at the 
session today nor the party tonight. Whether or not the 
individual has the qualifications it is just tradition.
<P>
	I was asked today why I was not there. I said that I really did 
not intend to think like these traditional good old boys here. 
Maybe we should be questioning whether there should be a 
governor general or a lieutenant governor. The individual I was 
talking to said that is tradition. I told him that is what is wrong 
here. What is wrong with questioning this good old tradition? 
What is wrong with questioning the fact that this government 
wants 50 per cent or more of the Senate to be Liberals?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is wrong with that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Frazer Valley West):</B> There is a lot wrong with it. 
You would have to go a long way in this country today to find 
many people who would want Liberal Party hacks or friends of 
the government or anybody else appointed to the Senate. That is 
what is wrong with that. Elect them. Give the average, ordinary 
Canadian citizen on the street an opportunity to be a senator.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
offer the minister a hearty nice try on his Bill C-65. The bill is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9352"> 9352 </A></B>
<P>
an act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies. This 
is good. It would be a lot better if it were just a bill to dissolve 
certain federal agencies.
<P>
	I represent a riding with a major sea coast and my constituents 
will sleep better knowing that the Canadian Salt Fish 
Corporation has been dissolved. I also cannot express anything 
but pleasure at the knowledge that the National Film Board has 
been reduced from eight to six members. I hope it will not find 
itself unable to make appalling decisions due to its short 
staffing.
<P>
	I want to say with a straight face that I am confident that the 
President of the Treasury Board experienced real difficulties in 
getting the civil service to agree to these cuts. I mean no sarcasm 
by saying this.
<P>
	In Mr. Martin Anderson's book <I>Revolution: The Reagan 
Legacy</I> he describes his own bureaucratic battles to get rid of the 
board of tea tasters within the U.S. executive branch. He failed. I 
think the minister deserves credit for what he has done. Let us 
have a hearty nice try for him and then let us get serious.
<P>
	How big is our spending problem? How big are our debt and 
deficit problems in Canada? The Liberal government appears 
recently to have noticed that its own lust for big government 
coupled with Progressive Conservative incompetence has 
saddled this nation with an on-book debt of over $500 billion 
and an unfunded liability in the Canada pension plan of about a 
like amount, and we continue to have annual deficits in the range 
of $35 billion to $40 billion.
<P>
	For years the established political parties laughed the debt 
off: ``We are creating assets. We owe it to ourselves. What is a 
billion? We have a culture to create''. Whoops. I will tell you 
what a billion is. It is a one followed by nine zeros. It is so much 
money that if you spent $1,000 a day since the birth of Christ 
you still would not have spent a billion dollars today. As a matter 
of fact you could go on for approximately another thousand 
years. If you spent $20 a day since the dinosaurs vanished, you 
still would not have spent $500 billion. What I am getting at is 
that it is a lot of money even by the standards of this 
government.
<P>
	How much has the minister saved us? How long has it taken 
him to save us that money? It was Albert Einstein who once said 
it is impossible to solve a problem by thinking on the same level 
that caused it. He was right. If we are going to try to eliminate 
our deficit and get our budget under control we are going to have 
to do some bold new thinking.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the member for Winnipeg 
South rose at the time when the member for the Reform Party 
rose. I would ask that you consider allowing the member for 
Winnipeg South to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary is 
absolutely right. The Chair made an error. A name had been 
taken off the list and the next name on the list was the member 
for Skeena.
<P>
	If the member wishes to interrupt the speech to go back on line 
to get it correct, the Chair is obviously happy to do that. I am in 
the hands of members.
<P>
	Does the member for Skeena wish to stand down to get the 
order right? Or does the member for Winnipeg South wish to let 
the member continue and the public will understand that the 
mistake was made by the Chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would only be 
appropriate since I am approximately halfway through my 
remarks that I be allowed to continue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will call on the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South to make a point of order if he wishes to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is fine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we are going to try to get 
our deficit and our budget under control we are going to have to 
engage in some bold new thinking. We cannot go on the same old 
way. We cannot go on making the same old assumptions. It 
really is true that as Tony Robbins expressed, insanity is doing 
the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.
<P>
	The Progressive Conservatives certainly proved it with their 
refusal to tackle program spending. What they did was 
considered insane either politically or in terms of the national 
interest.
<P>
	Apparently the Liberals were too busy scoring partisan points 
to notice what had happened, let alone why. Look at the 
minister's social policy review. Having helped create our 
impossibly expensive social programs, having made many 
extravagant promises that drive our welfare state, the minister 
set out to produce sweeping reforms without changing his 
approach. He failed.
<P>
	While we all feel a little pain at his embarrassment, even 
humiliation, in failing so spectacularly and so publicly in the 
most important assignment of his long and sterile career in 
politics, those of us on this side also feel a certain annoyance 
that the minister, given such responsibilities, was unable to rid 
himself of old and discredited ideas about the proper role of 
government.
<P>
	The idea the minister did not have and the idea that the 
Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs did not have are one and 
the same. They did not ask whether the programs we are 
spending too much money on are working. They just assumed 
everything was fine, but we were not quite efficient enough.
<P>
	The programs are not working. What we need is bold and 
original thought. We need clearly expressed yardsticks for 
measuring their success. If they are not working we need to shut 
them down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9353"> 9353 </A></B>
<P>
	Actually, as I stand here and say that it does not sound all 
that clever or difficult. I wonder why the minister did not think 
of it, or the Prime Minister, or the President of the Treasury 
Board. If they had they would have noticed something, not 
something small and subtle, not a little tiny point of light in 
the distance. They would have noticed a huge, roaring fire, 
consuming money in amounts that are literally astronomical, 
and for nothing that we can see that we want.
<P>
	I refer to our social programs. They consume two thirds of non 
interest spending by the federal government. They consume 
more than $80 billion a year. In a country that is unimaginably 
rich by historical standards, these immense social program 
expenditures are taking place side by side with the apparent 
disintegration of our society. We spend billions on poverty relief 
but apparently poverty keeps getting worse. We spend billions 
on health care and our spending grows geometrically. Yet 
waiting lists lengthen, equipment deteriorates and our 
politicians go for treatment in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We are paying 5 per cent of payroll into the Canada pension 
plan yet it is an unfunded liability and has reached half a trillion 
dollars to date. Half a trillion is a five followed by eleven zeros.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the President of the Treasury Board, to save us all 
from bankruptcy, has decreased the board of directors of the 
CBC from 15 to 12. Were they spending over $12 billion each? 
Perhaps the government will tell us every little bit helps. I am 
here to say that it does not, not enough. I am here to say that 
Ralph Klein was right when he said: ``You have to go hunting 
where the ducks are''. The ducks are in the social programs, not 
in the board of the Canadian Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act, and that is where we have to go hunting.
<P>
	When the minister spends as many months and as much 
political capital as he has to eliminate the post of secretary of the 
Canadian Film Development Corporation, it is that many 
months and that much political capital he cannot spend on 
changes that would really matter.
<P>
	I do not know whether hon. members opposite ever watch <I>Yes, 
Minister</I> or whether they are too busy living it. However, they 
should watch it because it is not just funny, it is very accurate. In 
one episode when the minister is criticising his permanent 
secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, for the amount of 
bureaucracy that exists, Sir Humphrey tells him quite rightly 
that it has nothing to do with him, it has nothing to do with the 
bureaucrats. ``The reason there is so much bureaucracy'', he 
insists, ``is that the Parliament keeps creating programs and they 
all need to be administered''.
<P>
	The total cost of administration for the federal government is 
$20 billion. The deficit is close to $40 billion. We would have to 
shut it all down twice to balance the budget. This bill does not 
come close.
<P>
	I realize that to make a real dent in the deficit, the government 
would need two qualities it does not possess in any great 
quantity: courage and imagination. Even the Republicans in the 
United States have found that what the public wants to hear is 
that they are cutting bureaucrats, not programs. To say that is to 
take the easy way out. It is not the bureaucrats who are causing 
the deficit, it is the programs. Before one can say that, one has to 
be able to think it and that is where the active imagination comes 
in.
<P>
	Many members opposite have been in politics a long time. 
They do not realize that the ideas that were once bold and new 
have gone stale and timid in the decades since. They do not 
understand that ``government knows best'' has been tried and it 
has failed miserably.
<P>
	However, I put it to them directly that when one is looking at a 
roaring fire that is consuming some $40 billion a year and one 
responds by changing the definition of a peace officer under the 
laws governing the International North Pacific Fisheries 
Commission, one is totally missing the point. One had better 
take a step back and take a good hard look at the overall structure 
of government and then one had better be willing to tell people 
openly and honestly what was found. The government has to tell 
the people that Ralph was right. It has to tell them that we have 
to go hunting where the ducks are and that they are in big social 
programs, not in the board of trustees of museums. Then it has to 
cut them.
<P>
	Let us have a rousing ``nice try'' for the minister but let us be 
clear that he failed. Maybe it is time that he stepped aside. 
Maybe it is time that the human resources minister and the 
Prime Minister stepped aside and let a party that truly knows and 
truly has the vision to resolve these problems take control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
heard some talk today from both of the speakers of the Reform 
Party on this bill about bold new thinking, new vision, a new 
way of doing business and yet all I hear is very old political 
rhetoric. I would like to ask the member in all seriousness what 
he feels is served by coming into the House and talking about the 
long and sterile career of a member of the House or denigrating 
the person. It is one thing to come forward and raise a legitimate 
concern about an individual who may be misperforming his or 
her task or about a policy decision of the government. But it is 
another to come forward as members of his party have done 
today and, as some might call it, slander other Canadians, 
without a scintilla of evidence, without any proof, in fact 
standing up and admitting that they had not bothered to check 
the qualifications, but of course they were unqualified.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9354"> 9354 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The question I would like to ask is in the business of good 
government, how is a bold new vision served by that kind of 
tactic?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to 
the hon. member's comments by stating that the minister has 
been in the House for a long time, not always on the government 
benches. He is part of a government that began its 
administration in the late sixties with a vision of ``we can help 
Canadians because we are all knowing and all powerful and able 
to solve all Canadians' problems for them. All we need is their 
money and their co-operation. If we do not get their 
co-operation we will force it down their throats''.
<P>
	This vision was expressed by the Liberal Party and has been 
around for some two and a half decades now. It has failed 
miserably. The consequences of that failure is what we are 
dealing with today. Yes, the Conservatives had a hand in it too. 
The Conservatives are culpable because they had an opportunity 
to do something about it in 1984. They looked it in the eye and 
walked away from it.
<P>
	It is a creation of the Liberal Party. It is a creation of ministers 
such as the one I was referring to. It serves the Canadian people 
to understand not only how we are going to deal with our 
problems but how we got here in the first place and the bad ideas 
that brought us to the brink of debt and ruin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the sad part of Bill C-65 is that the government is acting pretty 
well like the Conservative Party acted in encouraging 
patronage. The government is not implementing a law that is 
reducing patronage at all. It is a public relations exercise, as our 
colleague in the Reform Party mentioned earlier, scratching the 
surface.
<P>
	I wonder whether or not it is confusing a lion's roar with a 
burp. Yesterday when the government introduced Bill C-65 it 
mentioned it as being a great improvement in government, a 
great advancement, aggressive government, progressive 
government. It is as though we are dealing with Conservatives 
who are giving us the impression that they are really changing 
something when in fact they are not. We are living with the same 
system of patronage, give or take a few things. Certainly it is the 
case of the mouse that roared or mice that are trying to roar but 
they are certainly not giving us much to deal with anyway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find myself in rare 
agreement with my colleague from the Bloc. I appreciate his 
remarks.
<P>
	I think what he is getting at is essentially what I was trying to 
say in my intervention. The government is trying to display to 
Canadians that it is doing something but when you get beneath 
the surface, it is not. It is really sad when Canadians not only are 
expecting but are hoping against hope that the government 
really is going to do something.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	They understand it is crunch time. They understand that it is 
time to pay the piper. They are saying: ``Let us get on with it. Let 
us face up to our problems in this nation and let us overcome 
them''. The government is telegraphing false hope.
<P>
	I think that is what the member is alluding to. We do not see 
real systemic change. What we see is window dressing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard 
comments about surface scratching and burping and other 
qualities.
<P>
	Yesterday when we talked about the actual numbers I recall 
the government had eliminated 589 positions. It has appointed 
only 700. That strikes me as far more than scratching the 
surface.
<P>
	Moreover in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> article that was frequently 
cited today and yesterday, 80 people were identified with ties to 
the Liberal Party out of 700 appointments. One would find in the 
public opinion polls that there are probably more Liberals than 
that.
<P>
	The Reform Party has difficulty with the kind of argument it is 
making. What I have heard from members of the Reform Party 
in the past is that the problem is Ottawa, the problem is 
government, the problem is the civil servants.
<P>
	These boards are made up of Canadians from across the 
country. Many of them are regionally appointed. Many agencies 
are regional. Certainly some of them are appointments of people 
who reflect the views of the government. That is natural because 
you do have to change things. The majority on the boards are not 
now Liberal because they were appointed by the previous 
government.
<P>
	If you in the Reform Party are out to change-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary and 
all members will please put their remarks to the Chair for the 
reasons that have been explained many times in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the Reform Party 
surely will recognize that there is an advantage for their party to 
have people appointed from outside the House of Commons, 
from outside Ottawa to supervise activities carried on by 
Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to 
the comments of the hon. member by saying that he is trying to 
insinuate that there are really not many political patronage 
appointments being made.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9355"> 9355 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet we sit in the House week after week asking the Prime 
Minister why he continues to make political appointments. He 
keeps shrugging his shoulders and saying that there are only 
Liberals in Canada, there is nowhere else to go.
<P>
	I cannot believe the arrogance of that response. It will come 
back to haunt this party and the Prime Minister. It is indicative 
of the fact-everyone who sits in the House knows it-that 
virtually all of the important political appointments that have 
been made since the government was elected are patronage 
appointments. They are going to friends of the government. 
They are going to Liberal hacks and insiders. Canadians are 
starting to get the message. The media is reporting it. It is going 
to come back to haunt the government much as it came back to 
haunt Mr. Mulroney and his Progressive Conservatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I listen to my friends from the Reform 
Party and the way they talk today, I fully understand why they 
will probably form the next government. They know how to 
target the real problems.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague a question. He was 
talking about having an active imagination and looking at the 
overall structure of the government. I would like to ask him if he 
would agree to start with plucking the other place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has long been the 
position of this party and of myself personally that the Senate 
can be an important place if we adopt the principles of triple E. 
As long as it is a haven for patronage political appointments it 
will never be regarded with any credibility by Canadians 
anywhere.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.35 p.m. the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FRESHWATER">FRESH WATER</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support a policy 
that Canada's fresh water, ice and snow will be protected so that at all times and 
in all circumstances Canada's sovereignty over water is preserved and 
protected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
present and speak on this motion. The motion I am presenting to 
the House today deals with the need for the government to 
support a policy that protects and preserves Canada's 
sovereignty or control over its own water.
<P>
	Let me begin by emphasizing why we should pursue a policy 
which protects and preserves Canada's sovereignty over water. 
On the surface it appears that we already have control over our 
water. However this is not the case.
<P>
	The present terms of NAFTA-and I will go into them in more 
detail later-directly affect Canada's sovereignty over her 
water. We have sovereignty only until a sale has begun or a river 
has been diverted. At that point the supply of water under 
NAFTA cannot be stopped and we lose control of this very 
precious resource. At this point in time Canada's control over 
water is hanging on a thread and we need to take action to rectify 
the situation.
<P>
	I will go into detail later to explain exactly how the terms of 
NAFTA affect our sovereignty over water and how this situation 
can be fixed. However, first I wish to emphasize to the House 
why we must protect our water because it appears that the 
significance of this resource has been underestimated by many 
Canadians and this perception is likely due to the fact that water 
is so abundant in Canada.
<P>
	Canada has more water per capita than the vast majority of 
nations in the world but clearly its value should not be 
underestimated. Water is our most valuable resource and our 
sovereignty or control over this resource must be protected at all 
times.
<P>
	In the view of many experts water will be the most important 
resource of the 21st century. Clearly Canadian control over this 
political, economic and environmental commodity is 
paramount. Many experts have suggested that what oil has been 
in the past century water will be for the next.
<P>
	Canadians have such an abundance of water that it is often 
taken for granted. We often forget to look at the future and 
conserve our supplies or to look at the larger picture, which may 
only be as far as our neighbours to the south, to see where water 
has become the commodity of the future.
<P>
	Its value has been underestimated and overlooked in 
international agreements and the consequences will be serious. 
Water is a precious resource. It could also be a valuable 
bargaining tool, a card that we should not be too quick to play.
<P>
	Most of Canada's fresh water supply is concentrated in the 
Great Lakes, which accounts for 20 per cent of the world's fresh 
water supply and represents 95 per cent of North America's 
surface water. The Great Lakes are the most important natural 
resource shared by Canada and the United States. The Great 
Lakes provide a reliable source of fresh water for one-fifth of 
the U.S. and one-half of Canada, supplying 26 million people 
with drinking water.
<P>
	The 1985 international joint commission concluded that 
consumptive use of water in the Great Lakes basin is likely to 
double by the year 2000. Current estimates suggest that the total 
global consumption is likely to rise tenfold during the 20th 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9356"> 9356 </A></B>
<P>
century and that water scarcity  will be of increasing concern, 
particularly for most arid and semi-arid countries to the south.
<P>
	Of increasing importance to Canadians is that right next door 
Americans are facing significant water shortages as their 
resources are dwindling. The only natural source of water from 
Colorado to California is the Colorado River and its tributaries 
which provide water to seven states. It has been drastically 
reduced as a result of overuse and mismanagement.
<P>
	The most important source of underground water in the U.S. is 
the Ogallala aquifer. Six states from Nebraska to Texas are 
completely reliant on this aquifer, yet it is currently being 
drained at a rate 50 times faster than it is naturally refilling. To 
paint an even bleaker picture, we must consider the fact that 
U.S. land west of the Rockies to the Pacific coast is arid and 
agriculture in these areas depends almost exclusively on 
irrigation. A significant portion of North America's fresh 
produce is grown in this region.
<P>
	Clearly the American water crisis is serious and under 
increasing domestic pressure. With our abundance of water we 
are the closest and most logical source of water for our 
American neighbours. The Americans do and have looked to us 
for water.
<P>
	There have been at least 13 proposals for large scale 
diversions of water to the U.S. from the Great Lakes. In B.C. 
there are 19 Canadian companies that hold surface water 
licences to bottle four million litres of water every day for the 
American market. More than 30 companies have planned to 
export fresh Canadian coastal water by supertanker.
<P>
	One B.C. company was on the verge of negotiating a deal to 
ship 12.4 billion litres of water to Santa Barbara, California, in 
1990 at an estimated price of $34 million U.S. However the deal 
was never finalized because of local contentious issues.
<P>
	Last month Alberta announced its proposed water 
conservation and management act which would make Alberta 
the first province in Canada where water rights could be bought 
and sold. This has been viewed by many as opening the door for 
eventual exports of water to the U.S.
<P>
	This motion is not about whether we should or should not 
export water to the United States. However it is about our ability 
to make decisions without losing sovereignty or control over our 
water, ice and snow.
<P>
	There are many arguments for or against water exports on 
political, economic and environmental grounds. This motion is 
about Canada's ability to maintain the right to choose how or if 
we wish to market our water and Canada's right to maintain its 
sovereignty over water in any given circumstance.
<P>
	We must retain our ability to choose what we want to do with 
our water, whether we want to sell it and, if so, we must retain 
the ability to choose whether we wish to continue such 
activities, particularly in times of shortage of our own domestic 
water supply.
<P>
	Economically it may make sense to market water to the 
Americans or elsewhere some time down the road. However, 
before these exports take place there must be an agreement with 
the Americans that allows Canadians to proceed with water 
exports without the threat of loss of control over that resource.
<P>
	As it now stands Canada is vulnerable in the event of any 
water exports or diversions. Despite our abundance of water it 
would not be to our advantage to begin or enter into any major 
water exports because our ability to control the use and planning 
of that resource is undermined by the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of confusion regarding NAFTA 
and water, particularly during the last election when the 
agreement had not yet been signed. There are still many 
problems with NAFTA and water rights and these concerns must 
be addressed.
<P>
	The main area of concern is that water is not one of the items 
specifically exempted under the terms of NAFTA. Article 309 
prohibits controls by Canada covering the sale or export of any 
good destined for either the United States or Mexico. Water in 
Canadian rivers and lakes is not mentioned in the export 
prohibition that NAFTA directly sanctions, which means that 
water will be freely exportable. Under NAFTA we cannot place 
restrictions on our ability to sell water.
<P>
	In addition, water is also subject to the same rules as tradable 
goods under NAFTA and includes the right of national 
treatment. This means Canada cannot give Canadians better 
access to Canadian water than it gives to the Americans or the 
Mexicans. The concern is that under NAFTA once water is 
diverted to the U.S. it cannot be stopped even in times of our 
own domestic shortage. Once we begin to sell our water to the 
Americans our control over that resource is lost.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Article 2101 of NAFTA requires that any trade restrictive 
measure taken relating to the conservation of any exhaustible 
natural resource, including water, be made effective in 
conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or 
consumption. In other words, any trade restrictive measures on 
water must be applied on a national basis. If we are to cut back 
on our water supplies to the Americans, we must take the same 
cuts ourselves no matter what kind of domestic shortage we have 
at home.
<P>
	Under the present deal we cannot give ourselves any better 
treatment regarding water than we do to our NAFTA partners. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9357"> 9357 </A></B>
<P>
Whatever we charge ourselves for water must be in line with the 
price we charge other NAFTA partners.
<P>
	These restrictions place a heavy burden on Canada. Under the 
present agreement it would be extremely unwise for Canadians 
to enter into any large scale water exports with the Americans. 
Personally I find it incredible that Canada actually agreed to 
such restrictive terms in the first place.
<P>
	Whether or not water was included in NAFTA negotiations is 
unclear. Previous and current governments have argued and 
continue to argue that we have not sold our rights to water in the 
NAFTA. The argument or justification for the deal is that 
Canada is not obliged to sell water to the U.S. under NAFTA. 
This is just political banter because once we begin to sell we 
cannot turn the tap off. Our sovereignty over water has clearly 
been sold out in the present NAFTA.
<P>
	No matter how we look at it, the truth is that we no longer have 
the control to do as we choose with our water. It is a Pandora's 
box, for once it is opened sovereignty is lost. The deal has placed 
Canadians in a precarious position that must be addressed before 
control of this resource is clearly lost.
<P>
	Government legislation such as Bill C-156 sought to ban 
large scale exports in 1988. However it died on the Order Paper 
before being implemented.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's pledge to prevent any large scale water 
exports from taking place as long as he is Prime Minister made 
in early November 1993 is meaningless without corresponding 
backup legislation and a NAFTA subagreement. I challenge the 
Prime Minister to back up his resolve to control Canadian water 
with strong legislation ensuring sovereignty and control over 
this precious resource, followed up with NAFTA negotiations to 
ensure the same.
<P>
	An additional point I wish to make is that these laws and any 
future restrictions are completely redundant because NAFTA 
states that no party may restrict the export of any good destined 
for the territory of another party. Any domestic water policies 
could also be shot down by a trade dispute panel as unacceptable 
interference in the free market.
<P>
	Clearly the only possible solution, if Canada is to maintain 
sovereignty over water, is to negotiate a side agreement to 
NAFTA that specifically exempts water from the terms of the 
agreement.
<P>
	Negotiations of the agreement regarding water were promised 
by the Liberal government before the agreement was signed. Are 
we about to see the Liberals fail to deliver on yet another 
promise? I surely hope not.
<P>
	Immediately after the last election, early in November of 
1993, the Prime Minister publicly stated: ``It is time to talk 
about Canada's desire to renegotiate aspects of the deal''. The 
Prime Minister promised that he would not sign any 
international or bilateral trade agreement that would oblige 
Canada to export water.
<P>
	Shortly after the election the Prime Minister guaranteed to 
Canadians that ``water remains under the control of the 
Canadian government''. He guaranteed that this was a fact and 
promised to ``make sure it is like that''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister went on to say that he had a message for 
President Bill Clinton: ``Do not even dream that NAFTA gives 
the United States unlimited access to Canadian water. That is 
because water and the North American Free Trade Agreement do 
not mix''. These are simply empty promises as the Prime 
Minister has so far failed to follow through.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are still waiting for the government to live up to its 
commitment. If water and NAFTA do not mix, why did the 
Prime Minister sign the deal? And why has he made no effort to 
negotiate these other aspects? The only justification the Prime 
Minister and his trade minister had for signing the deal was that 
nothing in NAFTA forces Canadians to sell a good that we do not 
wish to sell.
<P>
	It is true that NAFTA does not force us to sell our water. 
However, NAFTA forces us to continue sales once we have 
begun, and places severe restrictions on our ability to regulate 
and control the marketing of our own resource. It is not enough 
to have the power to make the decision to sell water. Canadians 
must have the power to shut off the tap when it is felt necessary.
<P>
	Once a decision is made to export water, future exports should 
not be mandatory. It is simply not good enough for this 
government to merely pledge to prevent the export of bulk water 
to the U.S. as was done immediately after the NAFTA agreement 
was signed in November 1993.
<P>
	Canada caved in on an opportunity to provide special 
protection for water in the original free trade pact with the U.S. 
and should have taken the opportunity to make the necessary 
amendments before signing the deal. It is still not too late to act.
<P>
	I would like to point out that earlier this month Mexico 
received a $20 billion aid package from the Americans to help 
stabilize the Mexican peso, on the condition that credit lines be 
guaranteed with Mexican oil export revenues. What does this 
have to do with water, you ask.
<P>
	Canada is in a similar situation to Mexico with the current 
load Canada and Canadians are presently carrying. There are 
predictions that Canada may require a bailout from the 
Americans, and similar to American conditions on Mexican oil 
exports, loans will undoubtedly put conditions on Canadian 
resources, such as water.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9358"> 9358 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we desperately require a clear written 
understanding that Canada has sole control over its water 
resources. Canada must protect its sovereignty over water and 
negotiate a side agreement to exclude water from NAFTA. This 
issue is far too important to ignore.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very appreciative of the intervention by the 
member for Comox-Alberni. I share his concern and the 
government shares his concern for the maintenance of Canada's 
riches, Canada's natural resources.
<P>
	I also have some particular interest in this subject because it 
touches an area in which professionally I have given it some 
attention. It is of course true that sovereignty is the basic 
constituent element of a state and sovereignty extends to its 
territory, its land, the resources of that land both under and 
above it, fixtures, to the air space above, and to the territorial 
sea. It is elementary that sovereignty cannot be derogated from 
except by the sovereign personality himself.
<P>
	So to this extent Canada retains full sovereign rights unless 
we ourselves choose freely to contract out of those and that 
would be an obligation entered into under international law. It is 
a fact that we have led in the international law related to 
protection of natural resources, our own and also those of other 
countries. We have been interested in clean air. We have 
pioneered the treaties and the protection of the atmosphere. We 
have led the way in the proper utilization of the law of the sea, 
and its protection from pollution.
<P>
	Also, I may say in pursuance of this, because not all states 
have accepted our high standards, we have not merely 
negotiated and led the way to international treaties and 
multilateral treaties extending protection of the law of the sea, 
but we have negotiated bilateral treaties with numbers of other 
countries when the international or multilateral action was slow 
in coming. For example, we have extended zones of 200 miles 
from our coast, the better to exercise these international law 
norms.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I mention this simply to say that Canadians have led in this 
area. It was something very much in our minds when we 
negotiated specific agreements with the United States in 
relation to the Great Lakes, in relation to international waters, 
international rivers. It was also very much in our minds when we 
negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 
trilateral agreement with Mexico and the United States.
<P>
	It happens that during the election campaign in October 1993 
this issue was raised in the public debates: Is there any 
derogation from Canada's control over its natural resources, 
over its water in particular by virtue of the NAFTA agreement. 
This was something to which all candidates, certainly in my part 
of the country, addressed themselves. The answer is very clear: 
There is nothing in the NAFTA agreement itself derogating in 
any way from our sovereign powers over our water resources.
<P>
	However there is a point in international diplomacy and 
international law in which for greater security one acts inaccord 
with the Latin phrase, Mr. Speaker, and you and I both deplore, 
as Lord Justice Denning called the attempt to fetter law by 
recourse to Latinisms. I will quote the Latin phrase ex abundanti 
cautela but I will repeat it in its essential, for greater assurance. I 
said to those who asked me then: I will seek a clarifying 
statement that makes assurance doubly sure. Immediately after 
the election and in fact during the campaign, I asked the Prime 
Minister if we could address ourselves to this and this is what 
has been done.
<P>
	A trilateral agreement was signed by the Prime Minister of 
Canada, the President of the United States and the President of 
Mexico. It is what is called a joint declaration. Annexed to the 
NAFTA agreement is the joint declaration of December 2, 1993. 
It says it very clearly and recites what is in any case I think as a 
matter of interpretation clear in the NAFTA agreement itself.
<P>
	The statement annexed to NAFTA establishes that NAFTA 
creates no rights to the natural water resources of any party to 
the agreement. Unless water in any form is entered into 
commerce and becomes a good or a product it is not covered by 
the provisions of any trade agreement including the NAFTA. I 
could read the balance of this but I think therein is the essential.
<P>
	What is the legal status of a joint declaration of this sort, a 
statement annexed to the NAFTA agreement? I do not want to 
bore you with technicalities but the fact is that what are called by 
various names, joint declarations, agreed interpretations, joint 
statements, provided they are signed by the parties to the 
agreement become part of the agreement.
<P>
	The best known example of this is of course the SALT I treaty, 
the strategic arms limitation treaty of 1972 between the United 
States and the Soviet Union. It has many, perhaps 30 such 
declarations and agreed interpretations annexed to it, and they 
are binding in terms of interpretation of the treaty.
<P>
	I would simply say this to the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni. We are sensitive to his concern, which we 
share, for the preservation of our great natural resources, for the 
preservation of our water. There is nothing in NAFTA, nothing 
in any international agreement to which Canada is party 
derogating from our retention of full sovereign rights over water 
within Canada, whether it be in lakes or whether it be in the 
water supplies on mountain slopes unless and until it enters into 
a commercial form, which means in this context, bottled. In this 
situation it will not be subject to NAFTA arrangements. There is 
no recourse to any one of the NAFTA arbitral or dispute 
settlement procedures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9359"> 9359 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not see any reason to go beyond this at this stage. 
However, the government may at some future stage wish to 
make declarations for purposes of Canadian internal needs of 
this sort. However in international law we are fully protected. 
Our sovereign rights are fully preserved.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	On that basis I would simply say again that I welcome the 
expression of sentiment by the member for Comox-Alberni. I 
share his views. I believe all members of the government do. I 
do not believe though that there is any need for any further 
action to be taken at this stage. I thank him again for his 
thoughtful intervention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni as he presented his motion. I also listened to the 
remarks made by his colleague opposite, the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	Let me read the motion over, for the benefit of those who are 
watching the debate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should support a policy 
that Canada's fresh water, ice and snow will be protected so that at all times and 
in all circumstances Canada's sovereignty over water is preserved and 
protected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is not the first time that this issue is raised in the House of 
Commons. We will recall that in May 1991, Mr. Fulton, who was 
a member then, presented a notice of motion asking for a 
national water council to be established to control, among other 
things, all freshwater export proposals. He was not the only 
member involved in this debate.
<P>
	In another notice of motion, the current Liberal member for 
Davenport suggested that, in the opinion of the House, the 
government should strengthen the federal water policy by 
tabling a bill prohibiting the export of water by tanker, through a 
channel, a new pipeline or by interbasin transfer.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, this debate is not new. In fact, it goes back such a long 
way that I would like to quote what the current Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the hon. member for Winnipeg 
South Centre, said in this House on Friday, May 28, 1993.
<P>
	At the time, the minister was a member of the opposition. He 
said: ``-we must afford national treatment to all goods and 
services. Goods are defined as having the definition given under 
the GATT. Article 2201 of the GATT defines natural water, 
including ice and snow, as a good''.
<P>
	He also said: ``If the United States sometime in the future, 
next year or the year after, decides it wants to exercise its legal 
right as contained in the agreements to require Canada to export 
up to the proportion then it would supersede any policy that is 
now on the books''.
<P>
	Further on, the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre 
added: ``I think the very first item would be that the federal 
goverment make it very explicit that the present moratorium on 
water exports that the British Columbia government has 
introduced is the policy of Canada. The federal government 
should very clearly take an immediate position on that 
question''.
<P>
	We are now in a new Parliament. Last year, the governement, 
with Mexico and the United States, issued a declaration on the 
interpretation to be given to the terms of NAFTA. In essence, 
that interpretation is as follows: NAFTA does not establish any 
rights to the natural water resources of one of the parties. Water, 
as found naturally in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, aquifers, 
hydrographic basins, is not a good or a product, is not for sale, 
and consequently is not and has never been covered by the terms 
of any agreement. International rights and obligations 
concerning natural water are set forth in separate treaties and 
agreements, negotiated for that very purpose, such as the 
Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and the 1944 treaty signed by 
the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	However, this joint declaration by the three countries does not 
mean that Canada has an overall policy regarding sovereignty 
over water resources.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In short, Canada does not possess any policy on water 
resource as a commodity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know, as we all do, that Canada is the 
country with the largest fresh water resources in the world. In 
November 1987, the hon. Tom MacMillan, the then Minister of 
the Environment, announced a federal policy on water 
resources, clearly stating that the federal government was 
opposed to large-scale exports of Canadian water. The minister 
then introduced Bill C-156 to enact this commitment into law. 
But since that bill died on the Order Paper when Parliament was 
dissolved on October 1, 1988, we do not have a policy at this 
time.
<P>
	According to the Constitution, jurisdiction over water 
resources is shared between the federal and provincial 
governments; in general, the provinces have jurisdiction over 
natural resources, including water, within their borders. 
However, the provinces' very wide jurisdiction over water 
resources within their territory is limited by the specific powers 
granted exclusively to the federal government, including 
fisheries, shipping, relations with foreign governments, federal 
lands, Indians, projects likely to benefit Canada in general, as 
well as peace, order and good government for the country.
<P>
	I might add for the benefit of my constituents that, 
unfortunately, the federal government does not always live up to 
its responsibilities regarding outboard motors on certain lakes, 
as in the case of the unfortunate lakeside residents in Lac aux 
Sables. Some problems are also emerging with respect to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9360"> 9360 </A></B>
<P>
seaplane bases; I am, of course,  talking about the people who 
live along the shores of Lac Saint-Augustin.
<P>
	But let us get back to water as a commodity. Canada currently 
exports water to the U.S.; a network of canals carries the water 
to population centres at the Canada-U.S. border and then on to 
nearby communities in the U.S.
<P>
	For instance, the water supply system in Coutts, Alberta 
crosses the border to meet local needs in Sweetgrass, Montana. 
Under another agreement, Gretna, Manitoba supplies Neche, 
North Dakota with water. Similar arrangements exist between 
St. Stephen, New Brunswick and Calais, Maine.
<P>
	These cross-border water transportation systems are small in 
scale and do not require inter-basin transfers. They offer a 
practical way to rationalize local supply, so we are not talking 
about exports as such. As for exports by water tankers, the 
volumes contemplated at this time are insignificant.
<P>
	The North American Water and Power Alliance project, 
developed by a Californian engineering firm, was among the 
major projects that attracted a great deal of attention. It would 
have necessitated the diversion of water from the Mackenzie 
and Yukon river systems, going south, through a passage in the 
Rockies, down to the United States, to supply southwestern 
states with irrigation water and produce hydro-electric power, 
perhaps also create waterways. But this project, fortunately, was 
never considered viable by the Canadian government or the 
American government.
<P>
	Another project, namely GRAND Canal, was first submitted 
in 1959 and has been a focus of attention ever since. This project 
calls for the impounding of James Bay to collect the waters 
flowing from Ontario and Quebec rivers as well as the reversal 
of 17 per cent of their flow towards the south. Water from the 
Great Lakes would then be diverted to the southwestern part of 
the U.S. and the arid zones of Western Canada.
<P>
	Simon Reisman, at the time the chief negotiator for Canada in 
the free trade talks with the United States, and former Quebec 
Premier Robert Bourassa championed this water diversion 
project. But opponents of the project argued that its benefits 
were purely theoretical and that even its economic impact could 
be negative.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In the 1985 report, the authors of the study on federal water 
policy pointed out that transfers between basins, like any other 
major water development project, cause major changes in the 
environment by interrupting the flow of waterways, flooding 
regions, transferring forms of life and even modifying 
conditions in the atmosphere and the oceans. The ultimate 
consequences of these changes are unpredictable.
<P>
	We believe that federal criteria should emphasize the federal 
and national interests to be considered in a framework policy on 
the water resource. Factors to be considered would include: 
first, the consequences for the fisheries and navigation in 
federal waters, international waters and waters under more than 
one jurisdiction; second, international considerations of an 
economic, political and strategic nature; third, the possible 
impact on the capability of our water reserves to meet the 
long-term needs of Canadians and Quebecers, bearing in mind 
the lack of certainty about those needs and the cumulative effect 
of exports at the regional and national level; fourth, the impact 
on the environment and the economy at the regional level; fifth, 
the consequences for aboriginal people and other social groups 
and the size of compensation payments in the event of adverse 
effects; and finally, the general economic benefits for Canada.
<P>
	How we should manage our water resources is a very timely 
question. It was raised this evening, and now we must decide 
what the answer will be.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about Canadian 
sovereignty over water.
<P>
	More than any other country Canada is blessed with an 
abundance of fresh water. Water is a fundamental part of our 
heritage. It provides the basis for much of our industrial 
activities. Our lakes and rivers along with the snow and ice of 
winter provide recreational opportunities for Canadians and 
support a thriving tourism industry.
<P>
	The preservation and protection of our water resources is a 
matter of vital concern to all Canadians. The issue of large scale 
exports of fresh water has been the subject of public debate at 
various times over the last three decades within Canada.
<P>
	Concern has focused on proposals such as the grand canal and 
proposals to divert water from British Columbia to California. 
However, no scheme for the large scale diversion of Canadian 
fresh water across the border has won the support of any level of 
government within Canada.
<P>
	More recently concern has been expressed that first the free 
trade agreement and then NAFTA diminish Canada's 
sovereignty over its water by obliging us to sell water to the 
United States.
<P>
	I would like to make it clear that the Government of Canada 
considers sovereignty over our valuable water resources a 
fundamental principle that must and will continue to be upheld.
<P>
	The Canadian government will not support any plans for the 
export of water through independent transfer or diversion from 
the Great Lakes or from any other water body.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9361"> 9361 </A></B>
<P>
	Small scale exports such as bottled water must meet the 
environmental requirements of both the federal and provincial 
governments. Steps have been taken to ensure that Canada 
retains full control over the use of water in all its forms.
<P>
	For example, the federal water policy approved by cabinet in 
1987 provides a strong expression of Canada's intention to 
maintain sovereignty over its water. The federal water policy 
states that the government will permit no large scale water 
exports. It also provides for the federal and provincial 
governments to work together to develop a licensing return for 
small scale water exports.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	To ensure federal responsibilities for environmental 
protection and international trade are taken into account, 
regarding the NAFTA it is the position of the Government of 
Canada that Canada's sovereignty over its water resources is in 
no way diminished.
<P>
	Under the NAFTA Canada maintains complete discretion over 
the exploitation and use of its water. The NAFTA does not oblige 
any partners to exploit its water for commercial use, sell it to 
other countries or export water from its lakes or rivers. Thus 
Canada has no obligation to export water under the NAFTA 
agreement.
<P>
	The NAFTA applies only to water that has entered into 
commerce and has become a good or a product such as bottled 
water or water in tanker trucks. Water packaged as beverage or 
in tanks is the reference in section 7 of the Canadian 
implementing legislation for the NAFTA.
<P>
	On December 2, 1993 the governments of Canada, Mexico 
and the United States as parties to the NAFTA issued a statement 
confirming that NAFTA does not oblige any of the parties to 
export water. Here is what the trilateral statement has to say 
about water:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of any party to 
the agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless water, in any form, has entered in the commerce and become a good or 
product, it is not covered by the provisions of any trade agreement, including 
the NAFTA. And nothing in the NAFTA would oblige any NAFTA party to 
either exploit its water for commercial use or begin exporting water in any form. 
Water in its natural state in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, aquifers, waterbasins and 
the like is not a good or product, is not traded, and therefore is not and never has 
been subject to the terms of any trade agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly the Government of Canada has been vigilant in 
protecting our precious supply of water in all its forms. I can 
assure the House that Canada will continue to preserve and 
protect its sovereignty over water resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at least I will 
get the last word this way.
<P>
	I want to basically develop a case for the importance of water. 
Many of the speakers who have gone before agree this is 
certainly an important commodity in this country. We have to 
really address the question of protecting  Canada's sovereignty 
over this water. Again it is an example of where Canada has 
shown leadership but needs to continue its vigilance and its 
leadership.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra introduced some of our 
leadership in the law of the sea, the Great Lakes clean-up and all 
of those examples. However, he then closed by saying that we do 
not need any action. I really disagree with that comment. Action 
is essential to ensure this valuable resource maintains its 
position and that we retain our sovereignty over it.
<P>
	We should not take this commodity for granted. In the future 
demand is going to do nothing but increase. Anybody who has 
gone to California might know, as the member who introduced 
this bill mentioned, the aquifer being drained at 50 times its 
replacement in California and the central U.S. is a major 
problem. Anyone can look at the Colorado River and see what 
has happened there to realize that California is short of water. 
California has a population of 32 million and because of that the 
demand for water is only going to increase. I think it is 
reasonable to say that the price of water will be greater than the 
price of oil or gas down the road some time.
<P>
	Since Canada has a major supply of fresh water, it is essential 
for humans, for agriculture, for industry, for our future 
well-being that we preserve this water.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to talk a little bit about the preservation and then 
what I see as being threats to the sovereignty and control of this 
water. It is a renewable resource but it is only renewable if it is 
managed properly. Groundwater is renewed by rainfall and by 
snow melt. It can, however, be very quickly overused and the 
aquifers can disappear. There are many examples where aquifers 
that were once very productive have gone down dramatically. I 
mention the central U.S. as the biggest example.
<P>
	Certainly agricultural and industrial uses put a severe drain on 
aquifers. In many cases, permits are given without looking at the 
big picture. One more project is approved and then one more 
project and then another. No management is involved until a 
disaster occurs.
<P>
	One of the contaminators of our water supplies is industry. It 
has improved a lot, but we can see what happens when we do not 
manage it simply by looking at the Great Lakes and what we did 
there.
<P>
	Of particular interest to me are landfill sites. All across 
Canada we are implementing more and more landfills. We have 
the time bombs from the past that are leaching into our 
groundwater. We are installing new landfills but we say they are 
okay because we are putting liners in them. The only problem is 
the liners are only good for 25 years. The leachate collection 
system plugs up and we do not know what will happen after 25 
years. Experts are now telling us that contaminants could leach 
from those landfill sites into our groundwater for 800 years. 
Cana-

dians had better take note of this and had better start managing 
this resource much better.
<P>
	I foresee a federal umbrella organization to provide the 
information, the technology, the collection of that technology. 
The provinces would then be involved in the actual distribution 
of this information, with the municipalities delivering the 
service. We must have this organization or this resource will be 
lost.
<P>
	We need to look at our rivers and our streams. We need to look 
at the protection of our watershed areas. Logging, recreation and 
development are having a great impact on our watersheds. 
Above all, I again emphasize the government's involvement in 
this.
<P>
	We are not moving very far in this direction and I would 
encourage the Minister of the Environment to get involved now. 
I am glad the member put this forward so we can talk about water 
again. The last member who spoke indicated how significant he 
felt it was. Certainly the member from the Bloc who spoke 
indicated a real understanding of this as a resource.
<P>
	Let us manage it then and let us not let things like pollution, 
sewage problems, industrial waste problems, landfill problems 
and the lack of planning that destroyed the Great Lakes literally 
and will take who knows how long to revive, happen in the 
future.
<P>
	What are the two major problems facing Canada in 1995? 
They can be related to the sovereignty of water. Two things 
should be thought about here. Number one is the Quebec 
situation. One might ask how that relates to water and its 
sovereignty.
<P>
	One thing I have heard very little talk about is the St. 
Lawrence Seaway and the St. Lawrence River. Who controls this 
waterway? Who has sovereignty over it? Is it Canada? Could it 
be Quebec? Could it be the U.S.? This is something that the 
Quebec people should be asking Mr. Parizeau and the 
federalists. Let us talk about this issue. Let us talk about the 
potential threat that the negotiations over this major seaway 
could have in relation to the whole issue of Quebec. I see that as 
being a threat.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Hydroelectric power could relate to water. The member from 
the Bloc mentioned there have been proposals for draining water 
from Quebec and Ontario into the United States.
<P>
	The second major issue relating to this is the debt and deficit. 
That has already been touched on. How does that affect water 
sovereignty? Let me put this scenario to you.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance fails to make the necessary cuts or 
raises taxes causing a financial crisis, and there will be a 
financial crisis if he fails to deal with the problems we have right 
now, what might be the reaction? A great deal of our debt is held 
by U.S. creditors. The IMF literally becomes a receiver if 
Canada becomes insolvent. We have seen what happened to 
Mexico. That has been mentioned as well. The Americans are 
tough to deal with, they are hard dealers. They put on conditions 
and say: ``You will perform this way''. Mexico has lost  its 
sovereignty because of the $50 billion bailout that Mr. Clinton 
arranged.
<P>
	These are concerns we should be thinking about. It is fairly 
obvious that if our creditors decide to call their loans the one 
thing that 32 million people in one state in the United States 
need is water. It seems kind of far fetched and does not seem 
possible.
<P>
	We have heard about inter-basin transfers but that is not 
possible. Fifty years ago there was a project in Alberta called 
Prime that I was a bit involved with. It was a plan to drain water 
from Alberta down to California. The idea is there, it is on the 
table. If we in fact do become insolvent water will be one thing 
that will be called for as a way to repay some of our debt. When 
you are in debt you really do not have much choice. I see that as a 
threat to our sovereignty.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canada must deal with its debt and deficit. It 
must deal with the Quebec situation and ask about the St. 
Lawrence Seaway. We must not sign long term deals.
<P>
	The British Columbia power situation where long term deals 
were signed is a good example of what happens if you sell the 
farm too soon. A side deal must be negotiated in NAFTA so that 
we will never start shipping water to the U.S. As has been 
pointed out although there is no obligation to start, once started 
there is no cutting back. It cannot be reversed. The Prime 
Minister promised but he did not keep that promise.
<P>
	I believe we must control this resource. We are going to leave 
future generations a debt. Let us not leave them the loss of a 
valuable resource like water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a recent town hall 
meeting this issue was raised along with the deficit and the debt. 
I asked the audience that if we closed the borders to the U.S. and 
closed the borders to Canada so that there were no exports or 
imports, no exchange of goods and services, which country 
would last longer? Some constituents said naturally the U.S. 
because of its wealth, et cetera, that it is an influential 
superpower.
<P>
	After a bit of discussion everyone in the audience agreed that 
Canada would last much longer. Why? Because of our resources. 
What is the most important resource? Water. In a way I am 
pleased that the hon. member for Comox-Alberni has raised 
this issue. It has given us a forum to debate.
<P>
	I wish that the Reform Party would not use fear tactics on the 
Canadian people. The issue of the export of water was raised 
during the free trade debate. It was calmed down. Then it 
resurfaced during the NAFTA debate. People got an answer and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9363"> 9363 </A></B>
<P>
they were satisfied. Now the Reform has raised this fear tactic 
again.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra and the secretary of 
state quoted a statement from NAFTA that the three countries 
signed. I will repeat it for the Reform Party so they can pass it on 
to their constituents. ``The NAFTA creates no rights to the 
natural water resources of any party to the agreement''. It cannot 
be more clear than that. ``Unless water, in any form, has entered 
into commerce and become a good or product'' and the 
Secretary of State quoted the whole statement signed by Canada, 
Mexico and the United States. I do not know what further 
guarantee we want.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The follow-up speaker for the Reform Party compared 
Canada with Mexico. Again another fear tactic. Surely to 
goodness we do not in this House get up and compare Canada 
with Mexico. We have a strong Canadian dollar. It fluctuates, 
yes, but please do not compare the Canadian dollar with the 
peso.
<P>
	Again, fear tactics are being used. I can assure the hon. 
member and I can assure Canadians that the policies we have in 
place do allow for the export of bottled water. What is wrong 
with that? We import water from Italy. We import water from 
France. We import water from Poland and from the U.S. They 
buy our water. I see nothing wrong with that.
<P>
	We also have protection against re-routing rivers, et cetera. 
There is protection there. I do not know what further protection 
there could be.
<P>
	The hon. member complained that the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra finished off his debate by saying that we do 
not need any action. He said that no action is needed at the 
moment because of the legislation and the agreements that are in 
place now. He did not say that we do not need any action. Canada 
is continually vigilant and it has an excellent track record in 
initiating and pushing multilateral treatments such as the law of 
the sea.
<P>
	Being born and raised in Saskatchewan I appreciate the value 
of water. We had plenty of well water in Saskatchewan, all we 
wanted, but we did not have any soft water. The only soft water 
we could get was what we caught from rainwater and spring 
snow to put into the cistern. One day the children, my brothers 
and I, were playing with the rainwater and we wasted almost a 
whole barrel. When Dad came home from town you know what 
we got. It was the belt he sharpened his razor on and we got it 
across the buttocks. That is how precious soft water was in 
Saskatchewan at the time.
<P>
	That reminds me to this day how vigilant we have to be, and 
the government is. Even in the Arctic. The ice caps are water. 
Look at what happened when the U.S. dumped its submarines in 
the Arctic. We know how easily the Arctic can affect the 
environment of the whole hemisphere.
<P>
	The hon. member knows we addressed that issue when we 
were reviewing our foreign policy. Hopefully the committee in 
planning its future work will address the whole issue of water, 
not only water in H2O form but also water in ice form, in ice 
caps on the mountains, in the air, et cetera.
<P>
	If all three parties in this House co-operate I do not think we 
need any change in our present guarantees. That does not mean 
we should not be vigilant. From that standpoint I thank the hon. 
member for raising this in the form of a private member's 
motion so that we could have this debate in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, shall we call it 6.30 
p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As no other member wishes to speak 
and since this was not chosen as a votable motion, the hour 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business 
has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, this item is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on December 14, 1994, I questioned the Minister 
of Justice on four orders in council concerning prohibited 
weapons. January 1, 1995 was the infamous date that those 
orders were to become effective, much to the dismay of many 
honest gun owners in Canada.
<P>
	It is common knowledge that many Canadians are upset with 
the minister's gun control package. The minister is feeling the 
heat from his own colleagues in the Liberal caucus who are 
against the intrusive gun control that he promised in his 
announcement.
<P>
	In my question I referred to two court decisions, Repa and the 
Queen, 1982, and Theodore Pierce Simmermon and the Queen, 
1993. In both cases the presiding judge made a ruling that the 
weapons order was invalid because it was not subjected to 
parliamentary scrutiny in accordance with section 116(2) of the 
Criminal Code:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister of Justice shall lay or cause to be laid before each House of 
Parliament, at least thirty sitting days before its effective date, every regulation 
that is proposed to be made under subsection (1); and every appropriate 
committee as determined by the rules of each House of Parliament may conduct 
inquiries or public hearings with respect to the proposed regulation and report 
its findings to the appropriate House.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9364"> 9364 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently a third case has been heard in the courts, this time in 
British Columbia, Regina v. Martinoff. Vancouver provincial 
court judge H.J. McGivern followed the decision of the Alberta 
case.
<P>
	In December I clearly asked the minister to explain to this 
House why he had not complied with this section of the code. 
Instead of answering my question, the minister went on to tell 
me that the orders in council were made under section 84 of the 
Criminal Code which does not require the sort of procedure 
outlined in section 116(2).
<P>
	I understand the Criminal Code very well and I know that 
under section 84 the minister can initiate orders in council 
without the inclusion of a reference to Parliament as is set out in 
section 116(2).
<P>
	However, I do not understand how the minister can cast a 
blind eye to three court cases in Canada that have overruled 
orders in council under section 84. What is the minister scared 
of by bringing such orders before the House and before an 
appropriate committee?
<P>
	The minister stated in his response to me with respect to the 
case in Alberta that judgment was wrong in that respect and that 
he will succeed in the appeal. Clearly the minister should not be 
making a public evaluation on a specific case if the case is in the 
appellate division of the court. Rather, it should be the duty of 
the minister to look at the various courts and make decisions and 
comments based on the momentum of rulings.
<P>
	The Liberal government prides itself on consultation 
processes and discussion papers. It has produced so many of 
them it is running out of colours to name these papers.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always promoted consultation but only 
if there is a conclusion to the discussion. Why is it that a 
government supposed to be keen on openness did not discuss the 
topic of prohibited weapons?
<P>
	Before the parliamentary secretary scribbles down an answer 
to tell me that there was an emergency for the overall safety of 
Canada, I want to fill him in on a few of the statistics taken from 
a survey of causes of death in Canada.
<P>
	Statistics Canada in 1992, and it is about the same now, said 
that 155,746 people died of diseases, 90 per cent of all deaths in 
Canada. For example 3,437 died in car accidents, 2 per cent of 
all deaths. Thirteen hundred and fifty-eight died of AIDS, .7 per 
cent of all deaths. Two hundred and forty-seven died of 
homicides caused by firearms, that is, .14 per cent of all deaths. 
Sixty-three died of gun accidents, .03 of all deaths.
<P>
	In addition, let me point out that based on these statistics it is 
336 per cent more likely that a male will die as result of a gun 
than will a female.
<P>
	The minister needs to put his priorities in the right place. He 
needs to let Parliament and therefore the people who elected us 
as members of Parliament to evaluate if certain firearms should 
be banned or prohibited.
<P>
	I do not have a great amount of time but I want to ask the 
minister several specific questions and would greatly appreciate 
clear and precise answers. With three court cases before him, 
will the minister acknowledge that these are not isolated cases 
but rather cases of significance and bearing and that his decision 
to proceed with orders under section 84 was wrong and ill fated?
<P>
	When a clear procedure is outlined, why would the minister 
make every effort to avoid it, thus causing further complications 
in the courts? Why would he not even live up to the spirit and the 
intent of Parliament? Given that in the end broad public support 
and co-operation is required for gun regulations to work, why 
would the minister risk his whole package in the public spirit of 
co-operation just to prove an obscure procedural point?
<P>
	Will the minister call back the orders in council and resubmit 
them under section 116(2) enabling wider consultation and an 
honest democratic process?
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the issue appears to stem from an interpretation of 
section 116 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Through orders in council adopted pursuant to section 84 of 
the code, firearms may become prohibited or restricted.
<P>
	It seems that in one case with which I am familiar, the case of 
Simmermon decided by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, it 
was ruled that these orders in council must be subjected to the 
procedure provided by section 116(2) of the code.
<P>
	According to the section regulations made pursuant to section 
116(1) must be laid before each House of Parliament at least 30 
sitting days before they are to become effective so that public 
hearings may be conducted. It appears that the court felt that 
orders in council made under the authority of section 84 of the 
Criminal Code are also regulations adopted pursuant to section 
116(1).
<P>
	I understand that it is the view of the Attorney General of 
Alberta that this is not the appropriate interpretation and that an 
appeal of that Alberta Queen's Bench decision has been 
launched.
<P>
	I was pleased to note that the Minister of Justice in his reply to 
the hon. member observed quite correctly in my view that orders 
in council made under the provisions of section 84(1) of the 
Criminal Code do not fall within the ambit of section 116 of the 
code.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9365"> 9365 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister made his position quite clear: ``Although there 
is a judicial decision of the trial court which holds that it is 
necessary even under section 84 to lay the regulations before 
the House, that decision is under appeal to the appellate 
division of the court in Alberta. We have every confidence the 
judgment was wrong in that respect and that we will succeed 
in the appeal''.
<P>
	Given the case is before the courts it would obviously be 
inappropriate to comment further other than to reaffirm our 
confidence that the court of appeal will rule that the making of 
orders in council pursuant to section 84 of the Criminal Code is 
not governed by the regulation making power of section 116 of 
the code.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLC-62">BILL C-62</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
December I asked the President of the Treasury Board for his 
assurance that Bill C-62, the Regulatory Efficiency Act, would 
not apply to the Fisheries Act or any other legislation which 
protects the environment. The minister replied that it is not the 
purpose of the bill to compromise environmental protection.
<P>
	Although the proposed legislation is not intended to harm the 
environment, health or safety, the adoption of Bill C-62 would 
fundamentally alter the very structure through which 
regulations are both created and enforced. In other words, Bill 
C-62 poses a threat to what we have developed over decades in 
the form of national regulatory standards.
<P>
	If regulation has become outdated or irrelevant, then let us 
change it. Apparently over the next two years 250 regulations 
are to be repealed and another 400 will undergo major revisions 
as a result of the findings in the 1992-93 regulatory review. 
Review of existing regulations will make the regulatory system 
more efficient but it will not threaten the fundamental premise 
of regulation making namely that regulations apply to everyone, 
rich and poor, regardless of influence or power.
<P>
	Under Bill C-62, however, any minister would negotiate 
separate compliance agreements with any business or individual 
and replace designated regulations. It will be between the 
respective minister and individual applicant, not between 
Parliament and the Canadian public that individual agreements 
will be approved.
<P>
	In addition, in certain cases where trade secrets are involved 
or if the agreements contain information which could threaten a 
company's competitive position, then secrecy would be 
invoked. Gradually then we can see how the regulatory system 
would change and we would face a situation over time in which 
there would be a standard for those who can afford law firms and 
consultants and another for those who cannot.
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers' Association has stated that 
made to measure regulations as proposed in this bill would save, 
mostly to big business, over $3 billion a year. Treasury Board 
has pointed to these projected benefits but seems to have 
overlooked the cost side of the equation.
<P>
	The proposed bill if enacted would lead to thousands of 
agreements. What will then be the cost to the public for 
approving, monitoring and enforcing such agreements?
<P>
	In times of fiscal restraint does the government really want to 
establish a two-tier system of regulations based on separate 
negotiated agreements? Would that be in the public interest? 
Will approving, monitoring and enforcing thousands of 
individual compliance agreements further our quest for better 
levels of enforcement and standards?
<P>
	Canadians by far prefer one regulatory system, one that 
applies equally to all, a regulatory system that leads to better 
results in the public interest. For this reason I ask whether the 
minister would withdraw the legislation and instead produce a 
white paper for public discussion.
<P>
	In the meantime the Minister of Justice plans to introduce 
amendments to the Statutory Instruments Act very soon. The 
amendments are to simplify and accelerate the regulatory 
process and offer a better channel for achieving regulatory 
efficiency in an equitable and comprehensive manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill is 
but one part of the government's overall approach to regulatory 
reform.
<P>
	Over the past year we have been actively reviewing some 
40,000 pages of regulations and moving to change hundreds of 
the most obsolete and problematic regulations in the next year. 
No longer will trains have to have spittoons, for example.
<P>
	As well, we will be bringing in changes shortly to the 
Statutory Instruments Act that will create a more efficient and 
less time consuming way of developing and changing 
regulations. That is the second part of our plan for regulatory 
reform.
<P>
	Bill C-62 is a third part of our program. What we are trying to 
do here is to create a tool for use in special circumstances only, 
where an individual or a company feels it can achieve the goals 
of regulation but wants to do so in a manner that is not exactly as 
laid out in a particular set of technical regulations.
<P>
	We have carefully and painstakingly crafted these tools to 
make sure they do their job without reducing the protection that 
environmental or other regulations give the Canadian public. I 
would like to point out that the bill is one of the first pieces of 
process legislation ever tabled in the House of Commons that 
enshrines as an inviolate and absolute principle the goal of 
sustainable development.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9366"> 9366 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the environmental movement, I point out, that has been 
at the forefront in recent years in urging governments to include 
sustainable development as a legislative principle. The act we 
are talking about explicitly does this. It says that no agreements 
can be approved under the act in any area whatsoever, unless 
it is considered with the goals of sustainable development, 
period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The measures proposed in this bill are optional.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the Minister of the Environment does not want to use them 
with respect to any set of regulations, she does not have to do 
anything, thereby effectively exempting those regulations from 
the application of the bill.
<P>
	The bill is truly a democratic innovation. It will allow 
individuals, whether farmers, union members, taxpayers or even 
politicians, to force the government to examine its own 
regulations. From a common sense point of view it will force 
departments to look closely at possibly rigid, inflexible and 
often outdated rules to see if there is a better, cheaper and more 
sensible way to do things.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), a 
motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted.
