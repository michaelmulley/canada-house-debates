<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
October was breast cancer awareness month, I wanted to join with 
a number of other colleagues in promoting the need for women to 
have regular breast examinations early to ensure early detection 
and treatment of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer threatening 
Canadian women today.  This year alone 19,300 new cases of the 
disease will be diagnosed in Canada and 5,300 more Canadian women 
will die of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting then that the Minister of Health has recently 
announced the renewal of the Canadian breast cancer initiative 
which will now enjoy stable, ongoing funding of $7 million per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer awareness month is an initiative of the Canadian 
Cancer Society to inform Canadians, men and women alike, of the 
severity and the magnitude of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As breast cancer awareness month has drawn to a close, I know 
that all hon. colleagues will want to join me in congratulating 
the Canadian Cancer Society for its unrelenting efforts to 
educate all Canadians about the tragedy of breast cancer and how 
we can reduce the risks this disease poses to all women.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is an old joke that asks “What do you get when you play 
country and western music backward?”  The answer is that you get 
your girl back, you get your dog back, you get your truck back, 
and, if it were not for this Liberal government, you would even 
get your guns back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you know what you get if you play it forward, if 
you add interesting and insightful commentary, timely and 
informative news programs and combine it all with community 
service?  The answer to that question is that you get radio 
station CJVR in Melfort, Saskatchewan which was just named 
country music station of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you are in my riding of Prince Albert you will 
be royally entertained, amused and informed by tuning into 750 
CJVR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of this House will want to join me in 
extending personal congratulations to manager Gary Fitz and staff 
on winning this award not just once, not just twice, but for an 
unprecedented third time in a row.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Michael Heintzman, a reporter with the North Shore 
<I>Sentinel</I> in Thessalon in my riding, has earned first prize 
two years in a row in the best historical story competition from 
the Canadian Community Newspapers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 award was in recognition of his articles on Remembrance 
Day which appeared in a special section of the <I>Sentinel</I> 
that year.  This beautifully produced section highlighted the 
tremendous contribution of local citizens, towns and villages of 
our region during the great wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later today Mr. Heintzman will travel to Europe with our 
colleague, the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and a group of 
Canadian World War I veterans to participate in the commemorative 
ceremonies taking place to mark the 80th anniversary of the end 
of World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Heintzman will have an excellent opportunity to experience 
this momentous event with a group of highly respected and 
decorated Canadian veterans. I look forward to reading his 
observations when he returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of his work and that of the North Shore

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to commend 
three Honduran firefighters who have been residing in my riding 
of Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe for the past three months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been undergoing firefighting training so that they can 
return to Honduras to establish the first national firefighters 
school in their country.  They were due to leave Friday when they 
heard of the disaster which killed thousands of people in their 
country, many of them friends and relatives, and left countless 
others homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The building that was supposed to house the firefighting school 
is in pieces and many people are in desperate need of assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with two constituents, Paul Jennings and Paul McFadden, 
they are returning to Honduras tomorrow to help their country. 
As well, all of the fire stations in the greater Moncton area 
have set up collection points to gather supplies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely proud of the people of Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe for 
all they have done to assist the three Honduran firefighters and 
the victims of Hurricane Mitch.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REMEMBRANCE DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Remembrance Day is a time for reflection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father served in the second world war with the Argyle and 
Sutherland Highlanders and he imparted a great appreciation for 
what people have done in wartime and the sacrifices that they 
made for their country and their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of months before he died in 1992 I asked him to tell me 
some of his wartime stories which I recorded.  Some of his 
recollections were tragic, some heroic and some even humourous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such story dealt with the D-Day landings in 1944.  Months 
before the D-Day landings thousands of allied troops had been 
gathering in the fields of southern England to the point that 
soldiers use to say “It's a wonder that the island hasn't tipped 
leaving Scotland high and dry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remembrance Day is a day that does not glorify war.  It is a day 
that reminds us that there were many Canadians who believed in a 
better future.  They were prepared to fight and even die in order 
that generations to come would have a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is up to us to continue the work for a better tomorrow. 
If we do, we will have remembered.

yesterday the member for Oxford falsely accused one of my

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Oxford should chat with his caucus

</I></B></P><P align=left>These letters solicited support for an Ontario provincial 
Liberal candidate named George Winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga Centre even went so far as to include 
provincial Liberal membership booklets in the mail-out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both letters were written on House of Commons letterhead and 
used franking privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that members cannot use House resources for 
their own campaigns.  Therefore, is it appropriate for members to 
use House resources for provincial campaigns?  I would think not. 
The Liberals have got it wrong again.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to congratulate La Soupière, a 
community service program in Anjou, at the heart of my riding of 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, for its 15 years of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weekly, for the past 15 years, the volunteers at La Soupière 
have been providing a nutritious meal to the isolated and 
disadvantaged residents of Anjou.  In 1997-98, 40 volunteers 
served close to 3,400 meals.  This represents 2,300 volunteer 
hours.  Imagine how many meals and volunteer hours that adds up 
to over its 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to draw attention to the excellent co-operation 
between La Soupière, the city of Anjou, local merchants, Moisson 
Montréal, the various funding bodies, and the local community 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bravo to all those responsible for this wonderful effort.  It 
helps those of us who are elected to office keep in mind that, 
above and beyond economic growth and competition, we must be 
sure that the resulting wealth is better shared.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Mitch 
has hit Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, 
countries that were already struggling for some degree of 
economic prosperity.  While the death toll is still being added 
up, thought must be given to the danger of epidemic and to 
preparations for putting the country back on its feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Paul Péloquin, a priest from Laval who has been working in 
the capital of Honduras for the past 31 years, wrote to his 
relatives that “the entire country, every square inch of it, has 
been at least 70% destroyed”.  Yesterday, the governments of 
Quebec and Canada announced plans to provide emergency 
humanitarian aid to the countries hit by this disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec are very familiar with the value of human 
solidarity, having reaped its benefits after the Saguenay 
flooding and the ice storm. 
I am therefore encouraging them to support the victim assistance 
programs of such organizations as the Red Cross, CUSO, 
Development and Peace, Oxfam Quebec and the Endeavours of 
Cardinal Léger.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, CTV is reporting an allegation made by a former Canadian 
now living in Israel.  Leslie Lewis claims he was approached last 
year to give his Canadian passport to an Israeli agent.  Lewis 
also claims his daughter was approached for the same reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Israeli government has denied the allegation and says it no 
longer uses Canadian passports in its fight against terrorism. 
Would the foreign affairs minister tell us what he knows about 
this allegation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I make the point that we consider the integrity of 
the Canadian passport to be a primary responsibility, and we have 
taken a number of efforts to ensure that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the particular incident, the matter was reported to our 
embassy.  It was thoroughly investigated by passport people, 
consular people, CSIS people.  They could find no corroboration 
for the allegations that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we continue to monitor the situation, but there 
is no evidence that would require us or give us the basis for 
raising the matter with Israelis at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is new evidence that can be produced, we would be very 
happy to receive it and to further investigate it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians have strong feelings on this issue.  On the 
one hand, we believe in the security of the state of Israel and 
its fight against terrorism.  On the other hand, as the minister 
said, we are concerned about allegations that our passports are 
being used illegally.  Our passports are well respected around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is being reported that the minister was informed of this 
allegation some time ago.  When did he first learn about this 
allegation and what did he do about it at the time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just explained that when the first representation 
was made the matter was investigated.  Last February, March and 
April it was investigated by several agencies.  Certain parts of 
the gentleman's story did not corroborate in any way, shape or 
form.  They could not provide any supporting evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point in time we continued to monitor the situation, but 
it did not warrant any direct representation to the Israeli 
government without the kind of basic support and evidence that 
would be required to support the kind of charges he made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in September 1997 Canadian passports were illegally used 
by Israeli agents in an anti-terrorist operation.  At that time 
the minister gave the House solemn assurances that this would 
never happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have allegations that it did happen again, allegations 
that the minister apparently knew about but kept to himself. Are 
there any other allegations of this nature which the minister is 
aware of and yet has not disclosed to the House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the operative word is allegations.  Allegations are 
things we check out.  That is exactly what we did.  We checked 
them out.  There were no grounds to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we have continued to monitor them.  The only other 
allegation that was made was by Mr. Lewis about another 
individual who had been approached, and he totally denied it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, simply

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me first clarify that I sent officials over to 
the hon. member to brief him.  He did not check it out.  We made 
sure that he was fully informed of what went on.  That is exactly 
how we deal with it because we want to make sure people have full 
available information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the matter is CTV said allegations were made.  Yes, 
they were.  We checked out those allegations to the best 
information we could ascertain.  By the way, one of the handicaps 
of ascertaining it is that the individual in question would not 
allow us to use his name when we went around to check out the 
sources and the basis for that.  He is now clearly going public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that if there is any new evidence, if 
there is any new— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Red Deer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked for 
a briefing at 6 o'clock last night and again at 10 o'clock.  A 
briefing was set up at 9 o'clock this morning which was 
cancelled.  Finally I got a briefing at 1.15 this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to feel confident in their passports.  We also 
are against terrorism but not with the Canadian passport.  Let us 
get it straight.  The minister is saying that the allegations 
made by <I>W5</I> last night are untrue.  Yes or no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what I have said four times in a row is that the 
allegations were made.  We checked them out to the best of our 
ability.  There were a variety of agencies talking to a number of 
other agencies involved in the business.  We could not find any 
corroborating evidence to support the allegations that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact as much as we could ascertain was that the event he was 
talking about happened last fall before the assurances were 
given.  That is as much as we have been able to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member has more information we will look into it, 
but I want to make the point that we have in place a system where 
every five years we review the passport system.  We are presently 
bringing in a new system.  I believe it is the most secure 
passport in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes accounting revealed that the employment insurance fund

Canadian workers and the economy.  The report also suggests that 
the increase in CPP premiums should be offset with an EI premium 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister once told Canadians “payroll taxes are a

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister tell us why he now insists on killing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
effect of the CPP premium hike will be to take away a week's 
wages from a person earning less than $35,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister could lower the tax burden on these 
Canadians by offsetting the CPP hikes with a more substantial EI 
premium cut than he has been willing to make to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the government's watchdog states EI premiums should be 
much lower than they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

passing strange it is criticizing us for having acted to secure 
the Canada pension plan for all Canadians when it ignored it

enough rhetoric from the minister.  The C.D. Howe Institute is 
saying that the government's CPP tax hike will cost 200,000 jobs. 
He can offset the impact of those hikes by cutting EI premiums 
by the $7 billion recommended by the actuary.

finance minister who is saying payroll taxes are a cancer on job 
creation.  Yet the government raises payroll taxes.  He said this 
spring that the EI fund belongs to workers and employers. Now he 
is setting out to raid it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister quit this cynical, political manipulation 
of the government's finances and put jobs ahead of his own

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

cuts, let us be very clear about what Reform is advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its fresh start document, its election platform, it said cut 
the premiums 28% but for employers only.  Last January it told us 
we could use the surplus in the EI to help pay down the deficit 
and the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to act responsibly and take a balanced approach. We 
will continue our program of cutting EI taxes.  We will continue 
our program of reducing personal income taxes.  We will pay down

allow the banks to do this.  It is 75 cents a pop.  There is a 
service charge.

that he will not allow the banks in Canada to get into yet 
another market, namely selling postage stamps through their ATMs, 
in other words becoming a vending machine for this product and

question of the Bank Act, the legalities are not quite as clear 
cut as the member might let on. There is a question of whether it 
is the sale of goods or of services. Having said that, we have 
asked our officials to look into it. I will be very pleased to 
hear from the House and Senate committees looking into this to 
see what their suggestions are as to any potential expansion of 
the powers of banks.  I look forward to the members' suggestions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Ibrahim is not freed, can the Prime Minister tell us what 
Canada's official position will be, and whether he is prepared

afternoon the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
told this House that the $235 appraisal fee imposed on anyone

was an average cost, so to speak, and that, if CMHC were to 
appraise every property individually, the cost would be much 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since an appraisal is done on only one out of every twenty 
properties in Quebec, where is the truth in the minister's

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia and Bay of Fundy lobster conservation measures are 
not being applied evenly across the board.  If the minister wants 
these new regulations to work, then adjacent lobster fishing 
areas must have the same conservation measures. For instance, 
lobsters that are illegal to catch in district 33 are legal to 
catch in adjoining district 34.  How is the minister going to 
prevent smuggling and illegal sales between these two adjacent 
districts?

lobsters is an important objective.  We have put in place a 
number of measures in many different lobster harvesting areas of 
maritime Canada to achieve that.  Nevertheless for historic 
reasons and sometimes because of the requests of the fishermen 
themselves, it has not been possible to reach a single uniform 
size across the entire board.

<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-51 contains a number of changes that the government has 
identified as requiring fairly quick action, and we have acted. 
These changes would have normally been dealt with in the next 
major Criminal Code omnibus amendments, but the government wanted 
to deal with them sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice also tracks technical problems with 
the Criminal Code.  It produced a list of other amendments 
correcting legislative oversights and other minor problems to 
complete the package.  Since this is an omnibus bill there is no 
common policy theme which connects the changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has the responsibility and the constitutional 
authority to pass laws on criminal matters, but the application 
of these laws is under provincial jurisdiction.  We must 
therefore take into consideration what works and does not work, 
according to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We meet regularly with the provinces and we take their 
expectations into account when we develop strategies in criminal 
law.  Many of the proposed amendments to the law come out of 
this process. 
When these changes are considered, we must bear in mind that 
they arise from requests and proposals by the provinces, which 
play an important role in the application of criminal law in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments are a direct product of provincial 
requests.  For example, the changes to the gambling provisions 
originate from Quebec and Ontario.  The changes to the child 
prostitution provisions originate from British Columbia and 
Alberta.  The repeal of the year and a day rule responds to 
concerns from a number of sources, most recently from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces also asked to expand the ambit of 
non-communication orders to prevent persons charged with domestic 
violence offences from contacting victims or witnesses both 
before and after their bail hearing.  The proposed legislation 
authorizes the first judge or justice before whom the accused 
appears to make such orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the cornerstones of the bill is the repeal of the year 
and a day rule in section 227 of the Criminal Code.  Cases where 
it will apply are relatively rare but have been increasing in 
recent years because medical advances make it more likely that 
victims of assault will survive for extended periods.  Forensic 
advances also make it possible to prove the causation of death in 
cases involving disease or environmental pollution where it would 
not have been possible a few years ago.  I was pleased to note 
that members of all sides of the House support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change which was a priority was the provision linking 
the new deceptive telemarketing offences proposed by the Minister 
of Industry in Bill C-20 with the Criminal Code proceeds of crime 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-20 was drafted and introduced it was not apparent 
that this was an important link.  Competition Act offences are 
regulatory criminal law and the competition bureau would not 
usually consider it necessary to target proceeds from the other 
offences it enforces such as misleading advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the case with deceptive telemarketing.  As we have 
seen both from our own examination of the problem and recent 
media coverage, telemarketing fraud and deceptive telemarketing 
are capable of generating large proceeds.  They involve the use 
of telephone boiler rooms to contact large numbers of victims. 
Individual losses may be large or small, but if many victims are 
targeted the overall proceeds are often very large, marking 
confiscation a major deterrent and an important step toward 
compensating victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proceeds are so large in some cases that this sort of crime 
has attracted the attention of more traditional organized crime 
groups in Canada, making the targeting of proceeds even more 
important. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Industry take 
this matter very seriously.  As soon as the need for this link 
was identified it was included in the bill.  The offence of fraud 
already falls within the proceeds of crime scheme.  The inclusion 
of deceptive telemarketing will help to ensure that criminals 
cannot hide their own considerable profits from forfeiture and 
restitution to their victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another organized crime priority for both Quebec and the 
solicitor general was the exclusion of those convicted of 
organized crime offences from accelerated parole review.  This 
proved to be a fairly straightforward amendment.  It was 
proceeded with but concerns have been voiced that it does not go 
far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proposed, organized crime offenders would be excluded as long 
as the organized crime element is proven either on conviction or 
sentence.  To go further than this and catch everything at 
conviction might require the restructuring of the money 
laundering offence.  This would go beyond what is reasonable to 
attempt to do in an omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general and the justice minister were anxious to 
proceed with this change quickly.  The criminal organization 
offence was added to the Criminal Code less than two years ago by 
the government.  Fairly quick action was needed on this issue 
before a significant number of cases arose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important organized crime issue is the potential use of 
rough diamonds produced in Canada as a medium of exchange by 
organized crime.  As members of the House will know, the first 
ever Canadian diamond mine began production in the Northwest 
Territories earlier this month.  This represents an important and 
welcome source of economic development for Canada's north, but 
there are concerns that the high value of rough diamonds will 
attract thieves and organized crime interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason the Minister of Justice wanted to move quickly 
to expand the Criminal Code offences dealing with precious metals 
to include valuable minerals other than gold, silver or platinum. 
This would ensure the law covers rough diamonds and any other 
gemstones or other similar minerals that might be discovered in 
Canada in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of international cruise ships, the amendments would 
allow Canadian registered cruise ships, which fall under 
Canadian law regardless of where they are, and foreign 
registered cruise ships in Canadian waters to offer gambling to 
passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes will also allow cruise ships entering Canadian 
waters to import gambling equipment in their casinos without 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is expected to provide direct benefits to the cruise 
industry itself and indirect benefits to tourism and other 
business in the ports where cruise ships call. 
Canadian registered cruise ships will be competitive while 
abroad and foreign registered ships will not be deterred from 
calling on Canadian ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruise industry is an important and rapidly growing part of 
regional economies, particularly in the St. Lawrence valley of 
Quebec and the coastal waters of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy that we have proposed amendments that will address 
the concerns and interests of these provinces and their 
populations.  I am convinced that the proposed amendments will 
not lead to a significant increase in overall gambling and will 
not conflict with provincially regulated gambling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canadian waters, gambling will only be allowed on genuine 
international cruise ships during actual international cruises. 
No gambling will be permitted when ships stop over. I want to 
make this very clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains a series of sentencing reforms.  As with 
other amendments, the purpose is not to make fundamental changes 
to sentencing policy but to address certain specific concerns 
that have arisen with the sentencing reform bill, Bill C-41, 
which took effect in late 1996. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 created a number of general rules dealing with fines, 
conditional sentences and other measures.  The application of the 
new general rules to specific provisions of the Criminal Code and 
other acts have had to be reconciled or adjusted in some cases as 
we begin to see how the various provisions are being applied by 
the courts. It is too early to consider any fundamental changes 
to the sentencing provisions but there are a number of areas that 
warrant refinement in our opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example the legislation will clarify the relationship 
between the new general rules governing fines and other specific 
punishments in the Criminal Code and other statutes. There has 
been some question about whether the fine provisions would have 
priority over punishment rules for specific offences. The 
proposed amendments will ensure that a specific fine imposed 
pursuant to a specific offence provision has priority over the 
general rules.  They will also clarify that if there is a minimum 
jail or prison term, the fine options are not available as an 
alternative to it. In other words, the offender may be sentenced 
to a fine in addition to custody but not instead of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important sentencing changes deal with the enforcement 
of conditional sentences.  They are designed to ensure that the 
enforcement of conditional sentence orders is effective and that 
offenders face appropriate consequences for breaches of their 
conditions.  Offenders who breach the conditions of their 
sentences will no longer get credit for time spent while they 
were in breach.  The running of their sentence will be held in 
abeyance until a court concludes an inquiry into the breach no 
matter how long that takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the House standing committee's plan to study the 
whole issue of conditional sentencing as was requested by the 
Minister of Justice, we believe fundamental changes should not 
pre-empt its work.  Furthermore a number of cases have been dealt 
with by appeal courts and several are pending before the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  We believe we should allow the supreme court to 
render its decisions in these cases so that any further changes 
are predicated upon a solid legal foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill consists of changes that will not revolutionize 
Canada's criminal justice system.  They are not for the most part 
glamorous and they will not generate newspaper headlines, but 
they are important.  They are important to the police community 
which seeks powers to target proceeds of crime.  They are 
important to victims who are intimidated by assailants even when 
they are in custody.  And they are important to our prosecutors 
and our courts that are charged with the weighty task of ensuring 
justice is both done and seen to be done on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask that all members join the Minister of Justice, 
this government and me in supporting these amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand there have been some discussions and 
that there would be unanimous consent for me to share my time 
with the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I would ask for 
that unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
hon. members share the time as indicated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will cover a few 
fundamental flaws in Bill C-51. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the eloquent remarks of the parliamentary 
secretary.  If the millions of people who make up the vast 
audience watching the parliamentary channel were to listen to 
her, they might think it sounds pretty good, that we should get 
this in really quick.  The parliamentary secretary said that it 
is important to police, victims, prosecutors and the courts. In 
Reform's opinion a lot of changes could have been made in this 
bill that really would have made it important to police, victims, 
prosecutors and the courts, especially to victims and the 
Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has raised a lot of concerns.  We raised them 
during second reading when we had a good full debate in the 
House. 
We raised them in committee and had full discussion on some of 
our concerns about this bill.  We also put amendments in 
committee which the government did not consider.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had a great opportunity in this legislation to make 
a clear statement to criminals that the country has had enough 
with this cat and mouse game.  Instead the minister continues the 
course of inaction in getting tough and sending a message that 
Canadians have had enough of weak sentences, conditional release 
for violent offenders, child prostitution and those living off 
the avails of child prostitution, and organized crime figures 
spending so little of their sentences in prison for major drug 
offences and other very violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words about the subject of conditional release. 
I read a litany of concerns expressed by judges and others in the 
judicial system during my speech at second reading.  It obviously 
was not enough proof for the minister that conditional release is 
not meeting the expectations of the judges or the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could debate this bill for months just reading the comments 
made by judges on conditional sentencing.  Judges ask why 
parliament did not put right in the bill originally exactly what 
they wanted with conditional releases.  That is what the Reform 
Party tried to do in committee.  We tried to make it so Canadians 
and judges would understand what conditional sentencing meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary tells us there are cases before the 
supreme court right now and that the government wants to hear 
what it says before looking at conditional sentencing again.  I 
say to the parliamentary secretary and the minister, is it not 
time this House of Commons started making the laws and not wait 
for judges who are appointed by the government to make the laws? 
It is our job to look at legislation and to look at how it is 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, as do many Canadians, that the issue is very simple. 
Conditional sentencing should not be used in the case of a 
violent offence.  Yet it is happening more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By simply amending section 742(1) of the Criminal Code to exempt 
convictions for serious personal injury offences as defined in 
section 752 of the code could prevent such travesties as the one 
involving two gentlemen—and I use that term very loosely—who 
raped and tortured a Montreal woman last year.  Thanks to 
conditional sentencing they were let out, free to do it again. Is 
there no sense of compassion with this government or just plain 
common sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know one member of this House who in looking at that 
case would think that it was ever meant for two men convicted of 
rape, not only rape but a violent rape.  Yet a judge in her 
wisdom—and I really question that and hope that when this gets 
through the supreme court we will see some major changes in 
that—let this happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main reasons we will vote against this bill is 
because the government refuses to look at conditional sentencing. 
It continues to let this type of sentence take place for violent 
rape offences and violent murders.  It is unfortunate that this 
government is just not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the official opposition, we could be accused of being 
political in trying to find a weakness in the government.  Heaven 
knows, we would not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say what a judge said because we all know judges are 
not political.  They may have been at one time but they are not 
political in their jobs and we all know that.  As one judge put 
it, “conditional sentencing for these types of heinous crimes 
undermines respect for the law”.  That is what the Reform Party 
is talking about, the undermining of respect for the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who commit these kinds of violent crimes are allowed to 
get out on a conditional sentence, serving no time in jail, with 
no training to put them back into society so they will not do 
these things again.  That is why the judge said it undermined 
respect for the law.  That is why we put these amendments in 
committee, why we are debating this bill in the House of Commons 
right now and why we will vote against this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quote from another judge who said “Some judges fall on 
the other side and have been applying conditional sentences far 
beyond what parliament had originally intended”. We made it easy 
for them to try to interpret something the way they wanted to 
hear it.  Judges have asked publicly “Why do members of 
parliament not vote in the legislation and tell us what they want 
and what is meant by conditional sentencing?”

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we tried to get this minister to do at committee. 
We tried at second reading and we are trying again at third 
reading.  I am hoping there are enough people out there listening 
and paying attention, enough police officers, prosecutors and 
victims looking at this and they will write the Minister of 
Justice and tell her that this bill should not pass without 
something being done about conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some surveys.  The government does surveys.  The 
opposition does surveys.  Survey after survey of police officers, 
lawyers, probation officers and corrections staff indicate that 
over 90% of the experts in the business felt that sentences 
imposed by the courts were not respected.  Upwards of 69% of this 
same group felt that the amount of time served should be the same 
as the sentence imposed.  That is a shocking thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When somebody has committed a very serious crime and is 
sentenced to 20 years in jail, the public thinks he will serve 20 
years with a little time off for good behaviour.  In this country 
the judge can give them a conditional sentence.  They can serve 
no time in jail at all.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message the government is sending in Bill C-51 is that a 
life of crime pays, and the public remain the victims of the 
cruel hoax that Canada has a system of justice that respects them 
and not the criminal.  Right now the average person out there in 
the public believes that the system respects the criminal and not 
the victim.  Members on the other side know that.  They know 
about the motion on victims by our House leader and which was 
worked on very hard by the deputy justice critic from Surrey 
North.  It was put forward in the committee this week. This party 
is concerned about victims.  This bill does very little for 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another note, the Reform Party feels strongly that 
traffickers and importers of drugs spend at least two-thirds of 
their sentence behind bars. These people in most cases are 
members of organized crime and are a blight on society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a message sent to organized crime.  If we could 
have it our way, we would like the entire section on accelerated 
parole repealed.  Organized crime figures are serious criminals 
by the Criminal Code's own definition.  Why does the government 
continue to deal with them as if they are petty criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Automatic parole for these types of criminals is abhorrent no 
matter what the standard.  They are not rehabilitated after 
one-sixth of the sentence.  The government is going to go to 
one-third, but I guess it is the best we can expect from this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about people who are involved in organized crime. 
Organized crime by definition means being part of an organization 
of more than a certain number of people, and those people have 
made a decision in their way of life to become involved in crime. 
Crime is their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone launders a couple of million dollars and gets six 
years in jail and after two we let him go, is that anything that 
will stop a lot of people from getting into organized crime and a 
life of crime? If they know they will spend two-thirds of the 
sentence in jail no matter how good they are when they get there, 
they might think twice about getting involved in a life of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 deals with the issue of child prostitution.  The 
Criminal Code now provides a minimum of five years for anyone who 
uses violence or intimidation to get or keep a minor in 
prostitution.  The Reform Party feels that anyone who lives off a 
minor should receive a minimum one year sentence, and I and the 
public look at that and think one year is not even enough. Number 
one, they will not serve a year and number two, they are not 
getting any time at all on a first offence.  The government does 
not share our view but in fact it seems not too harsh to us at 
all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of this House to look at child prostitution, what 
this government is saying and what we have asked for.  It is very 
much a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about every member in this House has children.  If one of 
their children was to be lured into child prostitution or lured 
into the drug areas they would be incensed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure a lot of members have constituents who have children 
who have been drawn into the field of child prostitution.  How 
many street children have we in the cities of Toronto, Montreal, 
Edmonton and Vancouver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill we tried to make some changes.  We could not get 
the amendments before the committee.  The minister said she was 
aware that it was a problem and she would like the committee to 
look at it a little further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time we told the courts, from the bottom right up to 
the supreme court, that anybody who messes with our children, who 
starts to peddle drugs to them or who tries to lure them into 
prostitution is going to get minimum sentences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentence for prostitution might be one year, but the 
sentence for drugs has to be heavier.  There cannot be any early 
parole to return these people to the streets.  That is not 
radical.  That is what the average Canadian thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in our country.  I know 
that in Vancouver and Toronto drugs are a very serious problem. 
We do not find that in the polls with taxes, income and health 
care.  That is a day to day thing at home and not something we 
tell the pollsters when they call.  We may not want to talk about 
the fact that our children are involved in drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shock to many parents.  I know this from talking with 
people in my own constituency who have had the unfortunate 
situation happen where their children were involved with drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expense to our country, the expense of getting these people 
off drugs and back to a normal life, is minute in comparison to 
what it would cost to keep that person in jail who tried to lure 
a child into drugs or prostitution in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would have liked the government to send a 
message to those parasites who live off juvenile prostitutes. 
Society abhors their behaviour.  We have to start somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the government allows the police to use wiretaps 
to deal with the problem.  The government then allows a judge to 
give the criminal a slap on the wrist for his bad behaviour. This 
is not good enough.  Give on one hand; take away with the other. 
This is feel good legislation for the Liberals, but it is not 
taking the problem seriously enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked as much as we can on this side of the House on 
these areas.  We hope that the government listens once in a 
while, looks at this issue and realizes that it has to speed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to take the minister at her word.  She has said 
that the issue of conditional sentencing with respect to child 
prostitution will go back to the committee for consideration. 
The sooner the minister gets it there the sooner it will be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem in our country.  It is not a partisan 
political problem.  It is something that members from all sides 
of this House want to get to work on.  I think it is time we told 
the lawyers working in the justice department and the judges that 
it is the people in this House who make the laws.  We are going 
to bring in some tough laws to solve the drug problems and the 
child prostitution problems in this country because they are 
going to affect more and more people and it will not be very 
pleasant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the child prostitution sector is the 
government's lack of interest in dealing with johns.  Bill C-51 
does indicate something about this by making the communication 
with anyone for the purpose of obtaining an under-age prostitute 
an offence.  This may help police to catch a few johns, but they 
will probably only get a slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party attempted through amendment in committee to 
impose a minimum penalty for johns of 30 days for a first offence 
and 90 days for a subsequent offence.  We believe this would 
reduce the demand for prostitutes as it would not be possible to 
get a discharge or a conditional sentence or otherwise avoid jail 
time as one can now.  It would have sent a message to these 
perverted people that society is getting fed up with their 
behaviour.  Again our amendment fell on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we get serious with these issues they are not going to go 
away.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the government to seriously think about what it is doing 
in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summation, Bill C-51 was a golden opportunity to begin a 
process of equity and fairness in sentencing to deal with 
organized crime figures who live off million dollar drug deals 
and to deal with child prostitution and those who prey on those 
individuals.  Instead, the government continues in an inch deep 
and a mile wide manner of tackling crime in Canada.  By the very 
nature of this omnibus bill we are reminded that this government 
likes to wait around before it moves on specific problems and 
then it deals with them by omnibus legislation because it hopes 
no one will notice or no one will care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to vote against this bill on those three issues. 
Other members of my party, including the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, will talk about other reasons and 
perhaps the same ones I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious legislation.  It deals with some of the major 
issues of our young people in Canada today.  I hope that Liberal 
members on the other side are paying attention and that they will 
convince their minister that she should speed up the process. 
The government is going to push this bill through even if it has 
to bring in closure, which will not be the first time in this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to do what we can to let the Canadian public know 
that this bill is not good for Canadians.  We hope they will get 
their messages to this Liberal minister so there can be some 
changes made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank our justice critic, the member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, for sharing his time and other members 
for allowing me to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ray Canuel, the chief of the Vancouver city police, once said 
that the justice system is not working, that the Canadian public 
does not think it is working and that we need to fix it and we 
need to fix it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 was an ideal opportunity to do just that.  Instead 
what see is another effort to nibble around the edges of serious 
problems, problems that range from child prostitution, as my 
colleague has mentioned, to issues relating to sentencing.  The 
opportunity existed and, once again, the government let it slip 
through its fingers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through a number of points to provide some 
constructive solutions that have been around for a long time, 
solutions that the government would be wise to adopt as they are 
solutions that have been adopted and pushed forth by members from 
Surrey North to Moncton and members from all political parties. 
The government would find widespread agreement if it was to take 
these constructive solutions and adopt them tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at crime in the context of resources.  We have a 
certain amount of money.  The money is limited and the demands on 
that money are rather extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some examples of resources not being available to fit 
the demand.  Many criminals, as my colleague mentioned, are being 
let out of jail early.  Criminals have been sentenced but are not 
doing any time.  The RCMP had to close down its training 
facility.  The public is not served well by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If justice is going to serve the public well we have to 
implement cost effective programs.  Perhaps the first thing that 
we can do is address the issue of crime prevention.  Nowhere in 
this bill is that mentioned, yet the statistics and the data 
conclusively demonstrate that crime prevention is not only 
effective if done well, it is also cost effective.  For every 
dollar that is invested there is a $7 saving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country today the cost of crime is roughly $46 billion, 
yet we spend a little over $15 million on crime prevention each 
year.  Contrast that with countries like Belgium, which spends 
$130 million on crime prevention, and Great Britain, which spends 
a few million dollars and the result has been a 35% drop in 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to incarcerate a young offender is between $80,000 and 
$90,000.  The cost for an adult can be anywhere from $50,000 to 
$70,000 per year.  Experiments from Ypsilanti, Michigan to the 
Hawaii head start program to the Moncton head start program have 
shown that one dollar invested saves $7 per person.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can no longer afford to give mere lip service to this issue. 
We must act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could take the best of the three programs.  If we took the 
best of the program in Moncton, the best of the program in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is the prairie preschool program, and 
the best of the Hawaii head start program, in front of us would 
lie a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we could bring together the medical community.  All women 
have to go through the medical system before they give birth.  We 
could use the nurses and the physicians to identify families at 
risk.  If we did that we could address important things such as 
fetal alcohol syndrome which is the single leading cause of 
preventable birth defects in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at those who are prison, there is an extraordinarily 
high number of individuals in jails who have been dehabilitated 
by fetal alcohol syndrome.  This irreversibly damages a person's 
brain.  They do not have the ability to integrate, learn and 
communicate with other people.  It impairs their ability to act 
in an integrated way with society.  It causes extreme frustration 
for children and can manifest later on in criminal behaviour, 
conduct disorders or worse.  It is preventable, but we have to 
start at time zero.  Head start provides that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hawaiian head start program used trained volunteers.  This 
is important because we could use women who have had their 
children, who are responsible parents and who can provide their 
expertise.  It is an extremely important way in which a community 
could build ties.  They could use this pool of experienced 
individuals to support people who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the outcome of the Hawaii program?  There was a 99% 
reduction in child abuse rates because of the trained volunteers 
who worked with families at risk.  There is no other program that 
I am aware of which provided this extraordinary benefit to 
children and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis is on working with parents.  The emphasis is on 
teaching parents the basics of appropriate discipline, setting 
boundaries, proper nutrition, love, care and compassion, the 
effects of abuse on children and how to prevent that within the 
context of the family.  These may seem very basic and simple, but 
they are essential if children are to be psychologically stable 
children, adolescents and eventually productive adults in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton program started with children early on.  The key was 
that it used parents in conjunction with the school.  The bottom 
line was that it turned parents who were having difficulties into 
good parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome was extraordinary.  It has been shown that there was 
roughly a $30,000 saving for every child.  These programs showed 
a 50% reduction in teen pregancies.  There was a 60% reduction in 
criminal behaviour and incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do these programs make sense economically, they make 
sense from a humanitarian perspective and they have been proven 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of justice in our country today is roughly $46 billion 
per year.  The amount we spend on crime prevention is 
approximately $15 million.  We need a national program.  We need 
to use it within the context of the resources that we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice can take a leadership role.  She can 
work with her counterparts in human resources development and in 
health to convene a meeting as soon as possible in Ottawa with 
her provincial counterparts.  They could determine and assess 
what works in the provinces.  They could keep what works and 
remove what does not.  They could take poorly used resources and 
put them into something that works.  If we use the existing 
resources of the medical community, trained volunteers, and a 
similar program to the Moncton head start program we would save 
this country millions of dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, it would save a lot of people's lives both in 
victims and in potential perpetrators.  The stats are there.  The 
facts are there.  The government needs to show the leadership to 
do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May I had a private member's bill calling for a national head 
start program that was adopted by the House.  This program, based 
on work done by members across party lines and the National Crime 
Prevention Council which was brought to bear as a result of an 
edict from the House in 1994, shows very clearly that the House 
will support a national head start program using existing 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just need the political will from the ministers to do this. I 
know the ministers will find support from across party lines to 
do this.  Alone we managed to get four provinces on side to 
support the national head start program. All the minister has to 
do is call together the rest of them and half the work is already 
done for her.  She can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one legacy that the government can leave that is 
positive right now it is to enact this program for the future of 
our country, in particular for the future of the children of 
today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with some issues that have not perhaps been dealt 
with.  We are talking about drugs.  Again, this bill could have 
dealt with the issue of drugs.  There are some important projects 
that have been done that can effectively reduce the serious drug 
problems we have. In Vancouver we have hundreds of people 
overdosing and dying every year as a result of the drug problem. 
Children are taking drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at existing programs that have worked.  Let us look 
at the Geneva experiment.  After the needle experiment that 
failed in Geneva in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it rethought 
what it could do.  The Geneva experiment basically legalized 
drugs. It was an abysmal failure but now it has taken hard drugs, 
particularly narcotics such as heroine, and given hard core 
addicts a dosage of heroine a certain number of times every day 
at set times.  The quid pro quo on this is that individual has to 
come in and participate in drug rehabilitation programs, skills 
training.  The outcome has been remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a 50% reduction in hard core drug abusers who 
have been off drugs for at least a year.  This is a recent 
program and so therefore we do not have much beyond that to look 
at. The preliminary results are encouraging.  No other program in 
the world has worked so effectively to reduce drug abuse among 
hard core drug addicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The savings were also remarkable because there was at least a 
65% reduction in crime rates among this population of 
individuals.  Imagine if the minister were to speak to her 
counterparts in British Columbia and other provinces to at least 
adopt this in a trial program in Canada.  We know what we are 
doing now does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin with respect to those people who 
are pushing drugs, we need to have heavier penalties.  Right now, 
as my colleague from West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast mentioned, 
individuals are serving a third or a sixth of their sentence and 
being paroled.  That demonstrates to criminals that there is 
little or no penalty at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Surrey North has worked long and hard on this 
and many other issues of justice.  He needs to be listened to by 
members opposite because he has spoken so eloquently and from a 
great deal of personal experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at projects that have worked.  We do not need to 
reinvent the wheel but we need to look at projects that have 
worked, to adopt them at least on pilot projects here at home and 
look at the international experience on these.  With respect to 
pushing and trafficking, these issues have to be dealt with with 
the full force of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to address the issue of child prostitution. The 
government has an opportunity to hit those people for abusing 
children in one of the most egregious fashions possible.  This is 
not child prostitution.  This is rape and pedophelia, pure and 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals need to be hit with the full force of the law 
and this does not mean getting off with a third of their 
sentence.  This means being sentenced hard and being sentenced 
with the full force of the law. 
Programs need to be put in place to help child prostitutes get 
out of that situation and move into a life where they are not 
subjected to abuse that we cannot possibly imagine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of restorative justice and shaming procedures, 
members across the way and in this party have articulated 
experiments that have been done in some pilot projects across the 
country. This can be applied to take the financial and economic 
load off our justice system in a very important way.  It can 
provide for effective penalties that have proven in certain 
non-violent populations, in particular for juveniles to ensure 
that they will not engage in recidivistic behaviour. They would 
benefit as, most important, the victims would benefit by getting 
some retribution for the crimes that have been meted out to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Vancouver city police chief mentioned in his speech, the 
victims do not find they are being supported by the system 
because the justice system, largely because of financial reasons, 
is unable to mete out the penalties that are required for 
individuals who are committing atrocious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect what we are often doing is lumping the violent with 
the non-violent, the inveterate criminal with the first time 
offender all into the same bunch.  Many are being tossed out 
together with little retribution as part of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to divide up these two populations as and make sure 
those people who are the inveterate criminals, the violent 
offenders, the rapists, the murderers and the child abusers, are 
put behind bars and will receive the full force of the law and of 
course engage in the appropriate rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who are non-violent or first time offenders, 
juveniles in particular, can engage in issues such as restorative 
justice which in British Columbia, for example, has proven to be 
highly effective not only by keeping people out of jail but, most 
important, by decreasing the recidivism rate and ensuring that 
victims receive some retribution for the crimes that have been 
meted out to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of victims rights the government had another 
opportunity to pursue and adopt solutions that the Reform Party 
has been pushing for for a long time, to make sure victims have 
an important role to play in the justice system. Right now, 
although victims represent half the situation in crimes, they 
play a very small role in what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a slap in the face to those who have been violated, 
sometimes in horrendous ways, that they are second class citizens 
within our justice system.  They are not treated as the important 
persons they should be within the justice system which should 
first be seeking to protect them, provide retribution to them, 
provide restoration to them and provide help to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many cases where the perpetrator has been convicted 
and receives all kinds of help.  Yet the victims are left 
dangling in the breeze to fend for themselves. What a sad 
situation if one knows those individuals or those families and 
the pain and suffering they have to endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much that can be done within our justice system.  There 
is little that has been done with respect to Bill C-51.  Instead 
of dealing with issues such as whether we should remove the 
prohibition on dice and gambling on cruise ships, whether we can 
use wiretaps in the case of certain crimes and whether we remove 
sentencing from one sixth to one third of a sentence, the justice 
system and the members responsible on the other side should have 
used existing solutions and adopted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House have a responsibility to the people who elected 
us.  We have a responsibility not to nibble around the edges of 
problems but to take those problems in both hands and find the 
best solutions we can, the most pragmatic solutions, solutions 
that have worked not only in Canada but around the world, 
solutions that are cost effective and do the job and adopt those 
solutions here if only in pilot projects. 
Why wait to dot the <I>i</I>s and cross the <I>t</I>s?  Why not 
implement those programs in Canada?  Then we can see whether they 
will work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to again speak to Bill C-51.  As my colleagues have 
had the opportunity to examine this omnibus bill in the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, I will devote the time 
allocated to me to raising certain aspects covered by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to take a few moments to make a 
progress report on the work in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech at second reading, my Bloc Quebecois colleague 
from Berthier—Montcalm placed heavy emphasis on the importance of 
committee work.  He indicated that, when analysing an omnibus 
bill, parliamentary institutions needed to be efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often, committees fall victim to obstruction by the party in 
power.  I have some knowledge of this, for I sit on the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.  We are aware that the 
government and the Liberal MPs sitting on this committee do not 
want us, first of all, to address the impact of the Employment 
Insurance Act.  In fact, the opposition parties have formed a 
strong coalition calling for an emergency debate on the impact 
of the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with my colleague, the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, I 
deplore the fact that there is systematic obstruction by the 
Liberal MPs who sit on the committee.  When an omnibus bill is 
what is being studied, a bill as complex and detailed as this 
one, one may well wonder about the quality of work that is going 
into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I described this omnibus bill as a tutti frutti bill when I 
spoke on it for the first time.  It contains a number of 
amendments to the Criminal Code. It is a bill that goes in a 
number of different directions and affects a number of different 
aspects of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the sessions of the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights on Bill C-51 went off very well, according to 
what my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm says. 
Despite the committee members' rejection of the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois—I will return to this point 
later—we did enjoy some healthy discussions on the amendments 
proposed by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal MPs must not have any illusions, however.  As I have 
said, committee work is too often obstructed.  We ought to 
reflect upon the necessity of calling meetings when the dice are 
inevitably loaded in advance, when there are foregone 
conclusions.  Consensus in committee is a rarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are discussions, of course, but the outcome is known in 
advance.  The government rarely makes use of the recommendations 
made by the various parties, particularly when the opposition 
parties have reached a consensus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very rare for the party in power to adopt suggested 
directions, although these would often be beneficial to the 
entire population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the opposition have to roll up their sleeves and 
jump back into the fray.  I believe one has to have a hard head 
when one really believes in an amendment like the one we would 
like to see in this omnibus bill.  One has to be determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always easy to get across to the Liberal government 
that it is not on the right track. 
We are very much aware of the example the Prime Minister gives 
to his troops by his arrogant attitude and his refusal to ever 
go back on what he has said, even if it is something 
incomprehensible, as it often is, and not in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Prime Minister often sets a poor example for his 
troops, and does not show them frankly and honestly how to carry 
on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always easy to get this government to listen to 
reason, this government we would describe as arrogant.  One has 
to keep at it, sometimes even drawing a picture when that is 
what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the spirit in which the Bloc Quebecois has carried out 
the mandate entrusted to it by Quebeckers since it was first 
elected in 1993.  We have confronted the House of Commons head 
on, in order to defend the interests of Quebeckers. 
We worked exceedingly hard to move the heavy Liberal machine, 
which, as we say in Quebec, is too often asleep at the switch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Propelled by this desire to change things, very early, along 
with the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans and other 
members from the Quebec City area, we started a crusade to 
enable cruise ships to operate their casinos on the St. 
Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem banal, but this amendment will have a significant 
economic impact for the Quebec City area, as I will explain 
during the course of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruise industry represents several million dollars to our 
region.  In fact, on average, tourists each spend about $110 per 
visit. 
Given that each ship has between 1,000 and 1,500 passengers, it 
is not hard to imagine that a significant increase in the number 
of calls by these ships in our ports will have a strong economic 
impact on our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this increase will not be possible unless the needs of 
the passengers on these ships are taken into account.  At the 
moment, many of these tourists enjoy casino cruises, and casinos 
are increasingly popular with people on cruises.  In an effort 
to respond to the demand, ship owners provide casinos for their 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to now, Canadian law limited the expansion of the Quebec 
tourist industry that depended directly on the influx of cruise 
ships.  Since the Criminal Code prohibited the operation of 
casinos from Anticosti Island on, a number of carriers did not 
call in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provided that the casinos had to be closed at 
Anticosti Island and before the port of Quebec City.  This meant 
two or three days where the casinos were closed on the cruise 
ships.  So their stay was considerably reduced in order to not 
upset passengers.  The situation does not occur in international 
waters, because access to ports is direct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of this prohibition was to slow down the economic 
growth of the Quebec City region, a slowdown it did not need. 
Because of the Criminal Code provisions, the number of ships 
that stop over in Quebec City every year has dropped by about 
25.  This creates an economic shortfall of several millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that the members in the Quebec City region 
and the member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
have been waging such a battle on this important issue of being 
able to operate casinos on cruise ships.  It represents $2.5 
million in lost tourism dollars every year in the Quebec City 
region. 
This is why the industry has been after the government for so 
long to amend the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
introduced a bill in 1997 to remedy the situation.  All the 
members for the Quebec City region supported his efforts, of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the government's apathy and its refusal to take 
action, the member introduced his bill again in 1998, hoping to 
bring about changes for the economic benefit of the Quebec City 
region. 
After much pressure from the industry and from Bloc Quebecois 
members, the government finally woke up—it did not have much 
choice—and realized, after many years of listening to our 
arguments, that the situation could not go on and that something 
must be done.  It had no choice but to act or look like it was 
dragging its heels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have been hounding the government since we were 
elected in 1993, and we know that industry representatives have 
been doing the same for ten long years.  The government had no 
choice but to introduce this amendment authorizing casinos on 
cruise ships sailing on the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government has finally decided to take action, it 
must not be forgotten that its lethargy has cost the Quebec City 
region dearly.  Too many years went by before the Liberal 
machinery finally decided to do something. 
Today, we applaud this legislative change allowing gambling on 
international cruise ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other areas where the federal government's 
lethargy is having a detrimental effect. Gambling on cruise 
ships is but one example, and consideration of Bill C-51 has 
helped us identify more examples of this government's lack of 
political resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing her bill, the justice minister was proud to 
announce she was out to control the activities of organized 
crime. And then she proceeded to introduce a change to the 
accelerated parole review process under the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us make it clear that the Bloc Quebecois has 
for some time been condemning the absurdity of the accelerated 
review process. My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, repeatedly questioned the Minister 
of Justice, asking her whether she thinks it is right for a 
major drug dealer like Joseph Lagana, who laundered nearly $47 
million, to get paroled after serving only one sixth of his 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois did not simply question the justice minister 
on this issue, it also proposed solutions. Indeed, my colleague, 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg, presented a bill to amend the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act to deny high-profile drug 
dealers access to an accelerated parole review. 
The amendments proposed by the hon. member not only addressed 
organized crime, as the minister proposes in her bill, they also 
went beyond that to encompass conspiracy and money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions of the hon. member for Charlesbourg were even 
submitted to the justice committee as an amendment to Bill C-51. 
We know what happened; the Liberal majority rallied around the 
minister and refused to pass them.  This refusal is typical of 
the Liberal government's lack of courage as far as money 
laundering is concerned.  If the minister really wanted to deal 
with this dangerous problem, she would follow up on the Bloc 
Quebecois proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the recommendations were the withdrawal of the $1,000 
bill.  In our opinion, this is an extremely sensible proposal. 
What we are asking of the government is very simple: not to 
issue any more $1,000 bills. 
That would have a direct effect on money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, it will take this government a few years to 
understand, just as in the case of amendment for the cruise 
ships, that Canada is a money laundering centre.  It will take 
the government even longer to realize that having $1,000 bills 
in circulation helps the cause of money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government cannot be pushed.  It prefers a step by 
step approach.  It does not appreciate our telling it what to 
do, even when what is needed is obvious.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, which we consider arrogant, wants to seem to be 
taking initiatives, although we have long been proposing 
solutions.  Despite this strange situation, the Bloc Quebecois 
has not given up.  We will continue to ride this government to 
get it to act rather than remain complacent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have introduced private members' bills to get things moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know something about this because I myself introduced two 
private member's bills. Both were rejected by the Minister of 
Justice, even after I had devoted a great deal of effort to 
raising awareness among stakeholders.  There was a great deal of 
support for my bills, and several members here in the House were 
behind me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this situation, the Liberal government had no choice 
but to proceed, but it took all the credit. It turned it into a 
government bill and made us wait two years for the amendments to 
the Criminal Code, instead of giving credit to members who have 
the public's interests at heart. 
One amendment involved sex tourism; it would have made it an 
offence to engage in sex with children in another country.  The 
other had to do with genital mutilation of African girls who are 
now Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked very hard on these two bills and they were rejected by 
the then Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After much pressure from stakeholders and from members, the 
Liberal government finally caved in and agreed to amend the 
Criminal Code, because it had no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not about to give up. After a careful review of a 
situation, we do everything we can to bring about the amendment 
of legislation that is outdated or contrary to the public's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has the interests of Quebeckers at heart.

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this bill today. I have many remarks, some 
of which will echo comments already made by other 
parliamentarians here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by saying for those who are listening to this 
debate or who are reading <I>Hansard</I> that this is an omnibus 
bill.  That means this bill is a catch all, as has been commented 
on by other members in the House.  The bill affects not just the 
Criminal Code but other statutes as well.  It is a fairly large 
omnibus bill. Like all complex and large pieces of legislation, 
there are some good things in it and there are some things that 
cause me some concern.  The government has gone some way to deal 
with crime issues in this bill but perhaps not far enough on 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to me no coincidence that this bill comes before the House 
today at this particular hour. I was just speaking with the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who comes from the 
same province as I come from.  He is a member of the Conservative 
Party.  He and I sit on the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday this bill was not on the Order Paper but it is today. 
Ironically at this very hour the Minister of Justice is appearing 
before the justice committee to deal with the extradition bill 
and to answer questions from members of the justice committee who 
might have questions for her.  I certainly have many questions 
but of course it is difficult to be in both places at the same 
time.  Is it a coincidence that this bill comes before the House 
today so that I cannot question the minister?  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to talk about some of the aspects of the bill.  I 
do not want to be hard on the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  There is no conspiracy, Peter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I am told there is no conspiracy. I am 
told that by my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice.  I agree with her because I am sure she 
would like to be at the justice committee today as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some of the good things in this legislation, 
and there are some good things.  One is the year and a day rule 
that is changed in the Criminal Code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice has talked 
about the history of this aspect of the legislation.  It is an 
old anachronistic piece of legislation.  It is time that it was 
changed.  I think we in all parties can agree that the Minister 
of Justice by amending the Criminal Code to get rid of this 
section has done a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other good things.  Toughening the laws that deal 
with those who abuse children in the form of child prostitution 
is a good move.  I have had many conversations with colleagues in 
my party from Winnipeg, Vancouver and Halifax who see the growing 
trade in child prostitution.  We recognize that this has to be 
dealt with by tough measures in the Criminal Code.  I think the 
bill, by amending those sections that deal with prostitution, 
goes some way to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of telemarketing fraud, as technology invades all 
our lives, changes the way we work and changes the way we do 
business, it also unfortunately creates one of the enhanced 
opportunities which technology creates, the opportunity to commit 
crime in different ways.  Telemarketing fraud is one of those 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing scams are widespread.  They cost North Americans 
billions of dollars yearly and do not know any borders.  It is 
important that the changes cracking down on telemarketing fraud 
are a first step in dealing with that kind of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly susceptible to that crime are seniors and people 
who perhaps are not as sophisticated with the whole telemarketing 
system as younger people who have grown up with the technology. 
It is important that the government recognizes the people who are 
vulnerable and deals with that appropriately.  I think the bill 
does that.  I am somewhat congratulatory to the minister for 
dealing with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counterfeiting proposal has been addressed by other members 
today.  That too is a good measure.  Money laundering is a 
serious problem.  Last year I was contacted by a radio station in 
Montreal that wanted to know my opinion on the fact that Canada 
was named as a nation of primary concern by the United States 
because we were a source of money laundering.  It is not 
something that makes Canadians proud.  The government has taken 
some initiative to end money laundering and to deal with 
counterfeiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke before me 
referred to her colleague from Charlevoix.  The taking out of 
circulation $1,000 bills is a good suggestion.  I do not know why 
the government would not accept it.  It is something that could 
go some way toward stopping money laundering. Unfortunately the 
government has not accepted it.  It could have improved the 
legislation somewhat if it had done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also deals with conditional sentencing.  Conditional 
sentencing is a section in the sentencing provisions.  It is an 
opportunity to deal in a particular way with those who commit 
crime.  It ought not to be abused.  When it is abused it harms 
all those who might take advantage of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made some necessary changes to the 
conditional sentencing provisions so that when an offender is 
alleged to have breached or violated his or her conditional 
sentence and is arrested, the conditional sentence will now be 
stopped from the time of the offender's arrest until the 
conclusion of the court hearing.  That is a progressive move by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, the downside of the bill.  There are some 
things in this omnibus legislation that cause me concern.  One of 
them that we have to balance—and I am not saying it is entirely 
wrong—is the section that amends the Criminal Code to allow for 
a non-contact clause at bail hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people may know but some may not know what that means. At 
the time of arrest there is a delay between the time of arrest 
and the time the bail hearing is held to determine whether or not 
an offender is permitted to be released or whether he or she 
ought to be incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the bail hearing the judge can impose all kinds 
of conditions.  One may be that the offender have no contact with 
certain individuals.  That is a necessary protection because with 
some offenders there may be a concern that they will threaten 
other witnesses or that they will interfere with the 
administration of justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In changing the legislation the government is saying that at the 
time of arrest before the bail hearing a non-contact clause can 
be imposed.  The good side of that is that if the judge has 
concerns about witnesses being interfered with or the 
administration of justice being interfered with it gives the 
judge an opportunity to prevent that.  On the other hand, if 
there is a presumption of innocence we have to ask very real 
questions about a judge being able to impose a non-contact 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a particular area that causes me concern, that is 
the family law area.  Although this is a Criminal Code change it 
spills over into the family law.  In many cases when there are 
allegations of domestic violence or allegations of any kind of 
crime being committed, this will allow the judge to impose a 
non-contact clause which may interfere with family court orders 
that are currently in existence involving access to children, 
custody or whatever.  It is one in which we have to find a 
balance.  There are some good points to be made in favour of it 
but there are also some concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final item is the gaming provisions that have been addressed 
by other members who have spoken today.  They cause me particular 
concern.  I have to ask why gaming provisions, provisions that 
deal with people having the right to gamble on international 
cruise ships, have been lumped in with very serious changes to 
the Criminal Code.  We are dealing with child prostitution, money 
laundering and conditional sentencing.  Somewhere in between all 
these important changes are sections that deal with international 
cruise ships and the right to gamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my suggestion that those sections ought to be taken out 
of this omnibus bill and introduced on their own merit.  The 
debate concerning those is different than the debate concerning 
amendments to the Criminal Code and the criminal element.  Had 
the government done that, there may have been all party support 
for some of the very necessary changes to the Criminal Code to 
make our communities safe.  The failure of the government to do 
that makes me wonder if there is not some sleight of hand here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have real concerns about the cruise ship provisions.  The hon. 
member from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke prior to me is in favour 
of them, at least I took that from her speech.  I should put 
before the House, just to illustrate what we are dealing with, 
that I come from a community where casinos were just introduced. 
That has resulted in a large casino in the downtown core that has 
siphoned off business from many local small businesses on the 
main street:  the local restaurants, bars and entertainment 
venues.  Many of those businesses have lost their revenue to the 
casino.  The casino has hired many people.  Some of those who 
were displaced in one section have found jobs in the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will allow tourists on cruise ships to gamble 
when they are in Canadian waters.  This will have a direct impact 
on the community I represent.  Tourism is being touted by many, 
especially on the government side, as the saviour of the economy 
of Cape Breton.  We have managed to attract a large cruise ship 
industry.  It has done some economic good.  Many people on cruise 
ships come to the main street to buy souvenirs.  They take part 
in activities, attend museums and purchase goods.  They go to the 
restaurants.  However there is only so much money to go around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a real concern that by encouraging cruise ships to allow 
gambling when they are in Canadian waters—and I appreciate that 
within five nautical miles of the port they will not be able to 
do that—we are siphoning off some of the disposable income that 
might better be spent in the community where these tourists are 
destined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be absolutely frank.  The reason for having a tourist 
industry is to invite people to spend money in our communities on 
goods and services local people can produce. 
I question the wisdom in terms of economics of allowing cruise 
ships to have onboard gambling.  I questioned some justice 
department officials who appeared before the justice committee on 
this issue, as did other colleagues of mine, and I have not 
received satisfactory answers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of that gaming provision allows the provinces to 
introduce dice games.  There are people who have real concerns 
about the influence of gambling in their communities.  We know 
gambling can be an addictive form of behaviour.  We all know the 
stories of people who have gambled away their life savings in 
some situations because they could not help it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those sections cause me concern.  It would have been prudent and 
wise for the Minister of Justice to separate those sections of 
this omnibus legislation and introduce them separately in the 
House where they could be debated.  We now have to accept the 
bill in its entirety.  We can be supportive of cracking down on 
crime, making communities safer and preventing child 
prostitution.  The minister is also asking us to accept 
provisions dealing with gaming.  It would have been nobler, 
perhaps, had she separated those issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to debate Bill C-51, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  It is an omnibus bill 
that we will not be able to address in its entirety in the short 
time we have allotted.  However I will take a stab at a few 
aspects of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any bill that comes before the House respecting criminal justice 
should start from the premise that the most important thing the 
criminal justice system in Canada can do is set out a first 
principle, that the life and protection of law-abiding citizens 
and victims must be the highest priority of that system and of 
the government.  Sadly and unfortunately often times we see a 
criminal justice system that seems to stand that principle on its 
head.  I would argue that too often the rights of criminals come 
before the rights of law-abiding citizens.  We need a complete 
philosophical change, which I will discuss later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the provisions in Bill C-51 to end the 
accelerated parole hearing after one-sixth of a sentence for 
anybody who has been convicted of a crime as a gang member.  This 
raises a bigger issue, the whole idea of having automatic parole. 
As an Albertan I can say people back home feel very strongly that 
it is crazy to have a system with automatic parole.  Why have 
sentences when people are released automatically after one-third 
or two-thirds at the most?   It is crazy and unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal justice system is full of terms and language that 
mean absolutely nothing.  If people are convicted of two or three 
crimes the judge might say on the first one that they get two 
years; on the second one, three years; on the third one, four 
years.  However they will all be served concurrently and the 
effect is that they spend at most four years in jail.  It is 
really two-thirds of them because people never serve their full 
sentences.  They are out after two-thirds.  We have a situation 
where none of the language we see in the Criminal Code or in any 
provision that lays out sentencing means anything. 
It is always a complete exaggeration of the time the person will 
actually have to serve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a fundamental of the justice system when we sit down and 
consider it, we should have some assurance that it is relatively 
close to what actually happens.  If it says a sentence of five 
years and the judge metes out a sentence of five years, then 
there should be some possibility that the person will stay in 
prison for five years, but that is not the case in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with provisions that allow criminals who are 
sentenced to a life term to apply to get out of jail, the faint 
hope clause. When we say life in Canada, it does not mean life. 
It means 25 years.  It is really not life. When people are 
sentenced to 10 years, they are so-called sentenced to life. That 
is ridiculous.  With the faint hope clause we find out that the 
25 years is not necessarily going to be what they serve. 
Prisoners could be out in 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look throughout the criminal justice system we run into 
this. It is time we revised all of that.  Instead of getting a 
bill such as Bill C-51, we should go back to the drawing board 
and set up a system where a sentence that is going to be handed 
out actually has some correlation to what is served.  That makes 
sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for a fundamental change to the criminal justice 
system.  And while removing the accelerated parole hearing for 
members of organized crime may be a positive step, it really is a 
baby step.  It is a tiny step in fixing the overall problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the issue of conditional sentencing. I cannot 
say how counterintuitive this is to most people back home.  The 
government philosophy is that if one commits a crime in Canada, 
only as a last possible option would we consider putting that 
person in prison. If it can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that a person is violent and is going to reoffend, then perhaps 
they might go to jail.  Other than that, we see an increased 
reliance on the whole idea of conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing is referred to in Bill C-51.  I do not 
believe this government understands how much that provision is 
being abused. I want to emphasize that by pointing to a case in 
my own riding, in the town in which I live, Brooks, Alberta.  It 
is a long tale so I hope members will bear with me for a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People I know in the town of Brooks who run an insurance outfit 
had hired a woman to do their books for them.  They found out 
that over a period of a couple of years this person had stolen 
not a little bit of money but tens of thousands of dollars. The 
woman was eventually found out and she was convicted.  We were 
thankful for that. I think Gwen and Paul Vickers were probably 
pretty happy to find out that the system worked to that point. 
The person was convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vickers found out that the system broke down in how the 
judge meted out the sentence. The person found guilty of this 
crime received a conditional sentence.  Her name is Ms. McKennit. 
Ms. McKennit received a conditional sentence. Tens of thousands 
of dollars were taken from the Vickers.  They did get a good 
chunk of it back.  I do not think they got it all back.  Ms. 
McKennit was sentenced to a conditional sentence which 
essentially meant that she had to stay at the farm where she 
lived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with that.  The government went ahead and put 
in place the conditional sentencing without giving money to the 
provinces so people could follow up and make sure the sentence 
was actually being carried out.  Therefore, we have a situation 
in the little town of Brooks where one person has to supervise 
all the people on conditional sentence and parole. 
There is no possible way they can ensure that this sentence is 
being served out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people question right from the start whether or not it 
is a just sentence because in effect people are being sent home 
to watch television or to do whatever.  In fact during the day 
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. the person does not even have to be at 
home.  They can wander around the community and only have to be 
at home in the evening.  But there is no way to supervise that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone ahead with conditional sentencing but 
has not provided any resources to the provinces to ensure that 
the provisions of conditional sentencing are carried out.  It is 
an absolutely empty sentence because the one person who is there 
to supervise cannot possibly do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this situation before. The government effectively 
downloads in an area that is its responsibility in terms of 
sentencing but when it comes to administration it is the 
provinces'.  The provinces do not have the money and so the whole 
thing does not work.  It is toothless and completely useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be bad enough in the case where somebody who has stolen 
tens of thousands of dollars effectively goes home.  That is 
their penalty.  They go home.  A real tough penalty. That is bad 
enough, but what about all those cases, and we see so many of 
them now, where people are guilty of extraordinary violence and 
are found guilty of it?  Yet the government allows these people 
to be sentenced under conditional sentencing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are guilty in some cases of violent rape are sent 
home in the community where they raped the person.  That is their 
sentence. They do not serve one day in jail.  How can that be 
just?  That is not just in anybody's books.  But this government 
seems to think that somehow if violent rapists are sent to their 
homes, it is a just sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that it is completely wrong-headed.  It is contrary 
to natural law.  It is contrary to everybody's common sense. That 
is not a sentence.  The only sentence that is being meted out 
there is to the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleague from Abbotsford has spoken often in this 
House about a situation in his community. A young woman was 
brutally raped.  The man was found guilty and was conditionally 
sentenced to stay at home in the community. The woman lived in 
the same community and feared for her life and her safety because 
that animal was released back into the same community.  There was 
no one to supervise him.  He is sitting at home and the victim 
cowers in fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what goes on over in the justice department when those 
types of things happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another situation in my riding. A woman is living in 
absolute fear because her ex-husband will get out after 
two-thirds of his sentence.  He has written threatening 
suggestive notes in the past and has had a girlfriend monitoring 
the woman's home.  She is living in absolute fear.  She has lived 
all around the province trying to get away from this man.  He 
will be released very soon.  She is deathly afraid her life will 
be in danger, that this man is going to take her life.  I have 
sent the file over to the justice minister.  I have not heard 
anything.  This woman is living in absolute fear that she will be 
harmed and possibly killed by this man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the government sits there on its hands and 
does nothing when there are so many examples of this going on 
across the country.  We know that in many cases judges use 
conditional sentencing to sentence people who are violent, who 
are bound to reoffend.  That is so crazy.  It is so wrong-headed. 
It is contrary to everything that Canadians believe in and the 
government does nothing. I do not understand.  I wish somebody on 
the other side would stand up and enlighten us, tell us how this 
contributes to protecting the public.  I do not see it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may save a few bucks by putting people at home.  As the 
Reform Party finance critic I can say that our party is pretty 
tightfisted on a lot of things, but we would be more than willing 
to find the money somewhere within that existing envelope of 
spending where we know there is lots of waste. We would devote 
that money to putting violent criminals behind bars and to the 
greatest degree possible we would not let them out until we knew 
they were not going to commit another crime.  That is common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me very angry when I see women in my riding having to 
live in fear because this government cannot get that through its 
head.  The government does not understand the sense in that.  It 
is unbelievable it allows that to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of expanding the debate a little, I want to say how 
wrong-headed this government is and how its priorities are mixed 
up.  When the Liberals came to power, one of the first things 
they did was to push through the gun legislation. Some of the 
members who have not thought it through perhaps think it will 
somehow help with the crime problem in Canada.  Of course we 
already have had a handgun registry for a long time.  I defy 
members across the way to point to a single crime that it has 
helped prevent or solve in the last 60 years. Of course every 
time we make that challenge, they cannot rise to it because there 
are no examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will cost somewhere in the range of $140 
million or $160 million.  In B.C. the government is withdrawing 
funding for the RCMP.  The government has a chance to show that 
it is serious about dealing with the problem of crime. It could 
take the money that is being spent on a program that ostensibly 
has never worked in this country because we have tried it already 
with the handgun registry and it could give it to the RCMP. We 
could have RCMP on the beat around the clock.  They could have 
their planes in the air and their boats on the water to watch for 
smugglers of various kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge drug problem on the east side of Vancouver 
today.  We have third world rates of HIV infection there because 
drug use is so rampant.  What do we have here? We have a Liberal 
government that has decided it is much more important to medicate 
itself with the illusion that somehow this registry is going to 
solve the crime problem.  On the other hand, it denies funding to 
the RCMP who would actually do something about the crime problem. 
There is a real misallocation of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that for five years the government has been under fire 
over the Young Offenders Act.  It is five years since we came to 
this place.  We have made it an issue weekly.  We get up in this 
place and excoriate the government because it has done absolutely 
nothing about people's concerns about the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 18 months the justice minister from Edmonton, Alberta has 
said that her number one priority is the Young Offenders Act.  If 
that is the number one priority, we would hate to see the number 
two priority because she has done absolutely nothing. Here is the 
only legislation that we have received of any kind to deal with 
criminal justice in a long time.  And these are very, very minor 
changes for the most part. If her real commitment is to fix the 
Young Offenders Act, what is she waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canadians from coast to coast want that act dealt 
with and they want it dealt with now.  We propose three big 
changes over and over. This is not the Reform Party's wonderful 
idea.  It comes from the people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want young offenders, ages 15 and 16, who are guilty of a 
serious crime dealt with in an adult court.  That makes sense to 
me.  They want to see them dealt with in an adult court because 
regular people understand that the highest priority of the 
justice system is to protect the public, not to protect the 
criminals. I submit that is exactly what happens when these young 
people are allowed to be sentenced under the provisions of the 
Young Offenders Act. They barely get a slap on the wrist. We are 
saying if they do a serious crime, if they are charged with rape, 
murder, armed robbery or serious assault, those sorts of things, 
then by all means let us get them into the adult court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on the other end of the Young Offenders Act authorities 
need to have some power to deal with young persons who are 10 or 
11 years old who steal cars or start fires.  There was a 12 year 
old in Toronto who was suspected of rape a couple of years ago. 
All the police could do was catch him and release him, only to 
have him mock them on the front page of the Toronto <I>Sun</I> 
because he knew there was nothing the police could do.  The 
authorities need to have power to deal with these people, not so 
they can go to a federal penitentiary, break rocks into gravel 
and make license plates, but so they can at least get some 
counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, why are we protecting the names of young people who are 
found guilty of serious offences?  Why are we doing that?  We 
believe that the criminal justice system is there to serve the 
public, not to serve the offender.  If there is somebody guilty 
of a serious crime, a dangerous criminal, should we not know 
their name?  I think we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a common sense proposal.  I know my Liberal colleagues 
across the way have heard it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this government has its priorities standing on 
their head.  The real issue is that we have a criminal justice 
system that is there to serve the public and that puts the rights 
of law-abiding citizens and victims ahead of the rights of 
criminals.  That is completely missing in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members across the way to put some pressure on the 
Minister of Justice, who is from Edmonton, and tell her that not 
only Liberals feel strongly about this, but remind her that the 
people of Edmonton and Alberta feel extraordinarily strongly 
about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I address my question to my colleague from Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has cited many examples as to why Canadians today, with each 
passing week, are losing faith in the justice system of Canada. 
It does not matter where we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague talked about conditional sentences, parole and 
the Young Offenders Act.  Every day in some newspaper we see the 
results of a justice system that is breaking down.  Cutbacks have 
been made to the RCMP in my province and there have been cutbacks 
right across Canada, while crime is running rampant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Medicine Hat not agree that a public losing 
faith in their justice system will only amount to more and more 
crime simply because there is no punishment being meted out 
through the justice system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I absolutely agree with 
my colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke at a school the other day in Foremost, a little town in 
my riding.  I spoke to the grade 10 social class.  We talked 
about the Young Offenders Act and about the problem of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that amongst young people crime is escalating.  Some of 
the crime is extraordinarily violent.  One of the most disturbing 
trends is the increase in violent crime amongst young women. That 
is an area that the government must address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things which came out of that school visit was how 
young people are most often the victims of youth crime.  When I 
go to schools in my riding, or when I speak around the country, I 
talk about the issue of crime.  I ask grade 10 or grade 12 
students, or whatever grade they are in, “Do you think that the 
penalties in the Young Offenders Act are just right, too tough or 
too soft?”  Unfailing they say they are too soft.  The reason is 
that young people are most often the victims of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in my province the terrible case of young Ryan 
Garrioch who was brutally murdered in the schoolyard by another 
young offender.  A young man, just coming of age, lost his life 
because of youth violence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must start to take this issue more seriously.  I 
believe my friend is right.  Crime is escalating.  We see it 
amongst youth.  We have to do something about it.  It has been 
five years.  I do not understand it.  I plead with the government 
to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said for 18 months that this is her highest 
priority.  She has done nothing.  She has let the people down in 
her riding of Edmonton.  She has let the people of Alberta and 
the people of Canada down.  I entreat her and her colleagues to 
take this issue seriously.  Today many people are being 
needlessly hurt and in some cases killed.  We need to do 
something about this and I hope the government will get busy and 
do it right away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member for his comments.  They are thought 
provoking and, in that light, I have two questions which I would 
like the member to comment on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is that I have read recently that crime statistics 
are down and that the homicide rate is the lowest it has been for 
30 years in this country.  There is every indication from those 
statistics that in this country homicide rates are down.  I would 
like to have the member's thoughts on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, we have heard a number of stories, anecdotal evidence 
if you will, from the hon. member concerning cases that he has 
heard about.  I appreciate what he has told this House, but 
oftentimes I am concerned that we hear the interpretation of 
events.  We are all subject to that.  We read the headlines.  I 
wonder if he was in the courtroom for those cases and if he has 
heard the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he mentioned that homicide rates are down.  I 
believe that is a fact and it is important to note that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he will also acknowledge that youth crime has been 
increasing in this country and a lot of it is violent youth 
crime.  That causes me a lot of concern.  While homicide rates 
are down, I do not think we should allow this whole debate to go 
to sleep.  We need to continue to discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following up on that, it points to the fallacy of the 
government's argument with respect to the gun registry, that 
somehow guns are the reason we have the level of homicides that 
we have in the country.  The gun registry is yet to be put in 
place and, if I recall, homicide rates are down to a level 
equivalent to 1969.  That absolutely explodes the fallacy we 
heard from the government that the gun registry was going to be 
the thing that would cause homicide rates to go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks whether or not I was in the courtrooms.  It is a 
good question.  In the case of the Vickers family, to whom I 
referred to earlier, I was not in the courtroom.  However, I have 
carried on a long discussion with the Vickers family and also 
with the crown prosecutor through correspondence.  I have not 
talked to him directly, but I have seen his responses to the 
family with respect to some of their concerns.  The crown 
prosecutor, whom I know personally, is an extraordinarily 
intelligent crown prosecutor.  He presented a very fair case when 
he was scrutinizing for the Vickers family what had gone on.  I 
am convinced that in this case he was being nothing but 
absolutely accurate in his depiction of what happened in the 
courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I left out some of the details of this case because I did not 
want to exaggerate what had gone on.  There are a number of 
things that are being alleged that I have not mentioned simply 
because I do not want to exaggerate what happened in that 
particular case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member with great interest. However, I am always a 
little concerned when I hear members of the Reform Party address 
the issues like crime, the Criminal Code, law enforcement and 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am a Canadian citizen and, like them, I am greatly upset 
by especially despicable actions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, when I am sitting in this House and I hear members 
of the Reform Party say, as I have hear them say previously, 
“God has created men unequal. One should not interfere with 
God's established order. There are poor people and rich people, 
and that is God's will”, I think the worst place to learn 
criminal behaviour is prison. Indiscriminate imprisonment of 
anyone who has made a mistake, because they are young or maybe 
because they made one mistake, is not a solution. 
With their conservative attitude, Reformers are the ones who 
never show any compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that education should prevail. With its young offenders 
legislation, Quebec can boast about having the lowest youth 
crime rate in Canada. I realize that, low as it may be, it will 
always be too high. However, building the future on prison 
megaprojects does not ensure that we will live in free, 
democratic and safe societies, where the relationship between 
individuals is harmonious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what worries me about the Reform Party's position. Like 
all members of parliament, I agree that crime must not pay. 
Being a criminal is nothing to be proud of, that is right. But 
they failed to stress prevention and education, and stubbornly 
dig their heals in. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
raised a couple of good points.  The Reform Party does believe 
that prevention is very important and we could and should have a 
whole debate in the House with respect to that.  My colleague 
from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca did an excellent job of pointing to 
preventive measures that can be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take issue with some of the things that my colleague has 
stated.  I think that the primary purpose of the justice system 
must be to protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With some criminals, my colleague must know, it is much more 
prudent, in fact it is in the best interest of the criminal, to 
put them in prison where they cannot do harm to other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply saying that too often today we see people who are 
released from prison or who were never put in prison who should 
have been put in there.  That does not mean that we do not 
believe there should be rehabilitation.  Of course there should 
be.  But the primary purpose of the justice system should be to 
protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Reform Party position.  I am sorry if I did not make 
that very clear to my colleague. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe this bill deserves the support of parliament in large 
measure.  It is an omnibus bill and, by definition, an omnibus 
bill is a housekeeping bill and can in fact be quite tedious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A particular provision that caught my eye with respect to this 
bill was the homicide and criminal negligence provision, the year 
and a day provision, which permits prosecution even though the 
victim may have survived beyond a year and a day by virtue of the 
advances of medical science.  That makes perfect common sense. 
It makes all kinds of sense, given our present state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, may I suggest with respect to an omnibus bill that the 
devil is in the details.  I would like to, if I may, draw the 
attention of the House to one of those details, namely, gaming. 
The apparent effect of the amendment would be to amend the 
criminal code with respect to international cruise ships that are 
exempted under certain provisions of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, provincial governments under certain limited 
circumstances would be able to conduct and manage dice games 
without the heavy hand of the Criminal Code upon them. Apparently 
this has been a request put forward by both Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address this addiction by all levels of 
governments to the business of gambling.  The province where I 
come from, Ontario, raises something in excess of $2.4 billion of 
its revenues from this addiction.  This translates into 
approximately 5% of all of the revenues of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand to be corrected on my numbers but that is my 
recollection from newspaper articles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of Canada and the Government of Ontario in 
particular are heavily addicted to revenue generated by way of 
gambling.  It is certainly within my memory that this was not 
always a source of revenue for any government.  Governments have 
now become dependent on their gambling fix in order to meet the 
ever growing demands on their treasuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill facilitates that addiction and, I would argue, is not 
necessarily a public policy we should encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gambling by definition is largely a recreational pursuit enjoyed 
by a great number of people and abused by a relatively small 
number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, a parallel to the government addiction to 
revenue generated from alcohol.  Alcohol is clearly enjoyed by a 
large number of people and abused by a small number of people. 
However, in the decriminalization of that activity, we have 
diffused the criminality associated with the consumption of 
alcohol from the streets of Chicago in the prohibition days to 
the streets of all our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that if any member asked a police officer what is the 
greatest contributor to crime in our society, that police officer 
might well answer the criminality associated with the consumption 
of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect that we intend, mainly the reduction in criminality 
with respect to the illegal disruption of alcohol, has been 
replaced with criminality of other forms, mainly drunk driving, 
spousal assault, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the decriminalization of any activities, society in general 
and governments in particular frequently do not calculate the 
bottom line, cost to the populace, while they merrily rake in the 
revenue from the activity.  This is most readily observable in 
the revenues generated from alcohol and probably less observable 
in the revenues generated from cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would submit that the revenues that are generated 
from both those activities do not go back into serving the 
populace that has the addiction by virtue of the ready 
availability of those products.  In other words, revenues raised 
in alcohol and cigarettes far exceed government expenditures for 
those members in society who become addicted to those products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a perverse way, governments become the handmaidens in the 
addictions of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that governments should not be participating in 
creating addictions among their citizens.  I would argue that 
there is a parallel being developed here.  As governments 
decriminalize certain activities they create a dependency in a 
certain portion of the populace and that dependency is not 
compensated by making those revenues generated by the 
decriminalization available to those who are addicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore governments in general and particularly the Government 
of Ontario become handmaidens in the addiction while not giving 
any hand with respect to the help for the addiction. This is in 
my view a rank form of hypocrisy and bad public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not permit me to give example after example of 
individuals and families ruined by their addictions to these 
social pastimes.  I would further argue that the hypocrisy of 
government cuts out its high moral ground of leadership and in 
fact erodes its ability to lead the populace in directions for 
society which are good directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may be permitted a small illustration, prior to becoming a 
member of parliament I was on the board of an organization called 
Christian Indigenous Development Overseas.  The concept was 
relatively simple.  We lent money to micro enterprises in third 
worlds.  We lent money to people who had no security.  We lent 
money to the people who were the poorest of the poor.  We had 
projects in the Philippines, in Columbia and in Jamaica, and no 
sensible banker would ever lend money to these folks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our message, however, was quite simple. If you work hard, if you 
are an honest person, you will succeed. 
When we started this project we were assisted by CIDA and by the 
Wild Rose Foundation of Alberta.  For every dollar we raised our 
funds were matched somewhere in the order of three to four 
dollars.  It was a very successful formula and widely 
acknowledged as a good use of resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Wild Rose Foundation decided to generate its 
revenues in part from gambling activities.  As a funding 
organization we questioned whether we could receive funding 
generated from gambling activities.  It seemed to us that we were 
being hypocritical.   How could we use the funds that were 
generated in a somewhat less than honest way from something other 
than hard work and then give the funds to people who were 
desperately in need and to whom we were giving the message work 
hard, be honest and you will succeed? We felt we were being 
hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Wild Rose Foundations declined to withdraw from 
gambling activities we felt we had no alternative but to withdraw 
our request for funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we felt we were being hypocrites, this bill puts an 
additional layer of hypocrisy on all governments.  There has been 
virtually no debate with respect to the larger social policy 
issue.  While I support the bill and will in the end vote for the 
bill, it is my view that the social policy issue needs to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addictions of governments to revenues generated from these 
kinds of sources versus the benefits to society affected by the 
decriminalization of these kinds of activities is a broad social 
debate and one that is ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I suggest that an analogous ground might well be to how 
corporations prepare the balance sheets. Frequently the picture 
of a business generally on a balance sheet is quite limited.  One 
has assets, one has liabilities, one has income and one has 
expenses.  What the environmental movement is teaching us is that 
there is more to the bottom line than what appears on a balance 
sheet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the analogy is appropriate here.  There is more 
to the bottom line than what appears on the balance sheet. We do 
not know what social damage is caused by our governments' 
addition to these kinds of revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that in gambling we do not put on to the bottom 
line the actual cost.  We do not know what the impact of gambling 
is on the populace at large and the cost it has to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To carry the analogy further, government similarly has a 
balance.  It has revenues and expenses.  I will not get into 
assets and liabilities because there the analogy really breaks 
down because of the way governments count assets and recognize 
liabilities.  However, we do not really know what the social 
costs or the welfare costs or the addiction costs are to society. 
It certainly only minimally impacts the bottom line of 
governments but it does impact us all in society. It hits 
society's bottom line but it does not hit governments' bottom 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I will support this bill because there is a lot of 
good work in it and it tightens up areas that need to be 
tightened, but the whole area of gaming needs to be addressed by 
parliament.

Speaker, I want to pay tribute to the member. He has spoken very 
well.  He has spoken to the point that Canadians very often would 
like an answer.  On this bottom line the member has mentioned, we 
fail to take a look at it.  When someone makes a study, they do 
the revenues from cigarettes, revenues from alcohol, revenues 
from gambling, but no one really puts a price tag on the results 
of these commodities within society, how much they cost the 
Department of Health, how much they cost the social structure 
with family breakdown and so on.  We should be as a government 
taking a look at the bottom line.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel that the bottom line with regard to revenue 
more often than not generally clouds the real issue, that society 
does not see it as such and that we have a hard time dealing with 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
good question.  It is not something to which I have an immediate 
answer.  If governments back away from these addictions, these 
sources of revenue, other problems will spin out.  The classic 
example is that of mafia activity in these areas because they are 
so lucrative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know that there is not another way to deal with those 
issues.  The difficulty is correlating the 
family-social-individual breakdown to the availability of these 
products and activities and their decriminalization.  I am being 
perfectly candid. I do not have that answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental movement has recognized this.  A Harvard 
professor has recognized that damage to the environment can be 
quantified. If Kyoto is anything, it is nothing other than a 
glorified accounting system so those kinds of issues can be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why good thinking people could not arrive at some 
sort of accounting system that would bear some similarity to the 
quantification of environmental damage.  How could we quantify 
damage to individuals, society, families, et cetera, over that 
portion of time?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
criminal justice is very important to Canadians.  I would submit 
to the member that Bill C-51 is hardly a burning priority for 
most Canadians. His minister has had 18 months to bring forward 
changes to the Young Offenders Act.  Could he tell us why, if 
that is her number one priority, we are still waiting 18 months 
later? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the 
speech of the hon. member.  It had precious little to do with 
Bill C-51.  He seemed not to be interested in addressing the 
issues raised by Bill C-51.  In particular he did not address the 
two issues I raised.  He did not address some of the more 
profound social issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the specific issue of when the legislation will be 
introduced, that is well within the prerogative of the minister. 
She has generated fairly substantive support based on a report 
from the justice committee.  I expect to see that drafting in a 
timely fashion, as she would say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member who seconded this 
motion which does not reflect a new request.  The Canadian Urban 
Transit Association and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
have been lobbying for this policy change for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 they were joined in their quest by the Amalgamated 
Transit Union Canadian Council, the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
Ontario Lung Association and Pollution Probe.  These groups 
together have now formed a national task force to promote this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not give special mention and 
recognition to the two project managers for the national task 
force, Amelia Shaw and Donna-Lynn Ahee.  These two individuals 
turned this initiative into a national grassroots campaign.  I 
speak from personal experience when I say that if anyone had the 
opportunity to meet with these two exceptionally committed people 
they could not help but be convinced of the absolute need, the 
extreme importance and the widespread support for this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all pay tax on our earnings.  Some benefits we receive from 
our employer must also be declared as income and are therefore 
income taxable.  Employer provided parking and employer provided 
transit passes are both examples of benefits that are considered 
taxable under the federal Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Revenue Canada's interpretation of this act provides 
loopholes allowing most employees to receive their free parking 
income tax free.  Workers with this benefit save approximately 
$1,722 annually.  This is an incentive for commuters to drive and 
represents a significant loss of income tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can address this bias by making employer provided 
transit passes an income tax exempt benefit.  This change would 
provide a rare opportunity for the federal government to 
seriously affect public policy at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say, if nobody in the House minds, that employer 
provided tax exempt transit passes is a form of linguistic 
juggling so I will refer to it by the acronym many of its 
supporters use, TEI 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States TEI became available under the deficit 
reduction act, 1984, and the tax reform act, 1986.  While both 
the amounts and the manner in which a transit subsidy could be 
offered were limited, transit use increased on average 25% among 
employees offered this benefit.  Obviously it was a significant 
change in emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In San Francisco, for example, transit use among participating 
employees increased by 31%, removing an estimated 17 million 
vehicles miles from the Bay area, avoiding 61 million tons of 
pollutants and generating $1.6 million of new transit revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently American highway policy legislation known as the 
ISTEA bill is expected to further promote the use of public 
transit.  Employers will be able to offer up to $100 per month of 
transit benefits and some of the barriers that discourage many 
employers from participating have now been eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only OECD nation where the national government is 
not involved in funding urban transit.  Why should the government 
be interested in promoting public transit?  Because, by almost 
every measure, transportation in Canada is heading on an 
unsustainable path.  Transportation is the largest single sector 
source of Canada's carbon emissions at 32%, accounting for 30% of 
energy used and 65% of all petroleum consumed.  Half these 
emissions occur by cars and light trucks in cities where public 
transit is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation emissions are expected to rise 52% between the 
years 1991 and 2020.  If we are serious about reducing our 
greenhouse gas emissions we must find a way to promote the use of 
public transportation.  Making employer provided transit passes a 
tax exempt benefit would be a good first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we will face 
a long term set of consequences.  No Canadians have been able to 
escape the consequences of global warming.  In Canada our average 
temperature for the first six months of 1998 was 2.7° above 
normal and 5° above normal in parts of the Northwest Territories. 
Our first eight months have been the hottest in 600 years.  We 
are beginning to see the impact our actions in urban settings are 
having on ourselves and on our rural neighbours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all shocked by the graphic images of the devastation 
that occurred as a result of the floods in the Saguenay and 
Winnipeg.  The cleanup of the ice storms that hit eastern Ontario 
and Quebec has cost more than both floods with rural communities 
and farmers bearing the brunt of the disaster.  The frequency of 
hail storms in Calgary has increased from one every four years in 
the 1980s to two every year in the 1990s.  There has been a 
twofold increase in Canadian forest fires and pest outbreaks to 
the cost of $210 million each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 10% to 30% reduction in crop yields across the prairies is 
being predicted by Environment Canada's environmental adaptation 
research group.  The range of disease carrying insects, in other 
words the number of Canadians contacting malaria in foreign 
countries, has doubled.  In 1998 a Toronto woman became the first 
Canadian to contract malaria from a local mosquito.  We have yet 
to examine the cost of introducing new diseases to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are quickly realizing the seriousness of the challenge 
before them.  Any incentive encouraging the use of public 
transport is an important step in our struggle to meet the Kyoto 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same increases in auto use that have profoundly contributed 
to our greenhouse gas emissions also affect Canadians locally 
both in terms of health and the infrastructure needed to support 
vehicular use.  Despite tighter vehicle emissions regulations and 
reductions in some pollutants, smog increased by 20% over the 
past decade in Canada largely because of an increase in the 
number of vehicles and the distance these vehicles were driven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport made this observation in a recent 
address in the city of Toronto: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You don't need to see the seat belt sign to know you are coming 
into Toronto.  You recognize it by the brown haze of smog. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein is a very telling tale.  As we approach most significant 
urban areas of our country we are well aware of the advancing 
city by the haze hanging over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation related air pollution is particularly harmful to 
people at risk, meaning young children, the elderly and those 
with asthma or chronic lung and heart disease.  Hospitalization 
for young Canadian children with asthma increased 28% among boys 
and 18% among girls between the years 1980 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In greater Vancouver, part of the world with which I am most 
familiar, air is killing 900 people each year.  Air pollution 
wipes out 2,100 people across the province of British Columbia 
and 16,000 people across Canada each year.  For each death 100 
more received expensive medical treatment.  If nothing else, 
these statistics speak for themselves.  We are dealing with a 
major killer component in our environment as a result of 
pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments are struggling in their own ways to 
deliver the health services required by our aging population 
while preventable pollution related illnesses escalate.  Hundreds 
of millions of dollars can be saved by reducing smog.  TEI is a 
proven incentive to get many people from using their cars and 
back into public transit of one kind or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities have been asking for this tax exemption for many 
years to promote their public transit systems.  In the greater 
Toronto area commuter growth of 50% is expected within the GTA 
and 100% outside the GTA in the next 25 years.  I think we all 
agree that with every visit to the greater Toronto metropolitan 
area we are reminded of the increasing traffic flow in that part 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to acknowledge that traffic congestion increases the 
travel time required by individuals, vehicle costs, pollution of 
the area, and demand for parking and other forms of vehicular 
infrastructure.  Improving transit service is a less expensive 
alternative than adding lanes, widening bridges and 
intersections, and increasing parking availability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton estimates that 
taxes devoted to transportation will triple if it cannot achieve 
its target to reduce rush hour car traffic.  Municipal 
governments do not have the resources, that is the taxes, to 
maintain and expand their transportation infrastructure.  In many 
cities such as Vancouver and Montreal expansion of highway 
systems is limited by geographic location.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can no longer afford to support indefinite increases 
in automobile use.  Implementing the TEI would provide the 
incentive necessary for many commuters to switch to a mode of 
transportation with lower costs to society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard several comments being made as an excuse for 
inaction on this suggestion.  It would cost too much in revenue 
loss.  There would be a perceived inequity between those using 
public transport and others.  There is the question of whether or 
not taxation is an appropriate or an effective tool to motivate 
people's behaviour, the question about subsidies to public 
transportation, and the question about it setting a precedent for 
excluding other benefits from taxation.  I would like to take a 
moment or two in the time remaining to address each of these 
major concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we afford the revenue loss?  The Canadian Urban Transit 
Association estimates revenue loss to be between $18 million and 
$28 million based on U.S. data that 10% of employees will be 
offered $40 per month as the average benefit.  This is potential 
loss as few Canadian employers currently provide transit passes. 
Real losses can only occur when employers substitute transit 
benefits for currently taxed wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transit benefits are generally cheaper to provide than parking 
benefits.  Employees who trade a parking spot for a transit pass 
increase their employer's taxable corporate profits or their own 
taxable income.  This would result in a new tax revenue.  A net 
gain is expected with higher modal shifts to transit.  As well, 
for reasons previously cited it could save hundreds of millions 
of dollars in health care and municipal infrastructure costs 
should the TEI be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one taxpayer.  As we all know, an investment from 
one level of government that results in reduced cost or new 
revenues at other levels of government ultimately benefits the 
individual taxpayer.  We cannot afford any further inaction in 
this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this create inequities within the tax system?  Some equity 
concerns provide a convenient although rather ludicrous argument 
in my judgment.  I have heard critics say that allowing this 
income tax exemption would be unfair to employees with bosses 
that would not provide this benefit.  I cannot believe that any 
Canadian thinks it is unfair that different jobs pay different 
wages and benefits even though we may be underpaid for the work 
we do as a rule.  What Canadians think is unfair is 
discrimination, when an employer is paying a different wage or 
benefit to two employees at the same company doing exactly the 
same job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-two per cent of Canadian commuters enjoy free or heavily 
subsidized parking while less than five per cent pay income taxes 
on this benefit.  Co-workers without a car receive no comparable 
benefit.  Tax losses from this benefit are estimated at $260 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000, 80% of the Canadian population will live in 
urban centres with access to public transportation.  Incentives 
that result in increased public transit use benefits all transit 
users, lower income families, women, students and the elderly, by 
increasing transit revenues and transit service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All taxpayers benefit from decreased congestion.  They also 
benefit from health care savings, reduced infrastructure costs 
and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  Very few tax policies 
impact so favourably on so many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair that cuts to transit service have occurred in order 
to deal with unstable funding.  It is unfair that low income 
families have been left with less access to educational and job 
opportunities simply because they do not own a vehicle.  It is 
grossly unfair that hospital emergency rooms fill on “smog” 
days with young children who cannot breathe properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would TEI be an effective and appropriate tool for increasing 
transit ridership?  Taxation is already effectively used to 
manipulate behaviours.  We increase taxes on alcohol and 
cigarette use.  We give tax credits to oil companies for land 
reclamation costs.  We allow tax deductions for charitable 
donations, political donations and RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States this tax exemption is a proven incentive to 
increase transit use.  The Department of Finance, quoting the 
U.S. general accounting office study, concurs that ridership will 
increase about 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the greatest benefit of TEI is its potential to interact 
with other transportation demand management measures to increase 
the effectiveness of both.  While local and provincial 
governments can develop transit systems and control land use, 
fiscal incentives are essential to maximize the results.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Victoria Institute for Transportation Policy, a research 
facility in British Columbia, suggests that any transportation 
demand management policies implemented at the local and 
provincial level will be approximately 20% less effective without 
this incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question is transit properties constantly hear that 
higher excise taxes on gasoline and substantial subsidies from 
provincial and local governments currently favour the use of 
public transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most provincial subsidies have been slashed. When they did 
exist, the hidden subsidies of car drivers almost equalled per 
passenger per kilometre the more visible transit subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our taxes pay for road construction, road maintenance, policing, 
health care for pollution areas and accidents.  Car drivers tend 
to travel more miles than transit users which increases their 
individual subsidy substantially.  A 1993 study showed that 
Ottawa-Carleton residents paid $425 annually to support each car 
user and only $121 to support transit users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department is concerned that promotion of this 
initiative would be precedent setting.  The red book claimed a 
Liberal government would establish a framework in which 
environmental and economic policy point in the same direction. 
What better way to green the hill then to provide our employees 
with transit passes in lieu of parking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need many precedent setting strategies to fulfill our Kyoto 
commitment to combat climate change and to reduce traffic 
congestion.  Implementing the TEI would be a sign of good faith 
that this government is interested in working toward a 
sustainable economic future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing congestion, pollution and the environmental and health 
impacts requires a number of strategies.  One easily 
implementable first step the federal government could take is to 
make employer provided transit passes an income tax exempt 
benefit.  This is a win-win situation.  Implementation requires 
only a policy change from the federal government.  It is the 
responsibility of individual transit properties to successfully 
market this service.  Potential revenue losses are an 
insignificant investment compared to the long term social, 
economic, environmental and health benefits of supporting 
sustainable transportation use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that both the Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce 
and the Toronto Board of Trade are now calling on the government 
to allow this tax exemption to proceed.  Businesses are voicing 
their concern over the impact and high cost of congestion.  This 
is viewed as an important demonstration of the government's 
commitment to achieving emission reduction targets.  We need 
proactive policies providing long term savings and avoidance of 
tax impacts as we plan our society for the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supporting public transit is not solely a transit issue.  It is 
a health issue.  It is a social issue.  It is a pollution issue. 
It is an environmental issue.  It surely is an economic issue as 
well.  It is a solid foot forward in the battle to meet our Kyoto 
obligations.  It makes sense.  It is cost effective.  It has 
proven to be effective in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot agree to provide an incentive for Canadians to use 
public transportation when so many groups and organizations are 
supportive and we have no clear opposition, how will we ever be 
able to make that much bolder and controversial step necessary to 
create a sustainable future?  It is time to make employer 
provided transit passes as tax exempt benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to stand today to discuss the issue of whether the 
government should consider making employee provided transit 
passes an income tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my many years in municipal politics I supported this 
position. As the president of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities I lobbied the government on this very point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way talks about the support of the FCM and 
the Canadian Urban Transit Association. There is no question that 
the government should consider the motion proposed by my hon. 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development has stated that it is incumbent on the 
government to ensure that environmental policy is not hampered by 
fiscal policy.  It is unfortunate that at the moment Canada has 
not joined other industrialized countries such as the United 
States and several countries in western Europe in making employee 
provided transit passes a non-taxable benefit. 
Under current federal income tax policy, employer provided 
parking benefits are officially taxable, but most employees 
qualify for exemptions.  Employer provided transit passes are 
fully taxed, providing an estimated $570 per year federal tax 
advantage to the average automobile commuter.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of an urban parking space and GST avoidance result in 
an average $1,726 annual financial incentive to commute by 
automobile rather than public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who live in the greater Toronto area or the 
Vancouver area or in Montreal, we certainly know the impact of 
congestion of automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would assist in our Kyoto commitments. It has been 
estimated that as many as 300 million kilometres annually of 
urban automobile travel within 10 years would be eliminated if 
this proposal were adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been estimated that it would reduce by 35% the 
expected growth in peak period travel in our major urban centres. 
We would save billions of dollars in road construction costs as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also prevent tens of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse 
gas emission.  Clearly the battle to deal with reducing C02 
emissions is going to occur in our cities.  Therefore this 
proposal will assist in that reduction to meet our commitments, 
those targets at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would relieve traffic congestion, thereby reducing 
transportation costs.  It would enhances economic efficiency.  No 
doubt it would lead to a reduction in health costs and fewer 
respiratory related illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current taxation policies favour the automobile over public 
transit.  Let me elaborate.  We could amend the Income Tax Act so 
that employer contributions toward employee transit commuting 
expenses are not treated as a taxable benefit.  Alternatively, 
the same effect could be achieved by the Ministry of Finance at 
the administrative level publishing a statement of regulations in 
an interpretation bulletin.  In either case employers could pay 
some or all of the cost of employee transit commuting expenses 
without listing them on employee T-4 tax forms as taxable 
benefits and employees would pay no income tax on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal has the support of the Canadian Urban Transit 
Association, the Transportation Association of Canada, the House 
of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development and the national round table on the environment and 
the economy.  I had the pleasure of participating in that round 
table when I was president of the FCM in November 1996. The 
climate change task group of the national air issues 
co-ordinating committee also supports it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making transit benefits tax exempt leverages a much greater 
value by giving employers an incentive to offer such benefits.  A 
typical transit benefit would total $480 per year plus $182 in 
tax exemption for a total benefit of $662. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience in other countries such as the United States and 
western Europe indicates that many employers would offer transit 
benefits if they were tax exempt.  This is an effective strategy 
for increasing transit commuting, particularly for communities 
that develop other incentives for transit use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason transit benefits are tax exempt in most other 
developed countries.  Several European countries provide tax 
credits to employers or employees for transit pass purchases. 
U.S. income tax law exempts up to $65 worth of employee transit 
benefits per month, about $88 Canadian, although it would be a 
little higher now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transit benefits can take various forms.  Employers could give 
free monthly transit passes, tickets, tokens or transit fare 
vouchers including bus, rail, ferries and form van pools, but not 
car pools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States transit benefits typically average $20 to 
$30 U.S. per month or about half the full price of a transit 
pass.  Employers typically offer transit benefits to an employee 
who agrees to commute by transit at least a few days a month. 
The results of a transit benefit tax exemption are that transit 
voucher programs are being established in many major American 
cities. Transit vouchers are produced by transit agencies or 
independent firms and they are equivalent to a money order or a 
cheque that can only be used for purchasing transit passes or 
tickets. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, an employee might receive a $30 voucher with his 
or her monthly paycheque.  They may pay the balance, perhaps 
another $30, to purchase passes or tickets from any local transit 
agency. These programs are popular because they minimize 
employer administrative costs and they allow one instrument to 
be used in an area with multiple transit companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this proposal clearly has merit.  This proposal, as 
the hon. member indicated, should be considered.  We need to look 
at those benefits and say that fiscal policy should not hamper 
good public policy in terms of improving and encouraging public 
transit, improving our environment and improving the overall 
health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest current federal tax policy is both economically 
inefficient and unfair because it provides automobile commuters 
with a valuable benefit that is unavailable to other modes.  This 
policy is at cross purposes with municipal, provincial and even 
federal transportation objectives to develop a more efficient and 
sustainable transport system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, federal income tax exemptions have a significant 
leverage effect.  They induce employers to provide benefits that 
meet exemption criteria and as a result most Canadian employers 
are offered parking benefits but virtually none are offered 
transit benefits.  The total value of untaxed parking benefits 
represents $1,726 in annual economic incentive to commute by 
automobile rather than by public transit.  We need to look at 
this and we need to take action.  I hope the House will consider 
the motion and support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on Motion No. 360, put so 
eloquently this evening by my colleague from Kamloops, that in the 
opinion of the House the government should consider making 
employer provided transit passes an income tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I sincerely commend my colleague from Kamloops for 
his very thoughtful presentation and initiative.  He has brought 
before us a very considered approach to providing an incentive 
for a responsible transportation policy which would have a 
positive impact on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is refreshing to find that the first government speaker 
following the member from Kamloops was not the obligatory 
parliamentary secretary standing up to read a speech written by 
bureaucrats opposing a good initiative from a private member.  It 
is encouraging to see that pattern broken this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am open to supporting this motion, but I have several 
significant concerns which I will outline and which I hope my 
hon. colleague will have an opportunity to respond to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My principal concern is that tax policy should be neutral.  One 
of the guiding principles of good sound tax policy should be 
neutrality and we ought not to design the tax code as a lever of 
social engineering.  We ought not to try to force or create false 
incentives for people to act in a way we think is desirable.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do so is really beyond the principal purpose of the tax 
system which is simply to raise revenues in the most efficient 
way possible to finance the needs of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a tax system free of exemptions, deductions and 
credits of the nature proposed this evening, I prefer one which 
is much lower overall, with much more generous basic personal and 
spousal exemptions which in effect would allow people to make 
decisions about how they spend their money and conduct their 
lives by themselves, according to their own priorities and not 
the priorities of politicians and bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a deep theoretical reservation to supporting initiatives 
of this nature.  I was the only member of my party to vote 
against a private member's bill which came before us earlier this 
year from my hon. colleague from Portage—Lisgar to allow for the 
deductibility of mortgage interest payments on principal 
residences.  While this would have been an enormously popular 
incentive for people to invest in home ownership, it occurred to 
me that it would have been an enormous addition of a complex, 
special credit in the tax system which would make it even more 
costly to administer and would again create these kinds of false 
incentives rather than letting people face a completely neutral 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I opposed the motion for mortgage deductibility then and that is 
why I have some serious theoretical concerns with this kind of 
exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much prefer to completely overhaul the Byzantine, 1,300 
page Income Tax Act which we have constructed in this parliament 
over the past 80 years since the temporary Income Tax Act of 1917 
by adopting some kind of simple, pure, clean, neutral, flat or 
single tax similar to that proposed by the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood in his various versions of a single tax or 
in some of the propositions for a flat tax offered by members of 
my own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of tax reform would allow Canadians to decide whether 
or not they are going to use their after tax income on transit 
passes, on parking or on other priorities.  It would not create a 
government incentive for social engineering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other questions that relate to other potential objections 
that I hope the hon. member will have a chance to respond to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs to me that the adoption of employer provided transit 
passes and the tax exemption thereon would create an inequity 
between those who have these transit passes provided by their 
employers and those who do not have such a privilege, those who 
by circumstance of their employment agreements have to pay for 
their transportation costs individually through after tax 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this would weight the playing field and 
reduce the neutrality of the tax system in favour of some 
taxpayers who happen to have employers who subsidize their 
transportation against those who would end up having to pay after 
tax dollars for their transportation.  That is the kind of 
inequity that arises when we play with the neutrality of the tax 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned with the cost issue.  The national task 
force to promote employer provided, tax exempt transit passes 
estimates, in its very thoughtful submission to the House of 
Commons finance committee, that the potential gross loss in 
federal revenue through this measure would be between $18 million 
and $28 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contradicts quite significantly the estimate made by the 
Department of Finance which suggests that the cost to the public 
treasury in reduced revenues would be as much as $140 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any of us in this House are capable of examining 
in detail the assumptions used in these competing estimates, but 
there is such an enormous disparity between the $18 million 
estimate and the $140 million estimate provided by the Department 
of Finance that I think before we support this motion we really 
ought to have a clearer and better answer to the question of how 
much potential revenue we are prepared to forgo through the 
adoption of this exemption.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that there is another potential inequity, in 
that many millions of Canadians do not live in urban areas and do 
not have access to or need major transit systems and would not 
use a bus or a subway system.  I can imagine many people who 
drive to work through necessity, whether they live and work in 
the suburbs, in smaller towns or in rural communities.  These are 
people who have to pay for their own personal transportation 
costs through after tax dollars.  It seems to me, again, 
inequitable to suggest that only those who live in major urban 
centres and have access to major urban transit systems would get 
a special tax exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reasons I would like to reserve judgment on 
this motion, although I am very open to supporting it.  I hope we 
can get clearer information on the potential cost to be incurred 
by the treasury.  I also think that we should look more closely 
at the question of the potential inequities that this kind of 
special tax exemption would create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would call on all members to work toward a 
simpler, less costly, more efficient and more neutral tax system, 
with a much lower overall burden, which would allow Canadians 
themselves to make decisions about how they will spend their 
after tax dollars, rather than we as parliamentarians making 
those decisions for them through the adoption of special 
incentives of this nature.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed my pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak to 
Motion No. M-360 moved by the member from Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to say that the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada is very pleased to support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest why this piece of legislation has been 
brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise that the member from Kamloops utilized throughout 
the course of his speech was the need to actually address the 
serious challenge of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, a mere 11 months ago, the international community 
met en masse in Kyoto, Japan.  It was the first time that the 
industrialized nations actually met to begin setting targets and 
timelines to address the serious issue of climate change. Climate 
change is something that will ultimately affect every region in 
the world and predominately those countries situated in a 
northern climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of achieving our targets with respect to Kyoto really 
stems back to the sort of country we have.  Perhaps no other 
country in the world lives off its natural resources more than 
Canada.  We have a diverse country and with our geographical land 
mass transportation has always been a historical challenge for 
Canadians.  We also live in a colder climate.  That means that 
our economy is very energy intensive.  It is resource based and 
is also export driven.  We need to ensure that we actually find 
some initiatives that are market driven and incentive based for 
us to actually begin to address the serious issue of climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no single solution available today, and I believe well 
into the future, that will enable us as a country and the world 
community to be able to reduce our greenhouse gases.  This 
initiative is a step in the right direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get back to the motion, on the issue of climate change, 
this is a very positive and well thought out initiative. There is 
a change in the political tide to some degree because the New 
Democratic Party of Canada is advocating a tax cut.  I applaud 
the New Democrats for doing that. All individuals in this country 
are overtaxed.  Any time we provide Canadians with any kind of 
tax relief it is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address an issue that was addressed by my colleague 
from Calgary Southeast.  He was discussing whether this would be 
too interventionist from a taxation perspective.  He said that 
government tax initiatives should never have a role in society. 
I prefer broad based tax relief for Canadians.  This motion heads 
in a very positive direction and should be given some thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys and 
the Liberal member who spoke both addressed the issue of climate 
change.  The member for Calgary Southeast never mentioned the 
issue of climate change.  The member said that it would be good 
for the environment.  Yes, it would reduce emissions in terms of 
smog and other things that are harmful to human health, but he 
missed the opportunity to say once and for all that the Reform 
Party of Canada understands that climate change is a global 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal and NDP colleagues will remember that the member for 
Calgary Southwest stood in this House on the eve of the world 
community meeting in Kyoto to address this real and serious 
issue.  The member for Calgary Southwest denied there was a 
problem with respect to climate change.  He actually said that 
the science was inconclusive and that perhaps more study should 
be done.  Saying that the science is divided is the same kind of 
logic as saying that cigarette smoking is good for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are individuals who advocate a so-called meeting of the 
minds.  They ask why the two conservative parties do not have 
some kind of fusion, alliance or coalition.  But there are some 
fundamental issues that differentiate the Reform Party and the PC 
Party.  One issue is our environmental commitment and our 
understanding with respect to the big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out that transportation accounts for 32% 
of all carbon dioxide emissions or greenhouse gases within 
Canada.  Local transportation is a significant component of that 
figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not want to go forward with this?  Canadians in 
general are overtaxed.  This would encourage Canadians to use 
public transportation en masse.  It would reduce consumption of 
automobile gases and smog which would be very good for human 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member from Kamloops for his initiative and for 
saying that there is only one taxpayer.  He is right.  We spend 
billions of dollars allocating moneys to maintain our rural and 
urban highways.  This would enable us to lessen some of the day 
to day pressures on our roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to adopt this motion.  The government 
says time and time again that it is committed to early action in 
order to address the serious issue of climate change.  I would 
submit that Canadians would look for any action or at least a 
little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is that this government has still to bring in 
initiatives and aggressive tax incentives with respect to 
research and development on energy efficiency. 
The government has yet to bring in aggressive tax incentives for 
the use of renewable sources of energy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of home heating, only 1% of all homes being constructed 
in Canada today are R-2000 compatible.  There are many solutions 
out there.  The government has a role in leading the way so we 
can actually make it market driven, incentive based and get 
Canadians engaged in the issue.  Another solution is producing 
less emissions of carbon dioxide.  Public transportation would 
head us in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier Canadians are overtaxed.  I understand the 
concern is that perhaps this would favour individuals who live in 
urban areas and some individuals such as myself who reside in the 
beautiful riding of Fundy—Royal, which is very rural, and may 
not have the opportunity to use transportation en masse.  I would 
also indicate that many communities would have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding half the population lives in a suburban area just 
outside the city of Saint John.  Nearly 35,000 individuals are 
within five or six miles of the city of Saint John.  There is no 
public transportation system for individuals who would choose to 
use public transportation in terms of the bus to go into the city 
of St. John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not necessarily because of a lack of will on the part of 
our valued municipal leaders such as Mr. Bill Artiss, mayor of 
Rothesay, and Alyson Leslie Brown-Hamilton, mayor of Quispamsis. 
I do not blame it on these individuals.  They would be committed 
to public transportation if they had the critical mass to do so. 
Providing a tax incentive for more individuals to take the bus 
would be most cost effective. The people in the Kennebecasis 
Valley in my riding of Fundy—Royal could ultimately develop the 
critical mass to use a public transportation system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member opposite for the motion.  The government should 
consider making employer provided transit passes a tax exempt 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that when this initiative came across my desk I 
thought it was a provocative thought, so I enter into the debate 
with that kind of mindset.  These are interesting initiatives 
from members who are trying to address real and valid issues that 
exist in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit of a peephole reaction to creating tax 
legislation.  One is forever looking through a narrow glass and 
not necessarily getting the entire picture.  I offer this as more 
of a response than a criticism.  It does not address the fact 
that all employers do not offer transit passes.  It does not do 
anything for those people who use transit who are not employees, 
people such as seniors, students and the unemployed.  It does not 
do anything for these folks.  I am not entirely convinced that we 
can confer a certain kind of benefit on one class of citizen 
without expanding the benefit to other classes of citizen, all of 
whom are transit riders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see a proposal, if this was the kind of 
direction in which the government wished to go, where the 
benefits of using transit were readily apparent and were of some 
use to all classes of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second consideration that bothers me is the peephole 
approach to public policy.  Municipal, federal and provincial 
governments already give substantial subsidies to transit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that at this point in time approximately 
48% of transit costs are subsidized costs.  Ridership or public 
riding contributes only 52%.  This brings me to one of the more 
critical components of the argument of my friend opposite, that 
there is an implicit assumption that with this exemption 
ridership will increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not clear to me in debate or in reading his support 
materials that ridership would increase.  Again I react 
anecdotally here.  I would have thought that employees who are 
using transit already will not necessarily increase the 
ridership.  They will continue to use the transit regardless of 
whether or not they get a tax exempt benefit.  I am not at all 
persuaded that ridership will be increased.  If ridership is not 
increased, we do not achieve what we want to achieve in terms of 
harm reduction to the environment or trying to meet Kyoto 
targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to think, if this debate goes 
forward, about the issue of how he can give assurances that 
ridership will increase.  The only clear evidence at this point 
is that tax revenues will be reduced.  I do not find this 
argument to be a persuasive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all wish to reduce greenhouse gases and to meet our Kyoto 
requirements.  The linkage is not necessarily demonstrable.  The 
assumption is that cars will be taken off the road—and I hope 
that is true—by giving this exemption.  If cars are taken off 
the road our greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced and we will 
be able to meet our Kyoto requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The linkage again is not clear in my mind.  This is in some 
respects an article of faith rather than a clear evidential 
linkage.  Those are the criticisms I have of the motion.  As can 
be seen in the phrasing of my criticisms, I am not at all opposed 
to the thought or to the general direction.  I would like to 
suggest that possibly the exemption may be only one way of 
achieving the benefit the hon. member wishes to obtain.  There 
may well be better ways to achieve these laudable goals by not 
taking a kind of peephole approach to little pieces and sections 
of the Income Tax Act which in and of themselves may create 
inconsistencies that are not necessarily anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I laud the hon. member for his initiative.  As I said, 
when this initiative came across my desk I thought it was a good 
idea.  It was not one that readily yielded criticism.  I offer my 
observations to him in the form of encouragement to a fellow 
parliamentarian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on my colleague's initiative.  This is a 
very bold challenge for the government to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must highlight that my hon. colleague who has just risen and 
spoken to some of the considerations that should be taken into 
account raised the issue of the effect a transit pass exemption 
for employees would have on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned a statistic from San Francisco as an 
example.  Transit use among participating employees increased by 
31%.  This in turn generated $1.6 million of new transit revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members mentioned inequality. 
If employees were given these benefits and incentives to use 
transit as opposed to driving their vehicles it would mean the 
transit companies would have more resources and more capabilities 
to decrease the costs to the public, the unemployed, the 
students, the elderly, the people who are using the present day 
transit systems in the cities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This incentive is a challenge for this government to consider. 
Today 32% of emissions in Canada are caused by our transportation 
system.  We are per capita the second highest emitter of 
greenhouse gases in the world.  We have to correct our ways.  We 
have to readjust our way of living, our day to day urban 
lifestyle, which this incentive is directed at.  The government 
has said that we will reduce our 1990 levels of emissions by 6% 
by the year 2005.  Today we are 12% beyond that.  Add 12% to the 
6% promised and that is an 18% reduction.  But there is no 
incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not acted on greenhouse gas reductions since 
coming back from Kyoto.  It has not done anything except consult. 
It has 12 specific tables which were created by the greenhouse 
emissions secretariat.  These people are continuing to discuss 
but there is no action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has created an incentive through Revenue Canada 
which would be revenue neutral for employers.  It would be a 
major incentive for employees to consider.  If they are getting a 
benefit from their employers and then having to pay a tax portion 
of that at the end of the year, that is a disincentive.  It 
reverses the whole process and our commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to consider this motion and vote in favour of 
it. The government would then be challenged to take it back to 
the environment committee, because this is a major environmental 
initiative, or to Revenue Canada. The finance committee would 
then seriously have to look at the impact of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it should not have banked on the taxation of employer 
benefits for their employees to get to work.  A lot of these 
employees travel from suburban areas.  If we look at the 
outskirts of the capital region of Ottawa our transit system does 
not even go the airport.  Somebody in downtown Ottawa wanting to 
utilize the public transit system has to stop at the Hunt Club 
region.  Then they have to walk the rest of the way, or take a 
taxi, or hitchhike, or use emit more greenhouse gases in some 
other shape or form.  It we had employer incentives that increase 
the use of transit it would increase the extent of our transit 
system in our cities.  It would be an incentive for the employees 
and the transit systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that municipal transit associations 
and municipal authorities throughout the country would be very 
much in favour of this.  Major cities have lent their support to 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg all members to seriously consider this.  Vote in favour of 
the motion.  It deals with the conscience of the country in 
making legal commitments for greenhouse gas reductions and making 
decisions on a tax exemption our citizens truly deserve.  When an 
employer hands them a transit pass as a benefit and then asks 
them to pay taxes on top of this it is a disincentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is repealing a practice by the government to create revenue 
that is uncalled for.  It is a very small investment by repealing 
a tax revenue that could have many benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must highlight some statistics.  San Francisco employers 
passed out transit passes to their employees as an incentive and 
transit use increased by 31%.  That would mean 17 million vehicle 
miles in the bay area of San Francisco.  Pollutants were 
decreased by 61 million tonnes and $1.6 million in new revenue 
was generated for the transit system in San Francisco. The hon. 
member across the way challenged us to come up with some sort of 
example.  Those are the statistics we can come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be further time to research the issues through 
committee and I think the topic of the motion would come back 
into the House for further debate. The challenge is given to the 
hon. member who has presented the motion and he would have 
another opportunity to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that those members who are suspicious of the motion 
in terms of a tax loophole reconsider.  The benefits are beyond 
what the government can afford in terms of the greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Our cities are being challenged with the whole aspect 
of transportation and the redesigning of our lifestyle.
