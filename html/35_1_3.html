	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I have the honour to lay upon the 
table the report of the Auditor General of Canada to the House of 
Commons for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1993.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I remind hon. members that, under Standing Order 108(3)(<I>e</I>), 
this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being two o'clock p.m., the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.
<P>
	May I say a few words, more to give my colleagues 
information than anything else. I met earlier with the whips and 
through their negotiations and after discussions with me it was 
decided that we are to operate on a certain pattern for the next 
few days while negotiations are continued with the whips and 
the House leaders.
<P>
	With regard to Standing Order 31 statements it has been 
agreed that we are to begin this way: We will have nine 
interventions by the government, three by the Official 
Opposition, three by the Reform Party, and we will work in the 
independents as we go along. This will be brought forth a little 
bit later.
<P>
	As for the question period, at least for the next few days-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thought the House was going to be raucous; it 
is the gallery I have to worry about now. We are going to get that 
cleared up.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	For the next few days we are to follow, subject to negotiation 
with the whips and the House leaders, an arrangement on which 
we will come to a decision with regard to the layout of the 
question period.
<P>
	With that in mind, I am going to conduct question period on 
the basis of what we set up for this kind of situation in the last 
Parliament. We will go from here.

Mr. Speaker, I welcome you and all members of the House to a 
great job with many descriptions.
<P>
	Today as Canadians we have many great challenges facing us, 
which also means that we have many great opportunities. Let us 
be very mindful that it is our responsibility to tackle the 
challenges of today with the same dedication, determination, 
courage and foresight as those early pioneers who developed 
this great country God has given to us as a gift.
<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians it is up to us to build a human 
infrastructure into our nation in the form of human bridges of 
understanding among regions of the country, bridges between 
suffering and comfort, bridges between unemployment and 
employment, bridges among cultures based on a proud but 
humble Canadian spirit.
<P>
	As Pearl McInnis said: ``I have no yesterdays. Time took them 
away. Tomorrow may not be but I have today''. Let us work 
toward a greater Canada and a better world. Welcome to these 
new challenges.

cover the transition to competing at the international level.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the federal debt went above the $500 billion mark. 
In general, people were disappointed with the Throne Speech in 
that there was no mention of any true resolve on the part of the 
government to address with determination the issue of deficit 
reduction. The Throne Speech confirmed all of the fears about 
the threats facing our social programs.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the Throne Speech that the 
government, lacking the courage the make the hard choices that 
are necessary, has decided to reduce the deficit at the expense of 
the less fortunate by cutting funding to social programs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to tell the Leader of the Opposition once again that 
the government has a very clear program for deficit reduction 
and that the Minister of Finance will be tabling a budget next 
month. When the Minister of Finance met with his provincial 
counterparts and when I myself met with the provincial premiers 
in December, we made it very clear that we had no intention of 
reducing transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take what the Prime Minister just said as a 
commitment from the highest-ranking law-maker in the land. 
But how can we take this commitment seriously when we 
contrast it with a statement made recently by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who publicly said he would like to 
see health care 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="21"> 21 </A></B>
<P>
expenditures reduced by 20 per cent? Who are we to believe? 
The  Prime Minister or the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no contradiction here. If we are able, working in 
co-operation with the provinces, to reduce the health care 
expenditures of all levels of government, then both the 
provinces and the federal government will save money.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it occurs to me that the Prime Minister is once again 
dangling the sword of Damocles over social programs since he 
has just said that the objective he is pursuing along with the 
provinces is to reduce health care expenditures. This is precisely 
the kind of half-truth that spreads fear among the public.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister serious about really wanting to cut 
expenditures and trim government fat and, if so, will he agree to 
set up a special committee of parliamentarians from this House 
with an urgent and detailed mandate to review all expenditures 
and all departmental budgetary items and to report back to the 
public? Its goal would be to reduce government spending, to cut 
the deficit and to quell this monster without touching social 
programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are willing to work with all the parties of this House to make 
sure that we find the cuts needed to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	The finance committee will be meeting very soon. The 
different committees will have the opportunity to look at the 
estimates of every department. We will look at every aspect of 
the government operations and make sure to review the 
expenditures.

to pursue this line of questioning, so far the federal government 
has not demonstrated a firm commitment towards reforming the 
Canadian tax system to address blatant unfairness and 
inequities. It is more concerned with testing the public opinion 
left and right about possible deep cuts pretty well across the 
board, but especially in social programs, while sparing the rich.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Is the Minister 
backing away from undertaking as a matter of urgency a serious 
and thorough reform of the Canadian tax system to better 
distribute the burden among Quebec and Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating 
my colleague on his first question before this House. As he 
knows, consultations are underway, in fact the most extensive 
ones ever carried out in this country regarding a budget.
<P>
	Within this framework, the Canadian people have told us that 
they wanted radical changes in many government programs, 
including taxation, and that is what we have set out to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if the Minister of Finance is indeed firmly committed to reform, 
is he prepared to undertake today to eliminate immediately this 
horrible family trust system which benefits only the richest of 
the rich, not the poorest of the poor in our society?

responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	At the same time that we are facing record debt and taxation 
levels to which the hon. member has just referred, we are also 
facing record levels of unemployment. Many economists and 
business people feel there is a direct connection between the 
two, that high debt and taxes kill private sector job creation.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister give the House the government's 
view on the connection between high record levels of debt and 
high record levels of unemployment and tell us whether the 
government believes that deficit cutting is essential to private 
sector job creation.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we understand that we have a huge debt in Canada. Yesterday 
apparently we surpassed the fantastic figure of $500 billion. It is 
a big burden that the Conservative Party left as a legacy with 
which we must start our work today. It is a reality and it is a big 
problem for the nation.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	There are two ways we can solve this problem and it will take 
some time. We have to cut expenditures but the main thing we 
can do to reduce the debt is to make sure that there are jobs in 
Canada for Canadians so that they can work and produce growth 
<P>

<B><A NAME="22"> 22 </A></B>

and produce taxes. That is the way we want to approach the 
problem.

members agree with your reply but my question was: Is there a 
direct connection between the-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I know we are all new to the House but 
would you please address your questions and your statements 
directly to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I have a supplementary, Mr. Speaker, on the 
same subject of deficits and jobs.
<P>
	This has come to us. It is an inquiry received on our question 
fax line from Dr. Dean P. Eyre of Ottawa. He asked the 
government this question. He said: ``The government proposes 
to spend $6 billion on infrastructure and create 65,000 jobs. Has 
the government calculated how many jobs might have been 
created if that $6 billion were simply cut from the taxes of 
individuals, property owners and small businesses?''
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> The 
questioners through the leader of the Reform Party should know 
that only $2 billion of the $6 billion is coming from the federal 
treasury, so it will have reduced only the deficit of the federal 
government. This infrastructure program is a big success.

in the Throne Speech the government really disappointed 
Quebecers and Canadians, who were expecting, after the 
election campaign's theme of ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', a true job 
creation program. In fact, no concrete initiatives were 
announced, except for the infrastructure program, which is 
inadequate to our needs.

	I also want to congratulate the hon. member for Mercier for 
her interest in this issue. I hope that we will have many 
opportunities to exchange our views, for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	As the hon. members will know, the Throne Speech includes 
several initiatives and measures. For example, the Youth 
Service Corps is a very important tool to put young Canadians to 
work. We will also set up a training program for all Canadians. I 
believe this can provide a good solution to the important 
problems which our young people are facing.

social security system.

it will bring about the essential changes needed to develop an 
employment program for a large number of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, this answer 
is totally unsatisfactory. I have a supplementary question for the 
minister. Why did he agree to the $800 million increase in UI 
contributions, given the disastrous effect this measure will have 
on the economy, and considering that the government invests 
only $1 billion a year in the infrastructure program?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

exact question is but as I tried to outline to the hon. member I 
will be very glad to provide her with a full explanation of the 
measures.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Auditor General tabled his report today. In it he has 
pointed out that unless some real changes are made the federal 
debt, that is, the federal debt alone and not the national debt, will 
reach 100 per cent of the gross domestic product by the year 
2008.
<P>
	The Auditor General has red flagged the situation as being of 
serious concern. He has stated in his report: ``Hard choices lie 
ahead''.
<P>
	The speech from the throne has focused on spending programs 
with no recognition of the serious fiscal situation facing this 
country.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance now able to assure Canadians that 
deficit reduction is this country's number one priority rather 
than introducing more spending programs as we heard about 
yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that deficit reduction 
is a major priority of this government.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we share the views largely expressed by 
the Auditor General. We did so in a matter of weeks after taking 
office. There is no doubt, as well, as the Prime Minister said so 
well in his opening remarks that we are not going to get the 
deficit reduction unless we also understand that economics is 
about people and that this country needs jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, we understand 
that this country certainly does need jobs.
<P>
	However, having looked at and read through the report, it 
would appear that there are many areas where this government 
can take charge of its own finances and ensure that money that is 
currently being wasted and misspent is available for Canadians.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance assure us that he will look at the 
Auditor General's report and implement the recommendations 
there to ensure that Canadian taxpayers' money is spent for the 
best benefit of this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite and I 
certainly share one thing in common. When I first came to the 
House and was up I also forgot to ask my question.
<P>
	The hon. member can rest assured that we are going to take the 
comments of the Auditor General very seriously, especially 
since he is looking at us from up there. We have already begun to 
do so.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a 
broad consensus in Quebec on eliminating costly administrative 
duplication in manpower programs. Unions, management, the 
government and hundreds of thousands of unemployed 
Quebecers agree. The 26,000 Quebecers waiting for 
occupational training, even though skilled jobs are available, 
also agree.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is 
as follows: Does he intend to conclude an agreement with the 
Government of Quebec as soon as possible on eliminating this 
costly duplication and thus respect the commitment which the 
Prime Minister made at the first ministers' summit on December 
21, and the commitment which he himself made in early 
December?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our government is in full agreement with eliminating 
overlap and duplication so as to reduce the cost of government. 
We said that in the throne speech and we obtained an agreement 
to that effect at the first ministers' conference.
<P>
	As for an agreement on occupational training, my colleague, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, has already 
discussed this with his colleague who is now Quebec's finance 
minister but who then was responsible for the manpower 
agreement, and he is continuing with the discussions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, since experts 
say that eliminating these overlaps would save at least some 
$250 million a year from the moment the agreement is reached 
and signed, would the minister not agree that for a 
cash-strapped government, it is time for him, the Prime 
Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to get with it as soon as 
possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I feel that we are already with it because we intend to 
cut government spending by much more than $250 million by 
reducing overlap.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister responsible for the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	At the beginning of this month the government announced the 
program's first project, a convention centre in Quebec City. 
Since then many Canadians have wondered how this project was 
approved prior to the government's announcement on the 
criteria for qualification.
<P>
	I would like the minister to explain to this House by what 
criteria and by what process the project in Quebec City was 
approved.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Quebec had for some time been in 
negotiations with the previous government here in Ottawa with 
respect to the project of the convention centre in Quebec City. It 
was anxious because of the change in leadership coming in the 
Government of Quebec to be able to bring the matter to a head. 
The premiers had been here on December 21 and had come to an 
agreement about the the program. They in fact unanimously 
agreed to be participants in the infrastructure program.
<P>
	We then said to the Quebec government that it was 
conditional-and I want to point out that it is conditional upon 
signing the formal agreement-that the project would be one 
that could proceed.
<P>
	Once the formal agreement is signed the project will in fact 
have to go through all of the tests required. We already have, 
however, through the Federal Economic Development Agency 
in Quebec, processed the application on an informal basis. I 
Must say that it is an excellent project. It will put over 1,000 
people to work in construction jobs and create more than 400 
long-term jobs after that. It is a project that will help get the 
people in Quebec City, the province of Quebec and Canadians to 
work and to work fast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I thank the minister for his clarification. Obviously this was a 
case of a political announcement occurring before this House 
was consulted and before criteria were publicly known. It 
creates the impression that we have another pork-barrel 
program. What action is the minister going to take to ensure that 
this type of situation does not occur in the future and what 
precisely did he do about the fact that the announcement was as 
ill timed as it was?
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is going to be a very open and transparent program. 
Information has been supplied to all members of the House with 
respect to the criteria under which the projects will be examined. 
The projects are not initiated at the federal level even though the 
program has been. The projects are initiated at the municipal 
level and are designed to meet the priorities of local government 
and the provincial government.
<P>
	That is what we have done in the case of this project to meet 
the priorities and the needs of the province of Quebec and the 
people of Quebec City and with the full support, I might add, of 
the mayor of Quebec City, members of the Quebec caucus and 
the Quebec government. I believe that is a good example of how 
we can get all levels of government together. It is the kind of 
thing we want to do to make sure this program succeeds, ensure 
that it be very open and transparent and in fact avoid the very 
kinds of concerns the member has.

is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. Does the 
Minister responsible for the Treasury Board intend to react to 
the request made by the Auditor General who, year after year, 
has revealed cases of income tax revenue lost as a result of the 
use of tax shelters, and does he intend to give the Auditor 
General a clear mandate to evaluate what these tax shelters cost 
the Federal Treasury?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government, as I think was indicated previously by my 
colleague the Minister of Finance, finds itself very substantially 
in agreement with most of the observations that have been made 
in the Auditor General's report. Even though those observations 
relate to what went on previous to this government taking office, 
nevertheless it is the responsibility of this government to make 
sure we respond to the concerns the member has raised.
<P>
	Indeed, we have already done so to a great extent in things like 
the opening up of the budget process which my colleague talked 
about earlier and streamlining the decisions in cabinet and 
various other programs that have been put forward by the Prime 
Minister to reduce the costs of operation of different ministries, 
the size of political perks and many other things. We have 
responded to some of the concerns the member has raised.

suggestions as to how we can meet many of these requests of the 
Auditor General.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Auditor 
General says in the report tabled today that it may cost Canadian 
taxpayers another $1.2 billion in income tax revenues lost in the 
resource sector and the petroleum and mining industries.
<P>
	Here is a case that was mentioned by the Auditor General. 
After 14 years of dispute, litigation, negotiation and discussion, 
there is still no consensus on how the profits of these 
corporations should be calculated.
<P>
	How does the minister intend to end this judicial saga, which 
has already cost Canadian taxpayers a great deal, recover the 
amounts outstanding, and plug these expensive tax loopholes 
once and for all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>As far as natural resources are concerned, Mr. 
Speaker, the Auditor General was referring to a specific case 
and, in fact, the government acted very quickly once the dispute 
was settled.
<P>
	As far as tax shelters are concerned, we have already said that 
everything was on the table and that we would take a long, hard 
look at all existing loopholes and exemptions. Considering the 
hon. member's question, I hope the Bloc québécois will support 
us when we bring down the budget in this House.

their RRSP accounts for their eventual retirement. That is why 
the statement made in December by the minister's 
parliamentary secretary concerning a review of the system has 
caused so much concern among Canadians.

limiting contributions to RRSPs?

responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find that in government one is on 
one's feet more than in opposition.
<P>
	The government said in the pre-budget consultations that it is 
reviewing not only every line of government expenditure but 
really all government policy. Certainly the matters to which the 
member has made reference are part of that review.
<P>
	I can tell the member however that this government will never 
do anything that will put into jeopardy Canadians' retirement 
income. What we are going to do is make sure that the tax system 
in this country treats everyone fairly and equitably.

Speaker, a supplementary for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Will he guarantee or at least allay the fears of the Canadian 
people that he is going to continue the RRSP and that it is not 
going to be a tax concession to be reduced but rather a personal 
retirement safety net that is to be encouraged for these people in 
the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to my hon. friend that 
his supplementary is exactly the same as his first question and 
my answer must be the same, that RRSPs are an important part 
of the retirement savings program in this country. However we

no exceptions.

federal government was not in favour of the Quebec 
government's proposal to reduce tobacco taxes as a way of 
eliminating smuggling. Can the Minister of Finance confirm

way of eliminating the scourge of smuggling?

that smuggling really is a scourge that must be dealt with. 
Certainly, considering the discussions and measures taken by

National Revenue, the laws which already exist will really have 
to be enforced.
<P>
	That being said, there is no doubt that one option is to lower 
tobacco taxes and Quebec has put forward the case for it very 
well. That is an option to consider, but as you know, it will have 
to be coordinated with all the provinces or at least most of the

several ways. Indeed, several observers have mentioned that

available everything I know on this subject. I will say, however, 
that the Prime Minister has made it very clear that the goods and

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Many Canadians who voted for the government were 
disappointed that one of the first things the government 
concerned about job creation did was to implement the North 
American Free Trade Agreement which many regard as an 
agreement that makes it more difficult for the government to 
create jobs and to protect existing jobs.
<P>
	Following up on the question raised earlier with respect to 
events in Mexico, an interesting exchange in which those who 
were against NAFTA defended it and those who were for it 
criticized it, what does the government intend to do about the 
situation in Mexico? What is the government prepared to do if 
the human rights situation does not improve in Mexico?
<P>
	Are we going to continue in this agreement regardless of what 
the Mexican army and government do to people who feel these 
agreements are destroying their lives?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to reply that in the red book we had a very definitive 
program regarding the need for the improvements to NAFTA 
before we signed. We managed to get the improvements that we 
wanted so we were in a position to sign.
<P>
	Of course as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, we are 
following very closely what is happening at this moment in 
Mexico. We are putting pressure on its government to respect 
human rights. We will keep pressing.
<P>
	However, there are a lot of hypothetical questions in the 
question the member has put to which I am not in a position to 
reply. We have to see how the situation develops there. We have 
confidence that the grievances that exist in that society have no 
relation to the signing of NAFTA.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is aware that we went a little over. I 
signified the intention of the Chair to cut off question period 
precisely at three o'clock. We will have one final short question.

	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the absence of a question from the other side, my question is for 
the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	First, I want to thank the minister for his work on behalf of 
Canadian farmers to date. He must be aware of the anxiety being 
felt in the dairy community regarding his negotiations with the 
Americans on ice cream and yogurt.
<P>
	Canadian dairy farmers want the government to stand up to 
the Americans and not to cave in on their unreasonable request 
for zero tariffs on these products immediately.
<P>
	What specific action is the minister prepared to take to assure 
the survival of a viable Canadian dairy industry? Is there a 
resolution to the problem that will help the Canadian dairy 
farmer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the hon. member for 
the question.
<P>
	Since Canada and the United States are continuing to discuss 
possible solutions to a variety of outstanding bilateral concerns 
in agricultural trade, including some that affect the dairy 
industry, my public comments with respect to this situation for 
obvious reasons must be rather guarded.
<P>
	What I can say is that we have had useful discussions with our 
American counterparts. Those discussions are ongoing. 
Whether they result in a resolution in the short term or not we 
will have to wait and see.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="29"> 29 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the hon. member and other members of this House 
can be absolutely assured that the vital interests of Canada 
including the vital interests of the Canadian dairy industry are 
very much in my mind and very much on the front of the table.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke): </B>Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.
<P>
	Allow me first of all to convey my respects and my 
congratulations to you on your election. For reasons that I will 
not mention, I was not in the House at the time when you were 
elected to this office. Needless to say, I am proud to extend to 
you, on behalf of the Conservative caucus in this House, our 
support and, above all, to wish you all the best for the coming 
Parliament.
<P>
	I have chosen and asked to speak today on an issue which will 
impact on our rights and privileges during this Parliament. Part 
of yesterday's Throne Speech reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government is committed to enhancing the credibility of Parliament. 
Changes will be proposed to the rules of the House of Commons to provide 
Members of Parliament a greater opportunity to contribute to the development 
of public policy and legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my caucus and my Party, let me tell 
all the members of this House that we fully endorse such a 
statement and that we intend to support the government in this 
regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In respect to the statement made by the government in the 
speech from the throne, I want to take advantage of the fact that 
on the very first day that we sit we have very deep and very real 
preoccupations relating to our rights and privileges in this 
House.
<P>
	I am rising on a point of order today not because I am asking 
for a ruling from the House, but I want to attract your attention, 
Mr. Speaker, and the attention of members to a few facts relating 
to our position on this side.
<P>
	Even though the election campaign rendered a result that was 
quite clear in regard to the previous government, the results, if 
examined objectively for what they yielded for us on an 
electoral basis, were such that the Reform Party that sits with us 
in this House obtained approximately 19 per cent of the vote and 
has a representation of 52 members.
<P>
	The Official Opposition with 14 per cent of the vote has 54 
members. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada with 
16 per cent of the vote has only two members. Our colleagues in 
the New Democratic Party, who I think have approximately 9 
per cent of the vote, have nine members.
<P>
	This, Mr. Speaker, as you know, creates a situation where-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair would be disposed at this point to 
ask the hon. member to come to the point. I would very much 
like to hear it. I will then take other points of order. I would very 
much like to hear the end of this point of order if I could.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> If I may be allowed to finish what I have to say.
<P>
	The point that I want to make today is that as the leader of my 
own party I intend to bring this matter forward to you first, Mr. 
Speaker, on an informal basis and with the other political parties 
in this House so that we can discuss what opportunities there 
will be for us in this House of Commons in respect to the 
statement made in the speech from the throne, in respect to the 
statements already made by our friends in the Reform Party or 
our friends in the Bloc Quebecois in regard to the opportunities 
that we will have to speak on behalf of the two million 
Canadians who offered us their support in the last election 
campaign.
<P>
	That is the point that I wanted to make on this day so that at the 
very first opportunity when this House sits and when question 
period is happening you know, Mr. Speaker, and all members of 
this House know that we intend to argue this point and at least 
have the opportunity to be heard. This is so that we can deal with 
such matters as my hon. colleague and friend from Saint John 
sitting at one end of the aisle and I am sitting at the other end.
<P>
	Furthermore, if I may, I have a question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member has made his point 
and I look forward to discussions with all hon. members in this 
House. The point is well taken and I do thank you for your 
intervention.
<P>
	Is this on the same point of order or have you terminated?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> No, I have a point of privilege.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have made the ruling on the point of order. Is 
this a point of privilege sir?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is but I understand that my 
colleague from the Reform Party also has a point of order on the 
same subject I have just broached. I would be more than willing 
to enable him to say what he has to say and follow that up with a 
different point of privilege.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the same point with regard to the conduct of Question Period, 
there were a total of 17 members who asked questions today; 14 
from the opposition parties and 3 from the government party. In 
your deliberations I would ask that there be a fairer distribution 
of questions during Question Period. The governing party has a 
majority of seats in this House yet we were relegated to three 
questions during question period.
<P>
	I would also ask that you consider the use of lists during 
Question Period. I understand that it is the first question period 
of the session, but you were referring to lists provided to you by 
the government and by the opposition parties. I would submit 
that in effect restricts, limits and fetters your ultimate authority 
to recognize members in this House. I would ask that in your 
deliberations you consider the question of the provision of lists 
in order to establish those who are entitled and able to ask 
questions during question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. I would point out that 
I made a statement prior to question period today explaining the 
decision why we were going to go a little bit over. Of course, I 
take these comments under advisement. Negotiations will be 
ongoing for the next little while.
<P>
	On the same point of order. The hon. member for Kamloops.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to reply to 
my hon. friend who has just spoken. I think it is well recognized 
in the parliamentary system that question period provides the 
opportunity for those in opposition to ask questions of the 
government. My hon. friend has many opportunities in caucus 
meetings and in other areas to raise questions of importance on 
behalf of his constituents. This is really the only opportunity 
that we have as opposition members.
<P>
	If my hon. friend looks at the record of today he will find that 
for the first time that I can recall the government had far more 
statements than it would normally receive.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, recognize when you make your deliberations 
that this is the only opportunity we have on a daily basis to ask 
questions of the members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	I would request that you not permit grandstanding on 
supposed points of order. When the member for Sherbrooke was 
actually speaking to the throne speech he was totally out of 
order.
<P>
	We would suggest that the House management committee 
which deals with standing orders look at these matters and 
respond to the House in the appropriate fashion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, I will take your comments under 
advisement and I thank you for giving me as much room as you 
have thus far.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding that the point I raised is an issue that is ultimately 
to be decided by the Speaker and not by any other House or 
management committee. That is my understanding of the rules 
and the practices in this place. I am happy to co-operate with all 
members in this House in assisting you in making that decision.
<P>
	My point of privilege is the following. I am sorry to have to 
raise it on this the very first day of question period. However, I 
could not help but notice that as we started question period you 
gave the House a temporary ruling on how this place would work 
for question period and for the statements we make before 
question period. I do not want to quarrel with the content of your 
ruling, maybe not at this point, but I want to question the process 
that led to this ruling.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me point out that your ruling directly affects my rights and 
privileges and those of 12 other people in this place. I 
understand that neither I nor any of the other 12 members 
referred to in the ruling were consulted. This is my 
understanding unless someone else has spoken with you.
<P>
	It is my understanding that you informed us as you gave us the 
ruling that you had spoken with the whips of the other official 
parties who represented a point of view.
<P>
	The point I want to raise with you and the reason I feel it is 
critically important that we raise it at this time is that if you are 
going to make rulings as you are called upon to do every day 
concerning the rights and privileges of members of Parliament 
and how this place works, then it seems only fair on the principle 
of natural justice that all members in this place have an 
opportunity to be heard before such rulings are made.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will take your comments under advisement. It 
would be the intention of the Chair to consult as widely as 
possible before taking any decisions. I will take the hon. 
member's comments under advisement.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr.

<P>
	During the last Parliament, I recall a somewhat similar 
experience and I heard arguments from the government party. 
The Speaker told us at the time to consult with party officials 
and subsequently to notify the independent members who were 
not necessarily taking part in the negotiations. We know 
something about this. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that a ruling 
was

they had to say.

subcommittee on equality rights unanimously recommended 
that the Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in all areas of 
federal jurisdiction. It also notes that the government has yet to 
introduce a legislative amendment to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act despite the passage of time.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to ensure that 
the government and Parliament act immediately to bring 
forward an amendment to add sexual orientation to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act as a prohibited ground of discrimination.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FOREIGNAFFAIRS">FOREIGN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition is signed by residents of Langley,

Ontario. It notes that the only relief available to two Canadians, 
Christine Lamont and David Spencer who have been sentenced 
to 28 years each in a Brazilian prison and have suffered 
miscarriages of justice in their judicial process, is for Canada to 
request expulsion in accordance with Brazilian law.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to urge the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs to request the Government of Brazil 
to expel Christine Lamont and David Spencer and return them to 
Canada.

that request.

	The House resumed from January 18 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here we are at the beginning not only of a new year but 
also of a new Parliament, with a new government, a new official 
opposition elected by the people of Quebec and a new formation 
representing mainly Western Canada.
<P>
	The government party and the third party were given clear 
mandates by their respective voters. I wish to congratulate both 
leaders for their success at the polls. To the Prime Minister in 
particular, I wish health, clear-mindedness and broadness of 
outlook in carrying out his duties in this crucial time in the 
history of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The people of Quebec will soon decide their future following 
a debate that we all hope will be marked by a spirit of 
democracy. This is also a time when the adverse effects of the 
combined economic and political crisis are threatening to make 
a growing number of our fellow citizens lose hope.
<P>
	I also want to pay my respects generally to all the other 
members elected to this House. On behalf of my colleagues from 
the Bloc Québécois, I can assure the Speaker, the government 
and all members of this House of our full co-operation in 
respecting decorum in this House. We will see to it, as far as we 
are concerned, that exchanges remain courteous though intense, 
rational though impassioned, orderly though vigorous.
<P>
	The major change in this House is undoubtedly the massive 
influx of sovereigntist members from Quebec. No one can 
trivialize the shift represented by the decision some 2 million 
voters have made to send 54 members here to pave the way for 
Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The dynamics which led Quebec to this decision were such 
that enough members were elected to form the Official 
Opposition. Paradoxical as it may seem, this electoral result 
flows from an implacable logic.
<P>
	Indeed, it was inevitable that these old walls, which too often 
resounded with the voices of Quebecers who were ready to 
approve measures rejected by the voters, such as the 
Charlottetown Accord and the unilateral patriation of 1982, 
would one day hear the speeches of members who base their 
party allegiance on the commitment never to accept to 
compromise Quebec's interests in Ottawa; members who are 
freed from the constraints of the old Canada-wide parties and 
who therefore will not be torn  between their obligations as 
federalist parliamentarians and their loyalty to Quebec; 
members whose political career is motivated only by the 
determination to work, with their blinkers off, for Quebec's 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Many in English Canada were surprised by the Bloc 
Québécois's achievement on October 25. To tell the truth, I am 
not surprised by that: the channels of communication from 
Quebec to English Canada are significantly distorted as they 
cross the border, so that the Quebec reality is perceived in a very 
confused way on the other side. That is the first justification for 
the presence of Quebec sovereigntists in this House.
<P>
	Institutions often lag behind reality. The previous House of 
Commons was no exception to this rule; the stinging rejection of 
the Charlottetown Accord by voters in Canada and Quebec is 
striking proof. Today, the main architects of that accord have all 
disappeared from the political scene. They were the same people 
who showed cold indifference to the misfortune brought on by 
the long and difficult recession which began in the spring of 
1990.
<P>
	The voters have set the record straight. For the first time in 
contemporary history, this House which is now beginning its 
work reflects the very essence of Canada, its binational nature 
and the very different visions of the future which flow from that. 
Truth is never a bad advisor. As General de Gaulle said, one may 
well long for the days of sailing ships, but the only valid policy 
one can have is based on realities.
<P>
	What are the realities with which this House will be faced? 
First of all, a really bad economic situation. To realize the full 
extent of it, it is not enough to look at the total picture as it is 
now; we must put it in the relevant chronological context.
<P>
	The latest recession lasted roughly from April 1990 to April 
1992, when net job losses stopped. But big business continues to 
lay off employees and the so-called recovery is so anemic that 
only economists dare to call it a recovery. Now, in early 1994, 
per capita GDP for all of Canada is still nearly 5 per cent less 
than it was in 1989. We know that per capita GDP is a more 
relevant indicator than total GDP, since it is affected by 
population growth, which is very large in Canada. Not only has 
Canada declined in relation to its partners but it is doing worse 
than before.
<P>
	The employment situation does not seem any brighter, any 
more encouraging. By the end of 1993, the Canadian economy 
had regained only 60 per cent of all the jobs lost during the 
recession. The situation in Quebec is even more disastrous, 
since the recovery rate there is only 25 per cent. It must be said 
that for all practical purposes, Quebec had no government for 
much of 1993, but in that time, many young people arrived on 
the labour market. Just to absorb the number of net new job 
seekers, the Canadian economy would have to create over 
200,000 jobs a year, about 45,000 of them in Quebec. The 1993  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="33"> 33 </A></B>
<P>
performance of 147,000 jobs in Canada, most of which are 
part-time, and none in Quebec, is far off the mark.
<P>
	These chilling statistics hide thousands of human dramas. No 
one goes gladly to an employment centre for the unemployment 
insurance benefits to which they are entitled. Underemployment 
has considerable economic and social costs. It is a real 
collective tragedy. In this regard, it is very urgent to put people 
back to work, giving them real hope of recovering their dignity 
by regaining the right to earn their living.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, it is no surprise that the unemployment level 
remains at such a high level. Fortunately, the American 
economy is not suffering from the same problems as those of the 
Canadian economy. Consequently, the economic situation has at 
least one aspect that works for us, namely exports to the United 
States. But the result is that the gap between American and 
Canadian unemployment rates has never been so high, the 
difference being close to five percentage points. The recovery 
south of the border is much stronger than here.
<P>
	Indeed, major obstacles to a strong recovery continue to exist 
in Canada. In the last few years, inflation has been lower here 
than in the United States, but our interest rates remain high.
<P>
	We hear a lot about the fact that interest rates are presently at 
their lowest level in thirty years. The reality is that this is only 
true of short-term interest rates. In 1963, the bank rate set by the 
Bank of Canada and the preferred rate charged by banks were 
about the same as today. However, the rate of a 25 year mortgage 
was 7 per cent, and the rate of long-term Canadian bonds was 
5,1 per cent, instead of the present 7.25 and 7 per cent rates that 
now apply to a five-year mortgage. This is where the problem 
lies, and it is a two-fold problem. Indeed, long-term interest 
rates remain too high, while the purchasing power of Canadian 
households has dropped significantly.
<P>
	Soon we will have no choice but to take a close look at the 
characteristics, the evolution and the magnitude of our 
economic problems, and also at the hardships that they create 
for their primary victims, namely the one and a half million 
unemployed workers, and the millions of children and adults 
who live below the poverty level. It appears that the new 
government prefers not to assess the magnitude of the problem, 
which is not even touched upon in the Throne Speech. Moreover, 
the government does not realize that we are caught in a vicious 
circle. The fact is that there will not be a true recovery as long as 
the political structure remains the same. Indeed, the present 
political structure is the primary cause of the falling into decay 
of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	One of the most obvious, if not spectacular, signs of this is the 
chronic inability of federal governments to control the budget 
deficit and the resulting soaring debt. It seems that this 
voracious monster can at will, like the Minotaur, take its toll in 
terms of jobs, of the minimal security of the poor, of the 
financial health of the federal State, and even of the future of our 
young people. Not only have those deficits been constant for the 
past 18 years, but this year's, which stands at some $43 billion, 
confirms that the system is totally out of order.
<P>
	In order to get out of this mess, it will not be enough to blame 
the previous government. In any case, Canadians have already 
let us know what they thought of its performance. Yet, the 
careful observer who has not buried his head in the sand cannot 
fail to identify a certain element of ineffectiveness, which is 
inherent to the system.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the government continues to pursue the 
ostrich's policy followed by its predecessor. By escaping from 
reality, it cannot put the finger on the main problem: this country 
is not governable, because it is stuck with a deficient and 
sclerotic decision-making structure.
<P>
	Nothing seems to make successive governments in Ottawa 
come out of the cocoon in which they shelter themselves from 
reality, and so it is with this new government.
<P>
	Yet, one only has to look at the relative performance of 
various other countries subject to the same international 
environment. This is a sure criterion, since everybody is facing 
the same economic problems and requirements. Therefore, the 
global context does not justify Canada's mediocre performance 
in terms of productivity since 1979, the worst of all OECD 
countries, nor the persistence of such a high unemployment 
level, nor the uncontrolled growth of the debt which, as we 
know, reached $500 billion yesterday. Canada is also in first 
place in terms of relying on foreign investors, since 40 per cent 
of its debt is owed to foreign interests.
<P>
	Be that as it may, it is not free trade agreements, global 
markets, or the requirements imposed by the competitiveness of 
the world markets which, in the last few decades, have forced 
the federal government to embark upon all kinds of programs 
and expenditures, to encroach upon provincial jurisdictions, and 
to create a tentacular bureaucracy. Rather, this extravagance and 
this inconsistency were motivated by a triple internal concern: 
to give to the federal government a legitimacy snatched from the 
provinces; to affirm its role as a strong central government; and 
to neutralize the centrifugal forces of the structure. It is our 
political structures which are called into question when we 
wonder why we have become the most overgoverned country in 
the Western world, with 11 governments for a population of 28 
million people.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We only have ourselves to blame if overlapping federal and 
provincial activities prevent the creation of cohesive programs 
and generate an outrageous amount of waste in human and 
financial resources That reveals a second reality as inescapable 
as the economic crisis, that certain inefficiencies are at the very 
heart of our system. These realities feed upon each other, and are 
a true reflection of the vicious circle which characterizes 
Canadian federalism. At the core of the economic crisis is a 
political crisis.
<P>
	But for the better part of English Canada, there is no political 
crisis. Or, if there is one, they choose to ignore it. They have sent 
to Ottawa a new government with the mandate to better manage 
the present system without changing anything in it.
<P>
	On the other hand, Quebecers not only sent a completely new 
team to Ottawa, but they gave their elected representatives the 
mandate to prepare a new order. The Bloc Quebecois was given a 
double mission: to manage the economic crisis and to handle the 
political crisis. Does the distribution of elected members in this 
House not prove the very existence of this second crisis? The 
government party only got 19 seats in Quebec, compared to 54 
for the Bloc. Who do you think speaks for Quebec today?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More than 30 years ago Quebec awakened to the world and 
decided to catch up. The quiet revolution transformed Quebec. It 
did not take long before the spirit of reform in Quebec collided 
with the spirit of Canadian federalism in Ottawa. Thirty years 
ago the horns were locked. Thirty years later we are still at it, as 
if frozen in a time warp. We should learn from the past, and this 
we should have learned: The political problem with Canada is 
Quebec, and the problem of Quebec is Canada.
<P>
	However, many Canadians refuse to acknowledge the 
problem which only serves to compound it. For example, the 
Bloc Quebecois has been on the federal scene for more than 
three years, but until recently we were ranked alongside the 
bizarre and the outer fringes.
<P>
	Our aim of course is not to win popularity contests in English 
Canada, but we have here in a nugget the essence of the political 
predicament which bedevils Canada. A new political party 
which had led systematically in the polls in Quebec for three 
years was regularly dismissed as a quirk on the charts or a 
manifestation of a temporary leave of the senses. Hugh 
MacLennan's powerful novel <I>Two Solitudes</I> was published in 
1945. Half a century later the title still mirrors the political 
landscape.
<P>
	Some are willing to deny the obvious in order not to upset the 
status quo. They speak of one Canadian nation, whereas Quebec 
and English Canada are two different nations. Even when 
nobody in Quebec was contemplating sovereignty, the Canada 
that steered Quebecers was not of the same cloth as the Canada 
that seized the minds and hearts of maritimers, Ontarians or  
westerners. Quebecers were in the vanguard of the struggle for 
more Canadian autonomy under the Red Ensign and eventually 
for the political independence of Canada. This tends to be 
forgotten in certain quarters where Quebec bashing is a popular 
pastime.
<P>
	Canada and Quebec have both changed tremendously in the 
last 100 years, but they are travelling on parallel tracks and 
remain as different today as they were yesterday. By and large 
they both continue to ignore the history and the culture of the 
other. This is no accident; language, geography and history 
largely account for it.
<P>
	However, Quebecers do not deny that English Canada 
constitutes a nation in its own right with its own sense of 
community. Every single poll in the last few years has shown 
that the vast majority of the people in each of the nine provinces 
want to remain politically united after Quebec becomes 
sovereign. This small detail is conveniently neglected by all 
those who question the existence of an English Canada on the 
shaky basis of regional differences.
<P>
	In France the people of the north are certainly as different, if 
not more so, from the people of the south as maritimers are from 
the people of British Columbia. But they both feel a strong 
attachment to France, or to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact, by clinging to the one nation thesis, English Canada is 
running the risk of undermining itself. As Kenneth McRoberts, 
the political scientist from York University, wrote in 1991: ``In 
its effort to deny Quebec's distinctiveness, English Canada has 
been led to deny its own''.
<P>
	If one accepts the obvious, one must surely accept the 
consequences. Every nation has the right to self-government, 
that is to decide its own policies and future. We have no quarrel 
with the concept of federalism when applied to uninational 
states. It is a different matter when it comes to multinational 
states, particularly to the Canadian brand of federalism.
<P>
	Canadian federalism means that the Government of Quebec is 
subordinate to the central government both in large and lesser 
matters. Within the federal regime, English Canada in fact has a 
veto on the future development of Quebec.
<P>
	When the theme of national sovereignty is brought up in 
English Canada a nice paradox almost always emerges. As I will 
certainly refer to it in the coming months, I shall call it the 
paradox of English Canada. First, the tendency to consider passé 
the concept of national sovereignty, what with the European 
Community, GATT, NAFTA and so on. This is a patent 
misreading of the situation. Take a look at the western world. 
Ninety-five per cent of its population live in nation states.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="35"> 35 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact is that Quebec is the only nation of more than seven 
million people in the western world not to have attained political 
sovereignty. I invite members of this House to reflect upon this. 
As a political structure Canada is the exception rather than the 
rule, an exception that is not working well, to understate the 
case.
<P>
	The particular situation of Quebec was inadvertently 
recognized by a member of the Canadian delegation to the final 
GATT negotiations in mid-December. As will be recalled, 
Canada was seeking to be exempted from the clause attacking 
subsidies by sub-national governments because, in his words: 
``There is only one Quebec''. He was right of course.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves: Who was in the driver's seat during the 
European revolution of 1989-90 which saw German 
reunification and the accession to political sovereignty of so 
many nations in central and eastern Europe? Was it the 
supranational institutions, the EC, NATO, the Warsaw pact, or 
was it the different nations, each one of them seizing the chance 
of a lifetime?
<P>
	In short, Quebecers aspire to what is considered normal in the 
western world.
<P>
	The paradox of English Canada pops up with the second part 
of the discussion about national sovereignty, the part that deals 
with the issue of Canadian sovereignty. A large part of the free 
trade election of November 1988 was spent, in English Canada, 
on the impact of the free trade agreement on the sovereignty of 
Canada. Everybody agreed that this was something important 
that should not be tampered with. However if Canada's political 
sovereignty vis-à-vis the U.S.A. is valuable and must be 
preserved, why is it that Quebec's political sovereignty 
vis-à-vis Canada is depicted as irrational in the anglophone 
media of the land? When the preceding Prime Minister said that 
she preserved Canadian sovereignty during the last stage of the 
NAFTA negotiations, why is it that nobody rolled their eyes and 
derided this quaint idea of sovereignty? What mysterious 
alchemy transforms the quality of a concept according to the 
people to whom it applies or according to the year of accession 
to sovereignty? One must not forget that independent nations are 
not born. They are made.
<P>
	All this does not prevent Canadians and Quebecers from 
having quite a few things in common: a respect for democracy, a 
large degree of openness to people of other cultures, and a 
fascination with our neighbours south of the border. And they 
both love their country. However, the problem is and has been 
for a very long time, that it is not the same country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Make no mistake about it. We will not stop reminding the 
people that, in order to legitimize his power play against Quebec 
National Assembly in 1982, Pierre Trudeau was able to call 
upon the support of Quebec's Liberal members of Parliament in 
order to claim to speak on behalf of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	We will repeat as often as necessary that the government party 
no longer speaks for Quebec. You can also be sure that we will 
not lose sight-and will not allow anyone to lose sight-of the 
fact that the new Prime Minister is the very man who led the 
assault against Quebec, in 1981, and ignored the 
quasi-unanimous repudiation by the Quebec National 
Assembly.
<P>
	The Charlottetown episode followed a similar pattern. Did we 
not see a block of Conservative members from Quebec, who had 
initially got into politics to repair the damage done by the 1982 
patriation, side with the Liberals in an effort to seal the fate, 
once and for all, of Quebec's historical claims?
<P>
	The 1992 referendum results dispelled any lingering 
ambiguity. The rejection of the Accord from coast to coast 
ended all hopes that some may still have had for a renewed 
federal system in Canada. You take it or leave it as it is.
<P>
	The Prime Minister himself came to the same conclusion. Did 
he not announce shortly after coming into office that he would 
not even attempt such a reform?
<P>
	Thus we should be able to make in the clear light of day the 
decision we are supposed to make by referendum in Quebec. We 
are left with only two choices: either we settle for the status quo 
that almost every federalist in Quebec since Jean Lesage has 
denounced or, the alternative is clear, Quebec attains full 
sovereignty, with full powers to assume full responsibility. The 
identity and roles of the players would be clarified at the same 
time.
<P>
	There certainly seems to be a sort of poetic justice in all this. 
The henchman of the dastardly deed in 1982, who has since 
become Prime Minister, will soon have to ask the people of 
Quebec to turn down the sovereignty deal in favour of the 
constitutional one which had earned him their reprobation in the 
first place. And he will have to do it on his own, without the 
support that his mentor, Pierre Trudeau, claimed to have in 
Quebec. You can see why he does not want the talk Constitution, 
as he said.
<P>
	By its presence and actions in this House, the Bloc Quebecois 
will be doing every Quebecer and Canadian a service, whether 
they like it or not, by preventing them from going back to square 
one. Now that the Meech and Charlottetown accords have 
stripped the varnish of political correctness from the Canadian 
federal system, revealing its obstinate fixedness, everyone is 
immune to promises of renewal. So much so that nobody dares 
make any, not even to score political points.
<P>
	This imposes upon us a basic civic duty, which consists in 
sparing ourselves three more decades of fruitless discussion, 
endless attempts and lost illusions. This waste of resources, this 
dilution of collective hope, this misuse of our energy has been 
going on for too long already. All we have to show today for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="36"> 36 </A></B>
<P>
ordeal the best wills in Quebec and English Canada have 
suffered is bitterness, suspicion, lack of understanding and a 
profound  collective alienation. We are about to lose the very 
will to face reality squarely.
<P>
	More importantly, there is the waste of time. I am not only 
referring to that of the people who, in the excitement of the 
sixties, dreamed of solving our conflicts and building in Quebec 
and Canada societies that would be tolerant, imaginative, open 
to the world and concerned with social justice. I am thinking of 
our two nations in particular. Because time is running out for 
them too. While we mope around, the world is coming apart and 
rebuilding around us. The boat is going by and we are missing it.
<P>
	Whether we like it or not, there will be a debate on our 
political future, and it will take place right here. The 
government is free to stonewall as has been the practice in this 
House with regard to the sovereigntist aspirations of so many 
Quebecers. Is it out of fear or powerlessness that they are 
evading subjects that put into question the old political 
structures of Quebec and Canada as well as their capacity to 
solve social and economic problems? Whether fainthearted or 
resigned, this total silence is irresponsible and leads to 
paralysis. The Bloc Québécois has been sent here precisely to 
break this conspiracy of silence.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We will not be afraid to point out that Quebecers are and will 
always be in a clear minority position within the federal system. 
The population ratio is three to one. We can fool ourselves and 
believe that we can determine the course of events despite this 
ever-present handicap which relegates Quebec to second-place 
status when interests diverge. This would imply constant 
tension and a superior performance on our part. In other words, 
utopia.
<P>
	If the truth be told, the Trudeauesque utopia is not foreign to 
the annals of French Canadian history. For many decades, 
French Canadians believed that their destiny was prophetic. In 
many respects, Pierre Trudeau is the last missionary of French 
Canada.
<P>
	Here again, we are confronted with a paradox. Canada needed 
measures to safeguard against the demographic and economic 
weight of the United States. Hence the creation of the Foreign 
Investment Review Agency and the implementation of the new 
energy policy. Quebec, on the other hand, did not require 
measures to protect itself from the demographic and economic 
weight of English Canada. Competence was all that was 
required and everything else would take care of itself. How very 
naive! And this was seen as reason triumphing over passion.
<P>
	In reality, Quebecers want to live a normal life. They are tired 
of fighting for basic things that have been denied them. They are 
quite willing to confront the challenges of the day, but they want 
all of the odds to be on their side. On the one hand, they want 
greater economic integration and a stronger competitive 
position internationally, while on the other hand, they want 
political sovereignty in order to face Quebec's competitive 
partners on a level playing field.
<P>
	Quebec sovereigntists advocate a modern concept of political 
sovereignty, one which is exercised within the framework of 
major economic structures and which is respectful of minorities. 
Under no circumstances will the 630,000 francophones outside 
Quebec be sacrificed. Moreover, Quebec sovereigntists were not 
the ones who rejected the Free Trade Agreement with the United 
States and NAFTA. There is a difference between withdrawing 
into oneself and pulling out in order to perform better in the new 
global economy.
<P>
	The close economic integration between Quebec and Canada 
forces us to take a careful look at what is happening in Europe. 
What lessons can we draw from the European model?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some pundits like to believe the European Community will 
gradually transform itself into something resembling Canadian 
federalism and use this as an argument against Quebec 
sovereignty. Thus they reveal their lack of familiarity with 
European developments. In fact the other way around appears 
much more likely. To solve the Canadian political crisis our 
present institutions should and I dare say will evolve along the 
lines of the European Community.
<P>
	A few facts seem in order. The European Commission in 
Brussels has a budget that amounts to 1.2 per cent of the global 
GNP of the community. It has no fiscal powers and-such a 
tragedy-cannot run a deficit. The federal government in 
Ottawa spends 22 per cent of GNP and has the whole gamut of 
fiscal powers. As for deficits we all know what has happened. 
The commission in Brussels has no army, no police and a small 
bureaucracy when compared to national governments. 
Community decisions are in fact executed by national 
bureaucracies. If we exclude trade matters, national sovereignty 
remains the basic ingredient of the community.
<P>
	For instance the 12 members could modify the structure and 
the workings of the EC without the commission having any say 
in the decision. For these countries co-operation is the master 
word, not subordination.
<P>
	This is a far cry from the Canadian brand of federalism. Who 
will pretend, for example, that only the provincial governments 
determine the future of Canada? Who will pretend that the 
federal government is but a benevolent arbitrator of 
inter-regional conflicts? For Quebec the central government is 
the problem. For English Canada it is part of the solution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="37"> 37 </A></B>
<P>
	The Maastricht treaty extended the process of economic 
integration to the field of monetary policy by setting the 
objective of a common currency before the end of the century, 
and the process of political co-operation by specifying the 
objective of a common thread in the fields of defence and 
foreign policy. These sensitive fields will remain the 
prerogative of the heads of state assembled in the European 
Council.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Hence the following question: If the European union is indeed 
the wave of the future as is frequently alleged in the Canadian 
media, why not propose this model as a solution to Canada's 
national problem? If Maastricht represents the embodiment of 
the next century, why does English Canada not propose the same 
kind of arrangement to Quebec? The Maastricht arrangements 
would be much easier to implement between Quebec and Canada 
than among 12 very diverse countries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let there be no mistake. Bloc members will not forget that 
their commitment to sovereignty constitutes the real reason for 
their presence in this House. One could say that as far as we are 
concerned, the pre-referendum campaign has begun. 
Meanwhile, we will not let the recession be dissociated from its 
causes.
<P>
	For the time being, and until Quebecers have made their 
decision in a referendum, members of the Bloc will seek to 
safeguard the future by averting present evils to the best of their 
ability. These evils include unemployment, poverty, lack of 
budgetary restraint, undue duplication, threats to our social 
programs, fiscal inequity and loss of confidence in our political 
institutions and leaders.
<P>
	All these issues have a direct impact on Quebec's interests but 
are equally important for the rest of Canada. Our aspirations 
drive us apart, but our social, economic and budgetary problems 
are the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Premier Bob Rae would say: ``We are all in the same 
boat''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Who can challenge the legitimacy, even for the whole at 
Canada, of any action the Bloc may take to limit the damage, 
create jobs, wrestle with the deficit and fight off attacks against 
our social programs? The universal character of these concerns 
confers a clear legitimacy on a common response to these issues. 
In addition, we received an electoral mandate. Our 54 seats were 
allocated by the principal players: the electorate. Do these seats 
have any less clout because they come from Quebec?
<P>
	I can already hear our opponents claiming that it was only 
thanks to an erratic division of seats of English Canada between 
the Liberals and Reform members that the Bloc was able to 
come to the fore with the second largest number of members. 
However, the impact of spoilers and how this translates to the 
electoral map is also an expression of the will of the electorate. 
It was a combination of all votes, whether they were from 
Quebec or the rest of Canada, which made us the Official 
Opposition. To criticise the fact that this responsibility has now 
been taken over by the Bloc Quebecois shows a lack of respect 
for the democratic process has a whole.
<P>
	We intend to take these responsibilities seriously; and we will 
do so loyally, correctly and with due resolve. We know that is 
what Quebecers expect us to do , and they would never forgive 
us if we deviated from this path.
<P>
	In this respect, we are guided by two principles: equity and 
responsibility. On both counts, the speech from the throne was a 
complete disappointment. At a time when more than one child 
out of six and one family out of eight are living below the 
poverty line in this country, when a million and a half people are 
unemployed, and when more and more people in Quebec see this 
as proof of the failure of Canadian federalism, one would expect 
the new government to stage a strong and spectacular rally.
<P>
	There is a general and widespread feeling of disappointment, 
both among the needy, breadwinners, young people and seniors, 
and also among business people and investors.
<P>
	All were anxious to know what specific measures would be 
taken to put Canadians back to work. Unfortunately, the 
government merely served up a condensed version of its little 
red book. The first hundred days of this government will not go 
down in history.
<P>
	Analyse though we may, we will find none of the answers we 
expected in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	Is there anything in the way of projects that hold out some 
hope? Nothing. The talk goes on about municipal 
infrastructures. It may be useful, but the program falls tragically 
short of what it would take to jump start the economy. The 
government has failed to understand how important it is to give 
people hope. How can the unemployed take heart, how can 
decision makers consider investing when the government is not 
even aware of the seriousness of the situation? When it should 
have taken drastic measures such as starting work on the 
high-speed rail link between Windsor and Quebec City, 
transferring labour training programs and resources to Quebec, 
where all parties have been lobbying for it for a long time, when 
it should have set up a fund to convert military industry to 
civilian uses, when it should have taken so many measures, the 
government chose to be content with publishing yet another 
pamphlet filled with vague electioneering propaganda.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="38"> 38 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The government will no doubt retort that it does not have the 
resources to invest in economic recovery. That is tantamount to 
acknowledging a lack of political courage and administrative 
stringency. Indeed, it is possible to reduce the deficit while 
leaving room to manoeuvre. To do that, you have to decide once 
and for all to cut spending. But the will to do so is lacking. We 
agree as to the diagnosis, but not as to the treatment.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is willing to support an ambitious deficit 
cutting plan, but not just any one. We cannot ignore the origin of 
the present national debt. We cannot forget that the federal 
government was the first one to open wide the gates in the early 
1980's, leading to this spiralling public debt. As we all know, on 
March 31, 1994, the net debt will reach $507 billion whereas the 
combined debt of all the provinces will be less than $170 billion. 
This explains why, a few years ago, the federal government 
decided to unload part of the federal deficit on the provinces.
<P>
	In view of this heavy responsibility, the federal government 
should show the way rather than impose its will by decree. 
Before considering shrinking the social safety net, before 
passing the buck to the provinces, the federal government must 
first put its own house in order. It could follow two very 
different paths. Ridding the federal administration of its fat 
could be done very quickly by eliminating useless trips, 
contracts awarded to private interests, friends and friends of 
friends, extravagant spending here and abroad, and by taking 
into account the horror stories which have been listed, year after 
year, by the Auditor General in his annual report.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>Good resolutions, noble intentions to let 
parliamentarians speak do not last long, do they? They cannot 
even wait for the end of the first real sitting day, for the end of 
the speech by the Leader of the Opposition to start hurling 
insults.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would hope hon. members would hear 
each other out in the debates as much as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> That would require a thorough and detailed 
study of each and every department's internal expenses. We all 
know how much the bureaucracy is unwilling to curb its 
appetite. Restraint will have to be imposed from the outside; in 
other words, it will have to come from the Canadian Parliament. 
The government has expressed its willingness to increase the 
responsibilities of this House. We take them at their word. We 
ask that they abide by that promise in a very concrete and 
significant manner. A meticulous analysis of theses 
expenditures by a parliamentary commission representing all of 
us in this House would be proof of the government's good faith 
and would allow us to seriously  inform the public as to the 
extent of the excessive expenses within government itself.
<P>
	The whole issue of national defence will have to be rethought 
in the light of the new geopolitical world map. The Bloc 
Quebecois will closely follow the federal task force in charge of 
this operation. Meanwhile, however, all capital expenditures 
should be frozen.
<P>
	This is only part of the way of life of our government. There is 
another aspect which was omitted in the Speech from the 
Throne. The federal government refuses to recognize the real 
scope of it, that is the duplication of federal and provincial 
activities. What exactly is the cost of that constant grappling 
between the federal and the provinces?
<P>
	A curious turnaround occurred in the way even the most 
fervent federalists themselves analyze the operation of the 
present system. Until recently, they praised the government for 
having achieved the optimum sharing of powers between the 
two levels. But we cannot keep on deluding ourselves; it is quite 
common now for people to denounce the bureaucratic 
duplication and the waste it causes.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In 1991 the Canadian Treasury Board conducted a study of 
overlapping federal and provincial programs. The study 
involved 453 different federal programs in 119 Departments, 
Crown corporations or other federal organizations, with a total 
budget of $96 billion. Forty-five per cent of these programs, 
which account for $40 billion in expenditures, overlapped 
directly with provincial programs.
<P>
	In other words, overlapping is the rule rather than the 
exception. The Bélanger-Campeau Commission concluded that 
if we could do away with this situation, we could save billions of 
dollars. According to the Quebec government itself, in the area 
of manpower and employment training alone, the overlapping is 
costing Quebec taxpayers $250 million a year. The federal and 
provincial structures in the field of manpower adjustment and 
training services include more than 50 programs and 
sub-programs for the same people who are thus left to wander in 
a maze of services.
<P>
	Right now, in Quebec, we are in the incredible situation 
whereby 75,000 to 90,000 jobs cannot be filled due to a lack of 
skilled labour, when over 25,000 Quebecers are waiting to be 
trained.
<P>
	This is at the heart of the dysfunctional federalism and the 
legitimacy crisis which is paralysing Canada. This 
administrative mess comes from the very nature of the system. 
However, this is also a sign of the willingness of the government 
to tolerate waste. Here is a real bonanza, an opportunity to save 
money and increase efficiency at all levels of government. But 
the federal government refuses because of its centralising 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="39"> 39 </A></B>
<P>
ideology, its veneration of the status quo or simply because of 
petty politics.
<P>
	Another area were the government is not taking its 
responsibilities has to do with public probity. It is praiseworthy 
to talk about promoting parliamentary democracy and deferring 
to the moral authority of the Speaker, but when searching for 
ways to enhance the credibility of parliamentarians, it is too 
easy to make only cosmetic reforms. The Speech from the 
Throne fails to recognize that the first step to take to ensure an 
ethical public service is to institute party financing by the 
people. When will federal parties forego the unlimited 
contributions they get from large corporations? When will they 
finally get out from under their hold? The Bloc, for one, made 
the necessary sacrifices to enter this House with its hands free. 
Of its free will, it adopted the restrictions provided by the 
Quebec legislation, drawing its inspiration from one of the great 
democratic principles passed down to us by René Lévesque. To 
talk about a political code of ethics and to think openness can be 
achieved without reforming party financing is just smoke and 
mirrors.
<P>
	The opportunities flowing from the generalities of the Speech 
from the Throne are no better in the area of equity. First, the 
omissions of the abbreviated red book that serves as a Speech 
from the Throne say a lot about the Liberal complacency where 
fiscal inequities are concerned.
<P>
	Canadians are not all equal before the tax system. Some 
benefit from tax shelters that have no economic justification. 
Some sell smuggled cigarettes or liquor and others buy them. 
Several avoid paying any tax, thanks to the underground 
economy whose rapid expansion is a measure of the poor 
performance of the GST. This tax, which was supposed to bring 
in $16.5 billion of federal revenue in 1991, yielded only $15 
billion in 1993. The government's legitimacy is still losing 
ground while the idea that it is OK to evade taxation is gaining 
ground.
<P>
	Some adjustments must be made. First, illegitimate tax 
shelters must disappear. Second, smuggling must be eradicated. 
In fact, there is only one peaceful way to do this and that is to 
pull the carpet out from under the smugglers' feet, that is, to 
reduce sharply the price gap between the product sold legally 
and the smuggled one. It has become urgent from a social point 
of view to reduce taxes on tobacco because of all the 
repercussions due to their prohibitive level. If we do not take 
immediate and decisive action, the social contract will continue 
to be broken a little bit more every day.
<P>
	Inequity breeds inequity. Not only will wealthy families be 
allowed to shelter huge sums of money into trusts but, in a 
blatant example of double standards, the government will 
recoup by reducing the social safety net provided to the 
underprivileged. Lacking the courage to cut into its wasteful 
spending, into federal-provincial duplication and into 
unjustified tax shelters, the government will prefer to make the 
unemployed, the people on welfare and pensioners pay. The 
direct victims of the crisis are about to be described as 
troublemakers at  the very time where they most need the help 
they are used to expect, given the compassion and social 
solidarity held as true Quebec and Canadian values.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We have heard various hypotheses about what the government 
intends to do with the social programs and provincial transfers. 
In the Throne Speech, we heard about ``reform'', ``renewal'', 
``streamlining'', ``restructuring'', ``modernization'', 
``redefinition'' and ``review''. In fact, we heard all the deceitful 
synonyms used by governments trying to avoid the appropriate 
terminology, like cuts, reduction, and decrease. Any extended 
recession tends to increase the income gap between the people at 
the top of the pyramid and those at the bottom. The previous 
government was particularly insensitive to the seriousness of 
the last recession and the hardships it brought about. There is a 
new kind of poverty in Canada. It is unacceptable that the new 
budget cuts be aimed at people already severely affected by 
economic hardships. To work together to get out of the recession 
is one thing. But to do so at the expense of the people who are 
already suffering too much is something the Bloc Quebecois is 
determined to expose and fight. For us in the Bloc, social 
protection is something that remains inviolable.
<P>
	The same goes for federal transfers to the provinces, which 
have been targeted in the last few years. As you know, these 
transfers are used to finance part of the provincial social 
programs. Parliament has yet to be consulted and already the 
government is talking about simply freezing the transfers for the 
next five years. Such a decision would put the blame on the 
provinces for the federal budget crisis, which would be a blatant 
non-truth. Economically, transfer freezing would result in a 
decrease, in constant dollars, of 3.5 percent per capita per year, 
for a total reduction of 18 percent over five years. But in fact, 
more than 60 percent of these payments are made to the poorer 
provinces. Quebec would become a net contributor to the 
federation, which would be a total aberration. And the federal 
government would wash its hands and seem to have a good 
conscience, while the provinces are left to care for the 
underprivileged who have been dealt another blow.
<P>
	With respect to federal inequities towards Quebec, it is hardly 
enough to say that the Speech from the Throne was silent on that 
subject. It would be more appropriate to say that the government 
wants to bury these telling signs of the true fate of Quebec under 
the federal system in Canada. Not a line on that, not a word, not 
even a subtle reference, nothing. The government continues to 
ignore the official statistics, compiled here in Ottawa, which 
clearly show that in many areas Quebec receives a lot less than 
its fair share, namely in the areas of federal procurement, 
federal investments, agriculture, research and development, 
regional development, defence and so on. The media in English 
Canada have blamed the Bloc for putting the emphasis on those 
areas where Quebec is  at a disadvantage and ignoring those 
where our province enjoys an advantage. They accuse us of 
painting a darker picture of the situation without reason. The 
presence of sovereigntists in this House is absolutely necessary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="40"> 40 </A></B>
<P>
to remind people of certain true facts that have been kept in the 
dark.
<P>
	It is very simple and one does not need a long list of statistics 
to understand what it is all about. In fact, one just has to look at 
the most recent data available, which show that Quebec receives 
from the federal government about the same amount it sends to 
Ottawa in taxes, converting of course the present deficits of the 
federal government in future taxes. Thanks to their deficits, the 
federal authorities can spend in each province more than they 
levy in taxes. But just wait to see the bill that the next generation 
will have to pay!
<P>
	Some are in a hurry to point out that, as a poorer member of 
the federation, Quebec will receive equalization payments 
totalling $3.7 billion in 1993-94. But the original purpose of 
equalization was to bridge the gap between poorer and richer 
provinces, was it not? In other words, equalization should 
represent a real supplement for those provinces which receive it. 
It so happens that Quebec does not get a supplement. The 
equalization payments that Quebec receives are only to 
compensate for what the province does not get from the federal 
government in other areas. So Quebec has to finance its own 
equalization payments. In reality, equalization in Canada is a 
transfer from rich English-speaking provinces to poor 
English-speaking provinces.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	For Quebec, equalization is only meagre compensation for the 
considerable loss of potential revenue in the form of federal 
spending on job creation. For instance, the equalization system 
does not compensate for the substantial advantage enjoyed by 
Ontario's economy as a result of concentrated federal spending 
on research and development.
<P>
	This unfair division of government spending is not just some 
perverse result of the federal system but is part and parcel of that 
system.
<P>
	So how does all this fit in with what we intend to do during the 
months to come?
<P>
	First of all, there is a way to reduce the federal deficit by 
several billion dollars, starting with the next fiscal year, without 
affecting the social safety net and transfer payments to the 
provinces which are basically earmarked for social programs. 
This would have a significant impact on financial markets and 
thus on interest rates. A drop of one percentage point would put 
$8 billion annually back into the pockets of consumers and 
businesses and at the same time ease the servicing of federal and 
provincial debts. The impact would be vastly superior to that of 
the government's infrastructure program.
<P>
	In the present context, however, it is not enough to simply 
reduce the deficit. Steps must also be taken to strengthen 
productivity, the backbone of the Canadian and Quebec 
economies. If interest rates continue to go down, there will be a 
recovery in the consumption of durable goods, including 
housing and cars. However, the production side will also need a 
boost. This would include helping more vulnerable sectors find 
a new niche. That is the way of the jobs of the future. Increasing 
research and development, an area where Canada is clearly 
lagging behind other Western countries, and easing the 
conversion of much of our military industry would be a priority 
as far as we are concerned. Once the economy has been nudged 
on its way to recovery, it will generate tax revenues that will 
help bring the federal deficit back to acceptable proportions. 
Cuts may be necessary, but cuts alone are not enough.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to repeat that unlike the 
government, members of the Bloc Quebecois will not evade any 
of the issues this Parliament will have to face. We will not 
tolerate the government's refusal to deal with Quebec's 
aspirations. Let it not be said that it was for nothing that the 
majority of federalists and all Quebec sovereignists struggled, 
each in their own way, for thirty years to give Quebec the tools to 
develop as a people. What Quebec started in the Sixties must be 
allowed to come to fruition.
<P>
	After the concept of a nation was established, after mobilizing 
Quebec society, after the efforts of Jean Lesage, the 
manoeuvring of Robert Bourassa and the courage of René 
Lévesque, there must be more than the evasive platitudes of the 
Prime Minister. He should realize that the history of Quebec did 
not stop on a certain night in November in 1981, behind closed 
doors in the Château Laurier. I suggest he look at the 54 
members of this party sitting here today and remember who sent 
us here and the mandate we were given.
<P>
	Then he will realize that Quebec's future as a sovereign 
country is just one step ahead, a sovereign country that is 
Canada's neighbour and friend.
<P>
	I move, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition in the 
House of Commons and member for Roberval,
<P>

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before anything else, let me congratulate you on your election 
last Monday which was exceptional in a way. As you know, your 
role is a fundamental one in our democratic institutions. Let me 
assure you today that my government and the members of my 
party will support you at all times and will try to facilitate your 
work in every possible way.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the two members who moved 
the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, the 
members for Bruce-Grey and Madawaska-Victoria. 
Although they are new at this, they showed us how wise their 
constituents were in choosing them as their representatives in 
this House.
<P>
	I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that they will enjoy a long and 
outstanding career in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no greater honour than standing before you in this 
House as Prime Minister of Canada. I will do my best to make a 
contribution to this great work in progress we know as Canada. 
In fact, each of us in this House has a role to play and a 
responsibility in that area.
<P>
	I want to salute and welcome the men and women from all 
parties whom Canadians elected to the House of Commons on 
October 25.
<P>
	This session of Parliament has an unprecedented number of 
new members. More than two-thirds of the women and men in 
this House are new to Parliament. It is the biggest injection of 
new energy in the history of this institution. I look forward to the 
new spirit that will come from this fresh Parliament. Canadians 
are looking for members of all parties in this House to work 
together in a very constructive way and I am confident that we 
can work together on many issues of importance to the people of 
our constituencies and of our country as a whole.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If there are a record number of new members in the House, 
there are also a few well-known figures such as the Government 
House leader who has been part of our political scene for 31 
years, I am told, and other veterans such as the members for 
Ottawa-Vanier and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who have been 
present in this House for so long they should serve as models for 
many of us. I would also call upon the many new party members 
to consult them occasionally as they could be of service. They 
are familiar with this House and have made some very positive 
contributions throughout their successful career.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the people of the 
constituency of Saint-Maurice, a region that knows me and 
understands me very well. I want my constituents to know that I 
will work hard for them and that I am deeply honoured to serve 
for the ninth time in my life as the honourable member for 
Saint-Maurice, a responsibility which gives me the greatest 
pleasure of all. I will always be very grateful for this 
opportunity.
<P>
	The people of Saint-Maurice want the same things as their 
fellow Canadians across the country. They want their 
government and their elected representatives to begin the 
much-needed process of healing the country. They want them to 
set aside old grievances and debates and to focus on building a 
country that we will be proud to leave to our children.
<P>
	What kind of country do the constituents of Saint-Maurice 
want? What kind of country do Canadians want? They want a 
country full of hope instead of fear, a country where each person 
is an equal partner and can make a contribution, rather than be a 
burden to society. They want a country where adults can find a 
decent, interesting job, a country where children can dream of a 
happy future. They want a country that recognizes our 
communities as the pillars of social stability and economic 
strength, a country with a dynamic economy, one which fosters 
the entrepreneurial spirit and which is on the cutting edge of 
technological progress and change.
<P>
	They want a country where the government listens to them 
and respects them. Finally, they want a competent, honest and 
fair government, one that keeps its promises and helps them 
achieve their potential. That is what Canadians want and that is 
what this government will endeavour to give them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Everything we do during this Parliament will be aimed at 
healing the deep wounds in our country, at restoring the bonds of 
trust and respect between Canadians and the government. It will 
be aimed at rebuilding our economic vitality to ensure that every 
Canadian is able to realize his or her full potential.
<P>
	Canadians voted for that kind of government on October 25. 
Above all, Canadians voted for a government that follows 
through on its commitments, that keeps its word and lives up to 
its promises.
<P>
	From the moment we took office a little more than two months 
ago we have been working to keep the pledges we made to the 
Canadian people. We have done what we said we would do.
<P>
	For example, on November 4 we cancelled the $5.8 billion 
helicopter program, a luxury we did not need and could not 
afford. The same day we introduced a 23-member cabinet, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="42"> 42 </A></B>
<P>
smallest ever. We cut $10 million from the offices of ministers 
and we reduced the size of the Prime Minister's Office.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Last Sunday the whip introduced a program to give a good 
example of where this institution has decided to cut by $5 
million the expenses that we have to incur as a Parliament. In the 
week since then we moved immediately to implement the 
national infrastructure program. In fact this month we will sign 
infrastructure agreements with every province and projects to 
put people back to work will get started in a matter of days and 
weeks.
<P>
	We sought and received improvements to enable Canada to 
sign NAFTA. We helped to negotiate a GATT agreement that 
opens new horizons for increased exports abroad and increased 
jobs at home.
<P>
	We reviewed the Pearson airport deal and cancelled it because 
it did not serve the interests of taxpayers.
<P>
	We appointed a new Governor of the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	We levelled with Canadians about the size of the deficit that 
we generated and about the huge debt that we will have to carry 
and we set up a new consultative process for the next budget.
<P>
	In our first meeting with provincial premiers we began work 
on such issues as eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, 
ending duplication between levels of government and reforming 
the tax system, including replacing the GST.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have done all that in a little over two months. Each of 
these measures is linked to a specific promise made during the 
electoral campaign. And now, in the Speech from the Throne, we 
are continuing to keep our promises. In fact, I was quite pleased 
to read the headline in <I>La Presse</I> this morning; there had been 
others like it during the campaign that had been just as positive.
<P>
	The Speech from the Throne, like this government's mandate, 
originates from the red book, the title of which is <I>Creating 
Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada</I>. We have provided 
Canadians with an action plan. We have run the risk of 
submitting a complete and detailed plan of action. We have done 
what no other party had ever done before.
<P>
	Canadians are not afraid to go off the beaten path. They were 
not expecting miracles either. What they want and deserve is a 
government capable of taking up difficult challenges.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the campaign I called it realistic hope for a better 
future for themselves and their children, for a prosperous 
economy in which they can contribute, for a society that is 
compassionate and caring, for communities that are safe and 
decent, for a government that represents them, that believes in 
the same things they do.
<P>
	Canadians opted for realistic hope for the future and they 
invested their hopes in this government. On behalf of the men 
and women who were elected to form this government I would 
like to tell the Canadian people we will not let them down. What 
we will do is work to respect what we said to the Canadian 
people we were going to do.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	This throne speech marks an important step in renewing the 
faith of Canadians in their institution. The agenda is ambitious 
but it is doable and it is the agenda Canadians have chosen. We 
must build on the goodwill and the renewed confidence in 
institutions that the government's actions have created among 
Canadians. The people of Canada said loudly and clearly during 
the election that they want to return integrity and honesty to 
government.
<P>
	The government understands that desire and will act on it with 
concrete measures early in this session. We have already sent 
very important signals. The work of the Hon. Mitchell Sharp is a 
powerful message to Canadians that government can be a force 
for good in society, that public life is a very honourable calling 
and that we are here to serve others, not ourselves. That is how 
we intend to conduct ourselves throughout our mandate.
<P>
	However it is not enough to clean up the system. Canadians 
voted for something more. They voted to return power to the 
elected representatives here in the House of Commons. We 
made commitments to the Canadian people to give the House 
and members of Parliament new relevance so that it once again 
becomes the focus of political debate and decision making in our 
government.
<P>
	The government House leader will bring forward changes to 
the rules and practices of this place. We will give a much greater 
role to parliamentary committees.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have asked the finance committee to come up with 
alternatives to the GST. Later on in the year, I will ask that they 
be closely associated with pre-budget consultations. The 
government will ask the parliamentary committees to submit 
our strategic policy as it relates to foreign relations and defence 
to a thorough examination.
<P>
	This government is serious about the need for real political 
debates to be held in this House before decisions are made.
<P>
	Earlier, during question period, the Minister of Finance 
suggested that a pre-budget debate be held in the House of 
Commons to allow the members to express their views on the 
coming budget, and I wish to commend him for that initiative.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="43"> 43 </A></B>
<P>
	We will also have a debate in this House on the role of our 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia because, as you 
know, difficult decisions will have to be made when the time 
comes to renew mandates, in March and April. And I want the 
hon. members to have an opportunity to debate the issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like members to have the occasion to debate it before, 
including the members of my party. I would like everyone to 
speak very frankly. After that we will make a decision knowing 
what everyone thinks. Particularly for my party it will be 
unusual because some members may take a position that is not in 
accordance with what we will eventually decide. However in a 
democracy we go along with the majority view, the decision of 
the authorities. I hope the opposition parties will realize this is a 
new opportunity we are giving to this Parliament so that we can 
know exactly what members think before, rather than us making 
the decision. I have been there. It is a terrible job to be in the 
opposition and I do not want to go back there.
<P>
	I want members to speak first. Of course they will criticize 
after that, but we will compare their first speech and the second 
one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These reforms are part of our efforts to bring government 
closer to the people and to restore trust between them.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	A government must act in the best interest of all members of 
society, mainly by promoting job creation, fostering economic 
growth and creating opportunities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The economic policy of this government can be summarized 
in two words: jobs and growth.
<P>
	During the course of this debate the President of the Treasury 
Board will speak about the national infrastructure program. The 
Minister of Industry will elaborate on government policy with 
respect to small and medium sized business. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development will speak about the youth 
corps and programs to help the transition from school to the 
workplace. The Minister of Finance has begun a consultative 
process across Canada before presenting next month's budget. 
He is committed to getting the economy moving and to creating 
jobs.
<P>
	Through a combination of expenditure restraint and economic 
growth we will succeed in reducing the deficit. We are 
determined to achieve our goal of 3 per cent of the deficit in 
relation to the GDP.
<P>
	We will not throw people out of work simply to be able to say 
that the deficit has come down. Yesterday the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria said it very clearly in a way we on this 
side believe it should be said, as do some on the other side too. 
He used a phrase all of us should  keep in mind: the government 
should be lean but not mean.
<P>
	In fact our approach to economic policy will be guided by the 
need to prepare Canadians for the jobs and economic 
opportunities of the 1990s and the 21st century.
<P>
	We will invest in Canadians, in training programs and 
programs to improve literacy and other basic skills.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our agenda for job creation and economic revival is an 
ambitious one and, as everyone knows, our resources are 
limited. A government cannot do everything and, in 1994, it 
should not try to. This is why we are going to count on 
partnership to boost growth and job creation.
<P>
	We will work in partnership with other levels of government 
to implement our infrastructure program, to reduce internal 
barriers to trade, to replace the GST and to reform our social 
programs.
<P>
	We will work in partnership with the private sector for job 
training and the youth service corps and for helping-and this is 
very important-financial institutions to better recognize and 
better meet the capital needs of small and medium-sized 
businesses.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This partnership will also extend to our work in knitting 
together a stronger social fabric in Canada.
<P>
	Our number one focus will be the economy, but a strong 
economy is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end, to better 
lives for Canadian families, to healthy caring communities, to a 
decent quality of life. This is the essence of what being a 
Canadian is all about.
<P>
	Canada's social security system was created by successive 
federal governments. A cornerstone of our philosophy is the 
principle of shared social responsibility. We are extremely 
proud of the Liberal legacy in social policy. In fact, the father of 
our Minister of Finance was one of the fathers of this great 
system. I was here in this House to vote on many of these 
measures.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We believe that people experiencing economic difficulty must 
have income support available to them through social 
assistance. But it is our goal to help people on social assistance 
who are able to work to be able to move from dependence to full 
participation in the economic and social life of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know that the jobless do not want to be unemployed. 
Canadians want to earn their living honourably. They want the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="44"> 44 </A></B>
<P>
dignity of a job. We must therefore design programs which will 
help them find work.
<P>
	We know that the poor do not want to live in poverty. 
Canadians who are able to work do not want to collect welfare. 
Our programs must therefore help, for example, a single mother 
who does not have access to child care services; otherwise, she 
will be forced to remain dependent on the state for many years.
<P>
	We must admit that Canadians have never faced so many 
social and economic challenges since the depression of the 
1930s.
<P>
	The structure of our economy is changing and the family unit 
has been deeply transformed. We must therefore reform our 
social security system to meet the needs of Canadians today.
<P>
	The minister of human resources will announce a process to 
rethink our social security system and to modernize it, in 
co-operation with the provinces and for the greater good of all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the course of this debate the Minister of Health will 
speak about the commitment of this government to health care 
and to women's health issues. The Minister of Justice will speak 
about measures we will take to protect individuals from crime 
and violence in their homes. He will speak about measures 
which enhance our commitment to the fundamental equality of 
Canadians.
<P>
	These are areas in which a society is judged. This government 
wants to play its role in ensuring the fabric of Canadian life 
continues to be tolerant and generous and that the quality of life 
we all cherish and which is so distinctively Canadian improves 
and benefits all Canadians.
<P>
	The agenda is full and it will require co-operation and a sense 
of a shared mission which our country has not seen for a long 
time, the kind of spirit we saw at the first ministers meeting in 
December. Canadians are ready for this national will. They want 
those of us who are in responsible positions in government and 
the private sector to work together toward those worthy national 
goals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his 
speech. It is a first in the House of Commons, in a quite 
unprecedented situation, as he said himself. I do not intend to 
respond to all the arguments he put forward, because I think the 
debate would be rather sterile. In the election campaign, we 
talked a lot about jobs, we talked a lot about the deficit in 
Quebec and we maybe talked a little about independence and 
separation, but not much. I know that if I got into that subject, I 
would not be fulfilling the mandate which I received from the 
people of our country.
<P>
	Besides, my convictions are well known. I have been here for 
many years. I would just like to tell you that my convictions 
about Canada are based perhaps on a text which describes our 
country very well. A hundred years ago, one of my predecessors, 
Laurier, spoke thus, as the twentieth century approached:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are French Canadians, but our country is not limited to the territory around 
the Citadel in Quebec; our country is Canada. Our fellow citizens are not only 
those who have French blood in their veins. They are all those, regardless of race 
or language, who have come here among us as a result of the vagaries of war or the 
whims of fortune or by their own choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	These words are just as appropriate today, on the eve of the 
21st century, as they were at the beginning of the 20th century.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I also want to mention that it 
is true that we did not get as many votes as the Bloc québécois. 
We will change that next time, but it is the reality now.
<P>
	But I have something to say to the hon. members who were 
elected in Quebec and who are French-speaking Canadians like 
me. Something happened this week in this House, something 
which they should have noted. First, we chose a Speaker. Two 
French-Canadians from Ontario got the same number of votes in 
the fifth ballot, which means that, at one point, all the members 
of this House voted for a French Canadian. One won and one 
lost. But in a sense it is very telling that a person like the hon. 
member for Ottawa-Vanier who, throughout his career, has 
always been proud to be a francophone and has always said it 
loud and clear, got such support.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria, in New Brunswick, rose in this House to 
second the motion in reply to the speech from the Throne.
<P>
	I have had the great honour of being the member for 
Beauséjour and to rise in this House to represent francophones, 
francophones from New Brunswick, and Acadians who were 
deported and who came back. And those one million 
francophones outside Quebec are part of my country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The Leader of the 
Opposition talked about progress and about preparing for the 
21st century. I agree with him. I look around this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
I see these members of different colours, religions and 
languages who are all members of the same family in my party 
and of the same country of Canada.
<P>

<P>
	If we know how to capitalize on our strengths and our 
potential, if we look for new solutions, and if, while facing the 
tasks awaiting us, we can communicate our hopes and our 
energy, we will restore the confidence of Canadians in their 
government. A country which was able to overcome its 
problems, which is competitive and which becomes more 
powerful and more independent, is a country which will be a 
model and an inspiration throughout the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In short, what Canadians want is a country to be proud of and 
to believe in. That is the challenge not only for this government 
but for this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	It is in that spirit that I invite the men and women of all parties 
in this House to join us in this national effort. I invite them to put 
aside old tactics that have so frustrated and embittered 
Canadians. I invite them to work with us in improving this 
country.
<P>
	I am convinced that the new spirit that men and women 
elected to this House are bringing with them makes it possible 
for us to enter a new constructive era together. We all have an 
obligation to uphold the confidence Canadians have invested in 
each and every one of us.
<P>
	Together we can prove that their confidence was not 
misplaced. Together we can do what every generation of 
Canadians did when put to the test and that is to meet challenges 
head on, beat the odds and build the country.
<P>
	It is our mission to take this country and prepare it for the 21st 
century, to make sure that we will give our children and our 
grandchildren this land of freedom, opportunity and justice 
which is an example to the world. Today, as Prime Minister of 
this land, I tell everyone that the world needs the understanding, 
tolerance and justice that this country has been able to prove 
over the years. For me Canada is and will always be number one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to begin by congratulating you on your election to the 
office of Speaker and to offer you the co-operation and support 
of our Reform members.
<P>
	Canadians made it abundantly clear on October 25, 1993 that 
they were not pleased with the performance of many members of 
the 34th Parliament and that they clearly expected a different 
style of conduct from the members of this Parliament.
<P>
	As both a member and the presiding officer of this House you 
have a mandate from the people to encourage a higher standard 
of behaviour. As a group, we pledge our co-operation with you 
in discharging that mandate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate all members for their 
election to the Canadian Parliament, and in particular the right 
hon. member for Saint-Maurice who was elected prime minister 
of Canada.
<P>
	There are several people whose ambition to become prime 
minister exceeded that of the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, but very 
few people have served their country, the House of Commons 
and the government as faithfully as he has. I think it is important 
for new members in this House to see that not only ambition, but 
experience, knowledge and dedication are also rewarded.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	A great man once said: He who wants to be a leader must be at 
the service of others. We would like to congratulate the Right 
Hon. Jean Chrétien who has become our leader.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, I want to especially thank the electors of Calgary 
Southwest for giving me the opportunity to represent them in 
this House.
<P>
	I know from months of town hall meetings, surveys and door 
knocking that our electors have definite hopes and aspirations 
for this Parliament. They hope against hope that we will be able 
to control federal spending and taxation. They hope that we, the 
members of this Parliament, will be free to represent their 
interests even if that conflicts with our party line. They hope that 
we will be capable of giving to all Canadians a fresh and 
vigorous vision of a new federalism capable of carrying us into 
the 21st century.
<P>
	I feel, as I am sure all members feel, an enormous sense of 
responsibility that we do not frustrate those hopes and 
aspirations.
<P>
	I realize-and many of us as new members have been 
reminded of this on numerous occasions already-that much of 
the conduct of this Chamber is frequently bound by precedent. 
However, there is a sense in which the 35th Parliament should 
consider itself a House beyond precedent.
<P>
	The reduction of the representation of a traditional federal 
party in this House from 152 seats to 2 seats is unprecedented in 
the history of federal politics although this fact does not seem to 
have registered yet on the member for Sherbrooke. The election 
of over 200 new members has already been referred to and is 
also unprecedented. The ideological and geographical 
alignment of the political parties in this House is also 
unprecedented.
<P>
	In other words, in electing this House Canadians themselves 
have broken with precedent. Therefore we believe it would be 
fitting that this House also break with precedent in some 
important areas, especially in the conduct of its own business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="46"> 46 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, our Reform group does not intend to conduct 
itself as a traditional opposition party. We feel ourselves bound 
to rigorously scrutinize everything that the government puts 
forward but we do not consider ourselves bound to oppose 
everything that the government puts forward.
<P>
	In scrutinizing the speech from the throne we will seek to 
identify and give credit to the measures we consider good. We 
will also seek to identify and expose those measures that we 
consider weak or ill-advised but when we do the latter we will 
feel an obligation not simply to criticize or oppose but to offer 
constructive alternatives.
<P>
	We think of this House, which is beyond precedent, as a 
three-cornered House. There is the government, the Official 
Opposition whose members wish to take their province out of 
Canada, and Her Majesty's constructive alternative.
<P>
	In keeping with this positioning, our principal contribution to 
the throne speech debate will be threefold. We will analyse the 
government's program from a variety or perspectives: fiscal, 
economic and social. We will offer proposals for improving the 
government's legislative program in the interests of all 
Canadians and we will put forward a subamendment designed to 
improve the government's program. The passage of our 
subamendment should not be viewed as an expression of 
non-confidence but as a constructive addition which 
government members themselves could support.
<P>
	Allow me then to speak for just a moment on the most 
commendable feature of the speech from the throne, its greatest 
weakness and a proposed improvement.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	We believe that the most commendable feature of the speech 
from the throne is its promise to enhance the credibility of 
Parliament. However the objective of any parliamentary reform 
in our judgment should be to create a freer Parliament, not just a 
more efficient one, a Parliament where members are free to 
express and vote the positions of their constituents even when it 
conflicts with party lines.
<P>
	Parliamentary reform of course, including this type of reform, 
has been promised before. Hopefully this government intends to 
act on its promises. The public is tired of the hollow eloquence 
of words and longs for the eloquence of deeds.
<P>
	For example, nothing would enhance the credibility of 
Parliament more than the institution of genuinely free votes. 
What we and many Canadians would like to see is for the Prime 
Minister to rise in his place today or tomorrow and clearly 
declare to you, Mr. Speaker, the following policy as a policy of 
his government: That the government will not consider the 
defeat of a government motion, including a spending measure, 
to constitute an expression of non-confidence in the 
government unless it is immediately followed by the passage of 
a formal non-confidence vote.
<P>
	That takes about 30 seconds to say. I say to the Prime Minister 
if he were to do that he would be known as the liberator of 
Parliament no matter what.
<P>
	We hope over time that this House and even the media will 
come to see cross-over voting, the number of times that a 
member crosses over party lines in the interest of constituents, 
not as a sign of party weakness or dissension but as a sign of the 
strength of genuine democracy in this Chamber.
<P>
	At the beginning of this session we want to commend the 
government's commitment as contained in the speech from the 
throne to enhance the credibility of Parliament. We think that is 
one of the strongest features of its program if it follows through 
on it.
<P>
	Allow me to turn to the greatest weakness of the government's 
legislative program and the area that we feel is most in need of 
improvement. All members are aware of the fiscal legacy which 
the previous Conservative administration left to the people of 
Canada and to the 35th Parliament. The distinguishing features 
of that legacy are, and this is the bottom line of the fiscal regime 
of the government that preceded this government, a record 
federal deficit for 1992-93 of $40.5 billion and a total federal 
debt as of noon yesterday of $500 billion.
<P>
	I say to hon. members that the greatest challenge facing this 
Parliament, whether their commitments are constitutional, 
social or to jobs, is to control federal overspending. I frankly 
expected that challenge to be acknowledged and addressed more 
forcefully and directly in the government's legislative program, 
not just in a budget two or three months hence.
<P>
	Traditional throne speeches, and this speech is very 
traditional, always listed things that governments proposed to 
do. However the throne speech of a government that is $500 
billion in debt ought to contain a new section listing the things 
that government proposes to stop doing. This speech contains no 
such section. Perhaps the Minister of Finance was not given 
equal time in its preparation. It would be vastly improved if it 
did and if it included such items as the following: a specific 
commitment to stop the payment of premature and excessive 
pensions to parliamentarians; a commitment to stop subsidizing 
crown corporations to the tune of $6 billion per year 
accompanied by a schedule for the gradual elimination of such 
subsidies; a commitment to reduce non-salary overheads of 
government departments and agencies by at least 15 per cent; a 
commitment to stop paying OAS and other income transfers to 
high income households; a commitment to stop regional 
development programs that simply do not work; and a 
commitment to identify and eliminate all unnecessary 
government functions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="47"> 47 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	To remedy this weakness in the government's legislative 
program, I ask this House to consider restricting its spending in 
the fiscal year 1994-95 to less than $153 billion by adding a 
simple spending cap to the government's legislative program.
<P>
	Members familiar with the government's financial statements 
will know that the federal government is currently projected to 
spend $162 billion in 1994-95. The spending cap we propose 
represents a 6 per cent reduction in that amount. How such a 
reduction should be made can be the subject of the budget debate 
and speech. The point of adding the spending cap to the 
government's legislative program now is to send a signal to 
investors and taxpayers that in the very first days of this session 
members on both sides of the House are deadly serious about 
reducing federal spending.
<P>
	The subamendment I will propose is an expression of 
non-confidence in the spending patterns established by the 
previous government. Is there any member of this House, with 
perhaps one or two exceptions, who could not vote for that? This 
amendment or subamendment is not an expression of 
non-confidence in the government's legislative program. It is a 
simple improvement which says: Whatever legislative program 
this House adopts we must not spend more than $153 billion on 
its implementation in 1994-95. I invite all members of the 
House including government members to support this spending 
cap.
<P>
	In conclusion, yesterday members honoured an ancient 
parliamentary tradition by following you, Mr. Speaker, to the 
other place and by listening to the speech from the throne and by 
claiming all the ancient rights of the Commons in the name of 
the people. The most important of these ancient rights, indeed 
the first function of the early British Parliaments, and the first 
function was not a legislative function, the only function of the 
original Parliaments was to constrain the spending of the crown.
<P>
	I implore the members of this House to reassert this right of 
the Commons, not simply in symbolism or in words but by 
legislative action, by crowning the speech from the throne with a 
spending cap.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment of the leader of the opposition be amended by adding 
immediately after the words ``federal administration'' the following words:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>particularly the need to restore public confidence in the ability of this House to 
control the federal deficit and overspending and to limit the government's spending 
in the fiscal year 1994-95 to less than $153 billion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me first of all congratulate you on your election as 
Speaker of the House of Commons. Certainly, your experience 
in Parliament and your qualities of heart and mind contributed to 
your being chosen by your peers. I am sure that you will assume 
your responsibilities with great skill and competence and you 
can certainly count on my support in the performance of your 
duties.
<P>
	I would also like to take the opportunity, as is the custom, to 
congratulate the movers of the motion in reply to the Speech 
from the Throne. In their own way, they each reflect what 
Canada is. With their respective knowledge and abilities, they 
are both a credit to their constituents and have begun a career in 
the Parliament of Canada in fine style, and I wish to commend 
them both.
<P>
	I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the 
Leader of the Opposition, who is not only a friend and a 
classmate but also a fellow parliamentarian, who in this last 
federal election had a very important personal success at the 
polls. Without a doubt, he won part of Quebec opinion over to 
his party, the Bloc Quebecois, and at any rate his personal 
success exceeds what we would have wanted to see in Quebec.
<P>
	In his new responsibilities as a member of the Parliament of 
Canada, I wish him the wisdom not only to meet his 
responsibilities to those who sent him here, but also to discharge 
the role that he must assume as Leader of the Opposition, which 
goes far beyond his own aspirations and what he would like to do 
here in the Canadian Parliament. I do not know how he can 
reconcile this twofold mandate, but I still wish him much 
success in this task.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the leader of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think it is remarkable to see, at the occasion of the federal 
election, a party which began as a regional party reflecting the 
legitimate aspirations of the people of a region more or less 
becoming a national party. I would like to say to its leader at the 
very beginning of this new Parliament that we used to have 
representation by three national parties here in the House of 
Commons that respected the fabric of our institution and of our 
country, that fought vigorously from time to time for their 
respective interests but always understood and fought for a 
bilingual Canada.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear the Reform Party leader speaking in 
French in his first speech in the House of Commons. I think his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="48"> 48 </A></B>
<P>
party, which in its creation was regional, might have by his 
leadership the possibility of becoming a true national party. In 
doing so it would be in the interest of the unity of Canada and the 
continuity of a strong and united Canada from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I want to congratulate all those who have been elected 
in the last election. Our responsibilities as parliamentarians are 
obviously significant but the most difficult test to pass is 
sometimes, in fact always, the election test. And everyone here 
deserves to be congratulated for having passed this test. I for one 
would like to thank my constituents from 
Papineau-Saint-Michel who, for the ninth time, have given me 
their trust and have allowed me to sit again in the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> Let me tell you where I stand in relation to the 
Leader of the Opposition, who speaks with conviction but whose 
argument in this debate I cannot accept. While he wants to build 
a new country, I want to improve mine. It appears to me that his 
approach is as sincere as mine. Like me, he comes from a 
Quebec rural area; he is from Lac-Saint-Jean, I am from 
Saint-Pascal-Kamouraska, in the Lower St. Lawrence region. 
My father was a country doctor, my grandfather a farmer. I 
studied in French. In this country of mine, I gained many times 
the trust and respect of a majority of people who do not speak my 
language, who do not share my culture and whose traditions are 
not the same as mine.
<P>
	Although part of the minority, I was able to work and assume 
responsibilities without any difficulty in this country. The 
Leader of the Opposition himself once assumed very important 
responsibilities within a Canadian government. He himself 
agreed to represent his country, that is, Canada, overseas. He 
was even called ``Excellency'' and he did not complain. This is 
to say that this country is a country of great tolerance, 
compassion and opportunities for everyone who wants to take 
advantage of what it has to offer.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is a clever speaker. Listening to 
his argument, I have noticed that he knows how to skip details 
and caricature the facts.
<P>
	There is no doubt that when he referred to the Meech Lake 
Accord and to the Charlottetown Agreement, he not once 
reminded us that the Parti québécois, which is the head office of 
the Bloc Quebecois, did not want to see the Meech Lake Accord 
nor the Charlottetown Agreement passed. At no time. I accept 
that some people may wish that all possible powers be granted to 
a State, a country separated and independent from Canada, but, 
please, do not make us believe that the Meech Lake Accord or 
the Charlottetown Agreement would have satisfied the Bloc 
Quebecois or the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	So do not accuse those who might have been against the 
Meech Lake Accord of being traitors to Quebec. Many things 
have been said about the Prime Minister who had reservations 
and objections regarding certain aspects of the Meech Lake 
Accord.
<P>
	Why would it be more serious for the Prime Minister, Mr. 
Chrétien, who was an ordinary Canadian at the time, to oppose 
Meech? Why would he be less of a Quebecer than Mr. Parizeau, 
who was also against the accord?
<P>
	In fact, it is obvious that we will never agree in this political 
debate. As the Leader of the Opposition reminded us, for thirty 
years some people have been desperately trying to convince 
Quebecers that they would be better off if they separated from 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Now I want to remind the members across the way, not those 
sitting at both ends but those in the middle, that during all that 
time they have been able to benefit from our democratic system, 
of the Canadian federal system, to express their point of view, to 
put forward their arguments in the greatest respect of democracy 
and of individual opinion.
<P>
	It is an exceptional situation that does not exist in every 
country in the world. A few moments ago, I heard the Leader of 
the Opposition make a comment. The only reason I am 
mentioning this is because he himself talked about it, and I will 
be careful since I do not want the media to quote me incorrectly. 
He said that a number of Central European and East European 
countries had gained their independence, their national 
sovereignty, so why would it not be Quebec's turn to do the 
same. He knows full well the answer to that question.
<P>
	In my capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I had the 
opportunity to discuss with representatives from all those East 
European and Central European countries at the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. How many of those 
people-whether they be from Croatia, from Georgia or from 
other regions of Europe that just became independent-how 
many of those people would give up their newly-gained 
independence to become citizens of the province of Quebec in 
Canada? They would be very happy to be Canadians.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has the habit of always going 
back to the 1981 referendum to claim that it is our Prime 
Minister who, at that time, had-and I can quote him since I took 
notes-``led the assault against Quebec''. Why would he have 
led the assault against Quebec? The hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice was simply defending Canada. He was not 
against Quebec, he was for Canada. Today, many people 
consider it important and useful to defend Canada.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition makes another error when he 
tells us that Quebecers will finally have the opportunity to vote 
for the status quo or for sovereignty in the next referendum. He 
does not recognize the reality of Canadian federalism when he 
talks about the status quo. Canadian federalism evolves 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="49"> 49 </A></B>
<P>
constantly; it is  transformed by decisions made by both federal 
and provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Over the years, the Government of Quebec has obtained a 
series of powers enabling it to take on full responsibility for 
areas under its jurisdiction, and in the past, legislative 
agreements were often used to give Quebec responsibilities 
which the other provinces did not have. My point is that the 
reference to rigid federalism is entirely inaccurate, and I think it 
is unworthy of the Leader of the Opposition, who favours a 
sound and structured debate, to say that the federalism we want 
is status quo federalism.
<P>
	Finally, let me say that when the Leader of the Opposition 
starts speaking on behalf of Quebec, he is somewhat 
exaggerating his mandate and his role. He does not speak for 
Quebec. He may speak for Quebecers but he does not speak for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Just now, he was saying that fifty members of the Bloc 
quebecois were elected because there was a political and 
economic crisis and it was therefore the Bloc's mission to try 
and deal with the recession and later on to deal with the political 
crisis through sovereignty.
<P>
	I think he should at least realize this: If he and his fifty or so 
members were elected because of the economic situation and the 
political situation, he will have to admit there are people in 
Quebec who voted for him because of the economic situation 
and who did not vote for him for his political option.
<P>
	The votes he got, if what he said earlier is still true, came from 
people who were fed up with Tory mismanagement, wanted to 
get rid of the former Conservative government and voted for 
him instead of for us.
<P>
	However, in the process they did not give him the power to 
speak up for sovereignty and Quebec's independence. They gave 
him a mandate to discuss economic questions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Incredible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> The hon. member may think that sounds 
incredible, but I would like to say, in concluding, that I realize 
the Leader of the Opposition has certain responsibilities in this 
House and that he must act accordingly. I admit that during his 
speech he spoke at length about economic issues, and I agree 
that when the Leader of the Opposition talks about the economy, 
when he talks about unemployment and when he talks about 
social measures, he is doing what he is supposed to do as the 
Leader of the Opposition, of what is referred to as Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition.
<P>
	However, when he switches to his role as a supporter of 
Quebec's independence, he is no longer playing his part as 
leader of the opposition in a Canadian parliamentary system, 
under our Canadian Constitution. When he supports secession 
for Quebec, he is going far beyond the normal role of a leader of 
the opposition, whose aspirations are to become prime minister 
of the legitimate government, not to become the head of an 
independent State.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I do not see how he will manage to reconcile these two roles. I 
know that he takes 100 per cent of the salary of the opposition 
leader as well as 100 per cent of all the benefits that go with the 
job. I can tell him that in his speech, today, he earned only 75 per 
cent of his salary.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that the debate we must have 
with the Canadian population regarding the future of Quebec is a 
very important one. During the hearings of the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, we hardly touched on the 
problems. The Leader of the Opposition referred to a document 
dealing with duplication. I must remind him, as he knows for 
sure, that this document was not prepared by the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, it was submitted to it. It was 
discussed by the Commission, but not commissioned by it. It 
was commissioned by Mr. Claude Morin for some students and 
faculties of the school of public administration (ENAP) in 
Quebec. Clearly, this is not a document you can consider to be 
thorough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I heard the Minister of Foreign Affairs a while ago 
comment at length the speech of my leader, the Leader of the 
Opposition, I thought I was in the twilight zone. It was as though 
the minister had never lived through the last 15 or 20 years in 
Quebec and in Canada. It was as though the member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel and his leader had never participated 
in the night of the long knives or the Meech failure. I also was 
led to believe that the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel had 
never worked for the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, that he 
had not understood the overwhelming message of the men and 
women of Quebec who testified in front of that commission. It 
was as though the reply of September 24, 1991, that of 
Beaudoin-Dobbie and of Beaudoin-Edwards, the July 7th 
Agreement, as well as the Charlottetown Agreement, rejected 
with a massive majority by Quebecers, had never existed. In one 
word, I thought I was on another planet.
<P>
	When I heard the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel 
question the legitimacy of the vote expressed by Quebecers and 
the legitimacy of the Bloc Quebecois as the Official Opposition, 
that helped me understand how the member viewed democracy. 
If the existence of the Bloc Quebecois has but one merit, Mr. 
Speaker, it is certainly that of having launched the debate on the 
future of Quebec and of Canada and that was our first objective. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="50"> 50 </A></B>
<P>
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would urge the  member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel to be a bit more democratic in the 
future when he speaks about the Bloc Quebecois and about its 
role as the Official Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the member 
and to remind him that I am not questioning the legitimacy of the 
Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament. I congratulated him 
for being elected and bringing with him fifty or so members. 
What I said is that, once here, he cannot claim that he won 
strictly on the strength of his separatist platform. In this respect, 
I quoted his own speech in which he said that he came here 
because there was a problem with the economy. People voted for 
him and for BQ candidates not because of their political 
message but because of the economic situation. What I do not 
like is for the Leader of the Opposition to claim, as he just did in 
his remarks, that the referendum debate has started.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	If he wants to have a referendum debate here in this House, he 
might have the opportunity to do so. But above all, what is really 
important is for him to have a real dialogue on the ins and outs of 
such a process, and that is what I urge him to do. 
Bélanger-Campeau did not conduct such an in depth study. I sat 
on that commission and I saw how those who appeared in front 
of it and those who were leading the debate were all of the same 
mind and going in the same direction.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, all those supposedly non-aligned people 
are now joining the ranks of the Parti Quebecois, starting with 
Mr. Campeau and his cohorts. We now know that all those who 
then claimed to be non-aligned were indeed biased.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel be so kind as to 
clear up a point for me? Ever since the Liberal convention when 
the hon. member for Saint-Maurice became leader of the 
Liberal Party, it has been quite clear that from then on we would 
not hear a single word on the Constitution. That policy was 
confirmed after the demise of the Charlottetown Accord in 
English-speaking Canada and in Quebec. It was stated again 
during the election campaign that we would not hear any more 
about the Constitution. The economy would be the only topic for 
discussion.
<P>
	But except for the few civilities that are in order, the 
Constitution was the only theme of the hon. member's speech. 
Are we to infer that the Cabinet is divided over this issue and 
that you are going to vote for the amendment moved by the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest and leader of the Reform Party 
to the effect that there should be more free votes in this House? I 
get the impression that you would feel more comfortable that 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> I welcome the hon. member's response to my 
comments. He speaks just like all other people in Quebec who 
resent Quebecers being told they stand to gain from being part of 
Canada. Each and every time we tell Quebecers there are 
benefits for them in being part of the Canadian federation, the 
proponents of Quebec independence always try to delude people 
into believing that our comments are inappropriate and 
inconsistent. Mr. Speaker, an enlightened debate on the 
consequences an independent Quebec would have is certainly in 
order.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> I am delighted to see those members applaud. I 
am glad they sit in this House because their contacts with other 
members will help them do away with parochialism, widen their 
horizons and understand that there is a place in Canada, and a 
good one at that, for Quebecers who want to be part of this 
country and be respected in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I seek your guidance. Do I 
have the floor for a comment or for my speech?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are two minutes left in the 
question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> I will be pleased to use 
them to say a few words to the hon. minister who has just 
spoken. He says we do not speak for the men and women of 
Quebec, I wonder whose interest he has at heart?
<P>
	When he says that we have benefitted a lot from federalism, 
he fails to mention that we had to fight the system in order to get 
what we got. Remember the fight of Jean Lesage. Remember the 
fight of Mr. Johnson, the real one, Daniel. Remember the fight 
of Mr. Bertrand-
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments 
has now expired. I think that the hon. member for Richelieu is 
next.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank members for not voting against me 
yesterday when my election was proposed. I have not worn this 
gown for 15 years; I am glad to see that it still fits. I want you to 
know that to get anywhere here you need to have names like my 
colleague's and mine.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More seriously, I will no doubt make mistakes over the weeks 
and months to come that will entail some problems and I would 
like to ask members from all sides to be patient.
<P>
	The hon. member for Richelieu has the floor.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="51"> 51 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate you on your election and to congratulate 
also the Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of the Committees 
of the Whole for their appointment. As our leader has already 
done, I want to assure you that you do have our full trust, 
support and collaboration and that you have my personal 
support.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity, as this is my first 
speech, to congratulate the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, Prime 
Minister, my leader, the Leader of the Opposition, and the leader 
of the Reform Party for their election and to extend those 
congratulations to all the members present here tonight.
<P>
	Before I begin my speech, I would like to complete my 
comment since I am lucky enough to speak right after the 
question period following the speech of the hon. minister. I 
would like to remind him of all the great battles we fought 
against federalism just to obtain a few crumbs. Let him 
remember also that federalism gave us the War Measures Act 
and the 1982 Constitution, signed without Quebec's consent. I 
can still see the Prime Minister and you sitting in front of the 
Parliament with the Queen of England in 1982 and celebrating 
the exclusion of Quebec from the Constitution; Quebecers 
remember also and maybe that is one reason why there are so 
many of us representing the Bloc Quebecois here.
<P>
	That is what you did. In 1982, you were with the Prime 
Minister celebrating the exclusion of Quebec. Would you have 
done so if another province had declined to sign the 
Constitution? Never! Quebecers did not forget and they wanted 
to show you so clearly by their votes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like first of all to sincerely thank my 
constituents in the riding of Richelieu who have once again 
placed their confidence in me in the election of October 25.
<P>
	The riding of Richelieu, which I am proud to represent here, is 
typical of Quebec as a whole. For one thing, over 65 per cent of 
my constituents voted for the Bloc Quebecois. Moreover, these 
people are going through very harsh economic times.
<P>
	The riding is characterized by an active agricultural life, 
dynamic industries, the presence of members of the Abenaki 
Nation, seaport operations and burgeoning cultural activities. 
There are towns like Sorel, whose history goes back 350 years, 
and Nicolet, with its Museum of Religions. I could also mention 
the beautiful farmlands of St-Ours, Ste-Victoire, St-Robert, 
St-Aimé, Baie-du-Febvre, Ste-Gertrude and parts of the lovely 
towns of Bécancour, La Visitation, St-Zéphirin, Précieux Sang 
and Nicolet. There are also the commercial fishermen in 
Pierreville and St-François, the big iron and steel companies in 
Sorel and Tracy and the high technology companies of the 
Bécancour industrial park, the biggest industrial park in Quebec 
and the whole of Canada. Unfortunately, as elsewhere in 
Quebec, the region is struggling with an unusually high  
unemployment rate and some serious social problems, like 
poverty and dropping out of school.
<P>
	On September 4, 1984, I was elected for the first time as a 
member of this House. The mandate my constituents gave me 
was clear: I was supposed to strive to bring about real change 
and fight for their interests. During the debate on the first 
Speech from the Throne of the conservative government, I 
denounced the waste and chaos resulting from 15 years of liberal 
power. Pierre Trudeau's team, of which today's Prime Minister 
was one of the main actors, left Canada a huge debt, inconsistent 
policies and constitutional squabbles that were almost 
institutionalized.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	If I interchanged the names of the parties today in this House, 
I could make almost the same speech as I did in 1984, after the 
Speech from the Throne.
<P>
	We had hoped that things would change for Quebecers and the 
people of Richelieu, but they have not. The Conservatives too 
left Quebecers with an enormous debt, inconsistent policies and 
a constitutional disaster.
<P>
	Unemployment is still alarming and is forcing thousands of 
Canadians into inactivity. More than ever before, businesses 
have problems upgrading their facilities. Like never before, 
farmers will have to face the new GATT realities. Our youth are 
lacking resources to start businesses. The gap between the poor 
and the rich is constantly widening.
<P>
	The people of Richelieu also share with other Quebecers the 
huge legacy that was left by the old federal parties: a $46 billion 
deficit and a $500 billion debt. Think about it: that represents a 
$100 000 one-family house for 5 million Canadian families.
<P>
	The people of my riding must also deal with the overlapping 
between Ottawa and Quebec programs in the areas of 
professional training, health, education, environment, 
communications and assistance to businesses. Another concrete 
example of Quebecers paying twice is the Nicolet Police 
Institute, in my riding.
<P>
	For instance, a municipality such as Tracy, which is located in 
my riding, wants to have one of its police officers specially 
trained in criminal investigations and has to send him to the 
Nicolet Police Institute, but the municipality must pay for the 
cost of that training. On the other hand, for other municipalities 
throughout Canada, there is the Canadian Police College.
<P>
	These municipalities also send their police officers for 
training in specialized fields like criminal investigations, but in 
their case, the federal government pays for all the costs of the 
programs. Quebecers pay 100 per cent of the specialized 
training for their police officers and also 25 per cent for the cost 
of the Canadian Police College, since we represent 25 per cent of 
the Canadian population. That is a concrete example of 
overlapping which I see every day in my riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="52"> 52 </A></B>
<P>
	Would it not be more normal that 25 per cent of the money 
paid to the Canadian Police College be given to the <I>Nicolet 
Police Institute</I>, so that it could offer free training to police 
officers who wish to specialize, the way it is in the rest of 
Canada? Here is a good example of costly duplication for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let me now give you, Mr. Speaker, some of my views on the 
throne speech presented by the Liberals. There is not much there 
to reassure me. I see no clear indication that the liberal 
government intends to deal with the real problems. I believe 
they will be much the same as the Conservatives.
<P>
	What I gathered from that speech is that they are going to try 
and solve the problems of my constituents and Quebec people in 
general with the same, ineffective means used by previous 
governments.
<P>
	What do they propose to deal with these problems? A National 
Forum on Health, when health is a provincial matter. Another 
forum to deal with foreign policy.
<P>
	I could not possibly avoid mentioning the report of the Deputy 
Prime Minister regarding the new Secretariat for the North 
American Commission on Environment. We expected a clear 
decision which would have confirmed the role of Montreal as 
the centre for the environment, but that is not what the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Environment did. She asked a 
private company to prepare a report.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We all know what type of mandates the Tories gave their 
friends who contributed to the election fund. Same solution, 
same procedure. I want them to know we will be on the look-out 
and we will remind the Liberal Party of its commitment in this 
matter. I am eager to see what the price of those consultations 
will be.
<P>
	Let me remind my colleagues across the way that the Auditor 
General's report is very clear on this. By the way, what were they 
all doing yesterday, in the beautiful city of Ottawa, after the 
Speech from the Throne? They were squandering money. And 
what did the Liberals do, after promising to curtail expenses? 
Dressed in tuxedos and ball gowns, they attended the ball of Her 
Majesty's representative. While the poor in my riding, in 
Manitoba and in Newfoundland sat in front of their TV set all 
day hoping for something real to come out of the Speech from 
the Throne, they went dancing. These poor people learned 
almost nothing from the speech; they learned though that you 
were going to the ball.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Did the poor people find a cause for hope? 
No! But no expense was too great for the others-caviar, wine, 
champagne; one hundred dollars per person maybe, 
approximately $100,000 for a party for 900, at a time when 
people are starving. That is what you did yesterday. What 
surprised me most of all was to see the Reform Party members 
join in. You said when you arrived here that you would cut 
everywhere. You  told the shoeshiner, who barely earns $20,000 
a year: ``That's too much! We are sending you back on the dole''. 
But you had no problem with last night's party. They want to cut 
the shoeshiner. They want to eliminate his job. They were even 
ready to discuss the price of a club sandwich in Parliament. Yet, 
they were all dancing about at the Governor's party. Members of 
the Bloc, however, kept their word and refused to be part of 
those unacceptable expenditures.
<P>
	Our party has made the economic recovery one of its 
priorities. The Speech from the Throne does little to give back 
hope to the unemployed in my riding and to all those young 
people who want to work. The infrastructure program 
announced by the Liberals will bring no solution to structural 
unemployment. It will not allow workers to acquire the new 
qualifications they need to get tomorrow's jobs. Quite the 
contrary! It is to be expected that as soon as the work is finished, 
the workers will once more be unemployed.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, our party wants to do its part to 
eliminate the Canadian debt. The Liberal government 
systematically refuses to go to the roots of the public finance 
problem and submit to a rigorous review each and every federal 
department and organization, in order to cut the fat, as my leader 
said earlier. And we all know that there is still a lot of fat to cut. I 
mentioned the Governor General's ball earlier. Again this week, 
we saw how millions of dollars were spent by several federal 
departments to produce videos depicting the life of officers of 
the Canadian forces and on windsurfing safely. These are real 
examples of wasting of public funds and members of this House, 
including those who put on their patent leather shoes to go 
dancing at the Governor General's ball last evening, will have to 
work hard to eliminate such waste.
<P>
	It should be noted that the Liberal government has in no way 
committed itself to reform the tax system in an equitable way 
and to challenge tax shelters such as family trusts. It is 
unacceptable that wealthy families be allowed to hide their 
fortune from the tax man while the burden of the middle class is 
constantly increasing. The Bloc Quebecois will fight in this 
place in order that any reform of taxation and social programs, 
in particular those for the poorest in our society, is done 
according to the principles of equity.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	I must say that I am also extremely concerned by the desire of 
the Liberal government to update, as it says, and to restructure 
social programs. After posturing as the defenders of social 
programs during the last electoral campaign, now the Liberals 
are threatening to do an about face and to slash the social safety 
net protecting Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="53"> 53 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will not allow such a reform to be carried 
out at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our 
society, the very same who are the first ones to be affected by the 
present economic situation.
<P>
	Finally, the Speech from the Throne ignored altogether the 
Liberal promise not to cut transfer payments to the provinces. 
The Liberal government will have to deal with a block of 
members committed to preventing it from carrying out its fiscal 
reform on the back of the provinces, which have been doing 
more than their share for a number of years.
<P>
	On the strength of the mandate given to us by Quebec voters, 
we are determined to talk in this House about real people and 
their problems. During the coming months, my colleagues and I 
will show the many failures of the Canadian federal system. We 
will do so at every opportunity.
<P>
	We will talk about the slow death of Quebec regions, the 
victims of Ottawa's paralysing centralism keeping people in the 
regions in a state of dependency.
<P>
	We will be talking about economic recovery and industrial 
development policies that cannot get off the ground and are 
ineffective because they have fallen victim to all of the illogical 
government programs. We will be talking about the millions of 
dollars wasted left and right without any apparent logic and 
especially without any input from the people directly involved.
<P>
	We will be talking about this country that is buckling under 
the weight of the debt load and that is incapable of achieving the 
necessary consensus to see things through. We will show that the 
sorry state of Canada's public finances is attributable not only to 
the actions of governments, but first and foremost, to a federal 
system which can only result in a stalemate.
<P>
	We will be talking about this country struggling with the 
inconsistency and confusion of overlapping programs. In fact, 
there are more than 50 job training programs and sub-programs, 
not to mention matching programs set up by the provinces, 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	We will expose this system which unfairly allocates job 
creation funds and fails to give Quebec its rightful share.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will speak at great length in the days and 
weeks to come about the real problems. For the first and 
undoubtedly, I hope, the last time in the history of Canada, a 
political party that embodies hope for true change for Quebecers 
will be present in this House.
<P>
	Setting aside arbitrariness and partisanship, the Bloc 
Québécois is here to say what the old federal parties have always 
prevented Quebec from saying.
<P>
	Try as they may to escape reality, the Prime Minister and his 
colleagues will have 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois sitting 
across the floor who, as they were mandated by their voters in 
Quebec, will raise the real issues, flush out the real causes and 
put forward real solutions.
<P>
	Firmly, but also respectfully, honestly and with no hard 
feelings whatsoever, we will explain to our colleagues from the 
rest of Canada what our vision for the future of Quebec is, a 
vision of a sovereign Quebec fully equipped with the tools 
essential to its development.
<P>
	Contrary to what the Liberal government seems to think, for 
us, to talk about the Constitution has little to do with philosophy. 
It deals with concrete things like eliminating costly overlaps and 
waste. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, insist that decisions be made 
by the people who will suffer the consequences. And that is 
exactly what we will do, in accordance with the mandate 
received from our voters, in the riding of Richelieu and 
throughout Quebec, to defend the interests of the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I wish to thank once again the people of my riding for their 
show of confidence and I want them to know how proud I am to 
serve them here, in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what our colleague from 
Richelieu said, and I wish to congratulate him on his re-election 
to the House of Commons. We have known each other for a very 
long time, he and I, and we sat together on several committees, 
interparliamentary bodies and so on.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I was rather surprised by 
what our colleague opposite said. He just said that since his 
arrival in 1984 or almost since then, he has found that the federal 
system was not working and, to quote him, that there was a lot of 
waste.
<P>
	Nevertheless, a few years later, while he was still a member of 
the Conservative government, his present leader, when he got 
elected as a minister-he was a minister even before he was 
elected as the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, as I recall-some 
$25 million in promises had been made for a byelection in 
Lac-Saint-Jean, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> To buy the voters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> May I conclude that the member is now 
apologizing in a way for that by-election his leader won when he 
came to this House a few years later? Even more, given his 
denunciation today, how did he manage to be re-elected under 
the Progressive Conservative banner in 1988 before coming so 
late to this conversion which he just explained to us today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
for his question. I am happy to see him back in the House. I have 
had the honour and pleasure of travelling with him onbusiness 
trips for the IAFSP, the International Assembly of French--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="54"> 54 </A></B>
<P>
Speaking Parliamentarians. I believe we did sit, full of hope, as 
Conservatives, with this difference that we saw the light.
<P>
	I can assure you that one party or the other, it amounts to the 
same thing. In what situation were the Liberals, in 1984? They 
were rejected by the entire Canadian population, from Halifax to 
Vancouver. Why was that? Because they had put Canada almost 
$200 billion into debt. They had completely given up the 
management of the country. They were voted out of office. What 
did the Conservatives do? We chose to believe. I did, I believed 
in the ``beau risque'', in Quebec joining the Confederation 
enthusiastically and with dignity. I too believed in that ``beau 
risque''. I came to this place and, together with capable people 
like the present Leader of the Opposition, we did our best to play 
fair.
<P>
	What happened under the Conservative government from 
1984 to 1993? The national debt grew from $200 billion to $400 
billion, has now reached $500 billion. There were constitutional 
issues then and there are still constitutional issues today. There 
was overlapping and there are still problems in that area.
<P>
	Now, the same people who were voted out of office in 
1984-the government leader and the minister who spoke 
earlier-are back. Why were they voted out? Because they did 
not know how to manage the country, they had put it into debt. 
How will the Liberal Party be remembered in the history of 
Canada? It will be remembered as the party that ruined Canada, 
and you all bear that responsibility when you are elected under 
the Liberal banner. Let us not forget that this is the party that 
voted the Clark government out of office saying: ``With us, there 
will be no tax increases.'' Joe Clark had promised to bring the 
deficit down from $13 billion to $10 billion. Yet the Liberals 
allowed it to rise to $38 billion. They are the first to blame. The 
Conservatives too tried to get the deficit under control. They too 
failed.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the problem rests not with the party in 
office, but with the system. That is want we want to work on.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
direct this question to my colleague from Richelieu.
<P>
	I listened attentively to his comments and particularly to the 
comments of his leader. I listened attentively, as well, to the 
comments from the government benches. It was interesting that 
all these comments had a lot to say about the wallet and very 
little to say about the heart.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	I have spent all my adult life with this debate in Quebec and 
Quebec's place in Confederation. We are going to be revisiting it 
again, but I can assure my hon. colleague that he will be getting 
an honest debate and whatever happens, win, lose or draw, we 
are going to be neighbours. At least he will have an honest 
debate. He will get it from us and I hope from the government.
<P>
	In your comments you mentioned that Montreal would be a

you tell me the names of the other Canadian cities that are in the 
running and why you think Montreal is the favoured city?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I want to remind the hon. members that 
they must address their questions to the Chair. The hon. member 
for Richelieu has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer the last 
question: it was during the conference on the ozone layer, which 
was held in Montreal under the chairmanship of the mayor of 
that city. It was agreed then that, if a secretariat was to be 
established, it would be in Montreal where the international 
conference was being held. It is in that sense that a commitment 
was made and it is in that sense that I was reminding the 
government of that commitment. I was surprised to see the 
Deputy Prime Minister trying to attract this centre in her own 
riding, through a study done by a private business and a small 
contract awarded to someone. This is commonly known as 
patronage and it is in that sense that I raised this issue.
<P>
	Earlier you said that we have also been talking for 30 years 
about debates and the presence of the province of Quebec. We 
agree with you that a debate must take place and we are 
convinced that, given their position, the new members of the 
Reform Party will make a great contribution to this debate. We 
want to have this debate precisely to arrive at some form of 
mutual respect between the two founding nations of this 
country, as well a new economic union based on the existence of 
two sovereign States.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member for Richelieu with reference to 
one of his remarks. In his enthusiasm he may not have meant 
what he said but he indicated that all the Reform members were 
in attendance at the Governor General's last night. Possibly the 
hon. member would like to refer to that remark and correct it for 
<I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, we are also 
former Conservative members, if my memory does not fail me.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that I have never said that I would 
not go to the Governor General's. I really think that it was an 
excessive expenditure. In a time of recession, the cocktail party 
we had at the House, after the Throne Speech, was sufficient. I 
think that we are exaggerating when, in a year of recession, we 
spend another $100 a head for such a party, while the poor are 
having a rough time. That is why I said that. Nonetheless, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="55"> 55 </A></B>
<P>
highly respect the Governor General who represents Her Most 
Gracious Majesty, whom we all like.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate my colleague from Richelieu for his 
excellent depiction of the situation of Quebec within Canada. It 
is true that every time Quebec gained something, it was after 
fighting against the outdated and inefficient system we are in. 
Canada is no longer the place that federalists describe but it is a 
failure that Quebecers will soon want to dissociate themselves 
from.
<P>
	To the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, I say that 
had the Quebecers wanted to vote for federalism, they would 
have voted for you.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	And I will add for the benefit of my colleagues from the 
Liberal Party that while they were dancing at the Governor 
General's ball, I am sure that they were thinking of cutting 
health programs.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but I must interrupt the hon. 
member. I think that your colleague is allowed to reply. You 
have 30 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> I will just thank the hon. member for 
Drummond, with whom I had the honour of dining last night, for 
what she just said. While people were at the Governor General's 
ball, we had supper in a humble restaurant in Ottawa with the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg. It so happens that we talked 
about Her Gracious Majesty, saying that perhaps the House 
should have sent her a telegram of sympathy when she fell from 
her horse and unfortunately fractured her finger. Being 
completely conditioned by his job, the hon. member for 
Charlevoix, a veterinarian, pointed out to me that he was also 
glad that the horse-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Environment and Deputy Prime Minister):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like first of all to congratulate you at the outset 
of your mandate. I would like also to congratulate all my 
colleagues here on both sides of this House and tell opposition 
members that it is my hope that we will be strong adversaries but 
never enemies.
<P>
	Like millions of my fellow Canadians, I was not born in 
Canada. As a young man, I came from very far, indeed from 
halfway around the world, to give my family and my children a 
wide range of opportunities that I could not enjoy myself. The 
island where I was born, Mauritius as it is officially known, was 
then a British colony and we had to exile ourselves in South 
Africa or Europe to get postsecondary education.
<P>
	After having completed most of my postsecondary studies, I 
chose Canada as my country of adoption. Canada is as large as 
Mauritius is tiny. Its tropical climate gives Mauritius almost 
perpetual sunny and hot weather. But except for the 
geographical contrasts, the tiny island of Mauritius and the large 
Canada share striking similarities. Like Canada a former French 
colony, Mauritius would later be subjected to conquest and 
colonization by the British. Like Canada, it has kept the heritage 
of the languages and the cultures of both founding countries. In 
both cases, Parliament is bilingual, Common Law exists 
alongside the Civil Code, and the French language lived on and 
even thrived under the British regime and afterwards.
<P>
	I was fortunate enough in my tender years to grow up in both 
the English and the French cultures and to benefit from both. I 
have always known from experience that it is possible to 
appreciate at the same time Molière, Victor Hugo or our own 
Gilles Vigneault, on the one hand, and Shelley, Shakespeare or 
writers of our time like Hemingway, Margaret Atwood or 
Michener, on the other.
<P>
	My own experience in my family, with friends or in a number 
of occasions in my life have taught me that languages and 
cultures, far from dividing us, can be a valuable means through 
which people can meet, share ideas and be united in the same 
spirit. I speak three languages, since Creole is now recognized 
as an official language, but I would have dearly liked to get to 
know many more languages and cultures when I was young.
<P>
	Just like Canada today, although English and French are 
dominant there, Mauritius is a genuine meeting point for all the 
most diverse religions and races.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The most fortunate similarity with this small country and the 
very large one that Canada is could very well be their sense of 
peaceful democracy, where individual liberties and human 
rights are highly valued and represent a most precious asset.
<P>
	When I first set foot in Canada, I felt at home right away, I felt 
comfortable and secure in this most democratic country. After 
living for a few years in British Columbia, I chose to move to 
Quebec 30 years ago.
<P>
	I had the opportunity, during my career, to visit Canada coast 
to coast, to discover small and big lakes, cities, towns, and rural 
areas. I also had the chance during my life to visit many different 
parts of the world. I have seen the sun rise on the Zambezi, and 
set in Southern Australia.
<P>
	The more I visit other countries, the more I appreciate other 
lifestyles and living conditions, and the more I appreciate 
Canada, its climate of profound peace and liberty, its profound 
democracy.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is why today is a very special day for me. It is an 
especially moving occasion for me, my first address in the 
Parliament of Canada. That I, who has come from so far away, 
indeed like many of my colleagues here in this House, should 
have the opportunity and privilege of taking a direct part in the 
political life of our country, is itself an eloquent testimony to the 
values of openness and generosity which characterize the 
Canadian spirit and way of life.
<P>
	It is difficult for me to conceive that in theory this country 
could break up, not because of profound divergences as to the 
values, equity or democratic ideals that we share, but mainly 
because of language and culture.
<P>
	It is indeed astounding to me to believe that we English 
speaking and French speaking Canadians who for close to two 
and a half centuries have shared geography and history, have 
shared the rigours and also the beauty of this vast land, but 
above all have contributed to building a common weal of shared 
values and experiences, a common way of life, a system of 
democratic politics and justice where fundamental freedoms 
have always flourished, could choose to tear up our common 
heritage because some of us live in French and some of us live in 
English.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I deeply respect the Quebecers who chose to be represented by 
a majority of members from a party advocating Quebec 
independence. However, while respecting that choice, I firmly 
believe that it will bring about results quite different from those 
targeted by my colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois as their 
primary goal.
<P>
	In fact, their very presence here is, in my opinion, the most 
vivid and eloquent testimony of the greatness and the 
democratic value of Canada. How many countries in the world 
would have been so democratic as to welcome with complete 
freedom, in a peaceful and serene manner, in their main 
Parliament, parties which might destabilize them, if not 
dismantle them? The members of the Bloc Quebecois are the 
most striking evidence of the democratic value, the openness 
and the profound freedom of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we enter the 21st century I am proud to belong to a party 
whose mandate in this critical juncture in our history is to 
restore the confidence of Canadians in our political system, to 
restore in them hope for the future, to govern in truth, fairness 
and integrity and above all to preserve the Canadian federation 
and its shared geography and values from sea to sea.
<P>
	If Canadians have now reached a level of such deep cynicism 
and mistrust in our own institutions and in our collective 
capacity to change our lives for the better, if so many of my 
compatriots in Quebec are turning inwardly  toward the 
parochial panacea of separatism, it is because our institutions 
have failed them in their justifiable expectations.
<P>
	As the one truly national party represented in this House, our 
responsibility is an onerous one: to preserve the integrity of this 
country by showing Canadians that their institutions can indeed 
change their lives for the better.
<P>
	In laying the foundation for the Liberal government's 
mandate and program, the throne speech confirms our electoral 
commitments to redirect Canada toward the path of recovery 
and job creation, after several years of economic recession and 
consequent unemployment.
<P>
	However it calls for far more. It calls for the restoration of 
integrity, honesty and responsible management in the conduct of 
our affairs. It calls for the government to set an example, both 
real and symbolic, of the kind of restraint and discipline that it 
asks of others. It calls for the renewal of hope for our young 
people, so dynamic, increasingly well qualified, yet for a very 
large number of them, despairing of that first job which will be 
the start of a meaningful career. It calls especially for our 
seniors and the disadvantaged in our society for the maintenance 
of our social safety net created and nurtured by Liberal 
governments over the decades.
<P>
	It will mean a new approach to unemployment and welfare 
support systems that through training and other positive and 
constructive programs will give hope and dignity to the 
unemployed and their families. It will mean a more decisive 
place for women and minorities. I am so proud there are so many 
women and minority representatives in our ranks. It certainly 
means the recognition of the aspirations of our first peoples in 
the objective of taking charge of their own ways of life within 
Canada.
<P>
	Importantly it reconfirms the status of our two official 
languages as the precious expression of our foundation and 
evolution as a fair country. In ``Creating Opportunity'', the 
Liberal electoral program, our party has set the course toward a 
sustainable society, a goal we should all endorse regardless of 
party affiliation.
<P>
	No longer can we accept a society of waste where unbridled 
consumerism results in the unnecessary degradation of 
ecosystems and the natural resources that are the springboard 
and sustenance of life and living. No longer can we tolerate the 
despoliation of the ample resources with which we have been 
blessed and for which we are trustees.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must change our way of life and our way of producing and 
start respecting the integrity of the ecosystems and their 
capacity to maintain and renew themselves. In a world which is 
more conscious of global equity, of the need to distribute more 
equitably the wealth between rich and poor countries, we cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="57"> 57 </A></B>
<P>
continue to consume energy and resources as frenetically  as we 
have been doing in North America for the past fifty years.
<P>
	If we still want to be taken seriously at the international level 
as sustainable development champions, we must set the example 
here, in this country, as a society that integrates its 
environmental concerns and objectives with its government 
objectives and methods. I am delighted about all the measures 
our government intends to take to integrate environmental 
concerns within a sound management process for our country.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	During the last two years, I had the privilege of working very 
closely with the Algonquins from Barrière Lake on a three-party 
agreement concerning an integrated resource management 
project in La Verendrye Park. This dynamic initiative, the first 
of its kind in Canada, not only reinforced my environmental 
beliefs, but proved once again that it is possible to reconcile the 
protection of our ecosystems with our ways of thinking and 
doing things. May I say how much we could learn on this issue 
from our First Nations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The respect and love the Algonquins of Barriere Lake and 
certain other First Nations show for mother earth is a touching 
lesson for us all. It is one I find especially moving and inspiring.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Among the most precious resources for which we are 
responsible are the largest water reserves in the world. The 
renowned Canadian scientist Joseph MacInnis told me the other 
day that, during a recent conversation, the distinguished 
chairman of <I>National Geographic</I>, Gilbert Grosvenor, let him 
know that water would be the first and foremost priority of his 
internationally acclaimed publication during the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are blessed with the enjoyment of the greatest freshwater 
system in the universe: the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basin. 
It constitutes 80 per cent of the total freshwater reserves in 
North America and 20 per cent of the world's reserves.
<P>
	Water is a goal of our new age, of the 21st century and beyond. 
To provide an idea of the magnitude of our dependence on the 
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence water, we draw from the 
ecosystem each day, on both sides of the border, 655 billion 
gallons of water. That is equivalent to 2.5 trillion litres. If we 
were to store this water in jumbo tank cars, it would be 
equivalent to 19 million tank cars of 34,000 gallons each. These 
tank cars, if tied together, would stretch over 237,000 miles. 
That is the equivalent of 9.5 times the circumference of the 
world at the equator.
<P>
	I have heard it suggested in scientific and environmental 
circles that the Great Lakes basin may become the population 
magnet of the 21st century. With the west and southwest of the 
continent drying up, with the groundwater table close to 
exhaustion in certain areas, a large migration of people 
northward toward the essential and crucial resource that is water 
is a distinct possibility for the future.
<P>
	Needless to say, we will have to do better in our stewardship 
of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence if we are to accommodate 
the large numbers of fellow citizens who may choose in future to 
take advantage of this unmatched resource.
<P>
	We will have to do considerably better than today. The record 
shows that in 1990 we were dumping into the Great Lakes seven 
million gallons of oil, 80,000 pounds of lead, not to mention 
1,900 pounds of PCBs and 1,000 pounds of mercury.
<P>
	We must strive to build this new sustainable society around a 
clean industry strategy which would include a binational clean 
strategy for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basin where the 
bulk of our population lives and works.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I cannot help but wonder how Joliette, Marquette and de la 
Salle would feel if they saw some of us renounce the great 
legacy of wide-open spaces that they left us. I hope that during 
the present term we will find a way to convince the Bloc 
Quebecois members and their followers that this great Canadian 
legacy which we built together is made up of too many common 
values and is the result of too many common efforts to be 
forsaken so lightly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I close my first address to this House in praying that Canada 
and Canadian unity shall prevail and that it shall flourish into 
the 21st century and beyond and that our great traditions and 
values of democracy, peace and freedom will continue to mark 
our lives together.
<P>
	Long live Canada. May Quebec and its immensely proud and 
rich heritage and contribution be always a vibrant and crucial 
part of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>M. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Madam Speaker, I am proud to be 
given the opportunity to comment on the remarks made by the 
hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, and to correct a 
few historical facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="58"> 58 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis reminded 
us that Mauritius and Canada had had a similar history, telling us 
how important it is for him that Canada preserves-as Mauritius 
did-its reputation as a land of freedom. However, one should 
remember that before joining the Canadian Federation, Quebec 
was also a land of freedom, a land of belief, a land of 
respect-respect for the established order, for men and women, 
for the family, for the fundamental and traditional values that 
had made Quebecers-whose ancestors were French-a noble 
people, proud of its origins.
<P>
	When Quebecers decided to join the Canadian Federation, 
they did not do so because they believed they would give 
themselves new fundamental values they did not have yet; 
Quebecers decided to join the Canadian Federation because they 
wanted to develop their own values and to share them with 
another people, the English Canadians.
<P>
	Today, when Quebecers are thinking of another way of living, 
they do not do so because they have something against their 
partners of 1867 or because they despise English-speaking 
people; they do so because they now fear the system they had 
accepted to be part of since that time. They think that system 
may deprive them from now on of their right to speak, their 
fundamental values, their traditions and their culture. They are 
concerned that the Canadian Federation will no more enable 
them to maintain this heritage they received not from the 
Canadian Federation but from their forefathers long before the 
Canadian Federation.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Why is it that the hon. member believes that if Quebec should 
become sovereign all of a sudden, he would lose all his rights?
<P>
	Why does he think that if it became sovereign tomorrow, 
Quebec would not enjoy those same privileges? Does he believe 
that the Canadian Federation is the only guardian of the 
fundamental rights of Quebec and that without that federation, 
without those fundamental values, Quebec does not have a 
future anymore? I would like the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis to make some further comments on 
that, because I do not think that those values were given to 
Quebecers by virtue of the Canadian Federation. Those were 
values that they already enjoyed before they entered 
Confederation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> I do not know how the hon. member could 
conclude that I said Quebecers had no basic freedoms and no 
sense of family or values. I never said that. The point I made was 
that we have been together for nearly two and half centuries. We 
decided of our own free will, the French-speaking population 
and the English-speaking population, to join together in the 
Canadian federation. And the same thing happened when 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia and others joined the 
Canadian federation. This does not mean there were  no basic 
freedoms before. However, together we have built a country that 
is the envy of many nations because of its sense of freedom and 
democracy, which is particularly true given your presence here. 
That we can be here, like this, is tremendous. I think it is very 
exciting to have colleagues from all over the world, who enjoy 
every freedom here, and that I myself, who was born elsewhere, 
am here as a Canadian and a Quebecer and proud of it and, as 
part of the Canadian system, am able to enjoy a measure of 
freedom that is the envy of the other countries of this world.
<P>
	I am not saying that if it happens to be the democratic choice 
of some Quebecers not to go their own way, that basic freedoms 
would crumble. I never said that. I never even mentioned it. My 
point was that what we have here, what we have built here 
together is something that is far greater and has far more scope 
than would be the case if we were to retreat behind our walls and 
do something that will deny the reality of people like the hon. 
member for Beauséjour who is also a francophone and wants to 
belong to this great francophone family within Canada.
<P>
	That is why we must continue to defend the vision of those 
pioneers who looked well beyond the borders of Quebec. The St. 
Lawrence is the epitome of Quebec's culture and history. But 
why would Quebecers not be entitled to the Great Lakes as well? 
And why would Canadians living on the Great Lakes not be 
entitled to the St. Lawrence? That is my theory. Freedoms will 
continue to exist, both in Quebec and elsewhere, but I hope they 
will exist within a much broader and more exciting context than 
Canada. That is why I intend to fight very hard to defend those 
freedoms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
knew the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, when he 
was in the National Assembly. I met him in Lac-Mégantic, a 
town not very far from my riding. I talked with him then and I 
was under the impression that he cared a great deal for Quebec. 
He was Minister of the Environment. That is why I was very 
disappointed by his speech where, despite the fact that he has 
been Minister of the Environment in Quebec and should make 
environment his priority, he barely talked about it.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	What I would like to ask to the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, who is parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of the Environment, is whether he will push to have 
the North American Commission on Environmental 
Co-operation, created under NAFTA, in Montreal? It was 
agreed during the Rio Summit, with the Mayor of Montreal, that 
his city would be a centre for the environment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, with all due respect for the 
member with whom I have had excellent relations at times, I 
think his mind must have been wandering when I read my speech 
because half of it was about the environment.
<P>
	I spoke about protecting the ecosystem, about adopting a 
different way of life, about our water resources. I am sorry if he 
did not listen. I will gladly send him a copy of my speech if he 
wants one.
<P>
	As regards your second question, you know our party is 
totally democratic. There is a caucus, there are democratic 
procedures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to first of all in my remarks congratulate you on your 
appointment. I wish you well. Having served in the House with 
you for one term, you can be assured of my personal support and 
my party's support. We will do all that we can to assist you in the 
chair.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the other Speakers and the 
Speaker of the House who won the election the other day. I think 
it is indicative that this Parliament will be different from any 
other we have seen in Canadian history. Who would have 
thought when there were only two names left on the ballot, even 
those of us who are not mathematicians and who thought it was 
all over on the fifth ballot, that we would come back for another 
vote.
<P>
	I discovered in the newspaper yesterday that I had single 
handedly delivered the speakership to Mr. Gilbert Parent. I was 
interested and surprised to read that. I was asked if I in fact had 
done that by coercing my caucus into making sure he was voted 
for and whether my persuasive tactics and characteristics were 
put into play.
<P>
	I would like to put on the record right now that had I gone into 
the persuasion mode it would have been over in three ballots. We 
would not have had to stay here for six ballots. Congratulations. 
You have a certainly exciting but large job ahead of you. Please 
be assured of our support for you and all other Speakers.
<P>
	Second, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 
constituents of Beaver River. As you know I served in this House 
as the member of Parliament for Beaver River since March 
1989. I spent almost all of the last term here. Our campaign 
slogan for 1993 was ``Let's do it again Beaver River''. Of course 
we had a unique chance to make Canadian history again by 
re-electing a Reform member of Parliament.
<P>
	I would just like like to say that my job as the member of 
Parliament for Beaver River is that of one of servant. The 
constituents there saw fit to elect me again as their member of 
Parliament. I am proud and I am humbled to be their MP again. I 
was certainly pleased to see that my mandate went from 50 per 
cent in 1989 to just a shade under 60 per cent in 1993. We should 
all be aware that all we had was one vote on ballot day and it is 
not by our  merit certainly that any one of us is here tonight. 
Those people put their faith in us. We know for sure they want to 
see things done differently.
<P>
	Let me just say again thank you to the people of Beaver River, 
a wonderful microcosm of Canada, albeit chilly tonight there, a 
marvellous farming, oil and natural resources community. 
Agriculture and oil are the two biggest industries in Beaver 
River. Unfortunately neither word appears once in the throne 
speech under my scrutiny.
<P>
	Something is lacking. We will work together to make sure that 
these things are addressed very specifically because they are 
huge industries and resources in my constituency as well as in 
many others across the country.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the Prime Minister and many 
other members of this House on their re-election. It is pretty 
exciting to have been re-elected to this House of Commons. As 
we know, there were some pretty big changes. There are some 
new faces here, but I welcome back those of you who were 
re-elected. I would also like to congratulate those who have 
been elected for the first time. It is pretty exciting to see this 
many new faces here. I am pleased.
<P>
	When I left here when the House disbanded in June many 
people whom I served with in the last Parliament were very 
friendly to me and I appreciated that. They said: ``Deborah, see 
what you can do when you leave this place, now that we are 
recessing at the end of June, to find yourself some friends''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I stand before you again tonight to tell you 
that I have found some friends, both personal and professional. I 
would like to tell you that I got married this summer. I married 
Lewis Larson on August 7.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We said at our wedding that one has a greater 
chance of being struck by lightning after the age of 40 than of 
getting married for the first time. So we are making Canadian 
history all the way. It was wonderful.
<P>
	What I appreciate in a partner is when I can go home at night 
and just get so much personal support. That one person is 
certainly important and the most important, but I was told to 
find some friends. I did my very best and it looks pretty good 
from my viewpoint. I went from a caucus of one to one of a 
caucus and I like this a whole lot better. It is pretty exciting.
<P>
	Thank you again for the support you have shown for us so far 
in the House. We look forward to working with everyone.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute right now to the hon. member for 
Kamloops. It is interesting and life is ironic. I warmed exactly 
his seat and he warmed exactly mine. For now we have made a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="60"> 60 </A></B>
<P>
complete switch in seats and I like this a lot too. I hope he 
appreciates the seat which I kept warm for him for several years 
as well.
<P>
	On to the throne speech. Let us look at some of the things that 
went right in the throne speech and some of the things that have 
gone wrong. Maybe there are some weaknesses in it. Far be it for 
me to stand here and be terribly critical.
<P>
	We are all here, I believe, for one reason regardless of our 
political affiliation or the way we are trying to come at this. I 
think we all believe that we want this country to be a better place 
no matter what we think of it. We are here for that reason only 
because it is not fun commuting to Ottawa.
<P>
	From this throne speech we realize that probably the main 
concern of all Canadians is that of economic insecurity. 
Certainly that is the real focus of this throne speech. People in 
this country realize that they are frustrated with high taxes. They 
fear for social programs or the lack of a real job.
<P>
	The economic insecurity troubling Canadians certainly 
results from many factors both national and international. 
Granted, there is perhaps little we can do at the international 
level but there are many ways by which we can determine to 
move this country ahead economically within Canada's borders. 
The way we exercise that potential influence through our taxing 
and spending policies is all important.
<P>
	Unfortunately for Canadians, for the past 20 years we have 
perhaps had too much government. Governments, both Liberal 
and Conservative, have spent too much, taxed too much and 
owed too much.
<P>
	Let us not bicker. Considering the hon. members on the other 
side of the House with whom I sat, I remember well the back and 
forth volleys. The Conservatives said the Liberals left them the 
debt.
<P>
	I do not want to see that happen again. Some of my friends 
over here will talk about those Conservatives. People do not 
care. What people are concerned about is that we dig ourselves 
out of this debt hole and they do not want to concern themselves 
with the fact of whomever it was who got us into it. We want to 
get out of this debt hole and we will do our best on this side of the 
House to make sure that we put policies into practice and 
support this government when it brings in legislation so that we 
can start digging ourselves out and not worry about who dug us 
in. Let us dig ourselves out. That is the focus we need to take.
<P>
	We must break the cycle of spending more, borrowing more 
and taxing more. What a refreshing change if we would be able 
to stand here as parliamentarians and say that we believe in 
spending less and borrowing less so that down the road we will 
be guaranteed that we will be taxed less. I think the Canadian 
public would support that wholeheartedly.
<P>
	We are aware that the annual deficit now exceeds 5 per cent of 
the GDP. This government has promised to lower it to 3 per cent 
during the life of this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	That is noble and we will applaud that, but let us make sure 
that it is only the first step because 3 per cent of the GDP is still 
well up, $20 billion or $25 billion of an annual deficit. We will 
be digging ourselves continuously into that debt hole if we just 
function at that level.
<P>
	Let us say for step one for this government it is 3 per cent of 
GDP but let it only be step one or phase one. Let us move rapidly 
toward a balanced budget so that we can break even with our 
arrears payments and then start making the actual payments on 
the mortgage.
<P>
	We have spoken long and loud about this debt quagmire and 
we want to make sure that the Canadian public sees something in 
us in this 35th Parliament that we would be able to make some 
suggestions.
<P>
	I am so glad to know that we have some economic specialists 
in my caucus now. I will leave that to them. It is marvellous 
because I have been able to turn that job over to them. I will let 
them deal with specifics about numbers and philosophies in 
terms of economics but let me say that we need to reform the 
economics of this country. The Minister of Finance is well 
aware of it and many of the Liberal backbenchers that I know 
and have spoken with are concerned about it as well.
<P>
	Second, in terms of economics, what must we do with the 
pension plan for members of Parliament? I stand before you and 
before this House as the only member of my entire caucus who 
qualifies for a member of Parliament pension at this point. I 
speak wholeheartedly about this as well as with serious 
conviction that we just do not talk about it and try to make it look 
good on the outside. We should see substantive reforms in the 
MP pension plan that are really going to make a difference and 
not just say that we have made changes in it. Let us make sure 
that it is brought more in line with the private sector and that it is 
not such a completely enriched situation where no other 
Canadian citizen would qualify for such a ridiculously 
extravagant pension.
<P>
	This process was introduced in 1952, the year I was born. It 
has been increasingly enriched far too much and almost in fact 
corrupted. Could we use that word? People in this situation will 
get into a program which is not actuarially sound. It is three or 
four times what every other pension plan is.
<P>
	Let us work together on that. People do not want their 
members of Parliament to be poorly paid. We learned that in the 
campaign. People do not want their members of Parliament to 
sort of be put out to pasture and not looked after, but let us make 
sure that it is brought into line actuarially so that we are not 
doing anything any more extravagant than that for other 
Canadian citizens. I do believe that the Canadian public would 
go for that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="61"> 61 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure that caucus would agree with my suggestion 
concerning these changes when they are brought forward and 
we look at the meat of the legislation. Please let us not tinker 
with the MP pension system just so it looks good. Let us 
actually make some substantive changes so that we can say that 
this was the government and these were the opposition 
parties-all of them in this House-that said they were going 
to change this and that will make a difference in the politics 
of this country.
<P>
	What about reforming this place? Does Parliament need to be 
reformed? Yes it does. Of course you and I, Madam Speaker, sat 
in the last House and watched the use of closure and limiting 
debate literally dozens of times. Let me again assure my friends 
with whom I visited in the lobby the last time on this side that I 
am going to be watching and making suggestions. I know that 
many people now on the government side are going to be 
concerned about that and give really good guidance to make sure 
that closure and time allotment and all these things are not 
slapped in.
<P>
	Let us make sure that the behaviour and decorum in this 
House change. The 34th Parliament and the 35th election issued 
an incredible warning from the Canadian public to all those who 
would run as members of Parliament. It was this: ``If you people 
do not behave the way any of us would behave in our 
boardrooms, if you people do not behave the way we would 
behave in our classrooms or in our private lives then we will do 
something about it''. They did so.
<P>
	We should not ever think for a minute, those of us who sit here 
cosy today, that they will not do it to us too if we do not make 
sure that we clean up the behaviour and the decorum in this 
House.
<P>
	Let me say I appreciate that in the first couple of days we have 
not had these spats. Let us make sure that whatever it is we feel 
so passionately about we still treat each other with that dignity 
and respect that every one of us deserved in our private lives and 
that we deserve as well in our public lives.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	There is a phantom in the Ottawa scene and it lives in this 
Chamber probably more than it lives anywhere else in this town 
or across this country and that is that it is so easy to become part 
of this group where we say: ``We are here, we made it, some of 
us are back again and some of us are new here''. There is 
something that is seeping through Parliament and that is perhaps 
that ego is number one. Let me remind all of us, myself 
included, that ego did not get us here, but it can get us out of here 
faster than anything we know of.
<P>
	Let us make sure that we realize what our position is here and 
that is as a servant. We should not just say it so it sounds good, 
but say it so we believe firmly that we are employees of the 
people who voted us in and sent us here. I believe that ego set a 
precedent in this place long, long ago and as my leader 
mentioned earlier, we will do  things in this House to break 
precedent and I am excited about that.
<P>
	Let us break the precedent of ego. Let us make sure that when 
we have new parties here, so many new members here and a new 
Speaker here that we break that phantom of Ottawa which has 
permeated this place and chase it out once and for all. Would we 
make an impression on the Canadian public? You bet we would. 
What a refreshing change that would be. Beware of the phantom 
of Ottawa that permeates this Chamber. Let us make sure that we 
behave in such a way that we are servants. We have an 
opportunity now like no other Parliament has ever had to have a 
fresh start and clean it out and make sure that we are going to 
make a more efficient, democratic and freer Parliament.
<P>
	Let us make sure that if we talk about free votes in this House 
of Commons that they are free and not just that they sound free. 
In the last Parliament we had a few free votes and unfortunately 
the public saw on TV just a particular member. What I got to see 
was the whole thing where the whip or somebody would come 
around and try to convince someone: ``Oh, no, you don't want to 
do that''. Let us make sure that if we talk free votes then we 
really act on free votes. That will free this place up and chase 
that phantom out faster than anything else. I think the Canadian 
public would really notice that.
<P>
	What about members of Parliament who get here and are safe 
for the whole term with a majority government? May we trust 
the people who put us here to be our board of directors so that 
they would be able to call us home as shareholders if we are not 
doing our job? I introduced and I am reintroducing my private 
member's bill on MP recall. Let us make sure that this 
Parliament is opened up. The phantom of job security here is so 
tight that nobody could chase us out. No executive director of a 
company would be allowed to be completely safe. Let us make 
sure that we open ourselves up.
<P>
	I am glad to second our subamendment which will be voted on 
tomorrow. We cannot afford to not support a subamendment 
which caps the finances. We cannot afford to let parliamentary 
reform just slip out of our hands and talk about it so nicely and 
yet it did not really happen. What a sad legacy at the very 
beginning of this 35th Parliament if we were to just give up by 
default right at the beginning.
<P>
	I want to finish now and conclude my remarks by just giving 
us all a word of encouragement, regardless of what party we are 
with and what our political philosophies. I have a tribute to the 
late Senator Stan Waters who knew many people in this House 
and who was certainly a good friend of mine. He was my only 
political ally here in 1990. Stan always said that whenever one is 
going ahead some place one must keep on marching no matter 
what deters one from that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="62"> 62 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not just for my party here in the House, but for every 
party, regardless of political stripe. Let us all get one sight in our 
mind and that is to make this a better Canada and make it a place 
where we are proud to go back on the streets or back to our 
constituencies and say: ``I am a member of Parliament and I am 
proud of that''. What a change that would be. Keep on marching.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
wish to congratulate you on your election. I am proud to 
represent the riding of Peterborough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not know how many members, like me, are relishing this 
evening. I have been observing what has been happening over 
the last two or three days. Members will notice that the light 
seems to have changed. The mood has become quieter and the 
debate, in the middle of this discussion about the tragic 
economic problems we have and about the future of this great 
country, has become much more personal.
<P>
	We have begun to exchange information about our ridings so 
that we can learn a little about where we come from. We have 
begun to exchange information about ourselves. The hon. 
member for Beaver River told us about her recent marriage, for 
example.
<P>
	It seems to me perhaps it is on occasions like this and not 
when the media gallery is full that some of the key things of a 
Parliament like this are actually done.
<P>
	My riding of Peterborough is often thought of as a microcosm 
of the province of Ontario, a bit in the way that Lac-Saint-Jean 
is a microcosm or special place in the province of Quebec. It is a 
riding that has been very hard hit by the recession. It is a riding 
that has great cultural and economic strengths and so it is a 
riding that has a great deal of hope. I would like members 
opposite, in particular, to know that.
<P>
	As for myself, as quite a number of people indicated today, I 
am also an immigrant. I was not born in Canada. In fact my 
family is from Wales. Hon. members might be interested to 
know that the Welsh language is much older than French or 
English. It is at least 3,000 years old and has changed very little 
even though it is very vital today. Its culture is very strong. Six 
hundred thousand people speak the language in a tiny country. 
They are very proud of their heritage. I am very proud of that 
heritage just as I am very proud to be a Canadian and to represent 
Peterborough.
<P>
	The debate today is about the revitalization of our economy 
and the future of Canada. I would like all members to know that 
even in this deep recession when the people of Peterborough are 
really hurting their mandate to me was to revitalize the economy 
within an even stronger Canada. That is what I intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I heard with interest the comments of our hon. 
colleague from Beaver River. I remember the days in the last 
session when I was sitting on the other side of the House and the 
several times we had an opportunity to speak to each other on an 
informal basis as members do.
<P>
	I would not want Canadians to think it is only with the advent 
of this Parliament that members have been friendly to each other 
across party lines. They have had the opportunity of knowing 
and assisting each other notwithstanding that they may have 
disagreed on policy or otherwise.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the hon. member on her recent 
marriage. I wish her and her husband the best.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member about the issues of 
recall and that of free votes. I am a fervent believer in increasing 
the number of free votes. Indeed the mother of Parliaments has 
considerably more free votes than we do. Government bills are 
often defeated by government members and the government 
does not fall automatically or an election is not called. We have 
twisted that convention very badly out of shape in Canada 
throughout the years.
<P>
	By increasing the free votes we also increase, in my opinion, 
the influence of those who lobby parliamentarians. Quite often 
the fraternity we have, for lack of a better word, keeps us 
together and to a degree fends off the influence of lobbyists.
<P>
	Would the member not agree with me that together with 
increasing free votes we have to increase the rules governing 
lobbyists and the registration of lobbyists in Canada?
<P>
	Finally I would like to ask our colleague as well about recall 
and to give an opinion on that. Her and I are going to have to 
disagree on that one. I believe I was elected to make decisions on 
behalf of my constituents. I am to stand before them at the next 
election having had their opinions in mind all of the time. I must 
stand not just on one issue but on my overall performance as an 
MP and let them judge me at the next election. After all, I 
probably voted against the majority of my constituents on such 
things as abortion, and probably similarly on such things as 
capital punishment, and I was returned here with a relatively 
comfortable majority.
<P>
	I believe very much in the Edmund Burke philosophy in that 
regard, that once elected you are a member for your 
constituency and for the country as a whole. You must stand on 
your record. If you do not do that you will always only represent 
the majority and never the minority within your own 
constituency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="63"> 63 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Madam Speaker, in the time we have remaining 
let me thank my friend from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for 
his comments and make mention briefly of free votes.
<P>
	There is a great possibility that would open it up to the 
lobbyists so let us make sure, as my hon. friend said, that we 
tighten up some of the regulations. Maybe we should go one step 
further and not give government funding to lobby groups. We 
might be surprised how the number falls off if such a thing 
happened.
<P>
	The member and I also appeared on a TV show some time last 
year about the pensions of members of Parliament and we 
disagreed on that as well. I somehow think my side might win in 
that regard, being with the Canadian public. Nonetheless I 
respect his view.
<P>
	Regarding recall it is easy to say: ``My people sent me here. I 
am doing what I am doing because they gave me a mandate''. Let 
us remember the reason we are here is three-pronged. First of 
all, is the mandate theory that I am here to do what I think is best. 
Second, is the delegation model where people would say: ``Go 
do what you like. We put our faith in you and we will see you 
again at election time''. Probably the healthiest of all three 
would be the idea of trusteeship: ``You as constituents put faith 
in me as your member of Parliament. I will go and do the best job 
I can do, but I will make sure that I continue from time to time to 
get a reading in the riding. I would be the trustee''. That does not 
mean I could disappear to Ottawa and say: ``They gave me the 
mandate so I can do as I please''.
<P>
	We need to be very careful in that regard. It is important we 
put our faith in the common sense of the people who voted for us 
and say that member of Parliament recall is something. If I lay 
that open and lay myself open in front of my constituents it 
seems to ease the tension and they see that at least we are 
willing.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint Louis for his excellent speech this 
afternoon and also the hon. member for Beaver River, who I can 
say is a very kind person. She wrote me an excellent letter last 
winter when I was in the hospital, as many members on both 
sides of this House did. I appreciate that very much.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate you on taking the 
chair. I think it becomes you very well. I will likely have an 
opportunity to congratulate the Speaker in person. I would also 
like to congratulate the other two officers of the chair.
<P>
	When I was sitting here this afternoon listening to the debate 
on whether we are going to separate this country or whether we 
are not, I found it rather depressing. As a result I threw away 
most of my notes. Therefore, what I am going to say tonight is 
from the heart. That is not to say that my notes were not.
<P>
	When we think of what it took in human work and human 
effort, in negotiation and flexibility of human nature to get this 
nation of Canada where it is today, I think all of us in this House 
and indeed across this country should exercise that flexibility 
and make up our minds that there is a bridge that can be built 
between human beings as well as across a river. Mental bridges 
or regional bridges in Canada, whether it be east, west, central 
Canada, Ontario, Quebec or Atlantic Canada versus central 
Canada, or whatever, are part of the uniqueness of this nation. 
As we start off this 35th Parliament it is very important that we 
realize and think about where we are going.
<P>
	At the outset I want to say that I cannot in any way express my 
feelings in words as firmly and as sincerely as I would like. No 
matter where I am in Canada, I feel at home. I hope there is not 
another Canadian from sea to sea to sea who does not feel the 
same way.
<P>
	Whenever I am speaking to development groups, whether 
they be chambers of commerce or municipal councils or county 
or regional councils or whatever, I always impress upon them 
the importance of smiling to people on the street and saying 
hello. It is very important to welcome people to your 
community. You can do that by breaking the ice.
<P>
	I believe there is an element developing in Canada where 
there is a coolness in one part of the country to people in the 
other. First of all we must remember that our ancestors put this 
nation together. They put it together through hard work and 
determination. Can anyone imagine the work it took to put the 
first railroad across this great nation of ours and why it was 
done? It was done to weld this country together economically 
and, hopefully, socially.
<P>
	I have the immigration figures here for Canada from 1852 to 
1972. It spells a story of immigration to western Canada. It 
spells the early days of immigration to-I do not call it central 
Canada, I call it by the names of the provinces-Ontario, 
Quebec and Atlantic Canada. We have some great heritage in 
this country, not only in physical objects but in messages, 
philosophies and mentalities that have been passed on to us 
through generations.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	I listened to the hon. leader of the Reform Party this 
afternoon. He had some particular views because he comes from 
another region of the country. I respect those views. I respect 
some of the views that have been put forward by the opposition. 
I cannot say that I go along with them, but they have the right to 
state them in this institution or anywhere in this country. We 
have to get down to a good, honest, in-depth debate on this 
nation. We cannot have an ongoing debate in a country as to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="64"> 64 </A></B>
<P>
whether we are going to have national unity or whether we are 
not.
<P>
	There are jobless people across Canada today. They want 
jobs. The average people in this country want to put bread on 
their tables. They want to have the dignity of being full-fledged 
citizens participating in their society. They would much rather 
be paying taxes than receiving welfare payments. It is up to us in 
this Parliament and in every legislature in Canada to think of 
those people, to think of the further advancement of Canada, this 
nation that was put together by great people like George Etienne 
Cartier, Baldwin and Lafontaine, people who had the flexibility 
to meet the other person's mind, have discussion and eventually 
agree.
<P>
	That is going to be the big issue in this Parliament. Are we 
Canadians going to sit around, continue to bicker and differ 
among ourselves on questions of national unity when if we got 
together and had a meeting of minds we would go on to retain 
and improve Canada as one of the greatest nations on the face of 
the earth? Some people in other parts of the world would give 
their back teeth to be here with us today.
<P>
	We not only have a great obligation to Canadians to provide 
jobs, we have a great obligation in this country to create research 
and development, to go on with it, to think of people in various 
parts of this country. Transportation is very important to this 
nation. We have many issues before us today; a $46 billion 
deficit in one year, a $500 billion debt in this country.
<P>
	I beg and plead with all members in this House to get down to 
the business that our ancestors would want us to do, and that is 
building Canada, which they strained their backs and expended 
their energies to do. They had a vision for Canada. Let us not 
lose that vision. Canada is one of the most loved nations on the 
face of the earth today. Other countries must be wondering what 
is going on here. If we are arguing among ourselves, they will 
wonder whether we are going to tear it apart or not. I have such a 
deep feeling for this nation that I could not help but lay my notes 
aside tonight and express these very sincere and in-depth 
feelings.
<P>
	We have a nation here that is not fully developed. Some 
people talk as if we are a fully developed nation. Out there we 
can create jobs by promoting tourism in this country. Tourism in 
Canada is virtually untouched, virtually untapped. We have 
some of the greatest scenes in this nation. Remember this. We 
have had a tremendous group of statesmen in this House over the 
years since these Parliament Buildings were first designed in 
1859 and the members here now are in some of those seats. I ask 
the members to think about developing the vision, the sincerity 
and the dedication to our nation of those people who passed 
through these seats ahead of us over the years.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	I have the list of Prime Ministers here. People think that 
Parliament is a raucous place today. Take out <I>Hansard</I> and read 
some of the debates on the great free trade of the 1911 election. 
Read the debates of the conscription issue in this House in 1917. 
It practically tore the country apart. It was a terrible thing on the 
social conscience of Canadians.
<P>
	In the opposition lobby and in the government lobby of that 
day, I was told by an older person a few years ago, there was a 
bar and the debate went on all night long. Can you imagine what 
a spirited debate that was.
<P>
	That is the kind of history we have here. We are not an old 
country. We are a very young country. It is not surprising that we 
should be having debates on national unity along the way. I just 
want to say this evening that we should think of the railway 
building which I mentioned and those people who immigrated to 
Canada and their train trips across this nation. After getting off 
ships some settled in Montreal. The St. Lawrence seaway 
development is one of the finest waterways that any continent 
could be blessed with. We can live together. You bet we can live 
together and we can thrive together.
<P>
	If we put our energies into developing Canada and put a vision 
into this Parliament, exercise a vision to create jobs, we can 
make Canadians happy again right across this country. Canada is 
worth retaining. The world knows that. It seems to me that what 
we have to do is convince ourselves. We have some great talent 
in this country.
<P>
	I have friends all across the province of Quebec. I have friends 
across Atlantic Canada. I have relatives in western Canada 
whom I have never seen, as many members may have. I have 
been to the territories in the north. This is the way we can build 
bridges. We must see our country and we must know our people. 
There must be respect for people out there. The only way that we 
can expect their respect is if we are not only seen to be but in fact 
are working on their behalf and on their betterment for the 
future.
<P>
	There has to be respect for dignity, a respect for people of 
different cultures, yes, and a respect for some decency 
throughout the world. Hope and dignity should be the landmarks 
of this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell when he said a while ago: 
``People think everybody was fighting with one another in past 
Parliaments''. Over my years here I have had many very good 
friends on both sides of the House. I remain in touch with some 
of them today.
<P>
	The 205 new members in the House have one of the greatest 
opportunities going. It is a personal challenge. They too will 
make friends back and forth across the floor. They too will find 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="65"> 65 </A></B>
<P>
that those people worked just as hard to get elected and have 
good ideas for Parliament and for Canada. They will grow to 
respect one another.
<P>
	To every one sitting in the House now I say it is a great 
opportunity to be flexible, to develop friends and to establish a 
base for helping people across the country. There are people out 
there who are hurting. Let us remember that the three main 
industries from colonial days that built this nation of Canada 
were the fisheries, the forests and agriculture. All three of them 
are facing considerable trouble today and we must have a feeling 
for the people out there who are fighting to stay alive, to make a 
living and to be creative.
<P>
	Over the years Canada has grown up a great deal. We have 
developed into a very responsible nation. I went to Dieppe on 
one of the anniversaries of the battle there and I could not 
believe what I saw. It was the first time I had seen it. There was a 
little narrow beach with tremendous cliffs that had openings in 
them all the way up for machine gun turrets and other heavy 
artillery. Poor Canadians were sent across the English Channel 
to attack Dieppe. One does not need any imagination at all to 
question the senior officer or officers who made that decision. 
Canada must have greater say in what we do with our Canadians 
abroad, whether it be in peacekeeping duties or, hopefully not, 
in time of war.
<P>
	Ten of thousands of young people died in World War I. They 
did not have an opportunity to live in this country. They did not 
have an opportunity to sit in this Parliament. Within 21 years 
there was a second world war that took another cream of the crop 
of young people from this nation. They are resting in graves far 
from this nation. They fought for Canada. They fought for peace 
in the world. They fought for freedom. They wanted a free 
world. Today in their memory the least we can do is have some 
flexibility and real sound friendship right across the nation for 
which they fought and died, were wounded or came home with 
horrendous thoughts about what they had experienced.
<P>
	These are some of my feelings today as I sit here and listen to 
the debate. I did not get into the contents of the throne speech 
which is a good start, an excellent start. I remember every word 
of it as do other members on the government side of the House 
and those on the other side. We had the red book and what we 
have in the throne speech is part of the red book. There will be 
more to come. As parliamentarians we must gain the respect of 
Canadians by doing what we said we were going to do. We 
cannot win them all. We are not going to come out of it batting 
100 per cent, but with the fact that there is a target to aim at we 
are going to come out of it far better than if we did not map out 
our route in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	The very fact that each of us was elected to this House of 
Commons shows that we have some special qualities and appeal 
to the people who sent us here. I ask the new members to develop 
a good rapport with all of us. My mind is open. My handshake 
goes out to anyone in this House who wants to discuss an issue 
whether or not I totally disagree.
<P>
	Let us think of one thing. We want to get Canadians employed. 
We want to continue this great nation for which our forefathers 
fought so hard. They put up with much torment to build our 
nation of today.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the member's remarks and I was rather 
moved. He spoke from the heart and I liked it; however, a 
country is not built only with a heart but also with reason. He 
talked about building bridges. He talked about a railroad from 
coast to coast. True enough, but the problem is that in my riding 
of Matapédia-Matane, railway travel is a problem. Last year, 
we had to apply tremendous pressure to try to improve the 
situation.
<P>
	There was Meech Lake, and some people of good will who 
tried to build bridges. Five small conditions, five requests which 
Mr. Bourassa called a minimum, and rightly so. Indeed, this 
country is vast, huge, but we are two founding nations which do 
not feel at home from coast to coast.
<P>
	You also talked about employment. My riding of 
Matapédia-Matane is among the poorest in Canada. 
Unemployment rates are astounding. I am going to ask you a 
question. You occasionally mentioned forestry and agriculture, 
but I did not see one line referring to natural resources, that is to 
say mines, energy, water and forestry. Could you explain why? 
If you want to build something and, above all, create jobs-
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
problem with transportation. It was rather ironic I was given a 
train pass on the day I was sworn in. I do not have access to a 
passenger train.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the two founding peoples. He 
will also be aware, as I mentioned in my speech, that people in 
the early pioneer days worked together long before 
Confederation to bring together those two founding peoples. 
Confederation itself was based on protecting the language, 
religion and culture of Quebecers. Those were some of the main 
reasons for it.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned high poverty rates. There are 
areas of Canada with high poverty rates. I have some in my own 
riding. I can relate to that.
<P>
	We will create jobs. We will create the initiatives to produce 
jobs. We are not going to say we will not do something because it 
is not in the program. If it falls under jobs and is going to create 
jobs then we want it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="66"> 66 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the throne speech and forests. As 
he knows the forestry industry comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. There are many members in our caucus who believe 
as firmly as I do that we should have federal forestry agreements 
as we have had in the past.
<P>
	We have treated our forest resources very roughly and have 
not managed them well. One thing that must happen from here in 
is the planting of trees. We have some very good institutions that 
develop forest trees. The expertise is there and it is a way to 
produce jobs. We can get people to prepare our forests for the 
future. We need to take an overall look at our natural resources. 
We also need to deal with the provinces on many of them.
<P>
	That is why in our red book during the election period, and 
every day the government will be sitting here, we put a great 
deal of emphasis on federal-provincial relations. It is going to 
be very important if we are to produce jobs for Canadians and to 
have a good rapport with governments of whatever stripe in 
whatever province so that we can work with them in protecting 
natural resources such as forestry, as the hon. member 
mentioned, and build a protection for agriculture, even though 
Canada was the only country at the GATT discussions that 
believed in supply management. It is the only one left of the 117.
<P>
	We cannot very well sign an agreement with ourselves. 
Canada is the only one left that believes in it. The only way to go 
is with high tariffs to protect our supply management system. 
We attempted to do that. By and large a pretty good deal came 
out of it. Also the other sectors of the economy affected by the 
GATT agreement will be big pluses for the country.
<P>
	I will certainly be glad any time to have a discussion with the 
hon. gentleman. I am sure we will find a common basis for 
friendship and serious discussion. I invite him to do that. We 
will learn to love this place after a while because we will know 
we are trying to do things for Canadians, that we are trying to do 
things for the people who sent us to Ottawa.
<P>
	I have known people in years past whose greatest aim was to 
get on the front page of the newspaper and on television every 
night of the week, but they did not come back very often after the 
next election. They spent so much time promoting themselves 
that they forgot who sent them to Ottawa to work on their behalf.
<P>
	I welcome the hon. gentleman in private conversation.
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
what the hon. gentleman had to say and I have to tell those in this 
House that I was moved by his nationalism and I was deeply 
moved by the way he sees his country, Canada. I must say that 
this part of the world is indeed a place where it is good to live 
and where there are many opportunities. Canada has always 
been a democratic country.
<P>
	However, I think it is time now for Canadians all across the 
country to realize that we must go forward and that Quebecers 
must now have their own way.
<P>
	As I said before, I agree with everything the gentleman said 
about our part of the world. Let us now think of the possibility of 
living side by side in harmony. I think that is possible. That is 
why I am now in this House with my colleagues from Quebec 
and other parts of Canada, to take a stand and make a decision 
for the future, perhaps the best decision for Canada and Quebec.

<P>
	It is always extremely intimidating for a new member to speak 
for the first time before an assembly such as ours, which is a 
product of democracy. I shall be as brief as possible, in keeping 
with the spirit of our standing orders.
<P>
	We are just out of an electoral campaign that took us to every 
corner of our ridings. I do not know a single member of this 
House, from one side or the other, who did not listen closely to 
his or her constituents during that period.
<P>
	A period when-and that is one of the main virtues of 
democracy-the voters, our constituents were able to make 
themselves heard.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="67"> 67 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	People were able to express themselves, as is the case every 
three of four years; they were able to tell us about their concerns, 
their fears, their needs, as well as their concerns and their 
objectives.
<P>
	I was really surprised to hear the people from the riding of 
Roberval, whom I knew well since I represented them twice in 
the Quebec National Assembly say how disappointed they were 
to see that, after nine years of a government whose mandate was 
coming to an end, the basic issues of the election campaign were 
essentially the same as those of the 1984 campaign. This was 
both surprising and disappointing for the people who listen to 
us, and it explains in part the lack of confidence and the lack of 
interest regarding politicians in our society.
<P>
	People were disappointed because in the 1984 election 
campaign, the Progressive Conservative Party had pledged to 
eliminate or reduce the deficit. At that time, politicians 
travelled to every riding to ask their fellow Canadians to support 
them, and more importantly to promise them that the deficit 
would, from then on, be under control. I must point out here that 
this deficit was totally generated by the Liberal government.
<P>
	Job creation was another priority during that election 
campaign, the 1984 campaign. Politicians of this country 
travelled everywhere to promise Canadians that the problem of 
unemployment would be solved, adding that it was unacceptable 
for a society such as ours to have an unemployment rate of about 
20 per cent in several regions. This was a promise. What is the 
situation nine years later? The situation is the same. If anything, 
it is worse than before.
<P>
	During the 1984 campaign, a commitment was also made 
whereby the constitutional problems would be solved, 
especially for Quebec where this is a very sensitive issue. We 
were told that a federalist party sitting in Ottawa would once and 
for all solve the constitutional problems and erase the 
unspeakable insult made to Quebec in 1982. Earlier this 
afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition alluded to this episode. 
Quebecers felt they have been betrayed by unspeakable political 
acts which took place in Canada in 1982, 1984, 1988, and up to 
the present.
<P>
	After nine years of promises, nine years of hopes, the election 
campaign was dominated by the same themes. Our senders debt 
not only has not been contained, it has tripled, in spite of all 
promises; the rate of unemployment is at least as high as it was 
in 1984, or nine years later, in spite of all promises. And last, but 
not least, there is a constitutional saga that deserves closer 
scrutiny. Years of discussions, exchanges, a deal, the Meech 
Lake Agreement, an agreement that essentially could have 
satisfied a certain number of Quebecers. For the main part, the 
Meech Lake Accord contained conditions which seemed 
acceptable to a relatively large segment of the population of 
Quebec. But what happened? Meech Lake was rejected. Several 
months,  several years of discussions, compromises, exchanges, 
fragile agreements were rejected, as we have seen, even if they 
gave some hope for the future of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	Some of our colleagues on the other side, whose ideas I 
respect, of course, will say that Canada is a great country, a 
country where we should enjoy living, where we should feel 
comfortable. But whatever people might say, let us not forget 
that, in 1982, this country let us down, and this country rejected 
Meech Lake which represented a giant step on the constitutional 
scene.
<P>
	Now we come to another discussion, another compromise, the 
Charlottetown Agreement, the substance of which seemed 
unacceptable even to Quebecers. Quebecers said no to this 
Agreement because it did not take into account their basic 
traditional demands, while English Canada rejected it because it 
apparently made too many concessions to Quebec.
<P>
	It is very sad indeed to look at how political negotiations 
unfolded under the previous government. Our political 
formation was born of the desire of Quebecers to express 
themselves through the democratic process, to elect to the 
Canadian Parliament men and women who would convey the 
message that had been circulating at home for years and which 
deserved to be expressed here, to be shared during debates like 
this one, to be the core of our exchanges and discussions and, 
maybe, eventually, of our mutual understanding.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has received extraordinary support from 
a majority of Quebecers. We are 54 here today, 54 members of 
Parliament who have a job to do, who have the mission to see to 
it that this message is, for once, given to the federal Parliament 
without being filtered or distorted on the way by those who 
refuse to say it as it is felt back home.
<P>
	We are here to make Parliament work. I want to reassure my 
colleagues. Many things have been said about the arrival of the 
Bloc in Ottawa. Never during the election campaign did we 
mention that we intended to paralyse Parliament, to prevent it 
from doing its job, to prevent it from dealing with the real 
problems facing Canadians. After our first day here, my 
colleagues and I are happy to show our interest for this 
institution and our profound respect for democracy. We are 
happy to tell all those who were worried about our coming here 
that we will co-operate. We will help find solutions to the 
terrible problems facing our society.
<P>
	The whole political context that brought us here is set against 
a dreadful economic background. The government implemented 
a monetary policy that created unemployment, a monetary 
policy that was aimed essentially at maintaining a low inflation 
rate in Canada without paying any attention to the 
unemployment it brought. The economic crisis was made even 
worse by the signing of a free trade agreement, when industry 
had not been prepared for the deep changes so badly needed in 
the context of a broader economy. The free trade agreement was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="68"> 68 </A></B>
<P>
indeed something positive for our future and for the 
development of our trade relations.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the difficulties of transition had been 
overlooked. It did not cross the government's mind that 
companies needed help to face this new context. The monetary 
policy and the lack of preparation for a new international trade 
context combined to make the situation even more painful for 
Canadians than it was in 1984.
<P>
	It is now incumbent upon this Parliament to settle once and 
for all a number of problems that get worse and worse all the 
time.
<P>
	Why are we here? First, we heard the throne speech, the 
contents of which we are now discussing. The first topic is a 
Parliamentary reform that could eventually lead to more 
responsibilities for members. This is certainly commendable. 
That approach could prove interesting. We should wait and see 
what this reform is all about.
<P>
	On the other hand, at the same time, you want to enhance the 
role of members of this House, yet you refuse to create an 
all-party nonpartisan parliamentary committee to analyze, 
examine, study, and criticize each spending item of the 
government. Instead, you merely mention a few examples of 
benefits which could be discarded so that we can appease our 
consciences and try to convince Canadians that we have done 
what had to be done.
<P>
	So, a parliamentary reform that is already somewhat 
handicapped, I would say, by the fact that the first valid exercise 
to which we could have invited the members of this House is 
being dismissed by this government, a Speech from the Throne 
in which this government did not see fit to reassure the citizens 
of this country about the kind of changes that it was ready to 
make in the social programs.
<P>
	It is disturbing to note that, at times, signals are given by 
politicians whose decisions are important in these matters and, 
at other times, in statements by employers, by people involved 
in the economic development, by people who are looking for 
solutions to the budget problems of the government, but who can 
only identify social programs as the primary target.
<P>
	Imagine the wonderful country and the brave government that 
will solve the debt problem of this country on the backs of those 
who suffer the most! Are they going to hit the elderly, or the 
unemployed once again? Are they going to hit people on welfare 
or health programs? We do not know.
<P>
	At times, the messages are informal, at other times, they are 
more formal in articles that they hasten to deny the next day. At 
any rate, when I hear the minister of Canadian 
Intergovernmental Affairs, right at the beginning of this 
mandate, say to us that they should at least try and cut 20 per 
cent in health care programs, I am concerned. It is nothing at all! 
Twenty per cent! As if it were the problem to takle first.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	We are sometimes told that we should make the system more 
effective. Naturally, everybody wants to make this system more 
effective. But no one ever talked about maintaining or 
protecting the financial resources allocated to these programs. 
What worries us is that each time issues such as the debt and the 
current year deficit of over $40 billion are raised, each time that 
these issues are raised, the social programs are inevitably 
associated with the repayment of the debt, with the reduction of 
the deficit. There is always someone somewhere to suggest that 
the money is to be found in the social programs.
<P>
	Administrative duplications in this country are very 
expensive. Hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted in 
jurisdictional disputes between the various levels of 
government. Today, we have asked-I personally did-the 
member opposite if he would make it a priority to address the 
issue of manpower. All Quebecers agree with that. Someone is 
whispering to me that he said he would. Of course, he said he 
would. He always says yes, but sometimes it is ``yes, right 
away'', and some other times it is ``yes, probably''. It could be 
``yes, certainly'', ``yes, probably'', or ``yes, sometime in the 
future''.
<P>
	The problem is that it is stop and go in an area where the 
Minister could make history. All he would have to do is endorse 
the consensus among the people involved in Quebec. Seldom 
have we seen the unions, the industry, the federalist liberal 
government of Quebec, the people responsible for manpower 
training, the unemployed, the hundreds of thousands of 
unemployed in Quebec, all in agreement. But they are, and what 
they are asking the federal government, before it cuts into social 
programs, is to save the $250 million wasted on duplicate 
services which only create problems.
<P>
	I thought that the government would leap at a tremendous 
opportunity like this one. But the Minister for 
Intergovernmental affairs is not sure. Maybe yes, maybe no. It 
makes no sense. The government will have to face reality some 
day. You are indicating that my time is up, Mr. Speaker, so I will 
conclude. The government must face reality, it must listen to 
members of this assembly, it must seize the opportunities 
available to save money without taking away from those most in 
need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague from the other side 
and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on being elected 
<P>

<B><A NAME="69"> 69 </A></B>
<P>
to Parliament. I had the privilege of meeting him at conferences 
when we were both members of provincial legislatures; I do not 
recall wether it was at  the International Assembly of 
French-Speaking Parliamentarians or at other forums. In any 
case, I am glad to see him here.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question which is rather relevant, I 
think. A few minutes ago, he said in his remarks that the 
minister responsible for federal-provincial issues had said yes 
in more ways than one, I won't repeat them all, to initiatives 
aimed at avoiding duplication. According to the member, we 
have heard it only too often and things have been dragging on for 
far too long since the Liberals came to power.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	Did the member forget that today is the first one of the session 
and that there was only one answer and that it was yes? If the 
member is not satisfied with a positive answer, can we conclude 
that he would have preferred a negative one that would have 
boosted his position and allowed him to say that the federal 
government is unwilling to do anything for them, thereby 
pointing out the failure of federalism? In other words he is 
saying to us that a yes is not enough, that things have been going 
on for too long. The first day in Parliament, we said yes right 
away, but even that took too long. Maybe we should have said 
yes before the question was asked? Perhaps that is the solution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague, to whom I give my regards, for asking for 
clarifications. We have indeed met previously in another forum.
<P>
	There is something we have to understand, and I am happy 
that my colleague has asked that question because it might help 
other ministers than the minister responsible for 
federal-provincial matters. This government has had a problem 
since the election and I am glad to be able to tell you how that is 
seen from the outside. The government gives the impression that 
no one in its ranks is able to take a firm stand. One day they 
create a program, for instance the infrastructure program. The 
government announces an infrastructure program, which is 
interesting enough. They tell us that there may be negotiations, 
that there might be developments and that they will give details 
later on these aspects; that they will make the criteria known and 
that provincial governments will be asked to contribute. The 
problem is there is never anything clear.
<P>
	Regarding duplication, the minister I asked omitted to explain 
today a declaration he made yesterday, although a few months 
ago he had clearly and firmly announced his intention of dealing 
with the question of duplication of responsibilities with Quebec. 
Only a few hours ago the same minister declared that the 
question of labour agreements has now become less urgent. The 
minister said he prefers to wait and examine those questions in 
the light of the general review of social programs that has to be 
done. That could take up to two years.
<P>
	Then I tried, unsuccessfully, to find out if the minister would 
proceed rapidly. For each minute that passes we lose millions of 
dollars. What we want is determination and clear and precise 
answers. People watching us are fed up with half-measures. 
They want real measures. That is why I was not happy with the 
answer. I would have liked some reassurance from the minister. 
I would have liked to hear a determined minister saying: ``Yes, I 
am glad to announce that every effort is now made to settle the 
issue of overlapping jurisdictions and duplication regarding 
employment, because every Quebecer wants us to do so''. Just 
ask the new premier of Quebec-a liberal and federalist 
premier. He will tell you how dissatisfied and disappointed he is 
about the way this government is dealing with the matter. That is 
the problem.
<P>
	I told the minister today what we want from the government: 
``Just make a decision! Choose an option! Yes or no, will you 
make changes in the social programs? Just say so! Yes or no, will 
you cut the transfers to the provinces? We want an answer''. 
That is what people want to know. They do not want to hear, 
according to circumstances, yes or no, a little bit or a lot, not 
much and not too much. Make a decision, that is what matters to 
us.
