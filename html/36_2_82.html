<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 2 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to speak in support of Motion No. 160 presented by my colleague, 
the chief critic for national revenue, the Canadian Alliance 
member for Calgary Southeast. The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to release the 1911 census records once they 
have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion is to release post-1901 census data to 
the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has received a broad base of support from various 
members of the House, not just Canadian Alliance members.  In 
addition, many MPs have received letters of concern from 
genealogists in their constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Surrey Central I have received letters asking for the release 
of post-1901 census records.  For example, Don Ellis of Surrey 
Central has been writing to me since I was elected.  He points 
out that the Access to Information Act protects the census 
information from being abused while it allows for the benefits of 
the release of this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ellis stated in his letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous census records have been released, and they have been of 
invaluable assistance to those of us researching our ancestry. 
We have long awaited the release of the 1911 census, and of 
future records, to give us additional information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, the Privacy Act is being given as the reason for 
withholding these records.  This is ridiculous in view of the 
freedom of information act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent wrote to me, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have recently been made aware that our government has placed a 
closure on all future census records and that the 1901 census 
will be the last one available for public research.  I would like 
to voice my objection to this unfortunate decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an amateur genealogist and the family historian I have made 
extensive use of census records both Canadian and British and 
cannot overstate the value of this source in establishing family 
relationships.  They are one of genealogy's most valuable 
resources and should not be allowed to be permanently closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the United States has made available the 1920 census and 
is in the process of preparing the 1930 census for release I 
would like to know the rationale behind Statistics Canada's 
decision.  I believe the former ninety year closure to be more 
than adequate to protect the privacy of any individual. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent, Robert Paulin, has been generous with his 
information and has encouraged the official opposition to take 
action to release these records that are almost a century old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong families make strong communities.  Stronger communities 
make stronger nations.  The government refrains from doing 
anything and everything that makes families strong, whether it is 
the definition of marriage or not reducing taxes, which creates a 
tremendous burden on family members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago only one member of the family worked.  Now both 
parents work, but still they are saving less.  All of these 
constraints are weakening the family institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of the family is important and the government 
needs to do everything it can to strengthen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the letters and representations I have received are from 
people in the business of researching family trees.  There is a 
significant demand for these services.  The withholding of the 
census data threatens these jobs and the firms conducting this 
research, and deprives the beneficiaries of important sentimental 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own family, my wife's great grandfather died in Canada, 
but we are unable to learn of his whereabouts since the census 
information has not been released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Census data is important information for historical research, 
especially for those researching family history.  Without 
releasing the information contained in the 1911 census this 
research is seriously hampered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of those who 
participated in the census have passed on and, as such, the 
potential for breach of privacy is minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to and including the 1901 census in Canada census records 
were transferred to the National Archives and were subsequently 
made available to the public 92 years after their collection. 
This was possible because clauses in the Privacy Act allowed for 
the subtraction of certain pieces of information and their 
release to the National Archives, subject to certain aspects of 
the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1906 Sir Wilfrid Laurier, by order in council, legislated 
regulations that brought about an imposed secrecy on enumerators 
and other officers of the Census and Statistics Office.  These 
regulations refer to chapter 68 of the Revised Statutes of 
Canada, 1906, an act respecting the census and statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within this ruling section 26 of the regulations stated that 
the compilation of census data could only be used for statistical 
purposes.  By 1918 this regulation was codified, providing that 
no one could view the information without the express consent of 
the individual.  Unfortunately, no time limit was given and, 
combined with a legal opinion of the justice department of 1985, 
it was interpreted that the information had to remain secret 
forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some historians believe that the original 1906 and 1918 
provisions had to do with a prevailing concern that the census 
data could be used for taxation purposes or military service.  It 
is doubtful that the prevailing concern of the time was that 
historians would use the data some 100 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a most recent report, the privacy commissioner, Bruce 
Phillips, warned the industry minister that the release of census 
data could seriously hamper the accuracy of future census and 
renege on a previous commitment to secrecy.  The industry 
minister has nonetheless asked Statistics Canada to undertake a 
study of options to amend the legislation in this regard by 
either retroactively changing the confidentiality provisions from 
1911 onward or by amending the legislation for censuses taken 
from 2001 onward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada were to place its census data under lock and key 
forever it would sadly be far out of step with many other western 
nations.  For example, in the United States census data is 
released after 72 years and an individual can retrieve his or her 
own data at any time.  In Australia census data is released after 
100 years.  In France census data is released after 100 years. 
In Denmark census data is released after 65 years, and in the 
United Kingdom efforts are being made to release data after 100 
years. 
It is now two years later.  We are still waiting for something to 
be done by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the panel will report to the minister by the end 
of May 2000.  Hopefully the motion we are debating today will 
spur the minister to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I had written earlier to the industry minister.  To 
be fair, his original response to me was on the government's 
line, that they could not release the information.  I wrote back 
to him and the chief statistician responded, admitting that the 
minister directed him to develop options for changing the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appeared that the minister was going to pay some attention to 
the matter in order to release this information, which was 
positive news until we realized that he had struck a panel to 
study the matter.  We urge the government to release this 
important information so that we can strengthen the institution 
of family and thereby strengthen our nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, many 
historians, genealogists and researchers had expected that the 
1911 census records would be publicly available in 2003, 92 years 
after the taking of the census.  They were dismayed to find out 
that this was not to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's censuses up to and including 1901 were taken on the 
acts of parliament which did not contain a specific 
confidentiality provision having the force of law.  As a result 
census records up to and including the 1901 census have been 
transferred to the national archives and are now available for 
public access. However, starting with the 1906 census, access to 
individual census records is explicitly prohibited by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a general perception that Statistics Canada 
has taken an arbitrary position on the matter and is simply 
refusing to release the 1911 census records.   This is certainly 
not the case.  In fact, the agency is respecting the legislation 
for which censuses have been taken since 1906.  Starting in 1906, 
the legislation giving authority to collect census information 
contains statutory confidentiality provisions.  These provisions 
are such that only the person named in the record may have access 
to his or her own information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a time limitation on this access.  Even when the 
person is deceased, the provisions are still in effect.  As a 
result, Statistics Canada cannot make public census records taken 
under the authority of the 1906 and all subsequent statistics 
acts without breaching the Statistics Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada continues to hold all individual returns of 
census questionnaires collected between 1906 and 1991.  These 
records are on microfilm and extracts are made available only to 
individual respondents who need to confirm birth dates for 
pension purposes, passports, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make the point that information from the current 
census records can be released only when written consent of the 
person named in the record or the person's legal representative 
has been provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also Statistics Canada has never considered the destruction of 
the 1906 and later census records.  These records have been 
transferred to microfilm and the original paper questionnaires 
have been destroyed in accordance with approvals given by the 
National Archives of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that historians, genealogists and researchers have 
legitimate reasons for wanting access to historical census 
records.  We also have to recognize and respect the right to 
privacy of individual Canadians and their ancestors.   While 
there is undeniably great value attached to nominative historical 
census records, this is where an important principle of privacy 
protection comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is being asked to retroactively alter the conditions 
under which information was provided by Canadians.  Is this 
right?  The privacy commissioner strongly opposes a retroactive 
amendment to the Statistics Act which would allow the transfer of 
individually identifiable census records to the National Archives 
of Canada for archival and access purposes.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner is of the view that allowing third party access 
to census records for such purposes constitutes a use that is 
inconsistent with the guarantee of confidentiality that 
Statistics Canada gave to Canadians when collecting their 
personal information.  He is also of the view that it constitutes 
a violation of fundamental privacy principles requiring that the 
personal information be used only for the purpose for which it 
was collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, many historians and archivists view Canada's 
census as a national treasure that must be preserved.  They argue 
that the census should be available after a reasonable period of 
time in order to conduct research which will shed light on the 
personal and community histories of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument often used to access Canadian census records is 
that census records in the United States and the United Kingdom 
are publicly accessible.  I would like to remind my colleagues 
that this is an issue of different legislation and perhaps of 
culture when it comes to the taking of a census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is undeniably great value attached to historical 
census records, there is also great value attached to the 
aggregate information that can be produced from current and 
future censuses.  Much of this value is contained in various 
pieces of legislation.  For example, population counts play a 
vital role in determining the amount and allocation of 
federal-provincial transfer payments for Canada health and social 
transfers, equalization and territorial formula financing. These 
payments were established at $39 billion in 2000-01 and the 
census is required to allocate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada feels that the most important factor 
contributing to respondent co-operation is the unconditional 
guarantee given to respondents that the information they supply 
will be protected.  Canada, for almost 100 years, has been able 
to unconditionally guarantee the confidentiality of the 
information supplied in the census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the commitments made to respondents in the past could 
have a negative impact on the level of co-operation given to 
future censuses and surveys.  A substantial decrease in such 
co-operation could jeopardize Statistics Canada's ability to 
carry out its national mandate of producing reliable and timely 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recognizes the importance of historical research 
but also must take into account the privacy concerns of 
Canadians.  This is why he has created the expert panel on access 
to historical census records.  This panel of eminent Canadians 
will look at the issues and provide an approach which would 
balance the need to protect personal privacy with the demands of 
genealogists and historians for access to historical census 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five member panel, which is chaired by Dr. Richard Van Loon, 
president of Carleton University, has been asked to make 
recommendations to the minister by May 31, 2000.  The panel has 
been provided with all relevant documents and information on this 
matter.  The panel is reviewing this information and is meeting 
with key stakeholders to seek their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the House should wait for the expert panel on access 
to historical census records to make its recommendations before 
voting on this issue.

<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise to address the motion raised by the 
member for Calgary Southeast with respect to the release of the 
post-1901 census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent months, a number of genealogists and historians have 
articulated their collective disappointment that the 1911 census 
records will not be available for review in the public domain in 
the year 2003.  These individuals had previously expected the 
1911 census records to be made available for research purposes 
in this particular year because census records have been, up to 
this point, accessible to the public after 92 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, censuses administered after 1901 fall subject to the 
Statistics Act that explicitly prohibits the release of all 
census records.  This prohibition does not allow anyone to 
access census records for any reason; the only exception is that 
an individual may access his or her own personal records—but that 
is the only current exception.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual may not access the census records of anyone else, 
not even those belonging to his or her immediate family members, 
nor even those records belonging to members of his ancestral 
family tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dilemma here is quite clear.  And yet, it is quite difficult 
to resolve.  We have two competing interests that present a 
difficult case for the House.  On the one hand, we have the 
reality of statutory integrity, upon which our nation is founded 
and, on the other, the practical idealism presented to us by 
historical curiosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have argued that the release of census records is crucial 
to furthering the knowledge Canadians hold of their past, of 
their communities, of their families, and of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to census records is what enables individuals, scholars, 
researchers, and historians alike to trace their respective 
histories and to answer questions about their past: from 
questions as simple as when exactly one's ancestry arrived in 
Canada, to questions as nationally significant as the face of 
the brave men who fought and defended Canada in the first World 
War.  Answering these questions can indeed teach Canadians a lot 
about themselves and about their origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadian historians have called upon these records to 
answer these and countless other questions which offer great 
insights into our history as a people. 
As such, the availability of census returns up to 1901 has been 
a tremendous resource for researchers in search of information 
with respect to housing, health, income, and general social 
conditions of the day.  But, again, researchers have been able 
to conduct their invaluable research based upon the laws in 
place before 1906 which authorized the release of these census 
records 92 years after they were taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, census data will not be available to 
Canadians come the year 2003, the year during which census data 
from 1911 would have been made available in the National 
Archives for public reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, however, those who argue that the census records should be 
released to the public argue that respect for statutory 
integrity and privacy is important. 
In 1906, when the change was made that all future censuses would 
be kept confidential and rendered forever inaccessible, 
legislators made a commitment to Canadians.  This commitment was 
that Canadians' responses to census questions would not be 
divulged to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government currently requires Canadian residents to 
answer increasingly intrusive and intimate questions on its 
censuses.  These questions included proddings into Canadians' 
marital status, physical characteristics, nationality, ethnic 
origin, wages earned, insurance held, educational attainment, 
and also proddings into respondents' infirmities and sicknesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the government census is not an everyday survey or 
questionnaire—it is very involved and it can also make for quite 
a personal experience.  In fact, census data are now collected 
every five years, instead of every ten, as they once were. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians will readily answer these questions and willingly 
provide the federal government with the information it requests. 
Others will be more hesitant to divulge their personal 
information.  Still, because the federal government requires 
Canadians to do so under fear of fine or imprisonment, everyone 
ends of answering all the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Why do they answer these intrusive questions?  What puts 
their minds at ease in divulging this information?  It is no more 
than the federal government's unqualified guarantee of 
confidentiality that allows Canadians to answer these very 
personal questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This guarantee is what convinced Canadians to divulge so much of 
themselves dating back to 1911, the guarantee offered by the 
federal government through the Statistics Act, and that remains 
the pledge the government has made to Canadians regarding their 
privacy. 
Would Canadians so willingly and accurately provide this 
information otherwise?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is our dilemma.  The Laurier government promised that the 
information collected in the census after 1901 would remain 
confidential.  The interesting part is no one is sure why this 
promise was made.  Archival records indicate that the 
confidentiality provision was designed to reassure citizens that 
census enumerators would not pass along the information to tax 
collectors or military conscription personnel. Archival records 
or not, it remains unclear why these privacy provisions are in 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that our world has changed dramatically since 1901. 
We have cultural values.  While today we place the utmost 
importance on personal issues, back then according to the 
information, the reason for keeping census records forever 
confidential was the fear that information would be leaked to tax 
collectors and military personnel, not because they wanted to 
keep the information confidential for eternity.  Canadians' 
concerns in 1906 were short term, to keep the information away 
from the taxman and from the military.  We cannot be certain the 
goal was to keep information from historians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of the utmost importance that we do not bar Canadians 
access to their history.  In a relatively young country such as 
ours, we must do everything we can to promote and encourage our 
history and heritage.  In so doing we perpetuate and strengthen 
Canadian sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the concern for statutory integrity and privacy 
interests.  However, the releasing of census records after 92 
years would not pose an infringement on statutory integrity nor 
be an invasion of privacy.  After 92 years those who completed 
the census as adults are likely to be deceased, at which point 
the concern for privacy is less important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Canadians today have been quite vocal in their 
support for releasing census records for research purposes. Given 
the overwhelming support for the release of records, we in the 
House cannot ignore the call of Canadians.  This is an instance 
where the sensibilities of what Canadians feel is right and 
justifiable must be taken into account.  If Canadians of today do 
not see the release of census records as an infringement on the 
privacy rights of Canadians of yesterday, then we as legislators 
have a duty to listen to their collective voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians today wish to retain access to census records 92 
years after a census has been administered, then given the 
precedence set in the period leading up to 1911, we should 
accommodate them.  In doing so we would be accommodating 
ourselves as well.  Research into our history as a people and as 
a nation may only be furthered by allowing access to these 
invaluable records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my support for the motion brought forward by the member 
for Calgary Southeast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am happy to speak to Motion No. 
160.  I congratulate my colleague for bringing the motion 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very interesting thing is happening in current society.  In 
the field of genealogy today people are currently looking at the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently heard a lecture given by Steve Dotto.  I believe he 
has a regular program on CBC where he talks about the Internet, 
computers and so on.  He said that there has been a tremendous 
growth in the interest in genealogy in the country and one reason 
is that the Internet is such a good tool.  He said if we want to 
learn all of the various activities, the best training device and 
lesson plan we could come up with particularly if we had a 
natural interest in the subject would be to pursue the genealogy 
of our own families.  All the lessons we need in order to learn 
how to effectively use the Internet would come through that field 
of endeavour and study.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that at the very time there is this burgeoning 
field in society current day families are looking more and more 
at their roots and their past.  We are looking at our 
institutions with renewed enthusiasm.  Whether it is the 
military, the RCMP, the church or other important institutions in 
society, there is a renewed interest in all of them.  We see it 
on November 11 with the increasing turnout of people at 
Remembrance Day ceremonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very time when all this renewed interest is happening we 
have run into a brick wall potentially on the release of census 
data.  This data is from the 1911 census.  The 1901 census data 
was available in 1993.  The major period of migration to Canada 
was between the start of the 20th century and the beginning of 
World War I in 1914.  There are millions of Canadians whose first 
ancestors arrived in Canada during that period.  We must take 
that into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an expectation on the part of virtually everyone that 
the data was going to be available in 2003.  Some minds figured 
out that is not going to happen.  It all changed because of a 
regulation in 1906. Although it is largely speculative, we know 
that they were not thinking about what the circumstances would be 
90 or 100 years down the road.  Logic dictates that the reason 
the release of census data collected was pre-empted at that time 
had to do with everyday concerns about conscription, what the 
military or the taxman might do with the data for people who 
completed the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way the regulations read at the time. Looking back 
on it we know in current terms if we use the natural lifespan of 
people that a 90 or a 100 year release of census data addresses 
privacy concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do some other western democracies do with their census 
data?  It is important to make a comparison.  The U.S. releases 
its data after 72 years;  Australia, 100; France, 100; Denmark, 
65; and in the U.K. efforts are under way to release the 
information after 100 years.   There has been some concern about 
retroactive alteration of confidentiality requirements and the 
whole subject of a privacy guarantee that was made when the data 
was collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of a single way individuals will be negatively 
impacted by releasing data 90 or 100 years later. Therefore I 
cannot think of a single way this will negatively impact 
participation by the population at large in current census 
collection.  It will put us in step with other western 
democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major point I am trying to make is that the motion is very 
worthy of our support to ensure that the 1911 census data is 
released in 2003. 
For the 1921 census and others in the future there is lots of 
time to come up with a very structured response to how the data 
will be released.  In the meantime it is important to address the 
very specific issue on the 1911 census.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate.  I was not planning to do so 
but I have been listening to the debate and my own private poll 
would indicate the people with whom I have spoken recognize there 
was a law passed in 1911 and that not many people today 
understand why the law came into effect.  Now there is an expert 
panel which has been appointed by the industry minister to try to 
resolve this by the end of next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to be very brief in my remarks.  I concur with the 
motion that is before the House this morning.  I would hope that 
the expert panel chaired by the president of Carleton University 
would pay attention to what has been said here in debate by the 
previous speakers on this topic and those who intend to take part 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may just interject a personal note, my uncle wrote a 
relatively readable book on the history of his mother's family. 
They emigrated to Canada from the area of Virginia around 1776 
because they supported the king in the war of the colonies. My 
uncle's book traced the history since then. I am sure he did that 
based on many of the tables that were available to him through 
the archives and other areas.  Now we are told that beginning 
with 1911 the records are not available because a law of which 
nobody seems to know the history says the records will be sealed 
in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy Commissioner Bruce Phillips, a former well-known 
television newsman, seems to have sided solely with privacy that 
would protect people into the grave and beyond.  For the life of 
me I cannot understand why after 92 or 100 years there would be a 
real problem.  If there are people or families who are concerned 
about this it would be interesting to hear them speak out on the 
topic but we certainly are not aware of them to the very best of 
my knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Phillips the Privacy Commissioner has said “People who give 
information to the government under penalty of law and an 
unqualified promise of confidentiality are entitled to expect 
that that trust will be honoured”.  Nobody would disagree with 
that but the question must be asked for how long, for 92 or 100 
years?  At what point do these competing demands take effect and 
the interests of amateur historians, genealogists and researchers 
come to the fore? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker mentioned the migration and immigration to 
western Canada that took part in the early years of this century. 
The prairies were filled out at that time and people want to 
know what happened in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba as well 
as the other provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear, and I am sure there will be differences 
of opinion in all caucuses on this, that this is a private 
member's motion on which it is everyone's right to vote.  I will 
support the motion when we vote on it. At the same time I will be 
watching with interest to see what the committee of experts 
decides when it reports to the industry minister on May 31.  But 
for the life of me, I cannot figure out why we would not want to 
pass on information about our ancestors and allow it to be 
studied by those who are alive now as opposed to protecting those 
who have been deceased for some time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a great honour to rise in the House today to speak 
about this very important issue.  I want to say at the outset 
that I have had a number of calls from constituents with respect 
to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of great importance, not only from a genealogical 
point of view but also from an historic point of view.  It is 
something that we on the government side have indicated we take 
seriously and want to take a very strong, fast and hard look at 
all the options with respect to where we should go on this all 
important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues in the House that the transfer of census 
records to the national archives for public access is a very 
complex issue.  Although historians, genealogists and researchers 
have legitimate reasons for wanting access to historical census 
records, we have to balance that and at least weigh in the 
respect and the right to privacy for individual Canadians and 
their ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a balancing act and one on which we have to give careful 
thought in this very important and delicate matter.  I want to 
point out that the minister and the government have gone on 
record as doing precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us, while perhaps of some interest to some 
people, is really premature based on the fact that our minister 
and our government have moved in this area.  We are taking a look 
at exploring and reviewing the options.  In so doing, it is 
important to note that the minister has created an expert panel 
of eminent Canadians to provide independent insight into this 
very important issue, where expert advice on legalities and 
privacy in archival matters are explored and the implications 
looked into in a meaningful way which will bring credibility to 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five member panel is comprised of: Dr. Richard Van Loon, who 
is president of Carleton University with a long history, 
including with the federal government; Chad Gaffield, director at 
the institute for Canadian studies and professor of history at 
the University of Ottawa; the Honourable Gérard La Forest, a 
retired supreme court justice; the Honourable Lorna Marsden, 
president and vice-chancellor at York University and former 
president of my alma mater Wilfrid Laurier University; and John 
McCamus, president of Osgoode Hall Law School at York University 
in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the panel were chosen with great care and are 
highly regarded Canadians who have a great deal of insight into 
these matters.  They were appointed on the basis of individual 
merit for their expertise and their long term interest in 
historical research and privacy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has asked the panel to recommend by May 31 of this 
year an approach that balances the need to protect personal 
privacy with the demand of genealogists, historians and others 
who want access to historical census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to individual census records for all censuses starting 
with the 1906 census is explicitly prohibited by law while census 
records up to and including the 1901 census are publicly 
available through the National Archives.  These records are in a 
public domain because the censuses up to and including the 1901 
census were conducted under legislation that did not contain a 
specific confidentiality provision having the force of law. 
However, access to individual census records for all censuses 
starting the the 1906 census is explicitly prohibited by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1906 and for all subsequent censuses thereafter, the 
legislation giving the authority to collect census information 
containing statutory confidentiality provisions was in place. 
These provisions are such that only the person named in the 
record may have access to his or her own information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no time limitation on this access.  Even when the 
person is deceased, the provisions are still in effect.  As a 
result, Statistics Canada, without breaching the Statistics Act, 
cannot, according to law, make public the census records taken 
under the authority of the 1906 and all subsequent Statistics 
Acts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has of course—and it is apparent as a result of the 
correspondence certainly that I get and other members of 
parliament—dismayed many genealogists and researchers who had 
expected that the 1911 census and the records would be publicly 
available in 2003, 92 years after the taking of that census. They 
argue, and some would say rightly so, that the census should be 
available after a reasonable period of time in order to conduct 
research that historians, genealogists and others like to do, 
which would shed light on the personal and community history of 
Canadians across the country.  They would like to see a change in 
the Statistics Act which would confirm that census records would 
be available after 92 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be a perception that Statistics Canada has taken an 
arbitrary position in this matter and is circumventing 
regulations under the Privacy Act. That is certainly not the 
case.  The agency is respecting the legislation under which 
censuses have been taken since 1906.  It is after all the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House are aware, the Statistics Act, like any 
law, can be amended.  While there is undeniably great value 
attached to nominative historical census records, this is where 
an important principle of privacy protection comes into play.  Is 
it right to alter retroactively the conditions under which 
information was collected by Canadians and provided by them?  It 
is a question that we need to look at and grapple with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner, Mr. Bruce Phillips, says no.  He 
strongly opposes a retroactive amendment to the Statistics Act 
which would alter and allow the transfer of individually 
identifiable census records collected during past censuses, 1906 
to 1991 to be precise, to the National Archives of Canada for 
archival and access purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is undeniably great value attached to historic 
census records, there is also great value attached to the 
aggregate information that can be produced from current and 
future censuses as well.  That information is and will be used 
for a multiplicity of purposes, and as genealogists and 
historians know, that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the commitments made to respondents in the past could 
have a negative impact on the level of co-operation given to 
future censuses and surveys.  A substantial decrease in such 
co-operation could seriously jeopardize Statistics Canada and its 
ability to carry out its national mandate of producing reliable, 
timely information on which many users depend.  It is very 
accurate and it is known throughout the world as being a good 
model, which many countries copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Census information is used for a multiplicity of purposes, as I 
have noted.  For example, population counts play a vital role in 
determining the amount and the allocation of federal-provincial 
transfer payments for the Canada health and social transfers, 
equalization and territorial formula financing. These payments 
were estimated at $39 billion in the year 2000-01 and the census 
is required to allocate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The census also provides comprehensive information for analysis 
of the social and economic issues of concerns to all Canadians. 
These issues include education, training, language use, 
immigration, multiculturalism, income support, child and elder 
care, housing programs and many other issues, all of which are 
relied upon as a result of the information gathered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I want to remind my colleagues that census 
information is a fundamental pillar of our democratic system.  We 
have a great system.  We need to promote it.  We need to protect 
it.  We need to ensure that it survives into the 21st century. 
That is our job, not only as parliamentarians but also as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data from the census is one that measures indicators that 
electors use to evaluate the performance of their government. 
This must never be taken lightly.  I know that members in the 
House do not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the minister having appointed the panel and the government

should now go forward and hear what that panel of experts has to 
say.  After that, we will be in a far better position to make 
subsequent decisions that affect Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad to have the 
opportunity to participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all my Liberal colleagues who have participated in the 
debate.  I especially want to thank the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington for not only acknowledging the effort of the 
member of the Canadian Alliance but for very clearly pointing out 
the efforts the government has undertaken with respect to this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue.  Many Canadians have asked us about 
the census and we have an obligation to respond to their 
concerns.  However, I, too, want to take this opportunity to 
re-emphasize to Canadians exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest of respect to the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast, I must say that as much as his motion makes a lot of 
sense, the government and the Minister of Industry have already 
taken the initiative, as was so eloquently pointed out by my 
Liberal colleague, to put a panel together to look at this most 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do compliment the effort by the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast, but it is premature.  We owe it to each and every 
Canadian to wait until the end of May when the panel will report 
back with its findings and tells us “This is what we have done. 
This is the information we have gathered.  This is our opinion 
and this is our view”.  I am confident that at that time, not 
only the Minister of Industry, who is the minister responsible 
for Statistics Canada, but all of us in the House will make that 
decision on which direction to go in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The date the panel will report back is May 31, 2000.   Canadians 
who want to maintain the protection of personal information and 
those who would like to examine personal information or 
communities, historically speaking, will have the opportunity at 
the appropriate time to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal colleague talked about the members of the panel, who 
are prominent Canadians.  I will take this opportunity to tell 
Canadians who they are so they can be assured that the people 
looking into this most important issue are indeed people who are 
well recognized and well respected and have the expertise and the 
knowledge to face this most important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five member panel is chaired by Dr. Richard Van Loon, 
president of Carleton University.  The other members are Chad 
Gaffield, director, institute of Canadian studies and professor 
of history, University of Ottawa; the Hon. Gérard La Forest, 
retired supreme court judge; the Hon. Lorna Marsden, president 
and vice-chancellor, York University; and John McCamus, professor 
of law, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These prominent Canadians reflect how seriously the government 
is taking this issue.  These individuals will do what is right. 
When they come to the government and the minister with their 
recommendations, I assure all the people who are interested in 
this important issue that we will take it as seriously as the 
hon. member for Calgary Southeast has in bringing forth this 
motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel has been provided with all relevant documents and 
information so that it can do a proper job.  The panel is 
reviewing this information and is meeting with key stakeholders 
to seek their views.  It will not only be these five members 
doing the work.  They will be reaching out to various members in 
various communities right across Canada to make sure that the 
data is transparent and well received.  The panel's 
recommendations will be the basis for serious review and 
immediate follow-up by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although historians, genealogists and researchers are upset that 
the 1906 and subsequent census records will not be accessible to 
the public and are asking that the legislation be amended, the 
privacy commissioner strongly opposes a retroactive amendment to 
the Statistics Canada Act which would provide access to 
individually identifiable census records collected in past 
censuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complicated issue.  I want to detail what historical 
census records are available to the public at the present time. 
All microfilm records of the 1901 and earlier censuses are 
currently available to the public and are under the control of 
the National Archives of Canada.  I want the people of Canada to 
know that because there is a perception that everything is locked 
away and hidden and not available to Canadians.  That is simply 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People ask where historical census records are available.  All 
microfilm records of censuses taken in 1901 and earlier are 
currently available to the public and are under the control of 
the National Archives.  Provincial archives in many regional 
libraries have also acquired copies of the same records.  Local 
libraries can request census microfilms through interlibrary 
exchange programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the earlier census records available to the public and 
not later ones?  Many Canadians have been asking this question 
and I would like to take a few moments to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The earlier censuses were conducted under various census acts 
which did not contain the same type of confidentiality provisions 
that are a fundamental part of Statistics Canada legislation 
today.  Consequently, it was not until the passing of the Privacy 
Act in 1983 that there was some legislative authority governing 
these 1901 and earlier records.  Under the Privacy Act 
information under the control of the National Archives can be 
placed in the public domain in cases where the information was 
obtained through a census or survey 92 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which the average Canadian often does not 
understand.  Therefore, I feel it is appropriate to outline to 
Canadians exactly what this issue is about so that they can feel 
comfortable that this government, previous governments or future 
governments do not have a big brother image over them, collect 
information, lock it up and use it as they so choose.  That is 
simply not the case.  That is why I am taking this opportunity to 
put Canadians at ease as to what exactly happens with the 
information we gather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken the bull by the horns.  It has 
undertaken an initiative to move forward positively.  In saying 
this, again, I compliment the member for Calgary Southeast 
because I know he cares.  His heart is where it should be.  He is 
attempting to ensure that each and every Canadian, organization 
and facility has access to this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry and the government recognize the 
importance of historical records.  We have also taken the 
opportunity to point out our concern.  There are privacy 
concerns.  By the end of May we will be in a position to respond 
properly.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REPORT STAGE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 3 consideration of Bill C-23, an act to to 
modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and 
obligations, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and 
of the motions in Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I wish to inform the 
House that there has been a change in the voting pattern for the 
report stage of Bill C-23, the details of which are available at 
the table. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise 
today to speak on behalf of my constituents against Bill C-23. We 
have just witnessed closure on the bill, another timely action by 
the government.  I have actually lost track of how many times the 
government has invoked it.  It is getting to be a habit.  It is 
all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my constituents are upset with the content of the bill. 
I will be expressing the views of thousands of them as well as 
millions across Canada who have written in and sent in petitions 
on the issue.  The view is that institutions which provide the 
historical, social, economic and legal foundations for the 
country deserve more respect and consideration than is being 
shown by this unaccountable government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unaccountable because it has consistently sat back and 
allowed questionable court decisions to dictate how it responds 
to issues that concern Canadians.  It has dragged its feet on 
young offenders legislation and wandered aimlessly in the legal 
wilderness while judges decided it was more important for 
pedophiles to have access that victimizes children than for those 
children to have a chance at a decent life free from 
exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to wonder what is worse: to watch the Liberals 
stumble over issues they do not want to deal with or to see them 
intervene in areas they have chosen as their pet projects.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side have expressed outrage over the 
irresponsible dispensation of taxpayer money to multimillion 
dollar corporations and other dubious projects that we have seen 
in the last month or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fully aware that there can be good public spending, that 
poor and vulnerable Canadians need a hand up at critical times in 
their lives, but what we have seen instead is a disproportionate 
amount of taxpayer dollars wasted on outdated concepts of what 
constitutes economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see in Bill C-23 is an ill conceived and badly written 
bill which attempts to address the concerns of one segment of 
Canadian society by trampling on the sensibilities of society in 
general.  It is not just the so-called Christian right that is 
uncomfortable with the implications of the bill but well meaning 
Jewish and Muslim communities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average Canadians who express their beliefs about fairness and 
equality in various ways are also concerned with the long term 
impact of omnibus bills which purport to sweep away supposed 
inequalities in one fell swoop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the scope that is worrisome here.  It is the 
confusion and open-ended qualifications in Bill C-23 which should 
stop the government and any clear thinking person in their 
tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet ministers are unclear about the meaning of conjugality 
as it is used in the legislation.  The justice minister rejected 
the idea that public benefits should be based on dependency and 
insisted that conjugal referred to the sexual union of a couple. 
The Secretary of State for Multiculturalism disagreed and 
expressed the idea that there were some requirements to fulfil in 
order to be considered conjugal but not necessarily sexual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking Canadians to commit public money and the future 
direction of social policy based on undefined opinions about who 
might qualify and who might not.  It is terribly irresponsible 
because it allows the Liberals to take the easy way out:  write a 
big bill and let the courts settle it later.  It sounds very 
familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians realize it was the actions of the courts that 
started all this in the first place and now we leave the future 
of Canadian families to them again.  The biggest loose end is the 
absence of any definition of marriage, which our amendments will 
seek to rectify.  This is an issue that is providing all sorts of 
amusement as various parties try to dance around the ultimate 
intentions of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals started out by claiming the bill was just about 
addressing an equality issue raised in a court case.  Supposedly 
M v H required the redefinition of spouse, and so the government 
scrambled to change hundreds of statutes to comply.  That court 
decision was really about redefining the responsibilities of 
partners toward each other in relation to splitting up property, 
but never let it be said that those without a backbone cannot 
stand at attention when a judge makes a decision over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear to everyone else that when hundreds of laws were 
rewritten to change what it meant to be a spouse the result would 
be the dilution of the sanctity of marriage, but the justice 
minister kept up that fiction for a while.  Public pressure 
finally got to her.  She announced last week that a definition of 
marriage would be posted in the front of Bill C-23, which I 
suppose undermines her assurances that Bill C-23 was not just 
about marriage.   Unfortunately putting it in the preamble gives 
very little weight to the amendment.  Canadians will not be 
fooled by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean the confusion has gone away, especially not 
in this place.  On April 3 the member for Burnaby—Douglas began 
his speech by suggesting that Bill C-23 had nothing to do with 
marriage.  Then he spent 10 minutes complaining that the 
definition of marriage needed changing and he would not be 
satisfied until that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He introduced the notion that restricting marriage to 
heterosexual relationships automatically rendered all other 
relationships as inferior, although I would suggest that he is 
taking this a little too personally and forgetting that there are 
millions of Canadians in a variety of relationships who do not go 
whining to the government for a pat on the back for every 
decision they make in their personal lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also raised the point that marriage, and the laws 
that have defined it, have changed over the years.  He repeated 
the old myth that the rule of thumb used to refer to the right of 
a husband to beat his wife as long as his weapon of choice was no 
thicker than his thumb.  Winnipeg historian Gerry Bowler points 
out that the rule of thumb is a reference from the lumber trade 
and wife beating has always been illegal in England and its 
colonies, including Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heated rhetoric aside, the point is taken that marriage and 
divorce have been examined and redefined over the years.  That 
does not mean that there has been a continuous stream of blissful 
progress, far from it.  Divorce laws were liberalized in the 
1970s and the implications of this are coming home to roost now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of common law relationships has risen faster than the 
rate of traditional marriages in recent years.  Lone parent 
families are becoming more numerous.  It is rare that Canadians 
do not know other couples who are divorced if they themselves are 
not among those statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been widely documented that the implications of all this 
include economic distress, personal breakdowns, increased stress 
on social programs and systems, and a rise in youth crime and 
anti-social behaviour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to exaggerate.  In fact I will say that many 
people successfully cope with everything thrown in their path. 
But that does not mean it is good public policy to create these 
stresses and then ask Canadian taxpayers to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a good, better and best way to organize society, and we 
are here to make sure we do what is best.  Not everybody will 
agree with the decisions, but sometimes it is right to say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would argue that what we see happening in society is 
a lot of people making personal decisions and governments having 
no moral authority to dictate what those choices should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is confusion over the obligations and entitlements of 
individuals and a deliberate blurring of the lines between what 
affects an individual and what applies to the group as a 
collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are responsible for the general conduct of society 
and the preservation of its institutions.  The best they can do 
is lay down the guidelines for what is desirable or beneficial 
behaviour for the greatest number and then make sure that all 
law-abiding citizens are free to make the best lives for 
themselves.  Only when one citizen interferes in the rights of 
another, especially when the vulnerable are being victimized by 
the powerful, do governments have a duty to step in and use 
guidelines to restore order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines cannot be whimsical and they cannot be remade 
every time another self-identified group rises to demand that 
society recognize its special circumstances.  That is not 
tolerance or compassion.  That is chaos and everybody in society 
suffers as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that open societies cannot make 
accommodations for legitimate demands, only that those demands 
have to be held up to public scrutiny and be openly debated by a 
broad representation of society.  That is not what we are seeing 
with Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Otherwise intelligent individuals are reduced to name-calling 
and spurious references to try to get their points across. 
Others, who are the first to complain if their free speech or 
ability to express themselves is being trampled, are the first to 
shout down their opponents and insult their beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an omnibus bill that wants to affect 68 statutes 
covering 20 government departments, but it wants to do so with 
ill-defined concepts, no provisions for co-operation among those 
departments and no recognition that the bill is unsettling for 
millions of Canadians on all sides of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a <I>Globe and Mail</I> article dated March 18, 2000, several 
gay men expressed reservations about having traditional forms of 
entitlements and obligations imposed upon them.  Toronto writer 
R. M. Vaughan is quoted as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this legislation codifies the larger battle in gay 
culture between conservative elements who want to mimic 
heterosexuals and think that is the path to freedom, and the 
traditionalists, now turned upside down as radicals, who don't 
want anything to do with straight norms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that Bill C-23 introduces lawyers to the bedrooms 
of the nation and drives thousands of couples to define their 
relationship in terms of where they might fit on a bureaucratic 
scale of benefits.  Rather than impose equality on a wider range 
of relationships, Bill C-23 would impose dozens more distinctions 
for individual Canadians, and their personal decisions would come 
under scrutiny and evaluation from faceless bureaucrats and 
overpaid lawyers.  As I mentioned earlier, there is a blurring of 
the lines between what affects an individual and what applies to 
a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have said that Bill C-23 is not about marriage, 
only about extending benefits.  In 1996 the justice minister of 
the day said that Bill C-33, at that time, was not about 
extending benefits, just about putting sexual orientation into 
the charter.  There are many quotes which could verify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burnaby—Douglas asked if marriage was so fragile 
that it could not stand to be pulled and stretched by the courts, 
and of course the Liberals, in this way.  In response the member 
for Erie—Lincoln said that 20 years after benefits were extended 
to opposite sex common law couples people were still getting 
married in significant numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over one million lone parent families, about 85% of 
them headed by women.  In many cases people are making personal 
choices, although I am not sure that divorce is always a case of 
choice.  I am sure that many people come to regret the choices 
they have made and we know that most of the children who do not 
have a choice in the matter are not always well served by these 
arrangements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to begin by saying that this is a very delicate 
matter.  Bill C-23 is an issue of concern for Canadians on all 
sides of the political spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken a number of calls and representations made by my 
constituents as to how they feel on both sides of this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, in this great parliament and across this 
great country, it is a matter of fairness, tolerance and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to the kinds of comments that have been made by members 
opposite with respect to this all important matter.  I object to 
the myths, the falsehoods and the misinformation that people, 
especially members opposite, have found it necessary to use to 
stir up people, to try to pit people against people and group 
against group in Canada, which prides itself on being a tolerant, 
caring and compassionate society.  It is important that we 
proceed with Bill C-23 in a manner consistent with the great 
values of Canada.  I think that is precisely what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the comments of members opposite.  I want to 
be very clear that what is at stake are both rights and 
obligations.  The granting of same sex privileges will confer 
certain rights and there will be obligations which will flow from 
that.  Let me also be clear that this bill, which has been 
studied at committee and is now before us once again in the 
House, deliberately maintains a clear legal distinction between 
married and common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that courts have ruled on this matter.  We know that we 
in the House are obliged to follow through with legislation. We 
also know that equal treatment should be afforded in the law for 
all Canadians, whomever they may be and wherever they may live, 
common law opposite sex couples or common law same sex couples. 
It makes no difference.  We are talking about fairness, 
compassion and equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It remains for the government to choose how to achieve the goal 
of equal treatment, and so it is that Bill C-23 represents the 
government's choice to provide equal treatment while also 
responding to the concerns of many Canadians about the need to 
preserve the fundamental institution of marriage.  This bill 
strikes a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill uses clear language to maintain the term spouse 
for married couples and to introduce a new term, common law 
partner, for unmarried, committed relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, under clause 1.1 it is now stated clearly that nothing 
in this bill would, in any way, shape or form, alter or affect 
marriage as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has been raised is the question of whether 
individuals will have to go to court to find out if they qualify 
as a common law partner because of the use of the term conjugal. 
Quite frankly, this defies common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common law relationships are not new.  The word conjugal has 
been used in federal law for some 40 years to describe common law 
opposite sex couples.  There is absolutely no reason that there 
should suddenly be a problem in this area where there has not 
been one before.  Let us put that to rest once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common law partners, both opposite sex and same sex, will apply 
for benefits and be held responsible for obligations in the same 
way that already occurs for common law opposite sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members across the floor raise a concern about those who 
might try to take advantage of the system, either by declaring a 
relationship that does not exist or by failing to declare one 
that does.  They raise all kinds of outrageous scenarios, which 
is beneath them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new situation either in law or in the 
administration of federal law.  Declaring a relationship that 
does not exist or failing to declare one that does would be fraud 
and would be dealt with under existing provisions that apply to 
married couples and common law opposite sex partners.  Let us put 
that issue to rest as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have also repeatedly claimed that there is no 
public support for this bill.  On the contrary, this is simply 
not true. 
In a survey conducted in October 1998, 67% of Canadians agreed 
that same sex couples should have the same legal rights and 
obligations as a man and a woman living together as a common law 
partnership or couple.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like a number of colleagues, have heard from many Canadians 
on both sides of this issue, as I said at the outset.  Some are 
concerned about preserving marriage, for example, but just as 
many are concerned about the bill being fair, equitable, tolerant 
and compassionate.  Equal treatment for all is what I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not result in increased taxes for Canadians or 
increased costs for employers because the bill responsibly 
ensures that both benefits and obligations will be extended at 
the same time.  The Department of Finance estimates that the 
fiscal cost will be balanced by the fiscal obligations which will 
rightly ensue.  This is not a cost issue for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, I should note that over 200 private sector Canadian 
employers already extend benefits to same sex partners in their 
employ as a business decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it indicates that a business decision taken in this all 
important area makes sense, not only from a competitive point of 
view but also from a compassionate and human point of view.  We 
in the government are doing the same by bringing forward Bill 
C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind members that the Supreme Court of Canada made 
it clear last May in the ruling of M. v H. that restricting 
government benefits or obligations to common law opposite sex 
couples is simply not consistent with the charter.  Canadians 
respect the charter.  Canadians have a great love for the 
charter.  Why is that?   Because the charter defines us as a 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the member opposite laughing, and well he should laugh 
because it is not we on this side of the House who always want to 
denigrate one of the great institutions of Canada, the charter as 
we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago Mr. Stockwell Day was in Ontario.  I forget how 
the chant went, but I think it went like this “Stockwell Day, go 
away, anti-choice and anti-gay; Stockwell Day, make my day, right 
wing bigot, go away”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are not my words; those are the words of Ontarians who see 
through the code words used by members opposite, who see through 
the bitterness, extremism and underlying hatred of various 
groups.  Quite frankly, we reject that, as do all good thinking, 
caring, compassionate Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member does not laugh at me again I will go back to 
what I was saying, which is that the great charter of ours 
guarantees equality for all Canadians, regardless of age, race, 
ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation.  Those 
guarantees exist for all, and they exist in a manner consistent 
with the fundamental underlying values of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we proceed with Bill C-23 to ensure that 
people, no matter where they live in Canada, are given the kind 
of fundamental respect that Canadians of all stripes not only 
require, need and deserve, but want, because that is after all 
who we are.  We are a nation of greatness built on the very 
foundation of tolerance and compassion, caring and acceptance for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Because our forefathers and foremothers forged 
this land along with native Canadians consistent with the 
underlying belief that we treat each other as we would be 
treated.  Why do we do that?  Because it is the Canadian thing to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to do the right thing and vote 
for Bill C-23. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to take part in this debate, 
which has been at times a very heated and often divisive subject 
before the House. 
The legislation is the modernization of benefits and obligations 
act denoted in <I>Hansard</I> as Bill C-23.  It was tabled in the 
House on February 11 this year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is focused on the human dynamics that exist in the country 
with respect to the rights and obligations that flow from human 
relationships and the recognition thereof in law. The bill has 
raised the ire on certain occasions and certainly caused a lot of 
members of parliament and a lot of Canadians to be inward 
looking.  This is omnibus legislation which means it touches a 
great number of statutes, 68 in total, and extends benefits and 
obligations to same sex couples on the same basis as opposite sex 
common law couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject as I refer to it is sometimes outside the comfort 
level of many in this place and many around the country.  Yet for 
most of us it becomes a question of fairness and equitable 
treatment with respect to benefits that accrue and benefits that 
would flow as a result of human relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A distinction remains with respect to same sex couples.  Many 
would view the differences as alive and well irrespective of the 
legislation passing through the House.  In the eyes of many there 
is a clear distinction between same sex couples and opposite sex 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation levels the playing field with respect to fiscal 
rights and obligations.  As has been referred to by many other 
members in this place and many who have given commentary on the 
bill, it is a bill that respects the Supreme Court of Canada and 
which is consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course with our charter obligations comes the responsibility 
to respect the law. To do otherwise, to deny equal treatment 
under the law and before the law to same sex couples or partners 
would be contrary to Canadian law as it exists and certainly 
contrary to our charter.   The ruling made in May 1999 in the M 
and H case that was handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada 
made it clear that governments and agencies cannot limit benefits 
or obligations by discriminating against same sex common law 
relationships. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
the Canadian Human Rights Act speak of equal treatment and fiscal 
fairness under our law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada approaches this 
bill as we approach many bills that have a moral underpinning, or 
legislation that forces members and rightly so to reflect upon 
their own conscience and the consultation that takes place within 
their constituencies and their ability to be objective and far 
sighted with respect to the position that is taken. For those 
reasons the right hon. Joe Clark, as it is incumbent upon him as 
leader to make decisions from time to time on such bills, has 
released members of this caucus to follow their conscience and 
the wishes of their constituents and to have a free vote.  I 
would suggest that we are the only party in the House which is 
following that particular tact on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is about fairness and financial equity, not 
about infringing upon an individual's moral or personal beliefs. 
The legislation maintains a clear distinction between married and 
unmarried relationships as viewed through the eyes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term spouse, which refers to married couples only, and the 
term common law partner are found in the bill and encompass 
people in common law relationships, both same sex and opposite 
sex.  The definition of marriage, although it was intended not to 
be changed, is now included by virtue of amendments that were put 
forward at the committee stage and further amendments that will 
take place here in the Chamber today with respect to votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Minister of Justice stated clearly throughout the 
weeks and months leading up to the tabling of the bill that the 
definition of marriage was not going to be included, at the last 
minute, at the eleventh hour, the parliamentary secretary tabled 
what was deemed to be a definition of what marriage is. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That definition is one that has been consistently accepted 
throughout the country for many years.  It is one the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada fully embraces and supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that the inclusion of this definition is 
wrong; it is the manner in which it was presented by the 
government.  It was held back until consistent and persistent 
pressure from within the government caucus and around the country 
cried out for a further definition.  Rather than omit it from the 
bill, the government decided to include it.  We accept and 
support that move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation speaks to benefits and obligations.  Same sex 
couples will have the same access as other Canadian couples to 
social benefits and programs to which they have contributed. 
Criteria still have to be met and there are obligations attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite spoke of the financial implications. 
The Minister of Finance, who I understand supports the bill, has 
indicated there will be offsetting savings by the implementation 
of the bill and that the actual cost will be virtually nil at the 
end of the day when one calculates those who will now be entitled 
versus those who may be disqualified from benefits by virtue of 
the acceptance and passage of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some bills that are currently before the country and which will 
be touched and changed include the GST and the HST tax credit 
legislation.  It was very unpopular throughout the country and 
was rejected by Liberals in opposition but as members of the 
government, they have quickly embraced it and expanded it. The 
child tax benefit legislation will also be touched as will old 
age security, the Canada pension plan and the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those types of bills demonstrate quite clearly that this is 
about economic and fiscal fairness as opposed to any moral 
judgment or any attempt to tread on what I think most Canadians 
feel is very sacred ground, which is the spiritual and religious 
definition of couples in marriage and how people interact.  This 
legislation is not meant to be judgmental in that way.  Sadly 
much of the debate embarked on in this place has at times 
digressed into this type of moral judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is consistent with the decision of the supreme 
court.  Bill C-23 will correct certain discriminations and will 
help achieve equal treatment under the law as it pertains to 
fiscal obligations and benefits.  To do otherwise would offend 
the principles of equity that are enshrined in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a strict legal principle with the emotion removed it is 
difficult if not impossible to justify not supporting this type 
of legislation.  Many have expressed reservations and many 
continue to struggle with the issue of homosexuality. This bill 
is more about keeping all Canadians on an equal footing with 
respect to entitlement of benefits and obligations as they 
pertain to fiscal matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces have already moved in this direction.  Many 
corporations and corporate entities have embraced this same 
approach.  British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario have enacted very 
similar legislation to that which we see encompassed in Bill 
C-23.  Many private sector businesses are taking the lead in 
correcting inequalities in the workplace through offering 
benefits to both spouses of same sex and opposite sex 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has already passed Bill C-78 which extended survivor 
pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service 
employees, as have Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British 
Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Yukon, Nunavut and 
the Northwest Territories.  The direction has clearly been 
blazed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to mention that Conservatives certainly can be 
compassionate, tolerant and open to modern thinking in this 
regard.  Canadians should not be fooled into thinking that this 
is an abandonment of the family or principles of the traditional 
view.  This is about fiscal and equitable treatment under the law 
with respect to how Canadians interact and what obligations and 
benefits would flow to them after having established a criteria 
and a relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my final submission, the term conjugal does not denote only 
sexual relations. 
Supreme court justices have made several commentaries and there 
are certainly instances of opposite sex couples who have remained 
together for many years and no longer embark on sexual relations. 
This is not the only criteria.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I grew up in a secure and loving family where both 
my father and mother were present. It was not a perfect marriage 
but I knew that they loved me and each other.  There was a 
commitment to stay together in spite of all the problems of 
married life.  That made my growing up years very happy and 
memorable and it instilled values and morals in me which I have 
brought to my own marriage and family of eight children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that not every family had that kind of good beginning but 
it seemed to be the norm in the Canadian society of the 1940s and 
1950s.  However, insidious pressures were being placed on family 
life. Post-war parents had seen thousands of shattered 
relationships.  Some of them had lost spouses in the war and had 
to start all over again.  Other relationships had been destroyed 
by adultery both overseas and at home, brought about by the 
separation of six terrible years of war.  In the lives of these 
people there was a growing bitterness about love and marriage 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the post-war years Canada enjoyed an economic boom.  With that 
came an ever increasing higher standard of living which placed 
the temptation of getting and spending before us.  Both 
government and Canadians in general went on a huge spending 
spree.  The government response to pay for all of it was to raise 
taxes bringing us to this day where we are almost the highest 
taxed nation in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in itself was yet another economic pressure on Canadian 
family life.  As inflation spiralled, many women who wanted to be 
stay at home mothers had to become breadwinners with their 
husbands simply to keep up.  Both men and women were working 
longer and spending less time with each other and their families. 
The commitment to develop strong relationships in family life 
was taking a back seat to other less worthy priorities. Some of my 
school chums' families started to disintegrate. Divorce become 
more frequent but still was not an epidemic.  However, the 
pressure on the family was building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the mid-1960s we were in the midst of a sexual revolution. 
Some segments of our society hailed it as liberty, a freeing up 
from traditional values like chastity and fidelity which had 
provided, in my view, structure and safety for the Canadian 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many women were tired of the abuse they felt they suffered at 
the hands of a male dominated society.  More of them were 
working, taking their places beside men and they wanted equality. 
Some of them wanted even more.  They wanted vengeance and 
retribution. The feminist movement started a strident campaign to 
bring women into the 20th century.  They burned their bras, 
demanded protection from unwanted pregnancy, spurned chastity and 
scorned the pro-life people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A gradual blurring of the sexes occurred that gave young men 
growing up in many female dominated, single parent homes an 
identity crisis.  This led to a rise in militant homosexuality, a 
coming out of the closet of gay men and women who also demanded 
equality.  The things that had been considered improper went 
looking for a desperate legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968 then justice minister Pierre Trudeau mouthed his 
infamous words “the government has no business in the bedrooms 
of the nation”.  He and his cohorts passed omnibus justice 
legislation which legitimized behaviour which until then for 
centuries had been considered outside the realm of normal and 
good family and personal relationships.  He legitimized 
homosexuality between consenting adults. He provided couples who 
were being split by disharmony and infidelity with an easier way 
out, no fault divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point in Canadian history, I believe our government 
started its assault on traditional family and marriage. In my 
view, no government can make legitimate any behaviour that has 
for centuries by tradition, custom, faith and the social contract 
been seen as destructive to family life.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the year 2000.  After 32 years of 
disintegrating family life, rising divorce rates, the murder of 
millions of babies by abortion, the decline of authority and 
discipline in families, school and judicial institutions, to the 
latest attack on the family, the attack on the very foundation of 
family life in this nation, the institution of marriage itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I suggest that the majority of Canadians, people of faith, 
whether they be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Sikh, have a 
common belief that the institution of marriage, one man and one 
woman, was part of the Creator's divine plan for the orderly 
conduct of life and the continuation of the human race.  Those of 
us who believe in this are wondering why our government continues 
its assault on the family which started in 1968.  Why is it so 
determined to allow in legislation the gradual diminishing of 
influence of the traditional family and marriage itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23, unfortunately in my view, is the logical progression 
of trends started long ago, where now in the form of same sex 
benefits, government continues the blurring of the traditional 
family and marriage.  It does that by suggesting strongly through 
this legislation that common law relationships of heterosexual or 
same sex couples are no different than that of marriage as the 
union of man and a woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sends a destructive message to all our children.  This says 
that the marriage of man and woman for life is not important.  It 
does not matter whether couples get married or not and it does 
not matter with whom one cohabits.  What a terrible message to 
send to our children.  How will the future of our country be 
influenced by this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In moving in this direction, I suggest that this government has 
given in once again to the tyranny of the minority.  Minority 
pressure groups in our society that demand legislative change to 
legitimize their position do not really question the morality of 
it.  They are afraid to ask the important question: Is it really 
the right thing to do?  They simply change the law in the name of 
equality.  Having equal rights does not make those rights correct 
or moral.  We cannot legislate equality any more than we can 
legislate morality.  Those are attitudes of the heart and soul 
that the government has clearly forgotten about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the party that told us that government has no business in 
the bedrooms of the nation, continues to invade them.  Ironic, is 
it not?  We have a bill that gives benefits and obligations on 
the basis of conjugal relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the youth of today saying?  When I listen to them, I 
hear them wanting to return to a better day, to a day when family 
life and marriage had more security and more commitment.  For 
instance, in a study done in 1971 young people between the ages 
of 18 to 34 were asked if they agreed that extramarital sex was 
okay and 34% of them said yes.  In 1995, 18 to 34 year olds were 
asked the same question and only 11% said yes.  Who are these 
1995 young people?  They are the children of the baby boomers 
whose lives were supposed to be made easier by free love, easy 
divorce and the legitimization of homosexuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones who suffered the results of the age of 
promiscuity, the lack of commitment, parents who were not there 
for them when they needed them and, quite frankly, they want a 
better life.  They want to be better parents and more committed 
to their spouses, with more order and structure in their family 
lives and for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does our government always have to be so many years behind 
the real feelings of the majority of people when it crafts and 
passes legislation?  This is exactly what is happening with Bill 
C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at our nation today and weep.  I weep for the hurting 
children who do not really know their parents.  I ache for the 
women who suffer post-abortion trauma and have deep regrets for 
their actions.  My heart breaks for young people who have grown 
up in homes where the lack of structure, discipline and love has 
led to rebellion and bitterness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reena Virk incident is a tragic result of the things that I 
have talked about today.  I see a government oblivious to the 
whole thing, determined to march to the orders of a tyrannical 
minority which will cause us all to reap the results of the 
whirlwind in the years to come.  I say shame on it for not having 
open eyes to see what is going on, open ears to hear the wishes 
of the majority of Canadians who are opposed to the bill and open 
minds to admit that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill passes without the amendments we have suggested, it 
will be a sad day for Canada and I, for one, would never want to 
be a part of that kind of country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, Bill C-23 has raised a lot of questions and a lot of 
issues.  People want to get their views on the record. Through 
the course of the debate we have found people with different 
backgrounds appearing to take a common position on a bill for 
entirely different reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, just a few moments ago an hon. colleague from the 
Conservative Party reaffirmed for everybody in the House who was 
listening that this bill was purely and exclusively about 
economic and fiscal inequalities that must be redressed.  As many 
others have done, he pointed to the fact that legislation in the 
House was really behind the current conditions of the day in the 
marketplace.  As an example, he pointed to the many decisions on 
the part of the private sector to equalize benefits 
notwithstanding sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may be true but the bill does aim to ensure that the 
economic discrepancies and inequalities that appear to exist in 
relationships of economic dependency are immediately redressed. I 
underscore that this has been an issue of economic dependency.  I 
think the state has a right to intervene in any partnership where 
economic dependency does have ramifications for the larger social 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was rightly pointed out by individuals in the House, 
tolerance, compassion and all those values that they ascribe to 
Canadian society and to each and every individual here, do come 
into play.  However, as another colleague has accurately pointed 
out, one does not legislate compassion, equality or justice.  One 
legislates equality of treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is, as this bill has indicated, a circumstance where 
economic dependency and a partnership is not recognized, then the 
state has the obligation to ensure that both the rights and the 
responsibilities of that partnership are upheld.  The 
presumption, of course, is that these partnerships all have the 
social value for a collective good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 recognizes that there is a discrimination of sorts.  I 
say of sorts because I am trying to be very careful and cautious 
in the language I use.  This is, after all, a charged 
environment. I am looking at the issue of all economic 
dependencies.  Cases where these economic dependencies do not 
call into question a sexual relationship are excluded from this 
bill.  For me that is an important and significant vacuum in 
this legislation.  We should include all those who are not 
properly dealt with by legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, once we see an injustice, once we 
perceive an inequality and once we engage our energies to ensure 
that we address that inequality, we have an obligation to not 
restrict that energy to just one component of that inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I am making myself clear, but if one recognizes 
the value of economic dependencies, then surely one should not 
restrict them on the basis of sexuality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my children think of me as a prude, or a dinosaur, as 
a member on the other side would have said.  I am not really. I 
am one of those children of the sixties.  I recognize that there 
are responsibilities that we arrogate to ourselves the moment we 
make decisions.  I truly believe that as individuals, if we make 
a decision we are responsible for it.  We cannot ask somebody 
else to be responsible for our decisions unless of course those 
decisions have a larger impact.  If people are willing to show me 
what the benefits are of some individual decisions, I am willing 
to accept them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues on both sides of the House have argued that the bill 
should be exclusively fiscal and economic in its approach, and 
that what the Government of Canada rightly is doing is catching 
up to society and giving to many relationships the legitimacy 
that convention has already accorded them and that private 
sectors have already ascribed by virtue of some decisions that 
have emanated from the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is one other element that people have raised. My 
colleague from the Conservative Party a few moments ago said that 
some people were still struggling with homosexuality.  No, I do 
not think anybody is.  There are overtones of religious bias. 
There is bias in everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite being one of those people from the free wheeling 
sixties, I too had an upbringing.  I am proud to say that my 
upbringing was religious, although I am not as practising as I 
used to be, but it was religious in the sense that it said every 
single man and woman, every single creature on this earth is 
worthy of the dignity that is accorded all humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people would say to me that I was being a little bit 
religious on this issue, I would say that they are darned right. 
I hope I am living up to the credo that I espoused when I was a 
younger man.  What dignity is at stake?  What compassion need I 
accord to someone that my background has not already obligated me 
to offer?  What discrimination is so glaring that it needs my 
immediate and total attention?  I would willingly give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have pointed out the economic and fiscal discrepancies 
where two unrelated people, it does not matter what gender they 
are, have agreed in their partnership that they would sustain 
each other. We as a state or as representatives of the state say 
that is a good and healthy relationship and we will give it what 
it is due.  However, let us do that for every single 
relationship.  Let us not restrict it by sexuality.  If we do, we 
then call into question precisely the issues that some of my 
colleagues have raised, and that is, by so restricting this 
decision and by indicating that we can only deal with this 
element of inequality do we then not call into question the 
larger issues, the issue of matrimony, the issue of heterosexual 
relationships, the issue, as my colleague from the Alliance Party 
indicated, of family?  From there we can extrapolate all the ills 
that we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we are in a position where we need to challenge 
ourselves about sustaining something that is rock solid.  Like 
many members in the House, I am also blessed with a little bit of 
skepticism.  I thought this was a bill, purely and exclusively, 
about redressing fiscal and economic inequalities and economic 
dependencies.  However, I then heard other members in the House, 
as is the end or objective of debate, and advocates outside the 
House complain that the Minister of Justice changed the bill by 
including an amendment wherein she defined marriage. Their 
response was that the bill was not about economic dependency. 
They said that the bill was about recognizing this particular 
sexual activity on the same par as another.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My tolerance and my willingness to address the issue were 
awakened. My constituents were also equally compassionate and 
equally committed to establishing a country and a society of 
which everyone could be proud.  They are now asking which it is. 
Is the bill one that recognizes this type of marriage on the same 
basis as the other by giving a definition or not giving a 
definition or by giving the same benefits that accrue to this 
one?  What are the social benefits of any type of union? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true that the state has no business in the bedroom of 
the nation, what then should be the criteria for economic 
dependency?  What should be the test of unions that are for the 
common weal and not for individual benefit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a number of concerns about the bill.  My 
colleagues have very ably raised a number of them over the course 
of their speeches.  I will focus on just a few ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern with the bill is that it threatens the very 
institution of marriage.  People can dismiss that and brush it 
off, but I think down the road we will rue the day that this 
legislation was brought forward.  It takes us further down a 
slippery slope that leads to the devaluing of the important 
institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Liberals passed Bill C-33, the bill that added 
sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act.  The stated 
goal of that bill was to protect homosexuals from discrimination 
in the workplace and in housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time a number of Liberals, and we will cite some of them 
today, assured the Canadian public that the amendment to the act 
would not lead to the extension of benefits to partners of 
homosexuals.  We were told then that it was only stopping 
discrimination, that it was only a workplace and housing issue. 
In the House on May 7, 1996, the Liberal member for 
Wentworth—Burlington defended Bill C-33 and the justice minister 
of the day with these words: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—many Canadians feared that Bill C-33 would lead to court 
interpretation such that gay couples could claim marriage and 
family benefits as a matter of right, that the legal privileges 
the state confers on conjugal couples of the opposite sex would 
be equally guaranteed by right to couples of the same sex.  The 
justice minister has explicitly said this is not the intention of 
Bill C-33.  He said it is workplace legislation and nothing more. 
He has assured us it has nothing to do with the definition of 
family, of same sex benefits or of same sex couples. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those words were from the Liberal member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  They ring pretty hollow today.  To add to 
that, on May 8, 1996, the justice minister of the day, the member 
for Etobicoke Centre who is now the health minister, confirmed 
this deception when he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Supreme Court of Canada decided the case of Egan and 
Nesbit.  It decided that notwithstanding that sexual orientation 
is a ground within section 15 of the charter on which 
discrimination is prohibited, the benefits do not automatically 
follow. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal justice minister at that time in his own words 
explicitly claimed that even if sexual orientation were added to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act the courts would not use that to 
extend benefits to gay partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can fast forward to today where we find that all those 
promises were empty.  They all ring very hollow, very deceptive 
in fact, as subsequent events have shown.  That slippery slope 
has operated quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a series of court decisions rendered in which 
various kinds of benefits previously restricted to heterosexual 
couples have now been extended to gay partners.  The most recent 
decisions have included the Rosenberg decision in June 1998 in 
which the Ontario Court of Appeal changed the Income Tax Act to 
extend pension benefits to gay partners.  In May 1999 the supreme 
court declared in its M. v H. ruling that gay partners were subject 
to the alimony provisions of the Ontario family law act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in these court cases is exactly what the Liberals 
said would not happen.  They are obviously not very good at 
prediction and beyond that they knew exactly where this would 
lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a pattern in which the initiatives of the Liberal party 
on same sex matters turn into merely a Trojan horse.  I make some 
exceptions for folk on that side of the House who understand and 
see the problems with the legislation. 
At first they say the legislation they are passing in 1996 will 
not lead to legal challenges designed to extend benefits to gay 
couples.  Then when the legal challenges come forward and are 
successful they turn around and say they had better change the 
laws to reflect the recent court decisions.  That is what they 
are doing with the introduction of Bill C-23.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member say just recently that the Liberal cabinet is 
trying to catch up with the recent court decisions.  The truth is 
that it is merely finishing what it set in motion.  It is all 
very disingenuous.  That is why we need to wake up and realize 
that the bill is a definite plan and it takes us further down 
that slippery slope.  It sets the stage for a direct attack on 
the heterosexual definition of marriage at a date coming very 
soon.  Stay tuned.  We will see it before long in our supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislation is passed it will lead in a very significant 
way, looking back historically, to a very major devaluation of 
marriage.  Some ask why this would be bad since we are in a 
modern era and maybe there are other ways to deal with it.  I 
would say that marriage, which the bill threatens, is a unique 
institution that has historically served us very well.  It 
deserves to be guarded, not only protected but affirmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage has brought great benefits to 
society.  It is in the vast majority of marriages that children 
are brought into the world, providing our country with its future 
citizens, workers, leaders, mothers and fathers.  Marriage, as we 
know and as is shown time and again in academic study after 
academic study, provides the most stable, enduring context.  Our 
Statistics Canada studies demonstrate this point.  Marriage 
provides the most enduring context for the development of 
individuals during the formative years of childhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proven that families in which the parents are 
married are statistically the most stable families.  In this way 
marital relationships contribute to the dignity, stability, peace 
and prosperity of the family and of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does marriage bring these benefits?  When a man and a woman 
enter into a marriage relationship it is almost always with the 
express purpose of making a lifelong commitment that will form 
the basis of family life and the environment in which children 
will be reared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriages do break down, regrettably, sadly and tragically, but 
the fact that marriage relationships are much more stable than 
common law relationships makes one point very clear.  Very few 
people enter into a marriage relationship flippantly.  Most have 
carefully thought about the commitment they are making and the 
sincere and solemn vows to which they are committing.  They 
realize they are participating in something much larger than 
themselves, something that most Canadians from various religious 
backgrounds believe is designed by God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply point out that people are serious when they get 
married.  This seriousness and depth of commitment to marriage 
are what benefit children who are born and raised in families. 
This is of great benefit to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way in which the institution of marriage benefits 
society we need to guard it, protect it and promote it.  The 
institution of marriage as the union of one man and one woman 
must be preserved, protected and promoted in both the private and 
the public realms.  It would be foolish to undermine the 
uniqueness of the marriage relationship.  Any society that does 
so risks losing the benefits that have come to that society from 
marriage and from the high regard in which it has always been 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are not thinking about the health of the larger 
society when they are willing to sacrifice the societal benefits 
which come from marriage in order to engage in some major 
societal experimentation.  We are in a laboratory, it appears, 
and some major social experimenting is going on that will create 
some real harm and damage down the road.  Such people regard 
marriage as little more than a form of self-expression.  It is 
much more than that.  It is the glue that holds society together 
and lays the groundwork for the society of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of marriage is not something to be toyed with. 
Were we to abandon the uniqueness of marriage, I am convinced we 
would pay a heavy price for that social experimentation.  We 
would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To tinker with the institution of marriage sends the wrong 
message to our young people.  Surveys have shown that young 
people are actually more optimistic about relationships and 
starting a family some day than many of their parents.  That 
optimism is good and needs to be encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were the institution of marriage to be changed, we would be 
sending the wrong message to common law couples who have children 
and who are contemplating making a lifelong commitment to each 
other in marriage.  Obviously many couples who are married today 
were formerly living together in common law relationships. 
At some point they decided to commit themselves to each other in 
a greater way, in marriage.  This is something to be welcomed and 
encouraged.  The children in such relationships benefit and 
society in turn benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore marriage in Canada as currently defined as the union 
of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others accords 
with the Reform Party, the Canadian Alliance policy that marriage 
is the union between a man and a woman as recognized by the 
state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though the bill before us can be criticized from various angles, 
I believe that one of the most serious criticisms is the way in 
which it takes us further down that slippery slope toward the 
devaluation of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of the way the Liberal cabinet and some 
candidates handle social policy matters.  Liberals appear to be 
anti-family with respect to the national day care program.  The 
Canadian Alliance offers dollars and choice for parents.  The 
Liberal cabinet has tax discrimination against one income 
families.  We offer a 17% solution of fairness and equity, a 
$10,000 per person exemption and $20,000 per family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal cabinet is unwilling to uphold laws against child 
pornography.  We would use the notwithstanding clause to protect 
kids.  The Liberals have unfair child access laws after divorce. 
We propose shared parenting family law to fix that.  I could go 
on from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we have a cabinet with a track record of undermining 
the family by way of legislative initiatives.  I do not believe 
that the majority will forget that attack on the family.  As 
members of the Canadian Alliance Party, as I wrap up, we will 
fight for families.  We expect that Canadians will join us in 
that significant battle as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian

arguments I have been hearing from time to time from our friends 
across the aisle.  Government members seem to be always 
presenting arguments that concentrate on their attempts to refute 
the arguments presented by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words what we have are negative arguments in opposition 
to the opposition.  What I am waiting to hear are arguments 
explaining the civil and social purposes of the bill.  What are 
its objectives?  How can it possibly benefit society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough for the government to argue that the bill 
will do no harm.  Although that premise in itself is questionable 
I do see some potential for harm there, but there must be, if 
this is to be reasonable legislation, a premise that it will 
somehow benefit the country.  What is the advantage of devaluing 
the unique position of marriage with respect to social benefits? 
What is the government trying to prove? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society has lived for hundreds of generations without this 
type of recognition for homosexual relationships.  These 
relationships have been essentially prescribed—

Speaker, today the stark, majestic, white spires waft by gentle 
breeze on tranquil Vimy Ridge belie the terror of old.  While the 
sky rained shells and brave men died, 100,000 Canadians moved 
forth in a hell of inhumanity, testing their mettle and mortality 
of soul.  They were advancing on unconquerable Vimy.  On this 
same ridge, tens of thousands had died before in vain British and 
French assaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal was now Canada's turn.  Canada's finest young men won 
the contest that day, a victory for all the world to see.  The 
greatest victory of World War I, Vimy Ridge, would enter Canadian 
history on April 12th, 1917. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many would say that Canada took birth that day, born into the 
world of nations with respect, born by the blood of our young and

on to this day.

interesting sense of accountability. The heritage department fast 
tracked nearly $5 million worth of grants to Option Canada even 
though the organization had existed only a few weeks.  It had no 
track in handling public funds. When heritage auditors found out 
that the money went missing the government responded by 
acknowledging that the money went missing and then closed the 
case.  End of story.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in fact the department, following questions that 
were raised two years ago on this issue, delivered over 100 pages 
of documents which were relevant to the actual audit and the 
follow-up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

Maybe it would have been good if taxpayers had got the cash back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grant was about boosting the no side of the referendum, as 
some people say, but that is not what Option Canada was about. 
The operations manager said, “Not a penny from the grant was 
spent on the no side's campaign during the referendum”. Of 
course that begs the question, what did the money go for?  Who 
knows what the grant was for?  Nobody knows where that money 
went.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

cleared up the crisis.  The money is still missing and the 
minister knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve an answer and to know where in the world the 
money is.  Option Canada officials are still refusing to open 
their books and the minister is refusing to demand an answer from 
them on accountability.  They refuse to answer how the money was 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is $5 million worth of taxpayers' money that has vanished 
without a trace.  Regardless of 100 pages of documents, the

where it went?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the health minister ignored Alberta's privatization plans. 
Then he told parliament that Bill 11 should be withdrawn. Next, 
prompted by the Prime Minister, he said that Bill 11 should be 
passed.  Now he has written to Alberta urging that Bill 11 be 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the health minister's acrobatics, and in view of 
his newfound concern for queue jumping, can the minister tell the 
House how many investigations are under way in Alberta and how 
many patients are affected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it was Ralph Klein himself who invited a comparison between Bill 
11 and legislation in other provinces governing private for 
profit facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comparison demonstrated that in Ontario and Saskatchewan for 
example, those statutes prohibited the sale of so-called enhanced 
services in private for profit facilities.  In response to the 
premier's invitation we wrote and pointed that out.  We quoted 
the sections and suggested that he amend his statute, among other 
things, to do what other provinces have done and forbid such 
practices. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
have thought he would not need Premier Klein to invite 
comparisons.  Those things could have been seen in the newspaper 
or on television for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians no longer trust the minister to protect the Canada 
Health Act.  They want answers and we want answers.  I will ask 
the minister again, how many investigations are under way in 
Alberta today and how many Albertan patients are affected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I can tell the hon. member that Canadians know whom to trust when 
it comes to health care in this country and it certainly is not 
the New Democratic Party.  The New Democratic Party happens to 
believe that pouring more money into the system is going to solve 
all the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that governments have to work together to 
introduce the kinds of changes and improvements that are needed 
to make medicare sustainable in the future.  With our partners in 
the provinces, that is exactly what we intend to do.

Mr. Speaker, Hugh Riopelle, a lobbyist and golfing pal of the

cabinet ministers on behalf of Pierre Bourque, Sr., a man who 
owes him money, to help broker a deal for the Louis St. Laurent 
building in Hull.  As of today, Mr. Riopelle has still not 
registered Bourque as a client under the Lobbyists Registration 
Act as required by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the ethics counsellor or the minister call in the RCMP to 
investigate this cosy deal, or should Canadians accept the fact 
that friends of the Prime Minister continue to receive special 
treatment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I explained on Friday, the ethics counsellor does 
look into the issue of whether somebody has been properly 
registered.  Where there is justification, he will then give the 
appropriate information to the authorities to investigate 
further. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a pattern developing here with regard to 
friends of the Prime Minister.  René Fugère acts as a lobbyist 
and does not register himself.  Mr. Riopelle acts as a lobbyist 
and does not register his clients.  Ordinary Canadians who are 
not friends of the Prime Minister are compelled to register under 
the Lobbyists Registration Act or face fines or possibly jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the double standard?  Why are friends of the Prime Minister 
somehow considered to be above the law? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is a ridiculous question.  The fact is that if 
there is an obligation to register, then of course he will have 
to do so.  It is as simple as that.  Apparently the member is in 
possession of information that he has not disclosed to me or 
perhaps he has disclosed it to the ethics counsellor which makes 
it an open and shut case for him.  If he has such information, he 
should disclose it.  In the meantime, justice will take its 
appropriate course.

Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the member has just said, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-23, an act to 
modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and 
obligations, as reported (with amendments) from the committee; 
and of the motions in Group No. 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, prior to question period I was making 
the point that the effects of Bill C-23 are not necessarily 
benign, although members opposite would lead us to believe that 
they are.  I would like to point out that for hundreds of 
generations and in almost every society I am aware of there have 
been social proscriptions against homosexual unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are more civilized.  We do not attempt, as Mr. Trudeau 
would say, to interfere in the bedrooms of the nation.  That is 
fair enough.  But we should remember that all through history, 
heterosexual unions have been recognized as having a social 
purpose.  They have never been considered to be purely 
recreational or even sentimental arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is the foundation on which civil society rests. Society 
extends certain benefits to strengthen and support the 
institution.  To extend those same benefits to homosexual couples 
for no good reason inferentially diminishes the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I frankly do not care how homosexuals choose to organize their 
lives, but to treat their unions as de facto marriages is 
downright silly.  That is not just my personal opinion.  In June 
1994 the present government House leader wrote in a letter to a 
constituent,  “I do not believe that homosexuals should be 
treated as families.  My wife and I do not claim we are 
homosexuals.  Why should homosexuals pretend that they form a 
family?” What happened?  In six years there seems to have been a 
slight change of opinion over there, at least on the part of the 
House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 when we were debating Bill C-33, we were repetitiously 
informed that the bill was not a Trojan horse, that it was purely 
a matter of protecting homosexuals in the workplace and in 
securing accommodation, that there was absolutely no future 
intent of bringing in same sex benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are four years later and where is that promise of the 
Liberals now?  I guess what we have is just another indication 
that a Liberal's word does not count for much, because this is 
what they told us.  They told it to us over and over and over 
again.  Now times have changed and four years have passed.  What 
is next?  How many more years will it be before this government 
or another one with the same stripes decides that it wants again 
to do some social engineering and starts to redefine the entire 
institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is incremental.  This is the Liberal way.  The Liberals 
have been doing it not only in the field of marriage and family, 
but in several other areas as well.  The camel's nose goes into 
the tent and little by little he edges his way in and knocks the 
tent down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has got to stop.  There is no sound basis, no social 
reason, no fiscal reason and no political reason for changing the 
status quo with respect to benefits.  Why the government has 
decided to take this leap I have no idea.  I am sure that Mr. 
Trudeau is appalled but he is no longer here.  I am appalled.  A 
lot of people are appalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of moralizing.  It is a question of common 
sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too many years ago, if anyone had suggested that homosexual 
couples living together under the same roof should be awarded the 
same social benefits as married people, they would have been 
laughed out of town.  It would have been considered hilarious. 
Yet here we are.  Is this progress?  I doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do wish that the government would reconsider and take another 
look at this hasty legislation.  A lot of amendments are coming 
up that, although they will not fix it, could certainly improve 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government in the interest of common sense, if 
nothing else, to give very serious consideration to some of the 
amendments my party has laid on the table.  It should look at the 
bill again, remember what country we live in, and think about the 
people in Canada who are by and large terribly offended by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received more correspondence, more phone calls and more 
e-mails about the bill than I have ever in my seven years in 
parliament received about any other legislation.  This tells me 
something and it should tell the government something. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to a fair bit of the debate on this 
issue, especially at report stage last week and again this week. 
I feel there are some things I need to say which in a sense 
respond to comments that have come largely from the other side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be necessary and this should not be relevant, 
but I feel I need to establish my credentials to speak on family 
matters.  The fact is that I have been married to the same man 
for 37 years.  I have borne and raised three children and spent a 
good part of that time as a full time, stay at home mother.  I 
now have grandchildren.  I now also have a somewhat older mother 
who needs a fair bit of family care.  We are all a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some people in the Chamber, I am no longer a family 
because my husband and I can no longer have children.  Therefore 
we should not be entitled to any benefits because we do not fit 
that old criterion of the family unit being there to raise 
children.   We have been there and done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families in Canada come in many different shapes and sizes these 
days.  Families can be people looking after elderly parents. They 
can be brothers and sisters living together.  They can be members 
of a family looking after other members of the family who are not 
able to care for themselves.  Families are not necessarily 
mothers and fathers.  One-third of marriages end in divorce, 
which is a pretty sad figure until we consider that the other 
two-thirds end in death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that people establishing committed, loving 
relationships of long term duration is to the benefit of society 
at large.   That is what the bill is about.  The bill is about 
recognizing that not every family is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very clear law on marriage which has been recognized 
in common law for a century and a half.  It is now also included 
in the preamble to this legislation, but also for nearly half a 
century we have recognized other kinds of relationships outside 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recognized common law relationships for a long time now 
for the purposes of establishing the obligations and the benefits 
of those relationships.  We have not considered them the same as 
marriage in the legal sense, but we have nonetheless recognized 
that these are generally committed, long term relationships that 
have many of the same qualities as a legal marriage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has bothered me in this debate is the way we have been 
speaking about fellow human beings.  It has bothered me a great 
deal that we have talked about hundreds of thousands of our 
fellow Canadians as if they are somehow inferior human beings.  I 
can put it no other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homosexuality is a fact of life for many Canadians.  It is not a 
choice of lifestyle.  It is a fact of life.  It seems to me that 
the comments I have heard on this topic have forgotten completely 
the people we are talking about are somebody's sons, daughters, 
fathers, mothers, cousins or next door neighbours.  For most of 
our history these people have had to live in secret, hiding who 
they are and feeling a sense of shame about who they are because 
of the societal attitudes I have heard expressed in the Chamber. 
It is hardly an attitude of inclusiveness toward our fellow 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this attitude which leads young people who realize in 
their teens that they are not heterosexual to have a whole layer 
of difficulty added on to growing and developing into adults, not 
because of who they are and what they are but because of the 
attitudes of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us can expect to be whole human beings if we are hit 
every day, as our society does, with the kinds of messages I have 
been hearing in the House, the message that what we are is 
shameful, to be hidden and despised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again.  These people are somebody's sons, 
daughters, fathers and mothers.  In my view if what we are doing 
with the legislation, as we did with common law marriage nearly a 
half century ago, is encouraging and recognizing long term 
committed relationships I believe that is to the benefit of all 
society.  I do not see how anyone could argue that this takes 
away from the institution of marriage.  I do not see how anyone 
could argue that this weakens the moral fibre of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I have been somewhat mystified by the total 
preoccupation with sex on the other side of the House.  The bill 
says nothing about sex.  It talks about committed, long term 
relationships.  I am married.   Whether or not I am married in 
law has absolutely nothing to do with whether my husband and I 
have sex, nor whether two people having sex has anything to do 
with their being recognized as a legitimate, long term 
relationship for the purposes of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard talk about the importance of having both parents as if 
somehow recognizing same sex relationships for the purposes of 
benefits and obligations would ensure that every child has two 
parents.  As I said earlier, one-third of all marriages ends in 
divorce.  The fact is that we as a society have to deal with 
that.  We have to deal with the fact that communities and society 
are responsible for children as much as the two parents who 
happen to have borne them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I only want to say that to the extent people live with 
dignity, they live full and complete lives and our whole society 
benefits.  What we have done until now is to relegate same sex 
relationships to the back alleys of society and in many cases the 
back alleys of our cities.  That is not healthy for the people 
involved and it is not healthy for Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the bill offends the sense or morality of some 
people but it does not deal with sin.  It does not deal with our 
sense of morality.  It deals with legal benefits and legal 
obligations.  I am quite entitled to feel how I want about what 
activities I think people might be engaged in, in their homes. 
They are quite entitled to feel however they want about mine. The 
legislation has nothing to do with that.  It makes no moral 
judgments.  It simply says how people are to be treated in 
society and what obligations they have to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I belong to a religious tradition that has in its background 
something called the Inquisition where for a long time people 
thought they could coerce others into sharing their beliefs.  It 
was a period of some shame and for which the Pope of the Roman 
Catholic Church has recently apologized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not sit here in the Chamber and make decisions as if 
everybody in Canadian society has to share my beliefs and conform 
to my particular moral standards.  I do not think any of us has 
the right to do that.  It harms society when we do that and it 
ultimately harms ourselves when we judge some people in our 
community and society to be less worthy and inferior. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to engage in the debate on Bill C-23 on 
behalf of the constituents of St. Albert who I feel are largely 
opposed to the content of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the previous speaker say that it is not for 
any one of us to judge how anybody else in the country should 
live.  I agree with that statement, but we are finding that the 
Liberal government will now impose upon Canadians or confer upon 
a certain category of Canadians benefits that they never had 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of this conferring of benefits is very much in 
contradiction to the opinions of a large segment of society and a 
very large segment of the society in my constituency.  From my 
perspective I certainly endorse the government's position that 
there should be no discrimination.  We should not discriminate 
and deny people where they want to live, where their employment 
is, the types of careers they want to follow and that type of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a step beyond when we recognize these types of 
unions and put them on the same level as marriage, saying that it 
does not matter what kind of relationship it is if it is a 
relationship that is ongoing.  It is very unfortunate that the 
government has put in there the word conjugal.  If the government 
is prepared to recognize any kind of a relationship then the 
morality of the nation has been debased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the dawn of history and even before, society has 
organized its way in solid, committed unions between men and 
women. 
That is the way in which every society in the world has organized 
itself.  There must be something in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used the word committed.  Unfortunately, marriages break down 
far too often, in this country and all around the world. 
However, a society of human beings should recognize that 
marriage, the union for the purpose of the procreation of 
children and for the raising of the next generation is a 
fundamental part of any society; not just our society, but any 
society.  That union which provides the home to raise children, 
the next generation, deserves the support and the sanction of any 
government, including this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children need our assistance.  We hear often about abused, 
neglected and malnourished children, children who have problems. 
Therefore, we need to nurture that environment.  That has been 
the focus of marriage and government support for marriage down 
through the ages.  I do not believe that obligation has changed 
in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 20 or 30 years we have gone from recognizing that 
our intolerance toward other relationships should not be 
continued to the point where we not only insist that we shall not 
discriminate against, we now confer benefits upon other unions as 
if they were the same as marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I take great exception to is the way the 
government is doing this.  It has introduced Bill C-23, which is 
an omnibus bill that will amend quite a number of statutes.  Each 
statute will be amended to indicate that where there is a 
conjugal relationship the benefits shall be conferred, but it 
says absolutely nothing about marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice introduced an amendment to the bill 
which, in essence, is a preamble to the bill that recognizes 
marriage as the union of men and women to the exclusion of all 
others.  However, it is only in the preamble of the bill.  She 
has not asked that every statute be changed.  Therefore, when 
there are legal actions pertaining to the statutes that are being 
changed and the courts look at these statutes they will see 
entrenched in law conjugal relationships exceeding one year but 
nothing about marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has asked that marriage be inserted into 
every statute that is being changed to recognize conjugal 
relationships.  The Minister of Justice said no.  The Liberal 
government said no.  Does this mean that conjugal relationships 
of any kind are now superior to marriage?  The government is 
prepared to entrench conjugal relationships in law but refuses to 
put marriage in law.  We have to ask that question.  Is marriage 
now second class to any kind of conjugal relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask that question too in the context of, for example, 
the Income Tax Act.  For the last 30 or 40 years it has included 
in it what is now called the marriage penalty.  Two people who 
live together have greater tax advantages than a husband and wife 
who live together where one parent stays at home to be with the 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court tells us that it is eliminating 
discrimination.  When asked to adjudicate on acts of parliament 
and legislation, it has struck down acts when they contravene the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
In doing so, we now have marriage penalties in law.  We now have 
acts of parliament that recognize conjugal relationships of any 
kind, but which refuse to recognize marriage.  Therefore, I have 
to ask the questions:  Where is our society going?  What comes 
next?

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the States is the forerunner of many things, unfortunately 
it is also the forerunner of things which we do not always think 
too highly of.  The whole challenge to the charter of rights and 
freedoms and to the legislation that has been in existence in 
this country is based on the fact that some people say they are 
discriminated against and denied benefits based on their sexual 
orientation.  The courts have agreed.  Here we are today 
recognizing these liaisons in legislation while we refuse to 
recognize marriage in the same legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being trite or facetious, this article from the U.S. 
magazine went on to refer to liaisons including more than two 
people and how these individuals are now starting to ask about 
their rights.  They want to know if they are entitled to benefits 
as well.  The courts would then be asked to deliberate as to 
whether there was discrimination against liaisons including more 
than two people.  Perhaps the answer would be yes.  Where would 
it stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we not had the marriage penalty for the last 30 or 40 years, 
if we had raised our children in a nurturing environment of 
respect, the way that society has evolved over the last 5,000 to 
10,000 years, perhaps we would not be debating this problem in 
the House today which says that we have to recognize conjugal 
relationships at the expense of marriage.  Marriage is now second 
class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from many people in my constituency of St. Albert 
who are opposed to this legislation.  I would like to record my 
opposition to this legislation and I would hope that the 
government would listen to the people and reject this 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this debate is in some respects a strange debate.  One has the 
impression of two different communities, two solitudes, and 
perhaps a good deal of the confusion stems from the fact that 
people have not read the bill.  I would not discourage them from 
reading the bill.  It is not a piece of poetry.  It is a rather 
prosaic bill.  It is a legislative response, as is the obligation 
of parliament under our system of government.  With our modified, 
quasi separation of powers, we have a response by parliament to a 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in M. v H.  It is a 
response to that decision, no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the bill looking for excitement, it will not be 
found.  It puts together 68 existing federal statutes that are 
affected by the court decision.  It corrects—and that is a legal 
word—those pieces of law by appropriate amendments in response 
to the supreme court decision, no more and no less.  It is a 
compendium of 68 laws.  It is not a bill on marriage.  Anybody 
who read the bill would find that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title gives it away immediately, the modernization of 
benefits and obligations act.  It is not a bill on marriage.  It 
is not an amendment to section 15 of the charter of rights on 
which the original decision in M. v H. in the Supreme Court of 
Canada was based.  Obviously, to amend section 15 we would have 
to have the concurrence of the federal parliament and all 10 
provincial legislatures. 
It is essentially a carpentering job.  Someone very carefully put 
together what is a very dull bill with limited objectives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my earlier address to the House on this bill I explained that 
it is limited to its special mandate, a legislative response as 
is our constitutional obligation as parliament to the judicial 
ruling, that it does not alter the legal definition of marriage 
in any way, one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense I regard the government amendment—in a legal 
sense—as being unnecessary.  It is inserted, though, as lawyers 
often do, in the phrase ex abundante cautela—for greater 
certainty.  But it does not change the definition of marriage. 
It does not add to the fact.  The bill itself does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any steps in the redefinition of marriage, if one were to 
attempt that, would require a comprehensive piece of legislation 
which would spell out concrete rights and obligations, conditions 
of a status and how one enters into it.  It would be another law 
on another occasion.  It would be something reached after a 
prior, necessary community consensus had been built, with some 
degree of interparty discussion.  That is for the future if 
someone wishes to proceed that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting in terms of this debate, and the 
constructive and useful thing which has emerged from it, is the 
opportunity to ask parliament to take note of the changes in 
society, the general recognition that relationships can exist on 
bases where both parties recognize them but which have no 
necessary connection with a sexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We speak of bona fide dependency relationships.  This is an idea 
whose time, historically, has come.  I am encouraged in that by 
the large amount of correspondence, messages, communications and 
personal meetings I have had in response to remarks which I and 
others have made on this particular situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are dependency relationships?  They are relationships of 
children and parents.  We find many situations in our society 
where children support an aged parent, or siblings, brothers and 
sisters, or two sisters and two brothers support each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find many situations of persons not in a familial 
relationship who share a life together without any sexual 
relationship.  If it is a demonstrated, bona fide relationship, 
should the law not be prepared to recognize that in our society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does require a bit of work, and the minister promised to 
study this.  I said “With all deliberate speed”, in the phrase 
of the United States supreme court, “can we not get some 
reasonably quick action?”  I understand that will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be tradeoffs involved which have to be understood and 
represented in a legal form, that is to say, a bona fide 
relationship with legal consequences cannot be unilaterally 
terminated except for cause.  There would be a limitation on the 
power unilaterally to renege, amend or terminate; proof of 
registration or something else to establish the beginning of a 
relationship and the irrevocability of its termination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not exactly tabula rasa.  My colleague, the excellent 
member for Parkdale—High Park, who has given a good deal of 
thought to these problems, reminded me of the law school cases 
which I learned in my second month in law school, Murray and 
Alderson.  In the 19th century, courts were being asked to 
recognize such relationships and give financial consequences to 
them, where dependency was proven and where in fact both parties 
recognized them adequately.  This could be put in the legal form 
of a statute.  It exists in a more rudimentary form through the 
common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak of non-revocability, it would seem to me that 
parties could not terminate unilaterally, although there may be 
special circumstances.  For example, a child supporting an aged 
parent might choose to get married.  It does not terminate the 
obligation to the parent.  One may look to some sort of 
comparative adjustment of the obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite this simply to say that there are problems, but they are 
not difficult problems.  There are no essential legal barriers 
that wise legislation could not take care of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be claims of the survivors' in dependency 
relationships to estates, to immovables, but once again these are 
issues that can be addressed.  The legal remedies for them, the 
legal formula to take care of them, can be established without an 
undue amount of work required.  There are sufficient precedents 
in the common law to provide just that sort of base for 
legislative action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constructive thing that has come out of this debate has been 
a heightened community awareness that the time perhaps has come 
to give legal recognition and apply legal consequences to 
dependency relationships voluntarily entered into and established 
on a bona fide basis.  That is the interesting challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a modest bill, a prosaic bill that simply changes 68 
federal laws in response to a supreme court decision.  It is our 
constitutional obligation, as a co-ordinate organ of government, 
to respond in that fashion.  It does not venture into the 
definition of a new code of marriage.  That, if it is to be 
attempted, would be a subject for another time, another debate 
and another law if and when the sufficient consensus is built in 
support of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it would be best to begin my speech today by taking 
stock of exactly where we are in Canada.  I represent a riding in 
Saskatchewan that is currently enduring an agriculture crisis of 
a magnitude similar to what was experienced during the Great 
Depression.  Saskatchewan has generations of farmers who own 
farms that have been in their families for generations and they 
face the prospect of losing their farms.  The income crisis 
facing Saskatchewan farmers is that bleak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the Canadian Alliance has laid out proposals, lists 
and solutions before the government of where it could immediately 
act to address the problems in our grain transportation system 
and our grain marketing system and the problems we face on the 
international market because of unfair trade practices of foreign 
nations and so on.  This week we will be releasing a summary of 
65 town hall meetings we held all winter long in farm communities 
across the prairies bringing forward solutions, most of them 
proposed by the farmers themselves, but the Liberal government 
refuses to look at that or address it in any way, shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country is currently experiencing one of the greatest 
scandals in the history of our nation, which is the 
misappropriation and mismanagement of funds through the human 
resources development department.  It is incompetent and 
deceitful and Canadians deserve better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is in tatters.  Waiting lists are growing 
every day and, in many cases, people are forced to leave our 
country and seek health care elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the highest taxed country of all industrialized nations 
in the world.  Under this Liberal government taxes have been 
increased 69 times at last count over the last seven years 
placing families under a tremendous burden.  It is such an 
unreasonable level of taxation that most of our well educated 
professionals are leaving the country.  They are being forced out 
of their own homes to go elsewhere to earn a living because of 
the great disparity in taxes, the great differential between 
filing a tax return in Houston or in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice system completely defies logic.  We cater to 
criminals and the victims have no rights.  It is a disturbing 
situation that needs all kinds of repairs, from the prison system 
to the Young Offenders Act to this conditional sentencing that is 
going on, all of this judicial activism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday the Prime Minister appointed a member from 
Saskatchewan to the Senate.  As far as I am concerned, this was a 
slap in the face to the residents of Saskatchewan because I know 
most Saskatchewan residents would like to elect our senators so 
we can have meaningful representation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Senate reform?  What about parliamentary reform? 
Everyone knows how this place runs.  There are no free votes. 
The government never resorts to the use of referendums.  It is a 
dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing here today?  Despite all the problems facing 
our nation, the government has brought forward a bill to extend 
benefits depending on whether or not one is having gay sex.  Is 
that the depth to which the government has to sink?  What about 
all the urgent matters facing our nation?  No, it is preoccupied 
with extending benefits to people who have homosexual sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to June 1999.  The Canadian Alliance at that time 
put forward a motion that read “marriage is and should remain 
the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others 
and parliament will take all necessary steps within the 
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve this 
definition of marriage in Canada”.  That motion passed but it 
was not a bill and had no statutory effect.  What we see now, 
despite the expressed will of parliament last June, is a bill 
that will not preserve the definition of marriage but will 
destroy it.  I submit that Bill C-23 is an insult to every member 
of parliament who voted last June to preserve the definition of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows full well that the vast majority of 
Canadians are upset about this bill.  They do not agree to 
extending the benefits that accrue to married couples to 
homosexual couples.  I know from my own experience in my 
constituency and from talking to my colleagues that there has 
been a large public outcry.  My constituency office has been 
deluged with phone calls, faxes, letters and e-mails demanding 
that the government abort this ill-thought out legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this public outcry, the minister put forward an 
amendment at the beginning of the bill that defines marriage but 
that has no legal effect.  It is meaningless.  Any judge looking 
at any of the acts modified by Bill C-23—and I believe there are 
68 of them—will not see that interpretative clause defining 
marriage.  Legal experts have clearly stated that in order to 
have the effect of retaining the current definition of marriage, 
the definition of spouse and marriage should be placed in each of 
the affected statutes modified by Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the Canadian Alliance has done.  We have 
put forth amendments, which will be voted on tonight, that define 
spouse as either a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage 
and that define marriage as the lawful union of one man and one 
woman to the exclusion of all others.  That is what the legal 
experts say will be required to retain the current definition of 
marriage and that is what Canadian Alliance members are 
proposing, but that is not how the Liberal government will vote. 
I believe the reason for that is that their ultimate goal is to 
destroy the institution of marriage or at least make gay couples 
the equivalent of what currently are married couples, in other 
words, gay marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20 of this year delegates to a Liberal convention voted 
on a resolution to legalize same sex marriages.  Although that 
resolution was defeated, it had a very close margin of 468 to 
365. The New Democratic Party already has the policy that it 
wants same sex marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to urging all members of the House to support the 
Canadian Alliance amendments, which would replace the definition 
in each of the affected statutes, I recently submitted a private 
member's bill, Bill C-460, which was an act to amend the Marriage 
Act and to include and place the specific definition of marriage 
in that act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because of the undemocratic nature of this 
institution, that bill will probably never see the light of day. 
If it ever does, I would certainly hope that all members of the 
House would see their way clear to support it.  I know that will 
not happen because, as I said, the NDP officially has a policy 
contrary to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech I mentioned the urgent matters 
facing this nation, one of which is taxation.  I will briefly 
outline for the benefit of the House solution 17, which is the 
Canadian Alliance's proposal for tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form government, we will implement a single rate of 
taxation of 17%, combined with a spousal and personal deduction 
of $10,000 plus a $3,000 deduction per child.  The net effect of 
that is that two million low income Canadians who currently pay 
some tax will pay no tax at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up by saying that in addition to supporting fair 
family taxation, the Canadian Alliance would also address issues 
that the Liberals have been unwilling to tackle, such as child 
pornography, criminal justice reform, child custody and access 
issues and many other issues that affect families because we are 
a pro-family party as opposed to the anti-family policies of the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be known that MPs who vote against the Canadian Alliance 
amendments in tonight's vote will be voting against the 
definition of marriage in federal law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 209. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to present to the House the 
10 top reasons Bill C-23 should be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tenth reason is that the government has ignored the Egan 
decision of the Supreme Court which ruled that the government is 
not constitutionally required to extend publicly funded old age 
security benefits to same sex couples.  The Egan decision dealt 
with the question of federal spousal benefits which are linked to 
the public purse.  Clauses 192 to 209 of Bill C-23 amend the Old 
Age Security Act so it seems the Liberals are directly 
contradicting the court's decision in Egan.  The Liberals are 
using muddy logic again and they are subjectively adhering to 
court decisions; some they choose and some they do not choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ninth reason is that according to recent reports the Prime 
Minister has decreed that Liberal members will not be able to 
represent constituents with their voices on Bill C-23.  He has 
insisted that this vote will be a whip vote and require that each 
member of the Liberal caucus votes for the bill.  It has long 
been the position of the Canadian Alliance that the first 
responsibility of members of parliament is to represent the will 
of their constituents.  Without this basic principle at work, 
democracy is an illusion and Canadians are in fact electing a 
four to five year dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this edict from the Prime Minister, 14 Liberals had 
the courage to vote against the bill at second reading.  Some 
others who had less courage hid behind the curtains and chose not 
to vote.  If a whip vote on the bill will not work for the Prime 
Minister, he should see the writing on the wall and withdraw Bill 
C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth reason to rethink the bill and withdraw it is the 
fact that the Naskapi nation of Quebec points out that Bill C-23 
overrides its treaty rights.  The Cree Naskapi, whose treaty 
agreement is referred to in the bill, came before the committee 
to share its concerns about the imposition of common law, same 
sex partners in its cultural definition of family and what it 
would do to treaty rights and obligations. 
Members of the Cree Naskapi made a strong case that the approach 
the government should take was to come and talk with them and 
negotiate first.  Let them inform the people and then perhaps 
have a referendum on the issue.  I think the Cree Naskapi are 
right and I think a whole bunch of other Canadians would 
appreciate the same respect from the federal government on the 
issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh reason to withdraw the bill is the public's reaction 
to it.  In spite of very little media attention and that the 
Liberal government is trying to sneak it through under the cover 
of other issues, the public outpouring of concern against the 
bill from coast to coast has been nothing short of miraculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament from all parties admit to getting large 
volumes of faxes, e-mails, phone calls and letters concerning 
Bill C-23.  Most say they have received more on this issue than 
any other issue this session.  Without exception the very great 
majority of citizens are calling for Bill C-23 to be withdrawn. 
The justice minister knows this.  We cannot even get through on 
her fax line.  The petitions against Bill C-23 are coming in like 
rain every day in the House.  We hear them one after another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth reason to withdraw the bill is that there must be 
something wrong with it if when after only four hours into debate 
at second reading the Liberal government moved closure to stop 
debate in the House.  At report stage and third reading it has 
moved closure again after one day of debate.  This is an omnibus 
bill.  It affects almost every statute, 68 in all.  It will 
impact on 20 different departments.  The bill extends all public 
benefits to people who were not eligible before.  It has sweeping 
implications for our social structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Liberals not allow debate?  Why do we have closure 
again, for the 67th time by the Liberal government?  Is it afraid 
more people will find out what it is up to with the bill and hold 
them accountable for it come the next election?  If that is not 
what it is, why is it being rushed through?  If that is why it is 
pushing Bill C-23 through it is another good reason to withdraw 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth reason to withdraw the bill is the treatment it got in 
committee after second reading.  The sweeping omnibus bill which 
affects 68 statutes in total got a short three and a half days to 
hear from witnesses in committee.  Many individuals and groups 
with important perspectives were not allowed to present to the 
justice committee examining the bill.  No provincial voices were 
heard.  No travel was allowed in order to get broader public 
input.  Witness lists were shortened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion to televise the proceedings and to get broader public 
input were voted down by the Liberal dominated committee.  The 
majority of witnesses that appeared before the committee were 
heavily weighted in favour of Bill C-23.  In short, the committee 
process was abused to give the false impression of fair public 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Chair is getting excited as we get close to number 
one, but the fourth reason Bill C-23 should be withdrawn is that 
the Income Tax Act which contains a definition of family has been 
totally changed.  It has been changed from the commonly 
understood definition to a new definition that will include any 
two people of the same sex who share accommodation for a year and 
have what they think is a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the section of the Income Tax Act which defines 
family was primarily intended for application of tax policies 
toward Hutterite colonies, but we can be sure that the Hutterites 
were not consulted to see if they felt there was any need to 
accommodate same sex relationships as a family.  Very likely they 
would strongly object to that inclusion.  Bill C-23 is an 
unwarranted redefinition of family and that is another reason it 
should be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason to withdraw the bill is that prior to the bill 
there was a definition in law which stated what it took to be 
considered related to another person.  This definition stated 
that family relations were those related by blood, marriage or 
adoption.  This definition is also generally consistent with the 
Canadian Alliance policy.  Bill C-23 strikes down that definition 
of family and redefines it to include any two people of the same 
sex who live together for a year in a conjugal relationship or a 
sexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent to redefine long held understandings of what it takes 
to be related to someone in order to give public benefits to two 
men or two women who have a sexual relationship is at the very 
least unnecessary.  This is the third reason.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason to withdraw Bill C-23 is that even though it 
proposes to extend all the benefits and obligations that were 
previously reserved for marriage, it is impossible from the bill 
to be sure who those others are that qualify.  To qualify for 
public marriage benefits the bill proposed that two men who live 
together for a year in a conjugal relationship would be included, 
but nowhere in the bill is the term conjugal relationship 
defined.  Yet it is the primary qualifying criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dictionary says that a conjugal relationship is one that has 
sexual activity as in marriage, but when asked if sexual activity 
is a requirement for these benefits the government says no, maybe 
and probably.  Sometimes it says yes.  It tells us that the 
courts know what is a conjugal relationship.  This is the second 
reason to withdraw Bill C-23, because it refuses to define who 
qualifies and drives people into the courtroom instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is that although the justice minister tells us 
repeatedly the bill has nothing to do with marriage, it in fact 
gives every benefit and obligation in federal public policy to 
same sex relationships that were previously reserved for 
marriage, with the exception that if one is married one must go 
through a divorce to formally discontinue the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms marriage and spouse are taken out of several of the 
statutes affected by Bill C-23.  Bill C-23 sets the perfect legal 
stage for a court ruling to force same sex marriage on Canadians, 
and they know it.  They voiced their concerns and forced the 
justice minister to put forward an amendment to define marriage, 
but she did it in such a way that expert legal opinion said the 
amendment would have no legal effect.  Only the Canadian Alliance 
amendments clearly set down the definitions of marriage and 
spouse in every statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals vote against defining marriage in an effective 
way in legislation, that would be the number one reason why Bill 
C-23 should be withdrawn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise again in the House for a second 
time to speak in support of Bill C-23.  I had the honour and 
privilege of being one of the first MPs to rise in the House to 
strongly support the legislation after the Minister of Justice 
introduced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to some of the amendments, some of the letters 
and the inaccurate facts that have been passed out even today as 
I am sitting here listening to my colleagues from the Canadian 
Alliance speak, I want to address a couple of things that the 
last two speakers have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saskatoon—Humboldt talked about the public being 
opposed to the legislation.  The member for Calgary Centre talked 
about the lack of witnesses in hearings into this matter.  While 
I was sitting here listening I found that quite incredulous.  Do 
they not speak to members of the Canadian Alliance Party in 
Ontario?  Have they not spoken to Mr. Long, who I understand will 
be seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance Party?  Are 
Canadian Alliance Party members who live in Ontario not 
considered to be members by the Canadian Alliance Party or by the 
public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happened on October 25, 1999, in the Ontario 
legislature.  The Ontario government is headed by Mr. Harris.  I 
believe Mr. Long, who hopes to be the leader of this great new 
party, was well known to Mr. Harris.  On October 25, 1999, 
Queen's Park introduced bill 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that bill do?  It amended 67 provincial statutes to 
provide benefits to same gender relationships.  Unlike the 
hearings we have had, unlike the debate that is going on today 
and has been going on, do hon. members know that bill 5 passed in 
five days without debate and without a recorded vote?  It is 
amazing, is it not, that bill was endorsed by all three parties 
in Ontario?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is in the province of Ontario.  I can confidently say 
that when I speak today and vote in favour of the bill I will be 
doing so because I represent my constituents and the will of the 
majority of the constituents in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk about marriage and the definition 
of marriage.  Quite frankly I am personally of the opinion that 
it was not necessary to put the definition of marriage in this 
legislation because this legislation has nothing to do with 
marriage.  Notwithstanding that, I will support the amendment 
proposed by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of the talk about losing the sanctity of marriage and 
that the government is forcing this through and it is happening 
very quickly, I should remind members opposite that in its haste 
the Ontario government failed to take into account widespread 
public concern around the issue of marriage.  Yet the federal 
government and the justice minister have felt it important to 
include the definition of marriage in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the bill is about.  The purpose of the bill 
is straightforward.  As I said on February 15, the bill amends 
legislation in order to recognize the principle of equal 
treatment for all common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre talked about how this bill was 
going to extend the same benefits that married couples are 
receiving.  That is not true at all.  Right now benefits are 
being extended to common law spouses and those benefits will be 
extended to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill looks at both obligations and rights.  The important 
thing to remember is that the legislation is about fairness, 
tolerance and non-discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the deputy whip spoke about the fact that in a 
changing society the family unit is changing.  She talked about 
her children.  I have been married for 22 years and I also have 
three children.  We have discussed this legislation with my 
children.  My children do not understand what the big ado is all 
about.  If there is one legacy I can leave to my children when I 
leave Parliament Hill it is the legacy of fairness, 
non-discrimination and being taught that it is not fair to 
discriminate any longer.  Intolerance is not acceptable in Canada 
or in our Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have also talked about the whole concept of widening the 
legislation to include brothers and sisters and dependency.  One 
of the things I have not heard talked about here at all is the 
equitable principle in law known as quantum meruit.  This 
equitable principle often arises in estate situations when a 
deceased person has failed to provide adequate compensation in 
his or her will or may have died intestate or may have left a 
legacy in a will but has not sufficiently compensated a person 
who provided either services or work for the deceased person 
during his or her lifetime.  This happens often in relationships 
between brothers and sisters or parents and their children.  It 
is very important when we talk about the concept of widening the 
whole area of dependency that we do not ignore the equitable 
principle known as quantum meruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the definition of the principle of quantum meruit 
as defined in Black's Law Dictionary. According to Black's 
quantum meruit is an equitable doctrine based on the concept that 
no one who benefits by the labour and materials of another should 
be unjustly enriched thereby.  Under those circumstances the law 
implies the promise to pay a reasonable amount for the labour and 
materials furnished even absent a specific contract therefor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four essential elements of recovery under quantum 
meruit.  First is that valuable services were rendered or 
materials furnished.  Second is that it was done for the person 
sought to be charged.  Third is which services and materials were 
accepted by that person sought to be charged were used and 
enjoyed by them. Fourth is that under such circumstances a 
reasonably notified person sought to be charged, that plaintiff 
in performing such services was expected to be paid by that 
person sought to be charged. 
The principle of quantum meruit applies whether there is an 
expressed contract or an implied contract.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my years as a practising lawyer about one-third of my 
practice was spent in estate law and often this principle came 
up.  For example, a nephew looked after his aunt and drove her 
from place to place.  The aunt had promised him a piece of land. 
She died intestate.  There was nothing left.  While the statute 
on frauds came into play and we could not obtain specific 
performance for the land, the nephew was compensated for the 
services that he performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about dependency, let us look at the equitable 
doctrine of quantum meruit.  When we do so is it something that 
we as the federal government would impose in our legislation or 
is it a matter of property and civil rights which therefore 
becomes a provincial matter? Again it is a constitutional 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say let us include dependency, that it is not fair when a 
person lives with and looks after his or her sister and does not 
receive anything on the sister's death.  However, a remedy at law 
already exists to compensate a person for the services that have 
been rendered provided that one could reasonably expect to be 
paid for those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the last couple of minutes to rule out some 
of the common myths which have come forward by a concentrated, 
well driven lobby group of a number of people because the letters 
we have been receiving in my office are all the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of secrecy, the House has held debates and the 
committee has held hearings.  By the time the legislation passes, 
it will have had at least five months before the House and the 
ability to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that the member for Calgary Centre was incorrect 
when he said that Bill C-23 will grant common law partnerships 
all the rights and benefits that married unions now have.  Bill 
C-23 will extend to same sex partners the same benefits and 
obligations that common law opposite sex partners have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, our proposed bill affirms parliament's primary 
responsibility for social policy.  It provides a responsible, 
balanced and legally sound framework within which to address 
recent court decisions and to ensure that same sex couples 
receive fair and equal treatment under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote today on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of 
my family, my husband and my three children, in favour of this 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
our colleague for her excellent speech, which indicates 
considerable open-mindedness.  I greatly appreciated her 
reference to the conversation with her children.  This is the 
kind of thing that needs to be discussed very openly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into the amendments proposed by the Canadian 
Alliance in detail, I would like to point out that it is the 
41st birthday of our colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  I am 
sure I can speak for us all in wishing him a happy birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are being offered today, in discussing Bill C-23 and the 
amendments proposed by the Canadian Alliance is, of course, the 
opportunity to discuss a fundamental value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later today, at 6.30 p.m., members will be standing up 
to vote.  I know that in a parliament, and this is true for all 
those who believe in democracy, it is normal to accept a 
diversity of views.  People are not obliged in any way to think 
the same way on everything.  That is something I have long 
accepted, in fact ever since my first day in caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect for the diversity of points of view to be 
expressed, however, I would like to argue that the bill we have 
before us is, first and foremost, one that concerns democracy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT57"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT57"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it concern democracy?  Democracy has been the subject 
of discussions for 300 years.  I believe that there is one 
inherent value, something that is rather intimately related to 
it.  It is the conviction that all individuals are equal in the 
eyes of the law.  This is what we are taught in law and in 
political science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are involved on the local level with various community 
councils, on the boards of various institutions, we constantly 
hear that if there is one supreme authority, the state or the 
supreme court, it is because everyone must be treated equally, 
everyone must enjoy equality of treatment.  This is so true that 
it is even part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
in section 15, as well as of the Quebec charter of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that we are being asked today to do as legislators? 
First, we are being asked to acknowledge that there are 
common law relationships. 
In our society there are people who, for the past 20 or 25 
years, have felt the need to enter into relations of solidarity, 
relationships—I will come back to this—that are conjugal but 
not marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a significant fact in Quebec, because the province in 
Canada with the highest rate of cohabitation is Quebec.  The 
courts pointed out that common law relationships in which 
individuals deliberately and wittingly choose to enjoy mutual 
benefit without marrying must be treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I have a hard time following my colleagues in the 
Canadian Alliance, because the bill before us does not concern 
marriage, but rather the antithesis of marriage.  It concerns 
those who have chosen to live in a common law relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I would not like there to be a debate on marriage 
anywhere but in parliament.  I do not think that it is up to the 
courts to tell us what form we want marriage to take.  I totally 
agree with those who say that debate on these matters is the 
prerogative of members of parliament.  The day we debate it, I 
will be the first to rise and say there is no reason to limit the 
institution of marriage as such to heterosexuals, that it is 
discriminatory to exclude people of the homosexual persuasion 
from the institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the time for that has not yet come. 
The bill before us concerns the equal treatment of all people 
and the recognition of common law couples, whether homosexual or 
heterosexual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most interesting that lawmakers—and here I will end my 
digression on marriage—did not feel the need to define marriage. 
The courts therefore gave a common law definition and the 
Minister of Justice, through the parliamentary secretary, 
presented the committee with a conventional definition of 
marriage, i.e. of a man and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is necessary to further expound on the merits of 
the strategy. For the purposes of the 
debate, let us be clear that all those who will be voting this 
evening at report stage and tomorrow at third reading need to 
know that the conventional definition of marriage is not being 
challenged and is not under threat. 
This is a given that we must keep in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hasten to add that contrary to what some have suggested, 
adoption is very obviously not what this bill is all about. 
Constitutionally, adoption is excluded from this debate because 
it is a provincial jurisdiction and comes under the civil code 
of the Province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side know what an important day May 20, 1997 
was. 
May 20 is a lucky day in the history of the sovereignist 
movement because it marks the day a few years ago when a 
referendum was held, with the results we know.  These results 
will keep getting better, as each of us also knows.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 20, 1999 the supreme court handed down an extremely 
important and almost unanimous decision.  Those at all familiar 
with the supreme court are only too aware that an 8:1 ruling is 
a serious ruling, one which made law and which was the 
culmination of a trend in rulings toward equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court was faced with the following case. 
Two lesbians who had lived together for a number of years, and 
had built up a business together, separated.  This is the case 
known as M v H. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the two applied for support under section 22 of the 
Ontario family law act.  Initially, this case was heard by 
Ontario's divisional court and then its appeal court.  The 
supreme court allowed the appeal and authorized the parties to 
appear before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have an obligation to pass this bill.  Even if 
the debate has to be among parliamentarians, nevertheless when 
the supreme court brings down a decision it makes law and 
obliges the legislator to bring its legislation into line 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, the supreme court has said that homosexual 
couples are to be treated on an equal footing with other 
couples.  It has also said that homosexual couples must be 
recognized in the eyes of the legislator as forming common law 
couples with the same recognition, the same obligations and the 
same privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some MPs find this a concern, and ask if we should not go 
further in recognizing what the concept of a couple implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that, given the jurisprudence 
referred to in M v H, this is a conjugal relationship.  Among 
the characteristics of a conjugal relationship are: living under 
the same roof, a personal and sexual relationship, exchange of 
services, social activities, financial support and being seen 
by society as a couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to state that there is no reason whatsoever 
why, as legislators, we cannot acknowledge that persons of 
homosexual orientation who are in a conjugal relationship cannot 
be considered a couple.  This is what the bill is inviting us to 
do, and I hope that there will be many of us here in this House 
open to individual equality who will support Bill C-23 at the 
report and third reading stages.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in debate on this bill at 
report stage.  I regret the use of time allocation, closure and 
all of the usual heavy-handed, undemocratic tactics employed by 
the government, as this has been my first opportunity to attempt 
to articulate the overwhelming consensus of my constituents on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be accurate to say that I have received more 
unsolicited constituent feedback on this issue than on any other 
issue in my time in this place.  I find it very disturbing that 
the government has become so inured to using the hammer of the 
closure motion that members like myself have effectively been 
unable to substantially address this bill and our constituents' 
concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treatment of this bill by the government, the House leader 
and the cabinet reflects, more than perhaps anything else I have 
experienced in this place, the growing arrogance and abuse of 
parliamentary power by the government, which I honestly find 
disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say on behalf of my constituents that hundreds 
of working people have written to me, faxed me and e-mailed me, 
as their representative, opposing Bill C-23.  Notwithstanding 
what members opposite say, these people are not bigots.  They are 
not advocates of discrimination and intolerance.  They are normal 
working Canadians.  I know that members opposite have heard from 
like-minded constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Parkdale—High Park regards as intolerant 
the members of her constituency who oppose the effective 
diminishment of the legal recognition of marriage.  I do not.  I 
think that her constituents and mine, who have serious heartfelt 
and conscientious objections to this legislation, are tolerant 
Canadians.  They ought to be heard.  If there is anyone 
intolerant, it is those who stand in this place to castigate 
Canadians who sincerely believe that there ought to be in law a 
preferential option given to marriage as the cradle of the family 
and the family as the cradle of human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to register my serious dismay with the kind of 
inflammatory rhetoric employed by some members of the government 
and other opposition parties in characterizing as intolerant 
those Canadians who, in good conscience, object to this 
incredibly significant piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do Canadians raise those objections?  They actually believe 
that the institution of marriage is central to any civilized and 
healthy society.  I find it utterly remarkable that in the year 
2000 members have to stand in parliament to articulate the 
reasons for which marriage ought to be given a preferential 
option in law.  It truly is remarkable.  It is a very basic 
natural fact that children are born and raised in the context of 
heterosexual relationships.  Is that an intolerant statement? 
No, it is a statement of natural fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that non-heterosexual couples would like to have that 
capacity, but nature has not so graced them.  Every civilization 
throughout history has recognized that the procreative capacity, 
what the philosophers would call a radical capacity to procreate, 
is something that is of great importance and ought to be 
protected and promoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go back to the beginning of political philosophy and read 
Plato's musings about taking children from families, putting them 
in government run day care camps and trying to create the perfect 
human being.  The effort to remove children from the cradle of 
the family has been the nightmarish vision of utopians throughout 
history.  Civilized societies, societies which understand there 
is a basic ontological nature of the human person which dictates 
that children of human beings are best raised in a stable 
two-parent heterosexual family, know that special privileges, 
special legal protections and special legal obligations must be 
accorded to those who enter the very solemn legal and contractual 
obligation of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-23 seeks to do is to take that very solemn legal 
privilege and obligation and turn it on its head, essentially 
saying that any two people who have the desire to live together 
in a conjugal relationship will, for all intents and purposes, be 
given precisely the same advantages, rights and privileges as 
married heterosexual couples without the attendant 
responsibilities.  In fact, the Minister of Justice even admitted 
at committee that the only place where marriage is really an 
operative term in federal legislation, which would not apply to 
the same sex beneficiaries contemplated in Bill C-23, is in the 
Divorce Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing is taking these unique legal privileges, this 
preferential option for the family, and giving that to anyone, 
regardless of their capacity or lack thereof to procreate 
children and raise the next generation.  In so doing, we are 
diminishing the distinctive legal, cultural and social value of 
the marital relationship, but we continue, and quite 
appropriately, to impose legal obligations on married couples 
through the Divorce Act, obligations which do not adhere to the 
same sex couples who will receive these marital benefits under 
the bill.  It seems to me that this is a radical piece of 
legislation which undermines an institution central to any 
civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, under the enormous pressure of public 
opinion, even from her own caucus, decided that something had to 
be done to cloak this bill in the appearance of being somehow 
defensive of the institution of marriage, because, after all, due 
to the diligent work of my colleague from Calgary Centre, the 
House passed a motion on June 8 of last year declaring that the 
government should take “all necessary steps” to preserve the 
definition of marriage as “the union of one man and one woman to 
the exclusion of all others”.  That shocking, intolerant, 
discriminatory motion passed by a vote of 216 to 55, with the 
entire federal cabinet voting in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice was required by political pressure, by 
all those millions of intolerant, bigoted Canadians that we keep 
hearing about from some members of the government, to do 
something to protect the institution of marriage.  Therefore, she 
had her officials in the Department of Justice, which we all know 
is a haven of defence of the natural family, insert in the 
preamble to the bill some meaningless, rhetorical reference to 
the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee it has been absolutely evident that the preambular 
definition of marriage included in this enormous, sweeping 
omnibus bill has effectively no meaning in law.  It will not be 
used as a reference by the courts.  It will not apply as a 
definition in the various statutes amended by this bill.  It is a 
meaningless, token gesture that the Minister of Justice is giving 
to some of her backbenchers, who can then go back to their 
constituents and disingenuously claim that they stood in the 
House and voted for the traditional definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put those members who intend to use that Trojan horse on 
notice that we will not allow them to mislead their constituents 
should they intend to do so at the next election.  We will remind 
their constituents who stood in the House, took the 
responsibility and defended with their vote the basic institution 
of civil society, marriage, that little platoon of society to 
which Edmund Burke referred, upon which our culture depends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore my colleagues opposite, do not let this be a whipped 
vote.  Do not let it be a partisan vote.  Let it be a vote of 
representation of our constituents, a vote that speaks for the 
value of marriage and family in our society.  Do not be cowed by 
the voices of intolerance.  Vote for the amendments to define 
marriage as the union between a man and a woman. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, normally I 
am happy to enter a debate, but I think this is a difficult one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things with which I have had difficulty as a member 
of parliament is the issue of morality and the fact that from 
time to time we are called on as representatives to attempt to 
prejudge, understand and reconcile the different moralities that 
exist within the general polity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this not only to those in my own riding, but also to some 
in other ridings which possibly have an even higher threshold of 
concern about this legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT61"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT61"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke previously talked about the hundreds of 
letters he is receiving.  I too have received some and petitions 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of my own concern about this issue and having to in a 
sense prejudge morality, I can well remember the last parliament 
when we had a debate over the human rights amendments and it was 
a somewhat similar debate.  I commissioned an official poll in my 
riding.  Even though I received hundreds of letters opposed to 
the human rights amendments, I discovered that the vast majority 
of my riding was in favour of them. I fear we are doing the same 
thing here. As a matter of fact, I have had less response on this 
legislation than I did on the original human rights amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in my place today to support the legislation.  Why do we 
support the legislation?  Behind some of the arguments today is 
the issue between collective and individual rights. We have 
defined our country as a nation in the world which respects 
individual rights.  One of the things we can be proud of as a 
nation as we go forth in the 21st century is that we support, 
respect and try to enrich individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue comes down to a question of discrimination. Do we in 
fact believe that certain groups in our society are being 
discriminated against simply because of some of the relationships 
they choose to enter into? My background is as an accountant so I 
focus on the Income Tax Act.  It tells me that with these 
amendments a same sex couple in a dependency relationship will be 
able to claim the other one as a full dependant.  I ask myself, 
if that was not the case, are they discriminated against?  The 
answer is yes, they are discriminated against and are treated 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those in the opposition and others who oppose the 
legislation would tell me they believe that is appropriate. In 
other words, there is some kind of appropriateness to some forms 
of discrimination.  Once we start making exceptions to the rules 
of a body of rights in a country, we are going down a very 
slippery slope in which there are only rights for certain people 
and rights for others.  That gets me back to my original 
discussion of collective and individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really bothering some people behind this legislation is 
the ability to impose their morality on society generally.  In 
other words, things seem to be changing.  This is the way things 
were.  One of the members spoke about her family.  I have been 
married well over 30 years and have a grown family myself similar 
to what she was saying.  I discussed this matter with them and 
they thought this whole issue was a bit of nonsense and that we 
were a bunch of old fogeys in the way we visualize society 
because society has fundamentally changed in front of us. I know 
my mother would be giving me heck for my opinion on this 
legislation but I think people's attitudes and views change over 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people in my riding who believe very strongly about 
this legislation and think it is bad legislation, I can only 
simply say that I have tried to reconcile their views with what I 
believe to be the majority of the people in my riding. I have 
come to the conclusion that we still believe in a fundamental 
principle and that is that the majority rules. In spite of what 
some of the members in the opposition would have us believe, I 
believe that the majority of Canadians in fact support this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the definition of marriage, this legislation 
does not really deal with the institution of marriage.  It is the 
provincial jurisdictions that deal with the institution of 
marriage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we have provided a definition within the 
preamble.  I believe that many in the community who would oppose 
this legislation are happy that at least there has been some 
recognition of what we believe to be a marriage as being the 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the issue of discrimination, one of the things 
that bothered me about the legislation, because we are extending 
benefits and rights to a larger group of people than possibly now 
enjoy them, is that the question invariably comes up as to the 
form of discrimination.  Are there other people in our society 
who are being discriminated against? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the dependency relationship under the Income Tax 
Act.  Many people similarly brought up the issue of a daughter 
who is supporting her sick mother and should she also not have 
the right to claim her as a dependant. Fundamentally I think we 
all agree that is true.  We agree that we should be extending 
this definition.  It once again goes back to the theme of my 
speech.  We must not provide for any discrimination in our 
system.  In fact we must find ways to do away with as much 
discrimination as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk as much as we want about this utopian society, but 
the reality is we are curtailed somewhat by affordability. That 
does not mean the government is not concerned about that issue. I 
am very heartened to discover that the Minister of Justice and 
others have commissioned a study to look into the ability to 
expand this definition to include other people who may well be 
discriminated against.  That is appropriate, but obviously to go 
down that road today to include a broader definition of 
discrimination would be very costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I explain that to those in my constituency who are 
concerned about that, I explain to them that under our current 
laws a broader definition of discrimination would be 
prohibitively costly.  The impact on private pension plans and 
others would be that some benefits now being received by some 
people in my constituency would actually go down to provide for 
this enhanced vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that in a future parliament, parliamentarians will be 
discussing expanding the definition to allow other forms of 
deductibility of obligations and rights.  There is no question 
that as we go down the road our society is aging.  I am very 
concerned about families who are trying to support themselves and 
possibly invalid members of the family and need some help from 
our taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is appropriate to continue to be silent on 
those issues.  We will continue to debate them.  As we prosper in 
the future, the definition of dependency relationships will 
increase to include those people but as of today we are going 
with this one measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken us a long time to have a charter of rights and 
freedoms.  As a government it has taken us a number of years to 
even invoke it, which is where we are being led to today.  The 
courts are saying that we have not been living up to the terms of 
the charter and it is time that we did. That is fair and 
justified.  To say otherwise means that what we really want to do 
is to amend the charter of rights and freedoms and take away 
individual rights and liberties, a famous hallmark of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am very supportive of this legislation. I 
certainly respect the views of others who are opposed to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask the special indulgence of the House. I was in 
my office working with the television on the parliamentary 
channel in the background.  When debate on the Group No. 1 
motions collapsed, I just did not make it all the way from the 
Confederation building to here in time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about tolerating and forgiving each other's 
little minor foibles today, I wonder whether I could ask for 
unanimous consent that Motions Nos. 14 and 91 which are on the 
notice paper in my name also be deemed moved and seconded and 
thus included in Group No. 2, pursuant to the Speaker's ruling. 
I ask for unanimous consent for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
hon. member be permitted to move these motions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I regret that because I think 
my amendments would have certainly added value to what we are 
talking about in today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we have this conflict in the discussion 
of whether or not the term of marriage is being discussed here. 
First the Minister of Justice adamantly denied it. She said this 
bill had nothing to do with marriage, and subsequent to that she 
put forward an amendment that in fact did talk about marriage. 
Furthermore almost every one of the changes that is being 
proposed by Bill C-23 in the 68 different statutes has to do with 
a marriage relationship, a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one amendment I really wish could be on the Order Paper 
to actually have members vote on because I think it would be 
consistent with previous decisions made in the House. We should 
not be using the back door with this bill to redefine marriage 
and family in all of these different statutes. I urge members to 
think seriously about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to chastise my fellow parliamentarians for denying 
me consent. I will gladly concede that in a foot race I would lose 
to almost everyone here.  That is part of my excuse for not 
getting here in 2.8 milliseconds all the way from the 
Confederation Building when the debate collapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply say that we ought not to be doing things that cannot 
take the heat of debate.  We should not be doing things that 
cannot bear the support of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke previously said that in a poll he had 
conducted the majority of the people were in favour of this bill. 
Of course we do not have questions and comments at this point 
but I would like to ask him exactly what question he asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a mathematician and being involved somewhat in statistical 
work I know this much about polling, that the way one words the 
question can almost certainly determine the outcome. If one were 
to say should we discriminate against people who like each other, 
probably 99% of Canadians would say no they do not think we 
should discriminate against people who like each other.  But the 
question should we support and promote a redefinition of marriage 
and of family, and look at the ramifications of that is not being 
asked.  That is not being done here in terms of the feedback we 
are getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people stop and actually see what is happening in this bill 
universally they have serious questions about it and so should 
we. I urge all members to think very carefully. The words that we 
keep hearing are, let us not discriminate against anyone, let us 
treat everyone equally and fairly.  One can hardly argue with 
those concepts.  However we should ask the question, if we pass 
this bill and make all of those changes in the 68 different acts, 
who then are we discriminating against?  It is a very important 
question.  The inclusion of the term “conjugal relationship” 
throws open huge questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that in passing the bill we will actually be broadening 
the group of people against which we are discriminating.  This is 
a very intolerant bill in the sense that it grants benefits only 
to those who, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are in a 
conjugal relationship. 
That means that everyone who is not in that group is being 
discriminated against.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will it be determined?  It has already been mentioned 
several times in the House today by several of my colleagues that 
two of the ministers on the front bench are in disagreement over 
this.   One of the ministers says “Yes, this involves a sexual 
relationship”.  The other one says “No, it does not”.  If it 
does not, what exactly is the definition of a couple who will 
qualify for these benefits?  How do we determine who will be 
eligible?  The definition simply is not there and there is 
confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I venture to guess that if we were to ask 300 members of the 
House, excluding the Speaker, we would probably get, as we would 
with 300 economists, 300 different answers.  Parliament is in 
error if we pass a law asking future courts and judges to rule 
without giving them a clear definition of what we are talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One couple may say “Yes, we are in a conjugal relationship.  We 
have sex in one form or another two times a week”.  They would 
qualify.  Another couple might say “We never have sex.  We do 
not engage in sexual activity”.  Would they qualify if they had 
lived together for five, eight or twenty years but had never 
engaged in sexual activity?  Does that really, in the dictionary 
definition, indicate that is a conjugal relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I think we discriminate against those who would be 
truthful.  When it comes to receiving grants, benefits and 
things, there are invariably some people who are willing to be a 
little less than honest about it.  The purpose of our laws and 
courts is to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and, in 
essence, people are forced to be honest.  If we have several 
different couples in different relationships and some of them say 
“No, we are really not in a conjugal relationship but we could 
get some benefits if we said we were” and if they do not have a 
morality that prevents them from being untruthful, they would 
simply declare “Yes, we are in a conjugal relationship” and 
they would be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has done absolutely no study to my satisfaction that 
has shown any indication of the cost of this, because it is 
totally unknown.  Starting out with a definition of a conjugal 
relationship being eligible for benefits where that definition is 
missing means we might have two people in Canada or we might have 
two million who will come forward to claim these benefits and 
rights that they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another huge conundrum here.  We are putting homosexual 
people into the same classification as heterosexual common law 
couples.  We know there are certain laws that cover common law 
relationships.  If I am not mistaken, if a man and woman have 
been living together in a common law relationship for three years 
they are deemed to be basically equivalent to married and if they 
split up there is a division of assets and things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if we have one of these couples in this so-called 
conjugal relationship where after three, four or five years they 
break up and then one of them says “I would like to have half of 
the assets” and they go to court to try to solve this?  The one 
who has the assets may say “No, we were never in a conjugal 
relationship”, while the one who wants the assets may say “Yes, 
we were”. 
How will the courts ever unravel that one?  It is a conundrum. 
Why we, as parliamentarians, would have such an ill-advised piece 
of legislation, in which we ask the courts to rule on things that 
basically have no definition, is a mystery to me?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say clearly and unequivocally 
at the beginning of my remarks that I fully support Bill C-23. I 
say that not only as a citizen and as a parliamentarian, but also 
as a father of five children, a grandfather of four and as a man 
who has been married a long time.  I was first married in 1960. 
I think I know a bit about marriage and I might even know 
something about the institution of marriage.  I can say 
unequivocally that I do not feel threatened by Bill C-23.  I do 
not think for a moment that the institution of marriage is 
threatened by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listened to the anti-diluvium reformers across the way, I 
find it difficult to understand what I suppose they would 
construe as their reasoning.  Somehow they believe that if we 
give homosexual couples in a common law relationship the same 
benefits and the same obligations as society has already given to 
opposite sex couples in common law relationships, that somehow 
threatens the institution of marriage.  Madam Speaker, if you 
could square that circle for me, I would appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I enjoy a privilege or a right and if that is extended to 
someone else living in a committed common law relationship, 
regardless of whether they are opposite sex or same sex, how that 
threatens me, my marriage or the institution of marriage is 
beyond me.  I guess it might be called reform party reasoning, 
flawed as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say one more thing about illiterate reform theology. 
Homosexuality does not spread like the flu.  It is not a 
communicable disease.  It does not spread around like that.  The 
reformers should not worry, if Bill C-23 passes, which it will, 
that all kinds of red blooded, heterosexual Canadians will be 
changing their sexual practices tomorrow or dropping their 
heterosexual orientation.  They will continue being heterosexuals 
as I am sure homosexuals will continue being homosexuals.  I want 
to assure the illiterates across the way that it does not spread 
like the flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention a few other things because I think they are 
relevant to the debate.  It is very relevant to cite a poll that 
was conducted by Angus Reid in October 1998 because it provides a 
very good indication of the thinking of Canadians with regard to 
some of the issues under discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to that survey, 84% of Canadians agreed that gay and 
lesbian individuals should be protected from discrimination. That 
very same poll showed that 67% agreed that same sex couples 
should have the same legal rights and obligations—reformers 
never mention the word obligation—as a man and a woman living 
together as a common law couple.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all surprised by these polling results.  They are 
merely further evidence that fairness and equity are strongly 
held beliefs among Canadians and that these beliefs can exist 
alongside our deeply rooted respect for the institution of 
matrimony as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of 
all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe to my core that there is no contradiction at all 
between wanting to be fair to same sex couples and supporting 
marriage.  Moreover, if we ask ourselves why Canadians exhibit 
this sense of fairness with respect to equal treatment for same 
sex couples, the answer is obvious, at least it is to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that most Canadians, indeed most members of the House, 
know people in unmarried relationships of the opposite sex and of 
the same sex.  They are among our friends and relatives and often 
the partnerships are long term and committed ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal level, in our own lives and experiences, when we 
think about our friends and family members who are in same sex 
relationships we want to see that these people are treated with 
fairness and dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we can actually put faces on the abstract notion of same 
sex partners, we can begin to see the daily realities involved 
and to realize the human side of this issue.  This is the reason 
why the majority of Canadians support equal treatment under the 
law for same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have announced their intention to review their 
laws.  It is why the federal government and most provinces and 
territories have now extended benefits to their own employees who 
are in same sex relationships.   Beyond the public service, the 
three provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia have 
taken measures to extend benefits and obligations to same sex 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 200 private sector employers have already extended 
work-related benefits, such as dental care and pension rights, to 
the same sex partners of their employees, as have many 
municipalities, hospitals and community and social service 
institutions right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware that some will disagree with the arguments that 
I have made.  They will say that it is the courts who have 
decided on equality for same sex couples.  Let me say that the 
courts have merely been responding to laws, including the charter 
of rights and freedoms, that have been written and passed by us, 
by Canadians' democratically elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is yet one more of these initiatives by a 
democratically elected government.  It would bring federal 
legislation into conformity with the charter.  Its wording and 
definitions have have been examined to ensure charter 
consistency.  Bill C-23 will ensure that our laws do not unfairly 
discriminate between common law opposite sex and same sex 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I have to remind parliamentarians that there was 
a time in Canada when women were not considered persons before 
the law.  In fact, there was a time when Canadian women were not 
allowed to vote and there was a big fight then.  The social 
Conservatives of that period were against extending the franchise 
to women.  I suspect it is the same group of people with the same 
mentality who are opposed to fairness and equality for gays and 
lesbians today.  There was also a time when aboriginal people 
could not vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the positive benefits of the bill before us is that it 
removes from our federal laws the few remaining distinctions 
among children based on references to illegitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue this fight to bring greater equality and 
fairness to more and more Canadians.  This kind of fight has been 
going on for decades and in fact centuries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is about equality in benefits and obligations.  First 
let us examine the benefits provided in the legislation.  This 
aspect has been the focus for some members opposite who have 
described benefits for same sex couples in hysterical and even 
vulgar terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What benefits are included in the bill?  The fact is that most 
of the statutes in the bill dealing with benefits relate to 
pensions.  We believe that hard working Canadians should be able 
to provide for and indeed be encouraged to provide for their 
common law partners, whether opposite sex or same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been debated for a good long time.  Yes, we have 
had time allocation, but there is a point where we have to bring 
the debate to an end.  It has been debated in other legislatures. 
It has been debated in homes.  I think people have made up their 
minds.  An overwhelming majority of Canadians are in favour of 
Bill C-23 and I urge its adoption.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, things are looking up a bit in this place.  I could see 
it coming.  In 1993 the Liberals had about a quarter of the 
section over here in addition to that whole side.  In 1997 that 
was reduced significantly.  There are a lot less Liberals.  As 
long as their mentality and their way of thinking continue down 
that path, I cannot wait until the next election because they 
will be toast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian people are tired of the social engineering that is 
taking place in the House of Commons, the constant social 
engineering that has been in place since 1993 when the good old 
Liberals came back into power, something that has been the 
history of their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always leads to their downfall.  It only takes time.  People 
finally wise up and realize the social engineering that has 
continued through their years of governance will never end until 
we get the right people in government who truly believe in 
democracy, who truly believe in the democratic voice of the 
common people throughout the land: the taxpayer, the guy and the 
gal who pack their lunches, work hard every day and pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these days the country will wake up and be quite pleased 
because the people of the land will be the ones who will make a 
decision about what kind of society they want to live in instead 
of the governing body of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not respect free votes or expect members of 
their caucus to represent their ridings because that is what they 
must do.  They do not allow that.  Is that democracy?  The whip 
cracks and that is the way it will be.  However one day society 
as a whole will have a voice in making a decision as to what kind 
of society we want to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for me, I choose the collective voice of the people over what 
that should be.  I do not choose the voice of the government 
because it does not believe in the consultation process.  Even 
though the Liberals talk it, they do not believe in it.  They do 
not believe in the petition process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My desk is full of responses to petitions.  We let them collect 
and then we take them back to our offices, but the responses are 
simple.  The petition is laid out on the table.  The government 
takes it and it responds.  Through all the gobbledegook that is 
in the long description of what took place in petition it is 
simply saying one sentence.  It should reduce the response to one 
page, save taxpayers some money and save paper.  The sentence 
should be simply:  “Sorry, folks.  We are the government. We 
know best”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 2.5 million signatures tabled in the House of Commons 
by Priscilla de Villiers the first year I got here.  It did not 
even sink in that 2.5 million people were asking for some very 
serious changes to the justice system. 
From the time of those tablings to today millions of more 
signatures have been tabled asking that something be done with 
young offenders, with the parole system and with the prison 
system to help protect society more.

look to the future.  Why should they be afraid of being in a 
school yard?  They want to walk down the streets in city of 
Toronto or in the city of Calgary without fear.  They kept 
tabling petitions, and what do they get from the Minister of 
Justice after all that time?  Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will not make a lot of petitioners happy.  What a wonderful 
listening government: millions and millions of signatures mean 
nothing, but a little court decision regarding a situation will 
make the law.  The government will listen more and more as the 
supreme court and other courts come out with rulings so it can 
make some more wise decisions based on the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind society.  It wants to base it on the courts. The 
people of Canada are tired of the courts deciding what kind of 
society they want to live in.  They are certainly tired of this 
place deciding what kind of society they should live in.  They 
truly want a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should up the good work because after the next 
election they will be toast.  They are not listening to the 
people of the land.  They will have a voice.  There will be a day 
that they take control of this place, take it back from the 
arrogance and the obnoxious methods being used to run their lives 
in a social engineering fashion.  I can hardly wait for that day. 
I sure hope I live long enough to see it.  I promise that day 
will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals continually shut down debate in this place. Closure

looking at this whole affair very optimistically because it will

we will get some people in here who know what in the world they 
have to do to rule a good country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people over there like a lot of humour.  They laugh at a 
lot of things.  That is good.  It is that kind of obnoxious 
attitude that will help make them history.  It will not be a very

being anything wonderful.  In my riding—

and they will be toast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come when the government needs to decide whether it 
will truly allow the people of the land to help make some 
decisions with regard to what kind of society we have.  It is 
time to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Liberals believe for one moment that the people of the 
land are happy the decision in British Columbia regarding child 
pornography is still sitting before the supreme court all this 
time?  They were saying not to worry, not to worry.  That is not 
the kind of government people want.  It was probably the most 
obnoxious decision in the face of society that has happened in 
this land for ages, that child pornography should be allowed to 
that extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they want from people in this place including me is a 
little action to starting representing what the people of Canada 
want for a society.  When will the Liberals start doing it? 
Liberal governments will never do it.  I ask folks out there to 
get ride of them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I do not know how I get so lucky to follow the hon. 
member for Wild Rose.  It just must be my day.  Actually the 
member puts forward very valid points and some interesting 
questions, must of which have to do with Bill C-23, human rights, 
equal rights, the way we see differences in society and the way 
we see differences among people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was intrigued and entertained by the comments just made about 
what kind of society we want.  That member and his party have 
stood in this place for the three years I have been here and 
continually gone on about what kind of society they want.  They 
want a society where the views of Charlton Heston are more 
important than the views of the average citizen.  They say that. 
They want a society that does not have any laws to deal with gun 
control and that believes in the American constitution which says 
one has a right to bear arms and a right to defend oneself with 
those arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not Canadian society by any stretch of the imagination, 
but it is certainly their society and their vision.  They believe 
in a society that would discriminate against individuals because 
of their sexual preference.   Let us deal with that just for a 
second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Hector wants to do that speech in his 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I did not heckle the member.  It was 
not me.  It was somebody else.  He should settle down.  The hon. 
member said he would like to live long enough to see change.  I 
do not know if he is going to see change, but I would like him to 
live too.  He should take it easy, lower the temperature, take a 
Valium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Bill C-23.  I do not care if the courts make 
the decision or if parliament is making it, but fundamentally the 
issue is whether we are prepared as Canadians to have a society 
in which we will say to people who are gay that they cannot have 
access to the dental plans of their partners in their places of 
employment, that they cannot share in some form of survivor 
benefits having lived in a relationship with someone for a number 
of years, or that because they are gay they are not entitled to 
those basic rights in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some concerns about the word conjugal in the bill.  That 
word was defined for me by members of the Mississauga Gospel 
Temple.  By their name alone we can tell they are Christians and 
their belief in the Bible is very strong. They are very good 
people.  Reverend Horton in a letter pointed out to me that the 
word conjugal in the dictionary refers specifically to the act of 
sexual intercourse between a man and a woman in a married state.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said “Just a minute.  If we are using the word conjugal, how 
can we say that this bill does not in some way reference 
marriage?  I think it does”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the minister, as had others, and said that we needed 
to address it.  For us simply to continue to say that this is not 
about marriage in some way, or that it could not be interpreted 
in some way by a lawyer somewhere down the road, is unrealistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  We will see how you vote on the 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I will be voting in favour of the 
bill, let me tell the member that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded by putting in the bill the definition of 
marriage, which to me was acceptable.  I have shared that 
information with my constituents at the Mississauga Gospel Temple 
and to everyone else who has written with concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found interesting was that the definition, which clearly 
is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, 
has caused some concern in the gay community.  They have called 
and said that somehow we have gutted the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a message regarding that.  If they are saying that and 
they are partners in gay or lesbian relationships, then what they 
are really telling me is that they want, perhaps through a hidden 
agenda, to move toward gay and lesbian marriages being defined in 
the same way as heterosexual marriages.  I do not support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that before.  Members opposite want to bring up some 
comments I made in the provincial legislature as an MPP.  I am 
quite prepared to defend them because that bill did not clearly 
define marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the 
exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I may be prepared to draw my line in the sand which says 
that marriage is the union of a man a woman to the exclusion of 
all others, I have introduced a private member's bill which would 
amend the Marriage Act and amend the Interpretation Act to lay 
that out clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not doing that to be mean-spirited to the gay and lesbian 
community.  I believe they are entitled to the rights outlined in 
Bill C-23 and to the obligations outlined in Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this before.  I do not consider it to be homophobic. 
I just understand, have been raised to believe, and my 
constituents in the majority believe, that marriage by definition 
is between a man and a woman.  That is based very much on 
procreation, on children and on families.  I understand that to 
be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, if two same sex people get together in a 
union, draw up a contract, do whatever they want and live their 
lives loving one another, I can assure you that does not 
jeopardize my marriage of 31 years.  I am the only one who does 
that, and I do that on a regular basis, as my wife would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that two women love one another, are in a relationship 
and live together has no impact on my relationship with my wife, 
nor should it for anyone.  The reality is that we take the issue 
and decide what kind of society we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use an example.  Suppose there were two people working on 
the assembly line at General Motors.  One of them was 
heterosexual with a wife at home.  The other was gay with a 
partner at home. Are we prepared as a society to say that the 
heterosexual person should receive full access to General Motors' 
company benefits, pension survivor benefits and dental plan for 
his partner at home, but that the person making the same dollar, 
working the same hours and taking the same risks should not have 
access to those same benefits?  Is that the kind of society we 
want?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people understand the differences between the 
former Reform Party, or the C-C-R-A-P, or the UA, or the CA, or 
whatever it is, and the government.  I think it is wonderful that 
it is having a leadership debate.  We will hear the vision for 
Canada and the world according to Stockwell Day and according to 
the present leader of that party. 
I cannot wait to hear the debate.  We will hear “praise the 
Lord” all across this great land.  They will be standing and 
saying that if people come to their bosom they will make those 
people more free and more democratic.  It is nonsense.  They can 
stump it and thump it any which way, but the vision in which 
Canadians believe is not one of the extreme right.  It is not one 
of the extreme religious right.  It is the belief that we all 
have the ability and the freedom to worship in whatever form we 
want or not to worship in whatever form we want.

Madam Speaker, it is funny to hear the word extreme in this 
place.  I think I just heard a speech on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government of some of the fatal errors that I think 
once again it is creating with Bill C-23.  One of those fatal 
errors is the omnibus nature of the bill.  The bill touches some 
68 pieces of legislation.  In doing so it will affect some 
longstanding and important pieces of legislation in the country, 
such as the Pension Benefits Standards Act, the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act, the Canada Pension Act, the Old Age Security Act, 
the Bank Act, the Income Tax Act and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of rhetoric from members on the other side, but I 
have seen these omnibus bills go through the House before and we 
in the opposition are obligated to point out some of the 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with an omnibus bill is that it ends up 
being left to the courts to resolve.  Therein will be the problem 
with this bill.  I want to be on record as stating that, because 
a lot of relatively innocent Canadians looking for some fairness 
in our society will end up giving more and more money to lawyers 
and going bankrupt themselves just by getting caught up in the 
web of the legal industry.  That is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some pretty experienced ministers on the other side 
and I do not understand why they would go along with this sort of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a fair bit of talk about homosexuality.  That is not 
only what this bill is about.  This bill is about leaving people 
out.  It is about leaving people like my mother out if she 
chooses to live with her sister.  It is about leaving elderly 
gentlemen out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Like my colleague from Swift Current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about exclusion, not necessarily inclusion.  Members 
opposite have to remember that.  This is not about homosexuality. 
It is about an omnibus bill that excludes some people.  These 
people, by virtue of exclusion, will be required at some point to 
go into the courtrooms once again and pay the enormous fees that 
lawyers charge to prove their case for equality. 
That is sad.  This could all be headed off by the government 
saying today “Let's clarify this.  Let's include people.  Let's 
make this fair”.  But it is not going to do that.  In fact, it 
is leaving such a bill up to terminology like “conjugal 
relationship”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned in the House several weeks ago that I had sat down 
with four young fellows in another riding.  I happen to know 
them.  We went through some of the issues involved in Bill C-23. 
I asked them if they would be involved in these benefits.  They 
said, sure, they were all in conjugal relationships, and they 
were laughing and giggling and bumping each other.  I asked what 
a conjugal relationship was to them, and they laughed and said 
“us guys” and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew all four of them and I knew they were not homosexual. 
They said that I could call them anything I wanted, but if they 
could take advantage through this bill of the Income Tax Act, the 
Pension Act, the Insolvency Act and the Bank Act they would do 
it.  Why?  Because whatever a conjugal relationship is, it cannot 
be proven that one is in such a relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many times people on this side of the House 
have to say “Clean up your act”, but these are loose ends, and 
serious loose ends.  It appears to me that the government is 
simply going down the road trying to collect votes from a certain 
group in our society such that it is willing to change all of 
these pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is power gone to its worst, in my opinion.  This majority 
government is in its second successive term and the government 
seems to feel that it might get a third successive majority 
government.  Whether that happens we will see.  However, the 
government thinks it can bring in such omnibus bills which affect 
our whole society and get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals leave office another government will be left 
trying to figure out the mess.  It will acquiesce.  It is such a 
mess and it will be left to the courts.  As one who spends a 
great deal of time following court cases, I know that leaving 
these things to the courts is a sad mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at the child pornography issue which has 
been left to the courts.  Can you believe it?  Time and time 
again we look at the mess of drugs in our society.  That issue 
has been left to the courts.  People who have peddled hard core 
drugs are walking away from the courts just because it is money 
and not common sense to common people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what motivates a government to do such a thing, 
but I do know that because it is a majority government it will 
get its way, unless somebody on the other side has the courage to 
take it away.  We will see what happens a little later when the 
voting starts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing a majority government such as this has failed to 
do is to go out into the country and ask people what they think. 
A member just a few minutes ago said the “majority of 
Canadians”.  That is very interesting because nobody from the 
government was in my riding and there are about 160,000 people 
who live in it.  Are we excluded from this group called a 
“majority of Canadians”?  Who did the government talk to? Lobby 
groups?  Liberal associations?  If I asked my colleagues, I do 
not think any of them would say that the Liberals were in their 
ridings asking questions about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member across the way says that the majority of Canadians 
believes in this, that is hogwash. 
It is not accurate.  At least he cannot prove it is accurate.  He 
certainly has not talked to the people in my riding nor in many 
other ridings in the country.

act.  I think, because we are trying to include one certain group 
within our society, to call it a modernization is a misnomer.  I 
would tend to call it a specialization act because it is an act 
that is directed at special groups, subsets of our society.  If 
this were truly a modernization act, it would include not 
exclude a lot of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more I come to the House of Commons, the more I see 
legislation like this, the more I watch a majority government 
stand up, one, two, three, as they will tonight, and the more 
this is thrust upon us, as it has certainly been thrust upon my 
riding, the more disappointed I am in the process of government 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a statement from the Liberal Government of Canada saying 
“You will take this modernization of benefits bill and you will 
like it because there is not a damn thing you can do about it.  We 
have a majority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis I guess the only thing we can do when such 
bad business takes place in the House of Commons is to remember 
it at the time of an election and get a government in that 
considers all people not just some, and one that modernizes and 
does not specialize.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this report stage debate. 
I must say that if I were to believe everything that was being 
said about this bill, I would probably want to vote against it 
myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard reports today that it has something to do with adoption. 
It has nothing to do with adoption.  Only the provinces can 
legislate with respect to adoption.  Why would anyone in the 
House want to suggest to their constituents that it has something 
to do with adoption? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard today that this has something to do with the 
division of assets.  Why would the House have anything to do with 
division of assets?  That is clearly a provincial matter under 
our constitution.  We could not legislate with respect to 
division of assets even if we wanted to.   However, members 
opposite in the House today have spoken about division of assets. 
What a lot of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rhetorical question has been asked by one of the members 
opposite:  What kind of society will we have?  Just having 
listened to a number of speeches here this afternoon, if we 
follow the logic opposite, what we would have is the wrath of the 
majority against the minority.  If we follow their line of 
reasoning, not only would the majority rise up against the 
minority but the majority could in fact rise up against 
aboriginal treaties, which are also part of our constitution. 
However, I dare say I could easily find a majority of Canadians 
who would prefer to eliminate treaties from being part of our 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at where this law came from.  This law came into 
effect because of a decision by the supreme court which said that 
this was the right, fair and equitable thing to do, 
notwithstanding it deals with a minority and notwithstanding the 
fact that it will not cost anyone any money for all the studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some questions for the members opposite who have spoken 
so vociferously, and might I say also viciously, against the 
minority covered by this bill.  They may want to question their 
cousin, Mr. Long, one of Premier Harris' two chief advisors, who 
declared today that he will be running for the leadership of the 
Canadian Alliance. 
When he appears at their leadership convention they may want to 
ask him why somebody who purports to lead the Canadian Alliance 
would recommend that the Ontario government enact bill 5.  Let us 
look at Bill 5.  It amends 67 provincial statutes extending 
benefits under provincial law.  Incidentally, Bill C-23 amends 68 
statutes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also ask why they are suggesting to people that we are 
sneaking this through parliament, that we are rushing this 
through parliament.  Let us ask Mr. Tom Long at the Canadian 
Alliance why the Ontario government passed it in three days.  Not 
only did it pass into law in three days, Ontario proclaimed it in 
three days.  Why or how could they purport to ascribe to a party 
where one of the would-be leaders has been part of this?  It took 
three days in Ontario but five months before parliament and we 
are accused of sneaking it through.  What a lot of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the whole idea of debate.  At Queen's Park there 
were six speakers over three days.  There was no vote.  It passed 
on consent.  No one will ever know at Queen's Park where Mr. Long 
resides, who opposed it or who voted in favour of it because all 
three, including their philosophical cousin, Mr. Harris of the 
Progressive Conservative Party in Ontario, put it through. 
According to the Toronto <I>Star</I> on October 27, 1999, Mr. 
Harris let it be known that anyone opposed to the bill should be 
absent from the House when it passed on consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of society will we have?  Will we have an exclusive or 
inclusive society.  What I am hearing today is that we will 
exclude certain people who we, the majority, define as being 
different.  We will have a society where the majority rises up 
and says to the minority “Sorry, we do not like you.  You are 
different.  We will not in any way deal with you.  We will not 
recognize you and we will not give you benefits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about intolerance.  We will tell people things that are 
patently not true.  We will tell those people that the government 
is rushing this through parliament, but the record shows that it 
has taken five months here and only three days at Queen's Park. 
We will say that we never know who voted on it.  Every vote here 
is recorded.  What did we see at Queen's Park?  We do not know 
who was for bill 5 or who was against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to ask again what kind of society they want.  Do they 
want a society where the majority will dictate?  Will we have 
polls for everything?  Will we have some sort of 
grassroots—which is their term—discernment of what the majority 
wants?  If they want to go on that basis they could eliminate 
Indian and aboriginal treaties in this country.  They could 
eliminate all sorts of things in this country because the 
majority is either being told a pack of nonsense or the majority 
does not like the minority who appear to be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people appear to be different from many of us in this 
place.  They have a different colour.  I acknowledge that. 
However, the reality is that we have entered into constitutional 
agreements.  That is not to say that they have special rights to 
the exclusion of all others.  We have recognized that this is the 
right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to something even more primitive or more fundamental. 
Let us look at Prince Edward Island which has four members of 
parliament.  That was a constitutional guarantee.  I guarantee I 
could find a majority in this country who would want to wipe out 
that constitutional privilege.  Are they in some way enjoying 
more privileges than the rest of us in perhaps Ontario or, dare I 
say, Alberta?  Prince Edward Island has a constitutional 
guarantee of four senators.  There are only six senators for the 
province of Alberta.  Is that to say that it has a privilege that 
Alberta does not have?  That is absolutely correct. 
Why does the majority not rise up and eliminate that right?  This 
is a situation where it is the right thing to do.  Sometimes we 
have to do the right thing in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about having a society that turns its back on the 
majority.  We would have people telling us that the majority 
wants to exclude certain people.  If we followed the line of 
logic from the members opposite, what other minority groups in 
this country do we not like?  I could undoubtedly find many other 
people who have been stereotyped as ones who should not receive 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House a while back an amendment was made to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, Bill C-33.  Members opposite gave the same sort 
of rhetoric with regard to that bill.  They indicated that we 
were attacking marriage.  They said, if I heard them correctly, 
that this was a slippery slope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member for Wild Rose to ask one of the would-be 
leaders of the Canadian Alliance why Queen's Park sneaked bill 5 
through in three days.  It amended 67 provincial statutes. 
Members on the other side cannot have it both ways.  Why do they 
not ask the member from Queen's Park, who supported it, the 
member of their cousin party, the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Ontario, who issues licences to ministers to perform 
marriages?  It is not this government.  It is the provincial 
government.  If one were to follow their line of logic, who is 
attacking marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me back up and look at the real attack on marriage, which 
occurred in 1974 and 1986 when laws were passed across Canada 
which stated that if people lived together it was the same as 
marriage.  That was a provincial law and that, I would suggest to 
the House, was an attack on marriage.  Being fair to people 
because they happen to live together and file their taxes 
together does not make them somehow different.  If those members 
opposite ever became a majority, I would live in fear of the 
majority rising up against people they believe to be different.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the debate throughout the day and I agree 
with some of the previous speakers who talked about this as being 
a difficult and moral issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not for a minute believe some of the material that has been 
coming from the members to my left because I submit that the bill 
is not about special rights for anyone.  It is fundamentally 
about fairness and equal rights.  It is a recognition that 
homosexual individuals pay into benefit plans and, until very 
recently, have been denied the benefits that should flow from 
those plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good deal of discussion on Bill C-23, the modernization of 
benefits and obligations act, has indicated that somehow this is 
a judge-made law.  It is important to recognize that the charter 
of rights and freedoms, which was introduced in 1982 and came 
into full force and in 1985, was achieved by the prime minister 
and nine of the ten premiers in April, 18 years ago this month. 
It was later ratified by the House of Commons and all the 
legislatures, with the exception of the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the

without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination 
based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex,

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, that law was passed by parliamentarians in the 
provinces and in the House of Commons.  Under our laws it is 
interpreted by the courts, which is fair. I think most citizens 
would find it reasonable that somebody has to interpret it and it 
is the courts and eventually the Supreme Court of Canada.  Again 
it says that one cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, along 
with a number of other categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out by the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, in 
the case of M and H there was a court decision. The supreme court 
ruled eight to one that there should be a division of assets. In 
my opinion Bill C-23 will ensure compliance with supreme court 
rulings like that in M and H which call for an end to 
discrimination based on sexual orientation.  The court has ruled 
simply that where benefits and obligations are extended to common 
law heterosexual couples, these same benefits and obligations 
must be extended to Canadians involved in long term same sex 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was intrigued with a book that I picked up for the first time 
last night.  <I>Justice, Not Just Us</I> is written by Gerald 
Vanderzande who is described on the jacket of the book as 
follows: “What he has to say is always moving and compelling. 
His words transcend the boundaries between denominations and 
faith communities.  In urging us to do God's work here and now he 
demonstrates the true potential of contemporary religion.  If 
only its practitioners learned to act in unison”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gerald Vanderzande has something to say on this issue and I 
would like to refer to it briefly.  He writes for an organization 
called Citizens for Public Justice.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now consider Citizens for Public Justice's position on 
legal-equality rights for gays and lesbians.  The government 
encounters a variety of human relationships in our society, 
including heterosexual marriages and other social 
relationships—. When a government does not recognize, in law or 
public policy, the reality of other, non-marital relationships in 
our society, then, whether we like it or not, the courts are 
forced to reinterpret the meaning and scope of marriage within 
the existing legislation. That means that other relationships, 
even though they are non-heterosexual and non-marital, must be 
defined— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say in this interesting document: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—all people are treated fairly when it comes to the recognition 
of certain civil rights and freedoms and the provision of certain 
services and programs—. How can we, without discriminating 
against certain people—recognize the constitutional and other 
rights of people who live in other “permanent” relationships? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to talk about what has happened in the far distant 
past.  We have had some references to that as well.  Mr. 
Vanderzande said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind you that, as I understand it, in the Old Testament 
Scriptures, most marriages were “common law”.  There was not 
what we now call a civil ceremony ensuring that people had made a 
formal vow.  There was not a public declaration of mutual 
commitment before a civil authority.  In fact, in the Scriptures, 
the father (the patriarch) of the family often decided who was to 
marry whom. In a culture that has moved on under a variety of 
influences, the government now faces new social realities. 
Government is not there to decide what is theologically correct. 
It is there to decide what is publicly just. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concludes in this portion of his book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree that religion (faith) is at the heart of life, and if 
we agree that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms rightly 
protects everyone's basic beliefs and every institution's 
religious or ideological convictions, and that the government 
should not interfere with a citizen's basic beliefs and an 
institution's freedom of expression, then can we not with respect 
to various human relationships provide equal protection in terms 
of public policy for those who live in a non-marital, 
non-heterosexual relationship?

they have received hundreds of thousands of petitions stating

against, then that is grounds for correction.  That is what this 
debate fundamentally comes down to.  It does not matter what the 
public opinion polls say.  It does not matter what the petitions 
say.  I am saying through you, Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member 
that the fundamental matter should be what we are doing to 
protect the rights of minorities.  That is the point that needs 
to be made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-23 has been used as a proxy for a much broader discussion 
around the area of sexual orientation.  It is useful to have the 
discussion, but I think it is also useful to put it into context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In much of the discussion today many members have talked about 
intolerance, saying that if one is opposed to the bill then one 
must be intolerant.  I do not believe that would be a very fair 
characterization of the position of members who try to argue for 
something rather than against something. There is a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discrimination is not exclusively a negative concept.  There are 
positive or affirmative discriminations within our society.  In 
fact policy by its very nature is discriminatory because we do 
not treat everybody the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discriminate in favour of seniors so that when they reach age 
65 they can qualify for old age security.  That is discrimination 
on the basis of age. We discriminate in favour of the disabled. 
We understand there are people in our society who have needs that 
as our value system dictates, we want to provide the assistance 
they will need to care for them and their family members. We 
discriminate in favour of aboriginals.  We have special programs 
to assist aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk a lot about the needs of various groups within our 
society.  All of these discriminatory practices within policy in 
fact reflect the values and the consensus of the views of 
Canadians.  It is a value system.  Although talking about values 
in our society seems to be politically incorrect these days, the 
fact remains that we do have a value system and we do have 
standards and guidelines that ensure when we make policy in this 
place and around the country that we are dealing with the lives 
of Canadians in all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the 35th Parliament Bill C-33 came forward.  Bill C-33 
included sexual orientation as a prohibited ground for 
discrimination in the human rights code.  The then commissioner 
of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Mr. Max Yalden, made 
public statements that if one were to include sexual orientation 
as a prohibited ground for discrimination that it was logical. Of 
course members know that discussion had to do with issues such as 
discrimination vis-à-vis employment, housing and access to 
services.  Those were the negative discriminations with which I 
believe all Canadians would agree. I think all Canadians agree 
that people should not be discriminated against with regard to 
housing, employment and access to services regardless of their 
value system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-23 we are no longer just talking about the negative 
discriminations.  Now we are talking about the affirmative 
discriminations. 
One group does not get the same as another group and there are 
these linkages.  Now the pendulum is swinging.  We have taken 
care of the negative discriminations.  Now we are saying that we 
are that good and that equal that now we have to do this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court dealt with it.  There was a series of cases. 
There was Egan and Nesbit with regard to pension entitlements. 
The court said yes, it is discrimination but the value system of 
Canadians was that it would be permitted discrimination.  I think 
that was the language the court used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now M and H, a case that came through the supreme 
court.  It said we have to recognize that people have other 
relationships.  M and H had to do with whether one same sex 
partner had to pay support payments to the partner whom they 
broke up with.  All of a sudden this whole thing started to creep 
from negative discrimination through equity and fairness and then 
“I want a piece of the pie too”.  That is how the pendulum has 
swung. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why there is so much discussion here. The die was 
set early in the 35th parliament as to the direction we were 
going.  Max Yalden said if we put sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination, this is the logical 
extension of that move.  Parliament made that step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not so sure that it is the supreme court which is telling 
parliament what to do.  I think the decisions of parliamentarians 
over the years in dealing with items that came to 
parliamentarians have been acted upon by the courts because 
parliament did not do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe parliament did its job with regard to this 
issue.  We should have consulted with our constituents.  We 
should have raised legislation.  We should have dealt with this 
if we felt strongly enough but we did not as a parliament. The 
courts did it as a result of that ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 responds to the court decision.  I believe it responds 
accurately to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people talk about intolerance, it is not a fair label.  It 
is something from a broader discussion that people have been 
talking about that we find difficult to discuss and talk openly 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should appreciate that about 3% of the population of 
Canada are homosexual persons.  It is quite a small number. Based 
on the numbers from the corporations that provide benefits and so 
on and what justice officials told me earlier today, about 1.6% 
of same sex couples actually will ever qualify for benefits under 
the bill.  The reason is that relationships must last for at 
least one year for them to qualify for any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, as members have said quite often in the debate, 
there is very little cost associated with it.  There are two 
reasons. One is that there are so very few couples that will ever 
qualify for this.  The other is that many of our benefits, like 
the GST credit, are going to be based on partner income rather 
than individual income and in fact same sex partners in a 
relationship will last longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill actually is ultimately about marriage because we are 
going to deal with it eventually.  Canadians will know that 
society exists and sustains itself because of the family. It is a 
very difficult issue for a lot of members to deal with. I believe 
in the traditional family.  I believe that couples who raise 
families, who raise healthy, well adjusted children are to be put 
on a pedestal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the members here who are arguing against Bill C-23 are 
actually arguing in favour of the family.  Should we not 
discriminate in favour of the family?  Should we not hold that 
traditional family on a pedestal and say that it is doing exactly 
what is necessary for our society to continue to thrive and to 
grow?  Should we not discriminate in favour of that family and 
give it more benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have discrimination in our policy now.  I gave many 
examples. Can we not continue to discriminate in favour of the 
traditional family with children?  I believe we can. Canadians 
ought to tell parliamentarians that they believe in the family, 
that they believe marriage as is in this bill, which is the 
lawful union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others 
and it reflects the value system of Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
recently I had the opportunity to pose a question to the Minister 
of Health with regard to the CHST funding by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the debate was about whether or not the transfer was 
as the provinces had provided the information or in fact as the 
federal government had presented the information. The House will 
know that the provinces were suggesting the transfers under CHST 
were 11 cents to 13 cents in cash, whereas the Minister of Health 
advised the House very clearly that it was some 33 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it would be useful to try to clarify why there would 
be this difference.  As hon. members know, there continues to be 
ads on the television which demonstrate a pile of pills 
representing the provincial government's share of health care 
funding and a smaller pile for the federal funding.  Canadians 
probably want to know a little bit more about why there is this 
discrepancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with the change of the rules way back in 1977 when 
the federal government transferred the ability to tax income to 
the provincial governments.  At the same time as transferring the 
taxation authority to the provincial governments, the federal 
government reduced its tax rates so that the net impact on the 
taxpayer in fact was nil. It was an interesting period of time. 
If I am not mistaken at that time the transfer of points was 
13.5% on personal income tax and 1% on corporate taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turns out, Canadians would probably be interested to know 
that in terms of the value of the cash portion of transfers of 
CHST funding, which includes health and the tax points or the 
authorization to collect income tax given to the provinces, that 
in 2000-01 the provinces will receive a total of some $30.8 
billion in the Canadian health and social transfer amount.  Of 
that, $15.3 billion will be tax transfers and $15.5 billion will 
be transfers in cash. Canadians will have to make up their own 
minds about whether or not they believe there is some value in 
tax points.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we went to the whole situation of tax points there used 
to be three separate bins, including a bin for established 
programs funding as well as post-secondary education.  Even then, 
back in 1977, there was a tax component as well as a cash 
component.  As the value of taxation, as the revenues or the 
economy of the provinces grew, tax on the growing economy would 
increase and generate greater dollars of revenue for them, and 
therefore the cash went down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way that the federal government can enforce the 
provisions of the Canada Health Act is to have a real cash 
component so that it can be withheld in the event that a province 
would decide, as Alberta has, to introduce legislation which 
would, I believe, violate the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the question today and ask the parliamentary secretary 
if he understands that those are the details and that the real 
truth is that the federal government contributes, in the form of 
transfers to the provinces, regardless of what form they take, 33 
cents of every health care dollar. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am standing in this 
evening for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health, as my colleague was unable to be with us this evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28, budget day, the Government of Canada announced a 
$2.5 billion increase to the Canada health and social transfer 
for provinces and territories to be used over four years for 
health and post-secondary education.  Let us not forget that this 
$2.5 billion increase follows the largest single investment in 
this government's history made through the previous budget, an 
$11.5 billion increase in funding over five years specifically 
for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000-01 the CHST will reach a new high of close to $31 
billion.  Of this amount $15.3 billion will be in the form of tax 
transfers and $15.5 billion in the form of cash transfers.  The 
bottom line is that the federal government spends in excess of 31 
cents of every public health care dollar spent by governments in 
Canada.  That is clearly more than 7 cents or 13 cents, as some 
provinces and the opposition claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review the facts.  It is projected that governments will 
spend—not individuals, but governments—$64 billion on public 
health care this fiscal year.  Federal direct funding combined 
with CHST health spending means that about $20 billion out of 
next year's projected $64 billion in public health care spending, 
or 31 cents on the dollar, will be financed by the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact if we factor in the $9.5 billion that the federal 
government will transfer to the less prosperous provinces and 
territories to invest in health care and other priorities, total 
federal transfers in 2000-01 will reach $40.6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All told, Government of Canada spending clearly exceeds 31 cents 
on the dollar.  Let me emphasize, as the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance have said, that if more money is needed to 
ensure accessible and sustainable high quality health care for 
the 21st century, the Government of Canada will be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
