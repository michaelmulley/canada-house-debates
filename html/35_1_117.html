<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 24 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assumed from reading the motion that my hon. 
colleague wants to stop immigrants from coming into Canada 
when they test positive for HIV.
<P>
	Today, the way the laws of the land stand, we have testing for 
all kinds of viruses and the medical doctors decide who gets in. I 
do not think we in the House have outlined the facts as to how 
much it costs in each and every situation. Who can decide who 
can come in and who cannot? It could be tomorrow that the HIV 
test or the medication will cost $10,000. Some might argue that 
is too much. Even a cost of $5,000 some could argue is too much. 
Where do we draw the line on how much is effective?
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	For that purpose the government has a law already in place so 
medical officers can decide who can be and who cannot be 
admitted to Canada on medical grounds. Also the government is 
reviewing the extensive information it has on HIV and will 
announce a decision soon about HIV cases in Canada.
<P>
	Our policies have to reflect the social structures, health 
systems and justice system we have in Canada. Otherwise it will 
be disastrous for us and it will be one sided. We cannot afford to 
have that. Misinformation and misunderstandings about HIV 
are very dangerous elements that we face today. I hope in the 
near future the government completes its investigation and 
studies and comes up with a policy that will satisfy the concerns 
of everyone in the House and of the population at large. We take 
care of our own citizens first and we are compassionate enough 
to allow others to come into the country.
<P>
	The best hope we have is to come up with a solution for HIV. I 
think that would make everyone happy. I suggest we keep things 
as they are for the time being and allow the system to work. We 
need medical discoveries, medical approaches and information 
so that we can make wise decisions on the issue. Otherwise there 
is nothing stopping us from coming up with a motion next week 
that says anybody who has cancer should not be allowed in 
because cancer costs too much to treat. Just about every disease 
in the world costs money to treat.
<P>
	Where do we draw the line? Where do we start and where do 
we end? Since we do not know that, I am unable to make a 
decision on who should be admitted and who should not. On that 
basis I oppose the motion and wait for the government to come 
up with a solution after researching the matter carefully and 
checking the track record of the last five years so we know the 
expenses we are talking about for HIV.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the motion tabled in the House on 
September 23 by the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. This 
motion, which clearly targets prospective immigrants who are 
HIV positive, is, by the same token, discriminatory.
<P>
	To argue that their admission would put an excessive burden 
on our health care system is very one-sided, since that is 
certainly not the case. The motion discriminates particularly 
against people claiming refugee status, since it would make 
them inadmissible even before their case is heard by the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	This motion should therefore be interpreted as barring 
immigrants, certain classes of visitors and persons claiming 
refugee status from entry into Canada.
<P>
	Detection of the virus in these people would make them 
inadmissible and, as a result, prohibit them from proceeding 
with their visit to Canada, from immigrating to Canada, and 
from claiming refugee status.
<P>
	Today, the Canadian government intends to take advantage of 
its statutory review of immigration policy. In an article 
published in <I>La Presse</I> on April 26, 1994, the Minister of 
Immigration and Citizenship was already setting the parameters 
for this review. He said the government was looking at the list of 
diseases for which testing is compulsory, to decide whether the 
list should also include HIV.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7396"> 7396 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the current Immigration Act, individuals who wish to 
immigrate to Canada are subject to admission criteria that do not 
discriminate in any way that is incompatible with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Tests are currently carried out 
on a routine basis and are compulsory for a number of diseases, 
including tuberculosis and syphilis.
<P>
	The minister went on to say that screening for HIV was not on 
the list. However, Canada could deny entry to individuals who 
were HIV positive and who had AIDS.
<P>
	If a physician suspects that an immigrant is HIV positive or 
has AIDS, a screening test is done. At the present time, if the 
applicant is HIV positive, the application is automatically 
rejected.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	In a study by the Library of Parliament, Law and Government 
Division, we read that in a study on admissibility finished in 
1992, it was recommended that the whole issue of routine 
testing for communicable and other diseases that are a burden on 
the health care system be reviewed.
<P>
	But, for the time being, there is no indication, as my colleague 
from Drummond said, that universal HIV screening would save 
more money than targeting other diseases. Furthermore, 
according to a study conducted by the McGill Centre for 
Medicine, Ethics and Law, the economical impact of HIV 
infection among immigrants is similar to the impact of coronary 
diseases. Finally, researchers at the McGill Centre believe that 
mandatory AIDS testing for immigrants would be purely 
arbitrary.
<P>
	That is why I endorse the position of our party which asks the 
government to create a committee that would review phase II of 
the Canadian strategy on the fight against AIDS. This position 
differs considerably from an outright fight against the 
admissibility of immigrants. Let me remind the House of some 
of the criteria we use to determine medical admissibility; these 
criteria are given in section 22 of the regulations related to the 
present legislation.
<P>
	``For the purpose of determining whether any person is...a 
danger to public health or to public safety...or might cause 
excessive demands on health or social services, the following 
factors shall be considered by a medical officer in relation to the 
nature, severity or probable duration of any disease, disorder, 
disability or other health impairment from which the person is 
suffering, namely: any reports made by a medical practitioner 
with respect to the person; the degree to which the disease, 
disorder, disability or other impairment may be communicated 
to other persons; whether sudden incapacity or unpredictable or 
unusual behaviour may create a danger to public safety; whether 
the supply of health...services that the person may require in 
Canada is limited to such an extent that: the use of such services 
by the person might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay 
provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent 
residents, or the use  of such services may not be available or 
accessible to the person; whether medical care or 
hospitalization is required; whether potential employability or 
productivity is affected; and whether prompt and effective 
medical treatment can be provided''.
<P>
	In 1993, 54 persons were refused for that reason. Therefore, 
as written, the present legislation contains all the provisions 
required to admit or refuse any applicant for visitor, immigrant 
or refugee status. I believe that this motion is, for the moment, 
premature to say the least. Moreover, it opens the door to 
discrimination towards would-be immigrants by reinforcing 
insidiously prejudices against them.
<P>
	This motion would also be in violation of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, a legislation which is the basis for several 
federal and provincial commissions on human rights. Several 
decisions and judgments confirming discrimination have been 
passed by these commissions under Canadian legislation on 
human rights.
<P>
	That study summarizes the position of the commissions: 
``Discrimination against HIV or AIDS infected individuals is a 
proscribed ground of discrimination because it is based on a 
deficiency or handicap as defined by human rights legislation''. 
However, for refugee claimants who must submit to a medical 
examination within 60 days of their arrival in Canada, the 
minister recognizes that the question is sensitive. ``On the one 
hand there are medical considerations and on the other the real 
fear of persecution''.
<P>
	As my colleague from Calgary Northeast was saying in this 
House, on September 23: ``The risk of admitting immigrants 
with HIV who likely do not even know that they are infected is 
one we cannot tolerate''. These are alarmist words, although I 
recognize the seriousness of the situation and the pandemic 
character of the disease. However, are we going to 
systematically screen for AIDS all Canadians coming home 
from a trip abroad on the off chance that they might not know 
that they have been infected by the virus? Why then specifically 
target visitors, immigrants and convention refugee status 
claimants?
<P>
	Since this terrible disease is a global health problem, how else 
can we stop anyone, be it healthy Canadians or healthy 
immigrants, from contracting a HIV-related disease, if not 
through an efficient national awareness and prevention policy? 
The solution does not lie in screening only, but mostly in a 
vigorous awareness and prevention campaign. This disease is 
not circumscribed to immigrants.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7397"> 7397 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The way this disease is spreading, healthy landed immigrants 
and permanent residents may get infected by the HIV virus even 
in Canada.
<P>
	Compulsory screening for visitors, immigrants and refugee 
status claimants is neither a cure nor a way to slow down the 
spread of the disease.
<P>
	In fact, routine screening is a dubious argument which raises 
several questions regarding the Reform Party's position on the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	On October 25, the Reform member for Calgary Northeast 
said in this House, and I quote: ``-today the <I>Financial Post 
</I>reported on a memo from the government's finance department 
which concluded that this government's immigration policies 
are worsening the unemployment crisis.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Immigration going to act on the finance 
minister's conclusions or on those of the Reform member and 
drastically reduce immigration levels?''
<P>
	The real aim of this motion is a drastic reduction in 
immigration levels.
<P>
	As my Liberal colleague from Thunder Bay-Atikokan did 
before me, I want to say again that the danger of HIV infection 
does not come from foreigners but rather from specific practices 
such as sharing drug needles, unprotected sex, transfusions 
involving tainted blood, and not mere physical contact.
<P>
	This is why the Canadian Haemophilia Society, the Red 
Cross, the European Parliament, and the British Medical 
Association all believe that visitors are not a public health 
threat.
<P>
	Therefore, I will vote against this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise in this House today and speak in support of 
Motion No. 285, a motion that the government test all 
immigrants to Canada for HIV positive status.
<P>
	Like many of the private members' motions to come before 
this House, Motion No. 285 is another example of common 
sense. It is a simple and direct motion designed to change the 
way the immigration department conducts its business. It should 
not be necessary for this House to move such common sense 
procedure but this Liberal government and this minister of 
immigration have once again refused to put the cares and 
concerns of ordinary Canadians ahead of political correctness in 
pandering to special interest groups.
<P>
	There are health implications for Canadians if we let people 
into this country with the disease. AIDS is communicable. AIDS 
is also fatal and there are no proven treatments or cures. Once 
you have it, unfortunately your days are numbered. We 
needlessly put at risk other Canadians who may contract the 
disease.
<P>
	We know of many ways that can happen. The disease can be 
passed on sexually or through blood or bodily fluids. When I 
visit my dentist now, he and all his staff wear latex gloves. They 
do not do this because some health regulation forces them to; 
they wear their gloves as a preventive measure. They do not 
want to take the risk, however small, of coming into contact with 
a fatal disease. Why would we as a government take the risk, 
however small, of exposing Canadians to the potential for 
receiving AIDS from an immigrant?
<P>
	Why there is refusal to do mandatory testing of all immigrants 
for AIDS or HIV is beyond me. We have a specific section in our 
Immigration Act which states: ``No person shall be granted 
entry who is suffering from disease, disorder, or disability 
which will likely be a danger to public health or which would 
cause excessive demands on health or social services''. This 
section is there for the protection of Canadian society.
<P>
	Every member in this House will agree that immigration 
should be a benefit to Canada and not a threat to public health or 
indeed the economy. Clearly the potential threat to both health 
and finances from AIDS carriers entering our country is cause 
for alarm.
<P>
	In the debate on this motion so far we have not heard one 
rational argument about why HIV testing should not be done on 
all immigrants. The member for St. Denis stated: ``Even if they 
test HIV positive they can continue contributing to Canadian 
society for many years''. It is the refusal of some to admit the 
obvious that angers so many Canadians. It is totally 
unacceptable and a contravention of the law to allow HIV 
positive immigrants into Canada.
<P>
	The member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan believes that ``it 
would be inappropriate to institute a blanket exclusion of 
persons with HIV''. He quotes the Human Rights Commission 
and states that ``such a practice would be discriminatory''.
<P>
	HIV is not a discriminatory disease. It will kill anyone it 
comes in contact with. I support the right of Canadian citizens 
over the right of non-citizens to be free from discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that the immigration 
minister is going to propose a tightening up of the immigration 
system including fewer family class immigrants and a move to 
allowing in those with better language skills and job skills so 
that the financial burden on our social programs will be reduced. 
These are moves in the right direction. The immigration 
minister should be congratulated for this reform, and I 
emphasize reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7398"> 7398 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the job is not finished yet. The immigrants to 
Canada who have more applicable job skills and speak English 
or French but also have AIDS will not be net contributors at all. 
They will be a burden on our welfare and health care systems 
and their presence increases the potential for others to be 
infected. As a guardian of the public purse I believe it is my duty 
to examine the costs involved in both the government's stated 
course of action and the measures proposed by this bill.
<P>
	The government avoids performing a $12, I will emphasize 
$12, test for AIDS on every immigrant who comes into Canada, 
not the proposed $10,000 as was alluded to earlier by a member 
from the other side but $12. With the current level of 250,000 
immigrants a year that is a saving of three million tax dollars. 
What are the costs of failing to perform such a test? The average 
health cost of caring for one person with AIDS is $250,000. If 
there are absolutely no immigrants coming to Canada with AIDS 
then indeed we have saved ourselves $3 million.
<P>
	However we have no idea how many immigrants are coming 
into Canada with AIDS. What if there are a mere 20 a year 
reaching our land with this fatal disease? The cost of caring for 
these 20 would be $5 million. If the number is 200, the cost is 
$50 million. Is it not worth $3 million to conduct this basic test?
<P>
	The Reform Party promised to be a constructive alternative in 
Parliament and offer solutions to the overspending problems of 
government. I do not believe we need to allocate new resources 
to this important task. We can point out some current 
expenditures that could be reallocated for the purposes of 
conducting mandatory testing.
<P>
	The federal Ministry of Health devotes an incredible amount 
of its resources toward the goal of AIDS prevention and 
elimination. The department spends over $40 million a year on 
such programs. Less than half of this money is spent on actual 
research to develop treatments or vaccines. Most of this funding 
goes toward yet another government bureaucracy, the Canadian 
AIDS Secretariat, and special interest groups.
<P>
	I would like to give some examples of the kind of nonsense 
that tax dollars have recently been frittered away on. There was 
the $35,000 spent on a centrefold in a homosexual magazine on 
the impact of AIDS. There was another $35,000 for a six month 
project called ``The Puppets Against AIDS Tour''. A group in 
New Brunswick received $128,000 to work for the 
empowerment of people with AIDS.
<P>
	What is the net benefit to Canadians of this type of funding? 
What did the empowering do for the health problem? Does it 
bring us closer to a cure? Who does it really educate? Would this 
money not be better spent on AIDS testing for immigrants?
<P>
	The goal of any public health campaign is clear: prevention of 
disease. One way to prevent the spread of disease in Canada is to 
eliminate new sources of the disease.
<P>
	We have a dilemma on our hands. On the one hand the Liberal 
government has a policy in the department of health to prevent 
the transmission of AIDS and it spends big dollars doing it. On 
the other hand the immigration department has a policy which 
allows into Canada an unknown number of AIDS carriers. This 
is not the only area of Liberal government policy where we can 
see a contradiction.
<P>
	The ministry of agriculture has looked at this type of issue 
already. We have all read about mad cow disease in Britain, a 
fatal disorder that attacks the nervous system of cattle. Our 
Agriculture Canada people have put down all the cattle imported 
into Canada from Britain since the time of the outbreak in 1986. 
The reason for this is simple. The disease can be passed on to 
other animals. We decided the risk of this happening, however 
small, was not worth the few cattle that were put down. It would 
seem that when it comes to the potential to contact fatal disease 
this Liberal government places the value of Canadian farm 
animals higher than it does that of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I want to point out one final example of contradiction in 
public health policy. We recently witnessed Health Canada 
officials at airports across Canada examining flights arriving 
from India, a country recently experiencing an outbreak of 
pneumonic plague. Much care and attention was focused on 
prevention by screening our borders. Pneumonic plague is easily 
treatable and poses no serious health threat to Canada. Yet much 
was done to deal with the situation. Why the same attention is 
not paid to detecting AIDS, a far more deadly disease, at our 
borders is just ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The time for action is now. We must deal with this problem 
before more lives are put at risk or taxpayers' dollars are thrown 
away. AIDS testing of immigrants is just plain common sense. 
Let us do it by supporting Motion No. 285.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take the time I have available to talk about something 
which has been causing me increasing concern as I have listened 
to the debates that have been proffered by members of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	We heard Reform Party members talk over and over again 
about the need to represent the interests of what they call real 
Canadians or ordinary Canadians, how they as members of 
Parliament have a duty and a responsibility to assess opinion 
from their constituents and to bring that forward to public view 
and discuss those issues that are important to the people they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7399"> 7399 </A></B>
<P>
represent. I agree with that. That is a fundamental role each and 
every one of us has when we get elected and come to this House.
<P>
	We have a second role. We sit in a very privileged position. 
We sit in the middle of an information flow and have access to 
resources, information and knowledge that few Canadians have. 
That imposes a burden upon us, a responsibility to educate and 
not to simply pander to those things that are of momentary or 
immediate concern. We must evaluate issues. We must examine 
them. We must research them. We must come forward to this 
Chamber with debates and arguments that are based on fact and 
some sort of presentation of a solution that will improve the 
lives of people.
<P>
	To simply victimize groups for cheap short term headlines is 
irresponsible. Unfortunately that is what I see in this. It is very 
easy. There are many people in the community who are scared to 
death of AIDS. It is a terrifying prospect. Surely we who have 
access to the experts and access to the information can take the 
time to learn about the issue, can take the time to learn about the 
work that is being done and bring forward responsible decisions 
not to inflame that fear.
<P>
	We have heard it over and over again: youth crime is out of 
control; immigrants are a drain on society; aboriginals are lazy. 
That is what we are getting day after day.
<P>
	The member for Simcoe Centre made a comment about 
pandering. If there is pandering going on, it is the Reform Party 
pandering to every nasty instinct that people have and doing 
nothing to try to advance a different view of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Doing nothing, look in the 
mirror.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would remind members that I sat 
and listened very carefully to the member for Simcoe Centre. I 
would simply ask that they allow me to do the same. I realize 
they might be a little afraid to have this kind of talk. They 
certainly do not appear to understand it.
<P>
	The fact is that daily we in this Chamber confront a great 
many very difficult issues. Listening to the members opposite 
one would think that every adolescent was committing crimes 
when we know that many of our programs for young people have 
been very effective. In fact, we know that the majority of young 
people are living responsible lives, but we do not hear that from 
across the floor.
<P>
	We do not hear about the successes in aboriginal 
communities. We hear about the failures. We do not hear about 
the successes in immigration, or the successes in 
multiculturalism, or the successes and the strengths that are 
given to this country through diversity. We hear about the 
problems.
<P>
	Those members do a great disservice to their own 
constituencies. They do a great disservice to the people of this 
country when they simply pander to the feeling that somehow 
we have become better by hating or rejecting or excluding 
people.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I had an experience some years ago. I was talking with a 
woman, a professional colleague who is a psychologist. In the 
middle of the conversation she broke down. She shared with me 
that she had AIDS. She did not have AIDS, but was actually HIV 
positive. Her husband was a hemophiliac. He got AIDS through 
a tainted blood supply and transmitted it to her. She now has full 
blown AIDS and will no doubt not be with us soon.
<P>
	That is a terrifying prospect, but when we look at that we 
know that AIDS is not as virulent or as rampant or as contagious 
a disease as some people believe. Yes, it is transmittable. There 
are significant health risks. We should examine those risks. That 
is a fact and yes, we do. Yet people are so sensitive to this 
disease, so concerned about it, that they wave it as a banner in 
front of everybody who wants to be terrified by it or every 
homophobic individual in the country. All they do is victimize 
the people who are dealing with a tragedy in their lives.
<P>
	I urge members to think about that when they bring forward 
resolutions to the House. There is a a screening process. There is 
medical examination of immigrants. The government reviews 
those regularly. We acted in this House some years ago to stop 
putting categorical lists in place because it categorically 
discriminated against people. There are policies in place that 
call for qualified medical personnel to examine people and make 
decisions about their medical admissibility. It is passing strange 
to me that the members opposite choose HIV as the one to mount 
their fight on. They need to examine very carefully their motives 
for entering into this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
must be nice to be part of a government of responsible people 
who simply take the attitude: ``Let us all be happy; things are 
fine''.
<P>
	That seems to be the attitude that often comes across. I really 
object to that because as my colleague from the Reform Party 
said a few minutes ago, if we applied common sense to a lot of 
things we are talking about, just straight, old common sense, it 
should ring a few bells. Apparently there are no bells to ring on 
that side of the House.
<P>
	Many will say that any member rising in this House to support 
mandatory HIV testing of immigrants and refugees entering 
Canada is doing so because of moral judgment. Let me first say 
that no moral judgment is behind my supporting this member's 
bill. My support for this bill is based solely on one concern and 
one concern only. That is public safety. Before anyone can 
discuss whether all immigrants and refugees must pass a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7400"> 7400 </A></B>
<P>
mandatory HIV test to live in Canada, it is necessary to research 
the history and the transmission of HIV.
<P>
	The unknowns are what we should be concerned about. The 
unknowns surrounding the infection of Canadians by HIV and 
the transmission of this virus to other Canadians must be 
addressed. As most Canadians know, those engaging in 
homosexual or bisexual activity and those engaging in 
heterosexual contact with persons of high risk are dealing with 
the two largest sectors of our society that test positively for HIV. 
What is seldom talked about is the third largest sector of HIV 
positive Canadians, those who are HIV positive with no 
identifiable risk factor.
<P>
	How can someone who is not homosexual, bisexual, an 
injection drug user, or who does not associate with these high 
risk individuals become HIV positive? Science cannot answer 
that question. Science can say that human immunodeficiency 
virus, HIV, is offering one of the most difficult challenges to 
those actively engaged in understanding how this virus works.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	What is understood is that there are two known types of HIV, 
HIV-1 and HIV-2. The predominant virus in Canada is HIV-1 
which is considered by scientists as the most serious viral form.
<P>
	Scientists also say HIV is the most studied virus in history but 
much remains to be learned about it. It is known HIV is 
retro-virus. It consists of RNA and must invade the DNA of 
living cells to replicate. It is believed that HIV may require one 
or more co-factors that act together to cause full blown AIDS. 
What those co-factors are have not been identified.
<P>
	It is also believed by scientists that HIV is the most 
genetically variable virus yet discovered and that worldwide 
there are at least five subgroups of HIV-1, the most dangerous 
form of the virus. This virus is known to mutate rapidly and is 
known to recombine with other HIV strains. This mutation can 
change the manner HIV infects the host and may change the 
manner in which the virus can be transmitted.
<P>
	Of Canadians known to be HIV positive and have developed 
AIDS, 4.5 per cent have no known identified risk factor that 
would explain why they became HIV positive. That particular 
stat worries me and it should worry every member of this House.
<P>
	There is currently no known cure or preventable measure that 
will end the worldwide threat to humanity posed by this virus. 
To be infected by this virus is considered a slow death penalty of 
great suffering.
<P>
	We have Canadians who have practised every known method 
to reduce the risk of HIV infection and yet they are known to be 
HIV positive. Can we allow those outside of Canada to bring 
different strains of HIV into this country to readily mutate with 
the strains already here? Can the rapid mutation of HIV and 
possible unknown variations of HIV cause the infection of those  
known not to engage in risk behaviours? Could introducing a 
new strain of HIV to Canadians develop a mutated version of the 
virus that we presently have that would allow far easier infection 
of Canadians?
<P>
	I do not know the answers to these questions and it appears the 
scientists who are studying this do not know either.
<P>
	Under current immigration regulations anyone presumed to 
be a drain on Canada's health care system can be refused 
authority to immigrate to Canada and HIV positive status is now 
a legitimate reason to prevent immigration to Canada.
<P>
	I understand this may change if this government accepts a 
proposal to allow anyone into Canada who would not be a drain 
on the medical system for five years. It is known to take seven to 
ten years from infection by HIV to require enormous medical 
need. Those not showing symptoms nor admitting to HIV 
positive status or are unaware they are HIV positive who are 
now entering Canada will require either large medical expenses 
in the future or maybe a threat to spread the HIV virus.
<P>
	Public safety also means no one has the right to spread a 
health threatening virus. It is a legitimate purpose of law in this 
nation to protect individuals and communities from health 
threatening possibilities and the cost of HIV infection.
<P>
	Public safety also dictates this government maintain a public 
health system that will be available for our citizens. In 1992 the 
average demand on our health care system per citizen was 
$2,247. An individual with progressive HIV infection after 
seven to ten years will require an expenditure of $70,000 to 
$100,000 per year. Every HIV positive person who requires 
known medication will use up to 40 times the medical expense 
used for every Canadian.
<P>
	The unknowns of how HIV mutations will affect positive 
individuals and transmission of the virus from positive 
individuals to others are still being investigated. The total 
potential cost to the health care system by HIV positive 
individuals is not known.
<P>
	Whether we can afford this total cost when we all know cuts 
will be necessary to health care financing if Canada is to keep 
our health care system accessible to all is not known. All these 
issues concern public health and safety and must be stated to 
Canadians. I believe that Canadians have no argument with 
allowing immigrants and refugees to live in Canada if they will 
not be an unnecessary and extravagant drain on their tax dollars 
or a threat to their health. I believe allowing individuals into 
Canada without knowing who may spread the virus or whether 
their cost to the health care system may be so large that the 
majority of Canadians will be denied adequate health care 
assistance in the future is too great a risk for the majority of 
Canadians to accept.

<P>
	Since exposure to HIV infection may lead to AIDS which is 
plainly life threatening, it is a legitimate purpose of law to 
protect individuals, communities and this nation from the 
spread of the virus. That is why I support the member's bill 
requesting mandatory HIV testing for all immigrants and 
refugees entering Canada. I believe the majority of Canadians 
would agree with me.
<P>
	In 1968 my wife and I and my small child arrived in Canada. 
When we were at the immigration office it was explained that we 
had to have certain things in terms of money available and a few 
other things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Were you tested?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> If the member will be quiet for a minute I 
will tell him about the medical requirements.
<P>
	I was required to go the doctor as were my wife and baby. We 
were given probably one of the most thorough medical 
examinations we have every gone through with the clear 
understanding that if there was anything wrong, any medical 
reason from tuberculosis on down or any kind of heart disease 
problem, whatever it may be, it would be cause for grounds not 
to be able to enter this country.
<P>
	We accepted that as being wise. Had we not passed we would 
not have come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> They should have given you an attitude test.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Little boy, what are you going to be when 
you grow up?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Once again, it is just common sense that it 
was done. We accepted it and we are very grateful that we passed 
the test.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order. I think you would find unanimous 
consent of the House that we go to Statements by Ministers, 
interrupting whatever business may be in progress at one 
o'clock this day, as arranged.
<P>
	The proposal is that at one o'clock whatever business is 
before the House be then interrupted so that we can go 
Statements by Ministers for the purpose of allowing the Prime 
Minister to make a statement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter the debate on this motion by the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast. I congratulate the hon. member 
for bringing this matter to the House. I am certain that HIV 
testing is a major concern of most people in Canada.
<P>
	There is a great deal of concern about this disease. I believe 
the whole medical profession is evolving in its attitude toward 
the disease and in trying to find a cure for it.
<P>
	I can speak from personal knowledge because I watched the 
son of a friend die from this very debilitating disease. I watched 
that young man lose weight, go into trauma. It was a very 
traumatic experience for us all. The effect it has on families and 
friends cannot be measured by anyone who has not experienced 
that.
<P>
	In addition, I have also had the advantage of travelling around 
the world a bit. One country I was able to visit was Kenya. 
Kenya as some may know has a major problem with this disease, 
much more than we do. In some ways it has reached epidemic 
proportions in that country. In spite of my own experiences with 
the disease and watching people suffer from it, I have to reject 
the motion of my friend. I reject it not from an uncaring point of 
view but rather the importance of getting this thing right.
<P>
	In other words it is very important that we start monitoring 
our immigrant population coming into our country. However, 
we must get the system correct. By getting it right, I mean the 
minister is now conducting a review of this whole area. In that 
process he is consulting medical practitioners. He is basically 
trying to get the system correct from day one.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Most Canadians recognize this is a very serious disease. 
However, authorities are somewhat split on how important a 
disease it is and how it affects the host population. For instance, 
this disease cannot be spread by personal contact; most medical 
practitioners do not believe it has reached crisis proportions in 
our population and do not regard it as a serious public health or 
safety threat.
<P>
	Why is it important to get things right? This is the whole 
essence of this debate. It is not so much in monitoring our 
immigrant population, those coming into our country, but rather 
the effect we can have on the current population in recognizing 
this important disease.
<P>
	In looking at the Immigration Act, I note in 1952 that our 
country disallowed the admission of immigrant populations that 
were disabled for medical reasons. That was not that long ago. 
How would our resident population of disabled people feel when 
their own country denied access to this nation because people 
were disabled? I suggest that it would make them feel like 
second class citizens. Many in our population do have AIDS. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7402"> 7402 </A></B>
<P>
must use every resource we have to try to do away with this 
important disease.
<P>
	It is also crucial we do not give the opinion, from the 
government point of view, that there is something inordinately 
wrong with these people, that if they want to come into the 
country they would be denied, that they are second class 
citizens.
<P>
	I know that the disease itself, even in testing positive for HIV, 
does not mean that you have the disease. As a consequence, 
today as we talk, there is no clear way to effect the admissibility 
of immigrants coming into this population; there is no real way 
to measure whether they have the disease.
<P>
	I note that currently the practice is that where there is a 
suspicion of the disease, the authorities do require testing, and 
they do deny admissibility. However, it is done on a selective 
basis, it is not done on a comprehensive basis which maybe the 
hon. member had anticipated.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is very important that we get it right. I do not 
think we are really disagreeing with the importance of the 
monitoring process; what we are talking about is how to get it 
right. We have to get it right not only so that we monitor people 
coming into our country but we get it right in our attitude as to 
how to deal properly with this very important disease in our own 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the 
right of reply. I seek the unanimous consent of the House for a 
two-minute conclusion to this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me be helpful to you. 
The member for Durham had concluded his remarks. I assured 
myself that he has closed debate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Northeast who is the mover of 
this motion is asking the consent of the House, and I think in the 
spirit of this 35th session of Parliament that people agree-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House understands 
fully that the member is closing off debate. No one else will 
speak to this motion and the question will be put forthwith in 
two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
urge all members of the House to support this motion. It is time 
that we sent a strong, non-partisan, non-political message to the 
immigration minister and to the government. It is time to put 
Canadians first. It is time to enforce the preamble to the 
Immigration Act that charges us with responsibility for the 
protection and safety of Canadians.
<P>
	HIV-AIDS has been politicized. It has become a partisan 
issue and that is a crying shame. We tend to forget that the 
politics of this disease has prevented Canada from taking action 
to eliminate it. It has cost us untold numbers of lives.
<P>
	This motion does nothing more than extend Canada's 
regulations regarding the entry of people with serious 
transmittable diseases to the most serious transmittable  disease 
of all. That is not intolerance. That is not special interest 
pandering. It is not regressive. It is common sense.
<P>
	If we in the House have a duty to exercise leadership in the 
interests of doing right for Canadians we have a duty to do more 
than just pander to our respective blocks of voters. We have a 
duty to do more than gauge the winds of special interest opinion.
<P>
	This is what my colleague, the minister of immigration, has 
done for the past year. It has lead to a year of non-action, a year 
in which the legitimacy of our immigration program has been 
severely undermined. For immigration to continue in Canada it 
must have the support of the Canadian people. It must command 
respect. In order for it to command respect in the eyes of the 
public, the program must be seen to be protecting and furthering 
the needs and interests of Canadians.
<P>
	Protecting HIV-AIDS, giving it special status simply because 
of its politics is the very opposite to protecting the needs of 
Canadians. It must stop.
<P>
	The House should be in the business of creating and 
maintaining an immigration program that works for everyone. 
We can do nothing less.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 11.51 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 93, the time provided for debate has 
expired.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
being a private member's ballot item, there is an understanding 
that we will vote by rows as is traditionally done for private 
members' hour and not the system that is used for government 
bills.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7403"> 7403 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will be voting row by 
row. It should be a great way to start the week.
<P>
	As is the practice the division will be taken row by row, 
starting with the mover and then proceeding with those in favour 
of the motion sitting on the same side of the House as the mover; 
then those in favour of the motion sitting on the other side of the 
House will be called; and those opposed to the motion will be 
called in the same order.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANENVIRONMENTALASSESSMENTACT">CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill C-56 to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act be read a second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, we are debating today how to make 
good legislation even better. This bill sets out to improve one of 
the most outstanding environment acts in the world. With the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and its important 
amendments, Canada will be a world leader in environmental 
thinking and practice. We are also making this country a better 
place to be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7404"> 7404 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act was first 
planned by the current Leader of the Opposition in 1989 when he 
was Minister of the Environment. We were in opposition at the 
time. I was the Liberal critic for the environment.
<P>
	Our party supported the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean in 
his efforts and voted in favour of the act. We put aside our 
partisan differences and voted for legislation which was good 
for the environment and good for Canada.
<P>
	We supported the hon. member and wanted the law 
proclaimed. Indeed it was a red book promise because the law, 
as it previously existed, was complicated, arbitrary, 
unpredictable and incomplete.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We needed new legislation to simplify the process and 
strengthen it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We do not have 
French translation and cannot follow what the minister is saying 
in English.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will certainly look 
into this and take the necessary steps to remedy the problem. In 
the meantime, I would ask the hon. Minister of the Environment 
to carry on with her speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, the new law will ensure that the 
environmental impact of projects is taken into account before 
the projects go ahead. The new law nourishes and reinforces the 
link between environmental health, economic health and human 
health.
<P>
	The act finally addresses the important issues which are so 
crucial to Canada. The new system is straightforward and 
streamlined. Small scale, routine matters will be dealt with 
through a simple screening process. We do not need to spend 
taxpayers' money to hold a grand inquisition for repairs to the 
roof of a building.
<P>
	On the other hand, large projects or environmentally sensitive 
projects will receive the comprehensive public study they need. 
It is absolutely essential that projects in our national parks, 
nuclear power plants, dams, mines and new industrial 
developments undergo comprehensive environmental impact 
studies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The act introduces the new principle of mediation. To the 
extent possible, we want environmental problems to be resolved 
by consensus to everyone's satisfaction.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Screening, comprehensive study and mediation will eliminate 
the waste and bureaucracy that unfortunately sometimes results 
in much time being spent on minor or easily resolved issues.
<P>
	A project will only reach the stage of review by an 
independent public panel if there are difficult environmental 
issues which cannot be resolved in any other way. When the 
environmental impact is important enough to be subject to an 
independent review, the act allows for full public involvement 
and requires a more stringent assessment of the project.
<P>
	For all projects we want everything out in the open and we 
want to ensure that the public interest is paramount.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It comes as no surprise that, referring to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean said, back in December 1989: ``This will 
probably be the best legislation of the kind in the world''. No 
wonder that, last month, the Leader of the Opposition described 
this act as his baby, adding that he had fought very hard for it in 
cabinet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Maybe we should not be talking about babies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No wonder that the Leader of the Opposition said: ``I am not 
against this legislation. I never said a thing against it''. And the 
present Leader of the Opposition suggested last month: ``We 
must find a way to harmonize provincial and federal 
jurisdictions. These two levels of government have to work 
together, otherwise it will be chaos''.
<P>
	To opponents of the act, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
said in 1990: ``We have jurisdiction. We take our 
responsibilities. If work is carried out in James Bay that can 
affect the nature and composition of Hudson's Bay's water, the 
federal government has the right, indeed the duty, to stop work, 
otherwise the courts will step in''.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act emphasizes the 
importance of federal-provincial co-operation and the 
harmonization of our respective systems. I am committed to 
working with each of the provinces to that end.
<P>
	We are willing to work with the provinces; the federal 
government did in fact sign a harmonization agreement with 
Alberta, and next week I will sign a second agreement with 
Manitoba. We are also negotiating with Saskatchewan, British 
Columbia, Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7405"> 7405 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that everyone in this country is concerned about the 
environment. Whatever our political differences, we all want a 
livable world for our children. We may not always agree on the 
approach, but we want the same results. It was clearly stated in 
the red book that we would reinforce the power of review panels 
by letting Cabinet deal with federal projects, and I am going to 
go even further.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to quote from the red book: ``Individual 
Canadians have expertise and a valued perspective to contribute 
to environmental policy-making. These assets are often not 
tapped because of financial or legal restrictions. A Liberal 
government will amend the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act to legally recognize intervenor funding as an 
integral component of the assessment process''.
<P>
	These were public commitments. Today, we are delivering the 
goods.
<P>
	To those who are still questioning the act, I will quote the 
Leader of the Opposition, when he was talking about the old 
offer: ``Current guidelines are not clear regarding 
federal-provincial co-operation on joint assessments''. We are 
aware of the need for clarification and we are working on it. The 
result can be seen today. That is why we have this bill today.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I urge the Opposition to listen carefully to what Lucien 
Bouchard said about the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act: ``This bill does not encroach on provincial jurisdiction''. It 
was not the current Minister of the Environment but the former 
Minister of the Environment-when he was a federal Cabinet 
minister-who said that we must ensure that there is no 
encroachment and step up harmonization efforts in order to 
avoid overlap.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For the last year the federal government has met with and 
listened to Canadians, environmentalists, communities, 
businesses and individuals. They have asked us to act further to 
improve the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and we 
have listened in good faith. The amendments we are introducing 
today are proof of that good faith.
<P>
	The bill we are debating today proposes to entrench in federal 
law the principle of one project one assessment. It is wrong that 
responsible businesses may be subjected to more than one 
federal assessment for their project.
<P>
	We need a strong, open public environmental assessment 
process but we do not need it repeated and repeated and 
repeated. Today's legislation commits us to ending confusion 
and overlap and to reducing cost and complexity.
<P>
	The second amendment guarantees that communities will 
receive the support they need to take part in major 
environmental assessments. Local communities with a direct 
stake in the outcome of an environmental  assessment must have 
the resources to participate if their rights are to have any real 
meaning. I use the example under the past process of Elliot Lake 
which obviously had a very direct interest in how the operations 
of Denison were decommissioned.
<P>
	The last amendment requires the federal cabinet to respond to 
any recommendations of independent review panels. This 
means that no individual cabinet minister can overrule the 
environmental assessment made by an independent panel. This 
means that no Kemano projects can be signed behind closed 
doors. This means that as a government we are willing to be fair, 
to open up the process, to simplify the process, to listen to 
concerns and ultimately to take a full cabinet decision. Once 
again we have built it into the law in black and white.
<P>
	We are not only talking about our belief in the principle of one 
project one assessment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is not only about the right of people from Chicoutimi, the 
Abitibi region, Quebec City or Montreal to have their say on 
environmental assessments. The bill establishes a participant 
funding program to help people who do not have the necessary 
financial resources exercise this right. How can anyone accuse 
the federal government of undermining the environmental rights 
of the people from the Lac-Saint-Jean region, when we give 
them the funds they need to participate in the environmental 
assessments of the projects affecting them?
<P>
	This amendment has nothing to do with Ottawa politicians 
trying to impose their views. Rather, it is aimed, as the Leader of 
the Opposition realized, at giving the people from the 
Lac-Saint-Jean region the power to tell the federal government 
what they think about a federal project. It is aimed at giving the 
people from the Lac-Saint-Jean region the ability to influence 
federal decisions affecting them directly in their daily lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are not just talking about ending backroom pressures to 
overturn environmental assessment. We have introduced 
legislation to take away the ability of any individual cabinet 
minister to overturn those decisions. We have introduced 
legislation to make sure that the recommendations of 
independent panels cannot be shoved on to the back burner.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The new law puts the onus on cabinet to respond to those 
recommendations. In the name of fairness and openness and in 
order to make sure that everything is completely transparent, we 
are acting to make sure that the whole government by virtue of 
cabinet is responsible for environmental assessment decisions.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, this bill recognizes the essential federal role in 
environmental assessment. As the Leader of the Opposition said 
so well: ``The federal government certainly has some powers 
which no one contests''. For example, the bed of Hudson Bay 
belongs to the federal government. This would not change. So as 
I said and I repeat, if work goes on in James Bay which affects 
the nature and composition of the water emptying into Hudson 
Bay so that marine or other life in Hudson Bay could be affected, 
the federal government has the right and even the duty to act; 
otherwise, the courts will stop the work.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition understands the law well and he 
was right when he described some federal responsibilities. It is 
not only legal; it is a matter of environmental reality. When you 
throw something into Hudson Bay, it affects northern Quebec. 
When you throw something into Hamilton Bay, it affects 
Montreal. Consider the International Joint Commission for the 
Great Lakes; what we do in these Great Lakes obviously affects 
the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	If a project on the north shore of Lake Superior is an 
environmental disaster, the problems end up not only in the 
Great Lakes but also in the St. Lawrence and the people of 
Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Quebec City and Rimouski suffer as a 
result. Environmental blunders in the Great Lakes affect 
Magdalen Islanders. Environmental problems do not respect 
borders. We have no choice but to face up to our shared 
environmental responsibilities. We must all come to an 
understanding here in Canada. The federal and provincial 
governments must work together, despite our political 
differences, to solve these problems, for the greater well-being 
of our people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is for the good of the people that we have to set aside our 
political differences, set aside our political agendas, and 
understand the point made by the Leader of the Opposition when 
he was in government and said the time had come to end the 
duplication and confusion that surrounded the EARP guidelines.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must present a common front internationally to solve 
global environmental problems. We must work together to solve 
our common problems with the United States. We must work 
together to solve our problems in the Pacific, the Atlantic and 
the Arctic.
<P>
	We have acted, we are acting and we will act to put in place 
what the Leader of the Opposition has rightly called absolutely 
major legislation. We must go further. We must overcome our 
differences and find a way to reach agreement. I am counting on 
my colleagues in the Official Opposition to support the bill 
initiated by their own leader, which will benefit all the people of 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Sound environmental practices are essential if we are to move 
to the day when pollution prevention becomes a central part of 
our thinking. Sound practices are essential in planning projects 
which are environmentally and economically sound. Sound 
practices are essential to planning and creating a better future.
<P>
	The legislation does not solve every environmental problem 
in the country. We will need to fine tune the legislation. That is 
why we have a one-year monitoring program in place. If there 
are real problems, let us move to solve them. If we can make 
more improvements, let us move ahead. If we can find new ways 
of eliminating overlap, of saving taxpayers' money, and of 
co-operating and harmonizing our efforts, let us do it.
<P>
	The bill moves forward the federal government's 
commitment in meeting our obligation to the environment 
which all of us share and which all of us cherish. Not only does 
the act move in that direction, but certainly the amendments we 
are discussing today speak very specifically to making the law 
workable for all Canadians in the interests of a sustainable 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-56, an Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, which was announced on October 6, is now at second 
reading.
<P>
	This legislation includes three amendments to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, as announced by the minister 
on October 6. That announcement almost went unnoticed, since 
the paper on social program reform had been tabled the day 
before. The minister's decision to make the announcement on 
that day was obviously an attempt to create a diversion, given 
the controversy generated by the reform proposal tabled by her 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The method used by the minister can certainly not be called 
transparent and open. On that day, the minister announced a 
piece of legislation which was first developed in 1990 when our 
current leader, who was then Minister of the Environment, 
tabled Bill C-78 on the environmental assessment process. That 
legislation was reintroduced in May 1991 as Bill C-13. In 
December of the same year, a legislative committee made over 
150 amendments to the original bill. Several provisions and 
clauses were deleted, reworded or added.
<P>
	However, the flexibility which had characterized Bill C-78 
had completely disappeared and been replaced by a very strict 
legislative intent. Moreover, one of these amendments, which 
affirms the federal government's intention to promote 
sustainable development, clearly indicates that the federal 
government considers itself the sole responsible for the renewal 
of resources, even though these fall under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7407"> 7407 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-13 was passed by Parliament in June 1992. The long 
delay before the proclamation of the bill was due to the need to 
draft the regulations required to implement the act, and also to 
the desire of the current Minister of the Environment to 
introduce the amendments which we are now examining at 
second reading.
<P>
	Following all these changes, it is clear that the current 
centralizing vision does not agree with the original legislation 
tabled by our leader when he was Minister of the Environment. 
In an article published in <I>Le Devoir</I> on April 1, 1992, Mr. Michel 
Yergeau, a prominent lawyer specializing in environmental law, 
reminded those who were trying to justify federal interference in 
fields of provincial jurisdiction by invoking the fact that the 
original legislation had been drafted under Mr. Bouchard's 
responsibility, that the then Minister of the Environment was 
very aware of the constitutional realities imposed by the nature 
of environmental problems.
<P>
	Mr. Yergeau quoted part of a speech made by the Leader of the 
Opposition who stated that in the grey areas, where the 
Constitution does not clearly define the role of each of the 
stakeholders, we must have co-operation. He added that, at a 
time when we realize that the debate on the environment is the 
fight for life itself and that this fight must be taken up by the 
whole world, and not affect only our own jurisdictions, our 
constituents would not understand and even less tolerate a 
wrestling match between federal and provincial politicians.
<P>
	Moreover, the spirit of the ruling by the Supreme Court in 
1992, in the Oldman River case, essentially boiled down to 
respect for provincial jurisdictions. The Court ruled that the 
assessment process provided for by the order did not apply to 
projects undertaken pursuant to federal legislation, and I quote: 
``On the issue of the positive obligation to regulate, Mr. Justice 
LaForest indicated that it was not intended that the guidelines 
order be applied every time a project could have an 
environmental impact of an area of federal jurisdiction''. He 
added: ``The federal minister or the panel cannot use the 
guidelines order as a disguised tool to impinge on areas under 
provincial jurisdiction that have nothing to do with the relevant 
field of federal jurisdiction''.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We must admit that all the amendments made to this 
legislation between the time it was first introduced and the time 
it was enacted changed completely the spirit of the reform 
proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in 1989. Bill C-78 was 
designed to harmonize the assessment processes and not to put 
under federal supervision the processes already in place in 
Quebec and in other provinces.
<P>
	Despite these revealing statements on the true spirit and 
purpose of the original bill, the minister jumped on the 
opportunity to give credit to the Leader of the Official 
Opposition for this legislation. In fact, the minister always uses 
this defensive strategy when we ask questions regarding 
environmental matters that date back to the period when our 
leader was Minister of the Environment. Could it be that the 
minister is looking for a good example or even for a guide to 
help her run her department? If she continues to link everything 
she does to our leader, Canadians will wonder whether our 
leader is still running this department or whether he has simply 
become the minister's mentor.
<P>
	But knowing the minister and her political ways, which are 
always of a partisan nature, we have to conclude that this is just a 
strategy to slow down the Official Opposition. She uses the 
alleged inaction of her predecessors to try and justify her own 
incompetence.
<P>
	The minister obviously thinks that she just has to refer to our 
leader's past and we will buy everything she wants to sell us, but 
she is wrong. We will reject all of her proposals that do not 
respect the environment and we will protest against any 
infringement on the provinces' jurisdiction. Already, in 1992, 
the Bloc had expressed its strong opposition to Bill C-13 
because it did not recognize the existence of a provincial 
environmental assessment process in Quebec. I also want to 
remind the minister that the Bloc Quebecois made a biting reply 
to the promulgation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act.
<P>
	I also remind her that the government of Quebec reacted the 
same way. Mr. Jacques Brassard, provincial Minister of the 
Environment, even withdrew Quebec's representatives from 
federal-provincial discussions. The new Quebec environment 
minister described this new federal environmental assessment 
process as an arrogant attempt at displacing Quebec from that 
jurisdiction. He went on to say that this is precisely what 
business people were asking his government to avoid, that 
business executives think having two assessment processes will 
be a disaster for the Quebec economy.
<P>
	The Quebec minister states that developers of all kinds will be 
faced with two processes having two different sets of 
requirements. He said: ``It is clearly unacceptable to Quebec. It 
smacks of provocation, arrogance and lack of respect for 
Quebec''.
<P>
	As I already indicated, Quebec announced it was pulling out 
of discussions initiated by the federal government on 
environmental requirements harmonization because those 
discussions are a sham. The Quebec minister said: ``They have 
gone too far. This bill is a deliberate act of provocation on the 
part of the federal government against the new sovereignist 
government in Quebec. It amounts to putting the province under 
a kind of guardianship''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7408"> 7408 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal minister nonetheless proclaims a so-called new 
era of co-operation, but it is nothing but window dressing. It 
clearly demonstrates the centralist vision of the federal 
government. Certain provinces are used to justify the use of 
strong-arm tactics against other provinces. The federal 
government signs agreements with some provinces, Alberta and 
Manitoba in this case, indicates that negotiations are under way 
with five more provinces and, all of a sudden, introduces a bill.
<P>
	The wall-to-wall theory is used. The Canada-wide approach 
is made to apply. National standards are implemented without 
any regard for what is already being done in some provinces or 
territories. The federal bulldozer starts rolling before 
discussions with the provinces are completed. That is precisely 
the attitude provinces reject and the public no longer accepts.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, ever since they came to office the Liberals 
have done nothing but centralize and encroach upon provincial 
jurisdiction. The Liberals still believe in a Canada that is the 
same from one end to the other, wrapped in the same red tapestry 
made from a book of the same colour on which the members 
opposite have fed abundantly during the last electoral campaign. 
However, as time passes, colour and direction are changing.
<P>
	Take for example the last green, mauve and grey books that 
this government made public with great pomp. Their projects 
and propositions once more target ordinary Canadians and show 
this government's determination to encroach upon provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This bill on environmental assessment is no exception to the 
rule of this overbearing and totalitarian federalism, as the 
former Liberal Environment Minister of Quebec, Mr. Pierre 
Paradis, called it. Coming from a convinced and orthodox 
federalist, from the same party as hon. members opposite, that 
says it all. May I remind you that Mr. Paradis came before the 
Senate to try to stop the passing of the bill introduced by then 
minister Charest, implementing the federal environmental 
assessment process. The minister said that Bill C-13 was 
trespassing dangerously on Quebec's preserves.
<P>
	He also said that this bill would allow the federal government 
to encroach upon a provincial jurisdiction. He believed Ottawa 
could, from then on, intervene any time it wished to assess a 
Quebec project that could have an environmental impact.
<P>
	This true federalist said that Bill C-13 would allow the use of 
every available lever to submit as many projects as possible to 
the federal assessment process and even to control all aspects of 
assessments done by another jurisdiction. He also said that the 
federal process would constantly interfere with Quebec 
procedure.
<P>
	The person who said those things in 1992 was not a member of 
the P.Q. or the Bloc, not a separatist. He was a Grit, a Liberal, a 
federalist, just like the Minister of the Environment and the 
government.
<P>
	On November 22, 1991, Mr. Paradis wrote to his old friend in 
Ottawa, minister Charest, the present member for Sherbrooke. 
He wrote: ``Bill C-13, in its present form, far from clarifying the 
situation, allows for a useless encroachment of the federal 
assessment process on decisions which fall exclusively under 
Quebec's jurisdiction, and this can only lead to a wasteful 
duplication of assessment processes and, inevitably, to 
numerous conflicts''.
<P>
	The federalist Quebec minister said he wished that Ottawa 
would recognize and respect the process used by the provinces 
to assess environmental impacts, something clearly under their 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It was not a P.Q. member who said that, that was not an evil 
separatist, it was a federalist who wanted the federal 
government to stay in Ottawa and look after its own affairs.
<P>
	In another letter addressed to another minister of the 
Conservative government of the time-we should probably say 
of the era, since this party has virtually disappeared from the 
map-Minister Paradis wrote on December 17, 1990: ``-the 
bill raises important constitutional questions and many 
implementation problems''. He was saying clearly that the 
federal government had no business saying it had to protect the 
environment when trying to regulate areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This legislation would mean that all Quebec projects would be 
submitted to a federal environmental assessment. Minister 
Paradis was concerned about wasteful and costly duplication 
and delays, since the federal process would be added on to the 
Quebec process.
<P>
	Finally, in the March 17, 1994 issue of <I>Le Journal de 
Montréal</I>, federalist Quebec minister Pierre Paradis was quoted 
as saying on the question of environmental assessments: ``We 
have to harmonize the two legislations in order to have a single 
window, predominantly under Quebec control, for 
environmental assessment''. And he added: ``Quebec maintains 
that its jurisdiction must be protected and that it should be in 
charge''.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The minister was here on March 17, 1994. How could she 
ignore a Quebec federalist minister's request?
<P>
	A lawyer, Michel Yergeau, was of the same opinion when he 
wrote the following in the April 1, 1992 issue of the daily <I>Le 
Devoir</I>: ``It is not because Ottawa has taken over a matter which 
demands a global approach and knows no boundaries that it can 
altogether disregard the Constitution. With Bill C-13, Ottawa 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7409"> 7409 </A></B>
<P>
uses its  authority and unilaterally settles matters in its favour, 
of course''.
<P>
	He then adds: ``To justify such abruptness, Ottawa puts 
forward the pressing need to protect the environment in its areas 
of jurisdiction. The net result of this unilateral exercise is not 
and cannot be good. It must be reviewed and refined''. I repeat: 
``It must be reviewed and refined''.
<P>
	The way things are at the present time, C-13 is just plain raw 
material the courts will have to refine on a case by case basis, 
which can only create a lot of resentment. In the long run, the 
whole exercise will be more time-consuming than sitting at the 
bargaining table to settle this issue once and for all. This is a real 
timebomb the federal government has planted in the Canadian 
legislation. This is also a further threat to the constitutional 
reconciliation the government yearns for. It is not even good for 
the environment.
<P>
	This is a rather serious statement on the part of an 
environmental lawyer. It seems to me that the minister should 
take heed.
<P>
	Mr. Yergeau says that Ottawa ignores the Constitution. He 
talks about the abruptness of the federal government. He thinks 
Ottawa is setting a time bomb in the Canadian legislation. The 
members opposite who believe in federalism should be very 
concerned by these statements. They should at least wonder 
about the impact their actions could have on the system they so 
implicitly believe in. It is totally illogical to in such a manner as 
to destroy a federal system you trust so much.
<P>
	Of course, we in the Bloc feel that this suits our purpose. If 
you go on like this, there will come a time in 1995 when 
Quebecers will tell you: We see what you are after and you can 
just go back to Ottawa. From now on, we will do our own thing. 
This is just perfect. Carry on like you have been doing. All that 
is grist to our mill.
<P>
	In an article published in <I>Le Devoir</I> on March 21, 1992, Lise 
Bissonnette said that the passage of the Act to establish a federal 
environmental assessment process was a kind of takeover. She 
indicated that Bill C-13 added to the Quebec-Canada problem 
that has yet to be solved, since it looks a lot like the 
Constitutional issue that it exacerbates while giving a lesson to 
Quebec. All the elements are there.
<P>
	Lise Bissonnette compared Bill C-13 to an enormous 
machine that can assess absolutely everything, including the 
areas most obviously under provincial jurisdiction. She also 
said that the terms and conditions of future federal-provincial 
agreements would ensure that the provincial process is subject 
to the federal process, even though Ottawa only had a small say 
in this area.
<P>
	More far-sighted, Ms. Bissonnette declared that Ottawa was 
giving itself the power to jeopardize Quebec's whole energy 
policy and thus its choices for economic development.
<P>
	Finally, she concluded her article by saying that Ottawa, by 
giving itself such wide, preponderant power that could take 
many shapes and forms, would control not only the quality of 
life but also a large part of economic development.
<P>
	Today, the minister and the federal government are faced with 
the clear consensus in Quebec against the CEAA. The Quebec 
Liberal Party, the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois all 
expressed their strong opposition to this Act. But no matter what 
we do or say, the federal government will go ahead. Should we 
take comfort in realizing that such lack of understanding and 
respect leads to separation? As it did so many times in the past, 
the federal government leaves Quebec no choice. It is a take it or 
leave it situation. Quebecers will have to choose soon. That is 
what some people involved or interested in this issue said at the 
time.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know that I must stop here. Will I be allowed to 
continue later?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, yes, according to the Clerk, 
it seems that you have a few minutes left. I would also ask you to 
always address the Chair, not the members opposite.
<P>
	It being one o'clock, pursuant to the order made earlier today 
with unanimous consent, the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Ministers.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government has set high standards of integrity and 
probity for itself. I have made integrity a number one priority 
personnaly.
<P>
	I have said it before, and I will say it again: Setting such 
standards for the holders of public office is essential in renewing 
and maintaining the faith of Canadians in their public 
instructions.
<P>
	This is the case in particular of ministers who must remain 
above reproach at all times and in all of their activities, whether 
it be as ministers, members of Parliament or private citizens. 
That is the burden of public office, and one that we all gladly 
accept to bear.
<P>
	Last week, the actions of the Minister of Heritage were 
discussed in this House. Legitimate concerns were raised which 
we all share.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7410"> 7410 </A></B>
<P>
	Everyone understands the rule that no one is to call judges 
concerning cases they have under consideration. This applies to 
everyone-ministers, MPs and ordinary citizens.
<P>
	The rule concerning relations with the judiciary is 
unequivocal and has been in force for over 10 years. No minister 
may communicate with members of the judiciary concerning 
any matter which they have before them in their judicial 
capacities, except through the Minister of Justice or through 
duly authorized officials of, or counsel acting for, that minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But the situation is not as clear with administrative tribunals. 
The guidance we gave ministers in this area was that on those 
rare occasions when any minister might wish to communicate 
with members of the quasi-judicial bodies concerning any 
matter which they have before them in their judicial capacities, 
they should only do so through the duly authorized officials.
<P>
	In addition to considering quasi-judicial matters, these 
bodies may consider a whole range of administrative, regulatory 
and policy matters.
<P>
	Even in relation to quasi-judicial matters before them, 
administrative tribunals defer from the courts. As part of the 
decision making process, some tribunals welcome 
representations from ordinary citizens and members of 
Parliament. These representations are put on the public record.
<P>
	When a representation is sent to the CRTC it is a public 
document. For example from September 1993 to October 1994 
the CRTC held 18 public hearings. It received 15,422 letters in 
support of licence applicants. Seventy-two were from members 
of Parliament, from all parties in this House. Representations 
were made by many Liberal members, including ministers, 
members from the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party, the NDP, 
the Conservatives, and one independent.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Clearly we are not confronted with anything like calling a 
judge. What we are dealing with is the dilemma of ministers who 
also must fulfil their duties as members of Parliament who were 
elected to represent their constituents. That makes this whole 
area of relationships with administrative tribunals much more 
complex than with the courts.
<P>
	I have learned a lesson too. This government has done a lot to 
give our ministers clear guidelines to do their jobs and avoid 
conflict of interest, including the historic ethics package we 
introduced in June. But now it is plain to me that the guidelines 
for dealing with administrative tribunals were not clear or 
complete enough.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last Thursday, after Question Period, I gave instructions that 
all ministers and secretaries of State review their files and the 
operation of their offices to establish whether there existed any 
other cases like that  of the Minister of Heritage, not only with 
respect to the CRTC but also with respect to other administrative 
tribunals.
<P>
	We have found several cases of a similar nature:
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and immigration, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, the Minister of Indian and Northern 
Affairs and the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa 
have each written, over the last year, to the CRTC in support of 
license applicants. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has 
also written on behalf of his constituents to a number of 
administrative agencies, including the Pensions Plan Review 
Tribunal and a board of referees concerning unemployment 
insurance benefits, as he has always done during his long career 
as member of this House.
<P>
	This is what we know so far. There may be others. But whether 
there are five or a hundred, the issue is the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Prime Minister I am dealing with ministers who did not act 
for personal gain, who did not act for partisan purposes. In each 
case they acted in good faith for their constituents. Let us put 
what they did into perspective. There is no scandal here, no 
violation of integrity, and no breach of public trust.
<P>
	How did this happen? I believe it is because we have not been 
clear in distinguishing between the role of a cabinet minister and 
members of Parliament in our guidelines when it comes to 
dealing with administrative tribunals. The government bears 
responsibility for that, and so do I.
<P>
	I promised Canadians we would provide an honest 
government and we have. I promised them we would provide an 
open and accountable government and we have. But I did not, 
and never could promise an infallible government.
<P>
	I said before that this government will make mistakes, but 
they will be honest mistakes and we will always move to correct 
them. That is what we are doing today.
<P>
	On Friday I gave instructions for more complete guidelines to 
be developed in consultation with the ethics counsellor to ensure 
that ministers deal with administrative tribunals in an 
appropriate manner. This morning I wrote to each minister and 
secretary of state instructing them that until the new guidelines 
were in place all dealings with administrative tribunals must be 
done through the ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At Cabinet tomorrow, I will be reviewing the whole issue with 
ministers. No one wants to disenfranchise the constituents of a 
minister.

<P>
	For example, on Saturday morning, I spent three hours in my 
riding of Saint-Maurice receiving my constituents. I even 
received some constituents from an opposition riding, 
Trois-Rivières. The Chamber of Commerce and mayor of 
Trois-Rivières came to see me. It is not even in my riding, but I 
thought that as minister responsible for the region, I would not 
punish the mayor who wanted to see me and just tell him to go 
and see his Bloc Quebecois member; because he wanted to see 
me, I received him.
<P>
	Was I wrong? Was I right? I think that it is part of my duty to 
receive, as much as possible, people who want to see me. On the 
other hand, no one wants ministers to unduly influence 
administrative agencies. The challenge is to strike the right 
balance in imposing constraints on a minister that are not 
imposed on an ordinary member of Parliament.
<P>
	Staff for ministers and secretaries of state will also be briefed. 
Finally, I believe this is a matter of legitimate debate and I 
undertake to hold a debate in the House of Commons before 
these guidelines are finalized. All members of this House have a 
responsibility to put my ministers-and me personally-under 
the closest possible scrutiny. We welcome that scrutiny, but that 
does not mean turning legitimate concerns into matters of 
scandal where none exists.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All my career I have believed that honesty is the best policy, 
that a government and a Prime Minister must level with 
Canadians, tell them the truth, and treat them with the respect 
and intelligence they deserve. That is what I am doing here 
today. I am proud of this government's record of honesty and 
integrity. We have worked hard to earn it. But honesty and 
integrity also mean facing up to moments like this. That is the 
responsibility that this government and I will never betray.
<P>
	One of the values of our parliamentary system and our 
administrative system that is very important to me is that all 
cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister, must first be 
elected in a riding where he or she is seeking the support and 
confidence of thousands of people like any other member of 
Parliament. After that he or she becomes the Prime Minister or 
is called to serve in the cabinet. The first duty of all of us is to 
make sure that the people who have voted for us are duly 
represented in this House of Commons and that their interests 
are defended. It is difficult sometimes.
<P>
	For example when I was member for Beauséjour and Leader 
of the Opposition, a group decided to close a radio station. A 
representation was made before me. Some local people said: 
``We want to keep a radio station in operation in Shawinigan. 
Will you support us to get a licence if it is closed?''. It was not in 
my riding but I knew these people. They knew there was interest 
in keeping a radio station operating in Shawinigan and I  told 
them I would support them. They were in the business and 
wanted to buy the assets and operate it.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately somebody else bought the station and I did not 
have to support them. However, the local citizens of my riding 
wanted to keep a radio station in operation. They thought a 
person like me who was still a member of Parliament could help 
them to maintain a link of communication for the local citizens 
through a radio station. That is the type of thing and that is done 
in public.
<P>
	A letter that a member of Parliament or a minister writes to 
the CRTC is not a private letter. It is not a confidential letter. All 
these letters are public documentation in a public trial that 
everybody can look at, just like the 14,000 people who wrote in 
support of applications.
<P>
	When I asked my ministers-there may be a couple of others, 
I do not know who wrote letters like that in support of 
applications-I found that one of them, the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans, wrote in support of francophones in his riding who 
want to make sure that all the news programs for French news 
are accessible to the francophones of his riding.
<P>
	Apparently he wrote too late, but the reality is that he was 
representing the interests of a little group of francophones 
isolated in the southwest corner of Newfoundland who wanted 
to communicate with people who speak French, the other 
official language of Canada, at home as completely as possible.
<P>
	I am happy to report what I have been able to gather over the 
weekend to clarify the situation. From here on, while we are 
developing the proper guidelines, ministers will have to keep in 
mind all the time that we are members of Parliament and we are 
at the same time ministers and what are due or undue public 
interventions such as those I have mentioned.
<P>
	I think it was in response to requests by their constituents in 
open fashion in open files. That is why I did not ask anybody to 
do anything. However, we will give proper guidelines after I 
hope a debate in this House of Commons so that the members of 
Parliament can tell us how to resolve this obligation to serve the 
nation as a minister and to serve the people who have voted for 
these ministers before they were called upon to serve in the 
cabinet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With leave of the House, I would like to table a copy of the 
letters that ministers have written to the CRTC. These are public 
letters whose release in no way violates people's right to 
privacy. I would like to table these letters immediately.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has just reiterated his 
commitment to integrity and ethics in government.
<P>
	We salute these noble remarks, which he has repeated on 
many occasions, notably during his assessment of his 
government's performance in the past year. But I would daresay 
that last week, the Prime Minister, who was preparing for 
situations in which he would have to rigorously demonstrate his 
commitment to ethics, faced for the first time-after giving 
many speeches and making numerous commitments to uphold 
public integrity; and we understand how difficult it must have 
been for him-a situation in which he had to make a decision 
and translate talk into action.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	With all due respect, I submit that for an honest leader of the 
government like the Prime Minister-which is something I 
recognize and congratulate him for; I think having an honest 
leader of the government is encouraging to all of us and 
important to all citizens-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> -it was an opportunity for the Prime 
Minister to go beyond his role as party leader and fully assume 
his primary responsibilities as leader of the government, namely 
being a vigilant and ruthless-repeat, ruthless-guardian of 
ethical standards. He had an opportunity to make an example, to 
ensure the continuity of ethical standards that have always been 
followed by Canadian government leaders by asking his 
minister to resign. I understand how difficult it must be. I 
understand how difficult it must be, especially when there is a 
personal relationship-as often happens within political 
parties-between individuals who work together for a while in 
the public interest. But one must sometimes look beyond 
personal relationships with fellow party members when 
fundamental values are at stake. I say that the Prime Minister-I 
say it with as much restraint as I can-failed his first test in 
honouring his commitment to integrity.
<P>
	Let us have a quick look at the facts. On March 15, the 
Minister of Heritage wrote the Chairman of the CRTC to, I say, 
support a licence application. My claim is strengthened by the 
fact that the addressee himself wrote that he saw this letter, this 
action, as a letter of support. This is in the public file. On March 
29, a letter thanking the minister for his support was put in the 
file. It was perfectly normal to think that the letter was one of 
support, since the minister was requesting that due 
consideration be given to the application, asking the CRTC to 
keep him abreast of any developments in the matter. Indeed, the 
minister, who is the CRTC's boss, asked to be kept informed 
about an application in which he had such an interest that he 
wrote a letter about it. Moreover, the minister offered, in 
writing, to provide any additional information the CRTC might 
have required.
<P>
	It took six months for the Minister of Canadian Heritage to 
feel somewhat remorseful, decide to apologize and write to the 
CRTC to say that the March letter was not intended to convey 
support to the application. This is what the minister did. A 
minister's actions are judged by the Prime Minister. One of the 
duties of the Prime Minister is to ensure that ministers behave 
properly and comply with his own code of ethics and principles 
of integrity.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was, to say the least, slow to react, since 
he found out on October 1 what happened but did nothing for a 
whole month. He waited until the whole issue became public and 
there is every reason to believe that we would never have known 
about this violation of basic rules of ethics for ministers if the 
letter had not been made public. The Prime Minister waited until 
the whole thing became public to suddenly start saying that this 
was an unacceptable mistake. It was too little too late on the 
Prime Minister's part.
<P>
	What is he doing now? Today, the Prime Minister is drawing a 
fine line between judicial and administrative tribunals. The 
Prime Minister is a lawyer. He has always been in public life and 
he knows public law. He is perfectly aware that a large number 
of decisions made by the CRTC fall under the jurisdiction of 
ordinary courts of law. What makes a tribunal a tribunal is that it 
makes decisions on rights, on their delegation and creation, on 
disputes, and on complaints or penal complaints and charges.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The CRTC does more than determine policy. It acts as a 
judicial tribunal when applying the law. It makes decisions 
based on civil, financial and public law that directly affect 
Canadians, since these decisions concern the management of all 
aspects of broadcasting and telecommunications. It is also 
empowered to deal with complaints.
<P>
	In this respect, the CRTC is subject to the same arm's length 
rules as judicial tribunals, and I would say even more so, 
because these quasi-judicial bodies have become so important 
that very often, the decisions they make are more important than 
the judgments of a civil court. For instance, the CRTC has the 
authority to decide whether or not a company will go bankrupt 
and whether a broadcasting or telephone monopoly will be 
awarded to one company rather than another. We all know that 
the financial stakes may be considerable, and citizens are 
directly affected by the implications, so these decisions are 
crucial.
<P>
	One can hardly stand up in this House especially when as 
Leader of the Government, one is thoroughly familiar with the 
situation, and claim that an administrative tribunal is less 
important than a judicial tribunal and that the strictly arm's 
length relationship that must exist to ensure the independence of 
judicial tribunals does not necessarily apply to tribunals like the 
CRTC. The distinction does not hold water.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7413"> 7413 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the Prime Minister's attitude today is rather 
surprising. Here we have the holder of the highest office in our 
parliamentary democracy, who already made an extremely 
controversial decision not to accept the minister's resignation, 
although most newspapers who carried editorials on this issue 
asked for the minister's resignation and criticized the Prime 
Minister for not demanding that resignation, and now, today or 
yesterday, I am not sure which, but some day we may find out, 
the Prime Minister hears there were four other cases in addition 
to this one.
<P>
	And today, he comes before us, neither repentant nor deeply 
apologetic, and refers to the fact that four other ministers were 
involved as an extenuating circumstance, as though there were 
safety in numbers.
<P>
	Third, we have the Prime Minister making this incredible 
distinction, while at the same time muddying the waters with 
respect to the duties of members and ministers. I submit that the 
Prime Minister did Canadian democracy and the public 
perception of Canada's democratic institutions a great 
disservice when he appeared to erase the fine line between the 
duties of members and ministers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows perfectly well that this entire 
debate is about the fundamental principle of the separation of 
powers. Our democratic institutions are all founded on the 
separation of powers: the legislative power, the judicial power 
and the executive power. The walls that separate these powers 
from one another are absolutely solid and impenetrable, because 
democracy requires us to dilute power and thus prevent the 
concentration of all these powers in one person, which is how 
dictatorships are born.
<P>
	A strict division of powers is essential to the development of 
democracy, respect of civil rights and operation of public 
liberties. A minister cannot encroach on the judiciary. Why? 
Why is the rule so strict? Why is it that we do not have to prove 
dishonesty? Why is it that we do not have to prove corruption? 
How come the simple fact of over-stepping this boundary 
carries a sanction? Why? Because the principle to be protected 
is absolute, it is the principle of the judiciary's independence.
<P>
	Democracy rests, first and foremost, on the rule of law. We all 
know that when the state violates the rights of an individual, 
when two individuals disagree, instead of resorting to violence 
or some other manifestation unacceptable in a democracy, we go 
before a wiseperson, someone totally independent, appointed 
for life, who will render a decision we can trust. I think that this 
country should pay tribute to the quality of its tribunals.
<P>
	All governments try their best to make sure they only appoint 
to the bench people with an impeccable reputation, competent 
and honest. This is a rule which, up to now, has been observed by 
all parties. This is vital, because the day the judiciary is 
compromised, democracy as we know it will be over, we will not 
be able to resolve  anything in a proper manner. Therefore, we 
have to respect judicial powers and we have to recognize the 
necessity of a separation of powers.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister tries to pretend that there is no 
difference between the job of an MP and the job of a minister, he 
confuses two other powers, he crosses in an unacceptable 
manner the line separating the executive and legislative 
branches.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	When a MP is chosen to be a minister, he enters a new phase, 
crosses the line between the executive and the legislative and is 
asked to behave with great rigour so as to respect the separation 
between both duties, both categories.
<P>
	If a member is unable to understand that the fact of becoming 
a minister adds to his duties the obligation of being rigorous and 
respectful of these fundamental rules, he should not be a 
minister, he does not have the skills to be one, and should either 
resign or be dismissed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>All these lame attempts at comparing him 
with an opposition member, even a government member who 
would intercede with an administrative tribunal on his 
constituents' behalf, do not wash because the Leader of the 
Opposition does not belong to the executive. The Leader of the 
Opposition is confined to legislative work and to representing 
his constituents. The Prime Minister knows full well that he 
twisted the facts, distorted these institutions when he confused 
both.
<P>
	Do we really need new rules? Do we need to tell you that a 
minister who has broken the aforementioned rules must resign? 
There are many precedents, and in a British judicial system such 
as ours, precedents make the rule.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs knows full well that he cannot 
contact judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals. He did it once and 
had to resign. The member for Sherbrooke knows it too, he 
learned it at his expense.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. The right hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, he should stop 
lying to the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. As you know, dear colleagues, it is 
unacceptable in this House to ascribe one member's motives to 
another member. It is certainly unacceptable to accuse a member 
of lying.
<P>
	I would therefore ask, with all due respect, the Prime Minister 
to withdraw his comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7414"> 7414 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I meant is 
that he is confusing the two. Judicial is not the same as 
quasi-judicial. I clearly explained the difference between the 
two.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure we want to hear both sides. Members 
of Parliament will have the chance to express themselves in the 
House. I would, with all respect to the Prime Minister, ask him 
to withdraw those words where he said that the Leader of the 
Opposition lied.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I just wanted to set the 
record straight, Mr. Speaker. If I said the word ``lie''-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Withdraw those words!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I am pleased to withdraw 
those words. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he should 
stick to the text; there is a difference between judicial-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, at this time, the Leader of the 
Opposition has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I return to the Leader of the Opposition to take up where he 
left off. We have heard a withdrawal of the words which were in 
question. They are categorical. I accept them as the Chair and I 
return to the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I told the Prime Minister that 
there was no distinction between judicial and quasi-judicial 
bodies to the extent that they decide on rights. These are rights 
which were decided.
<P>
	The heritage minister and the four other ministers who broke 
the rules all interfered with licence applications which the 
CRTC decides in order to create civil rights. In so doing, it is 
exactly the same as a court of law.
<P>
	I continue and I conclude, because I have a time limit.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	What we learned this morning is that despite all these 
declarations of respect for integrity, this cabinet also hid at least 
four other cases of violations of fundamental rules. I demand 
that these be followed up. I demand that we go beyond a simple 
ministerial statement which attempts to smooth things over. 
There must at least be an investigation by the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	He should check all the files, make the rounds, meet the 
ministers who are at fault and the other ministers, because we 
are told that there might be more. The Prime Minister told us 
that there might be up to 100 cases. That is more cases than 
Cabinet ministers. So the ethics counsellor must investigate.
<P>
	Secondly, the ethics counsellor should table in this House all 
the documents that he finds and be summoned before an 
appropriate parliamentary committee for a fundamental 
discussion, with witnesses, of an issue that affects the integrity 
not only of the government but of Canada's democratic 
institutions.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the outset I 
would like to say that I am very honoured and privileged to 
respond to the statement of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The way things work around here, different parties have a turn 
at being in government. We have had the Conservatives and 
Liberals over and over. I have to admit that sometimes when I 
look across I am overwhelmed at the magnitude of the 
responsibility ministers and the Prime Minister have. I 
sometimes wonder what we will be like when we get there.
<P>
	We received a copy of the Prime Minister's statement only in 
an official language which does not happen to be my own. 
Except for a few paragraphs, most of my speech is going to be 
extemporaneous since I spent most of the time available to me 
getting it translated into the language I could understand. I hope 
you will bear with me, Mr. Speaker, if some of the points I make 
and develop are perhaps not as well developed as we are 
accustomed to on this side of the House.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has spoken of the necessity for integrity, 
honesty and openness. He speaks of that not only today but has 
done so on a number of other occasions. I was never a member of 
a political party before I was elected here. One thing that drew 
me to the party to which I belong, the Reform Party, was that it 
stressed very strongly the concepts of integrity and honesty. I 
assure the House and the Prime Minister that his continually 
talking about integrity and honesty strikes a chord with the 
Canadian people because they want it and I want it.
<P>
	The question here is not whether we want it. In the notes that I 
took I see his speech included talking about integrity and 
honesty. That is really not the debate. We already agree on that. 
However, the question is how to do it.
<P>
	Without being disrespectful, what we have heard today is a 
longer answer to a question in Question Period without the nasty 
interruption of another question. We heard an explanation, 
trying to put oil on the waters and smooth them out. We are 
seeing massive damage control.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to get down to the basics of 
this issue. The question before us was triggered by a particular 
incident that has occupied the House for the last week. First we 
need to ask ourselves if we would be here debating this and 
would we be doing it in this way if it were not for this incident? 
Would the  government be as eager to push forward this agenda 
if it had not been driven to it? Perhaps this is reactionary but we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7415"> 7415 </A></B>
<P>
need to get on with it. We need to make sure there is integrity in 
government.
<P>
	We need to back up one step. One of the reasons the Canadian 
people and the opposition so strenuously object to what has 
happened is back one step further. It concerns the way 
government works.
<P>
	We all recognize that in our system of government all of us as 
members of Parliament are essentially powerless to influence 
true decision making. On a number of occasions we have put 
motions which have made eminent good sense to anyone who 
stops to think about them. Yet to a person, all of the members in 
the government have voted the way their leadership and their 
party, including their ministers, have directed on an issue. I 
accept that as fact. That is what has been happening. I can 
observe that. I have come to that conclusion.
<P>
	In the perception of the Canadian people, ministers are very 
powerful. Indeed they are. That is why one needs to object when 
a minister gives even the inkling that he is exercising that 
excessive power in order to influence matters on behalf of his 
constituents, a role that is not available to ordinary MPs in 
opposition or in government.
<P>
	We need to ask the government what has happened here. The 
Prime Minister has correctly stated that just because one is a 
member of the cabinet one should not be disenfranchised as a 
member of Parliament. I agree with that principle. The cabinet 
minister, as a member of Parliament, must be able to represent 
his constituents in legitimate matters. It is the variation that is at 
question here.
<P>
	This particular incident occurred when a minister made a 
statement on ministerial letterhead and because he is the 
minister overseeing that area it can properly be viewed as being 
undue influence.
<P>
	The ethics code does not permit that. I was able to pull this out 
quickly from one of my files. I quote from the ethics package: 
``Public office holders shall act with honesty and uphold the 
highest ethical standards so that public confidence and trust in 
the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of government are 
conserved and enhanced''.
<P>
	That principle is violated when several people are contending 
for a licence and one has behind him the power of a ministerial 
letter and the other one has an ordinary MP representing him. 
Because it is in the same department I believe this is a violation 
of the principle and ought to result in more than just an apology 
and ``let us try to do better''. We need to go beyond that.
<P>
	I also want to quote from the same document with respect to 
preferential treatment: ``Public office holders shall not step out 
of their official roles to assist private entities or persons in their 
dealings with the government where this would result in 
preferential treatment to any  person''. In this case it is evident 
that this has happened. It is wrong and it needs to be corrected.
<P>
	We also have the question of the ethics counsellor.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope the Prime Minister was honest, and I have no reason to 
question it, when he said: ``We want to have not only the 
appearance of more integrity, but we actually want more 
integrity whether it is in appearance or not''. I have no reason to 
doubt the authenticity of the minister's motivation there. I am in 
agreement with it.
<P>
	I will not relate all of the details of what has been going on in 
the past few days, but when we have an ethics counsellor who is 
being consulted only in retrospect after decisions are made and 
then, so it appears, only to help put oil on the waters, that casts 
great doubt on the whole procedure. I think it is a violation of the 
principle to have an ethics counsellor be responsible to, take his 
directions from and answerable to the Prime Minister only.
<P>
	I do agree that the Prime Minister needs all of the assistance 
he can get. I believe he needs to have counsellors in the area of 
ethics and certainly in the areas of operating this government. 
He needs all the help he can get but could we perhaps in addition 
have an ethics counsellor with the same order of independence 
and accountability to Parliament as, say, the Auditor General 
has in financial matters?
<P>
	I think it would be eminently fair, very helpful to the 
Canadian people and would certainly help all of us in this place 
as members of Parliament to understand and believe the 
government if there were an independent inquiry, not pushed 
around by political interests but one which would be truly 
independent and respond openly and honestly with the 
assessment of what has happened, a recommendation of what 
should be done now in order to solve this situation, what we need 
to do, what rules we need to change, what legislation we need to 
bring in and what people we need in order to make it work better 
and more correctly.
<P>
	I conclude by simply saying that this is a very, very 
unfortunate blight on this Parliament. It is an area where doubt 
is and has been cast on the government. We can only say that it is 
important for us as soon as possible, as cleanly as possible and 
as openly as possible to bring this to a conclusion and allow the 
minister to resign. Let us get this done the way it ought to be 
done and produce in the minds of people a genuine trust in the 
government.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
pick up from where I left off.
<P>
	This is what some people who were involved and interested in 
the issue said at the time. However, all these representations, 
warnings and concerns proved to be of little help, since the 
current Minister of the Environment announced that legislation 
on October 6.
<P>
	The amendments which are proposed by the minister and 
included in Bill C-56 do no change anything to the centralizing 
objectives of the federal government. The regulations made 
under old Bill C-13 are nothing to reassure those who want to 
invest in Quebec. Except for the construction of houses for 
non-migratory birds or field shelters, an almost endless number 
of projects could trigger a federal environmental assessment. 
The Minister of the Environment knows full well that the current 
Leader of the Opposition is not the one who drafted these 
regulations.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	It is her government that decided to take control over 
Quebec's economic development by subjecting to a federal 
assessment projects of vital importance for our province, 
including mining development as well as the expansion of 
power plants and hydroelectric projects. The strategy used by 
the minister to that end is both very simple and very predictable.
<P>
	The minister makes arrangements with a number of provinces 
to take control of fields where those provinces have not 
exercised their jurisdiction. She then signs an agreement with 
those provinces and there you have it: that agreement becomes 
just as valid for Quebec as it is for the other provinces. This is 
the automatic response of this centralizing government.
<P>
	And the Liberals behave that way in other sectors as well. 
Since they took office, they have constantly introduced projects 
aimed at giving the federal more control over the provinces. The 
big federal machine is systematically trying to gain more 
control in every sector, in spite of its own problems and its 
serious functional and political deficiencies.
<P>
	Members sitting on the other side are pleased. They keep 
singing each other's praises, they keep chanting ``Long live the 
federal government; long live our strong centralizing 
government; long live the big federal machine''. However, the 
other side of the coin is very depressing and raises serious 
concerns among people. And people are right to be worried. The 
federal government is like a steamroller levelling everything 
and jeopardizing vital entitlements. People fought to gain  these 
rights and now they have to fight again to preserve them.
<P>
	In fact, with their big boss who speaks of dignity and pride, 
their bread and butter supplier, the Liberals are driving a huge 
steamroller over the less affluent and middle-income taxpayers.
<P>
	The provinces are also getting crushed under this huge 
steamroller. Naturally, the rich, the large corporations, the 
financiers, all those who are for centralizing to excess find 
pleasure in watching the steamroller do its job. It is a real shame, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Small is beautiful and people first are concepts unknown to 
the people opposite. Yet, on the evening of October 25, 1993, 
these same people had promised us the moon. But getting back 
to the subject, let me quote them.
<P>
	When they were in opposition, the Liberals opposite used to 
speak against the bill on the federal environmental assessment 
legislation. This will illustrate the striking transformation 
elected members undergo when they move across the way. It is 
tragi-comic.
<P>
	Bach in those days, the present Liberal member for Winnipeg 
North Centre was saying: ``We must ensure that the powers put 
in place are explicit enough to make it possible to develop 
environmental standards that can withstand provincial pressure. 
The government is not protecting Canadians, with this bill at 
least, against the aims of the provincial and federal 
governments. The people have been let down in so many ways 
already that, if we do it again, Parliament will score more poorly 
than ever''.
<P>
	That is what he thought of this bill passed by his government. 
It was no good then, but now it is OK.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Eglinton-Lawrence, who still sits in 
this House, said on October 22, 1990, and I quote: ``It is, in fact, 
legislation without teeth''. [-]The key word was ``redraft'' and 
not make amendments that are going to provide acceptable frills 
to this bill but to alter completely the whole dimension of this 
bill. [-]One of those items refers to the fact that the compliance 
component of the bill certainly is very lacking. There is absolute 
indifference to the concept of making various jurisdictions of 
government comply, particularly when they set up their own 
review mechanisms''.
<P>
	Our colleague from Egmont, Prince Edward Island, was 
saying: ``Bill C-78 does not meet the legislative requirements 
relating to environmental protection. Considering how 
important and urgently required this legislation is, we cannot be 
satisfied with such an ill-defined and toothless bill. This bill 
does not meet the expectations of Canadians nor those of the 
government's own environment and economy committee''. It is 
so seriously flawed that it should be withdrawn or redrafted. But 
I am sure he will vote for this bill.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7417"> 7417 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal member for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso said: 
``In addition, I have many concerns about the philosophy behind 
the bill and about the bill's effectiveness''. As I listen to this 
debate, I am convinced the government should go back to the 
drawing board before it asks us to pass this bill. Many basic 
aspects of this measure should be rethought, and quite frankly, I 
must say the bill is far from perfect.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal member for Nepean went even further when she 
said: ``Unfortunately, the weakness of the legislation before us 
makes for a sceptical public and questions the motives of us as 
legislators and the seriousness of the government's intent in 
enacting this resolution''.
<P>
	The current Secretary of State and Liberal member for 
Northumberland said, in referring to Bill C-78, and I quote: 
``Mr. Mulroney's government's latest environmental legislation 
is fundamentally flawed. Canada will return to the dark ages of 
environmental law if Bill C-78 passes in its present form''.
<P>
	The present Minister of Industry said in the House: ``The 
heritage of Canadians is too important to be left only to the 
provinces. I do not see even a wish to acknowledge that it has the 
power to intervene in development projects which are going to 
be environmentally harmful. This bill is an inadequate response 
in the context of many events occurring in Canada''.
<P>
	One of his cabinet colleagues, the Minister of social program 
cuts, mentioned that his Liberal colleagues had been devastating 
in their criticism of the flaws of this bill. He said this measure 
would do no good at all. He hoped that someday, we would have 
a government that would be able to negotiate a new agreement, 
with responsibility shared by federal and provincial authorities. 
``I think that our own creative juices should be employed for 
finding out how we can share jurisdiction for environmental 
assessment'', said the present minister. It is rather comical that 
at the time, this minister talked about sharing responsibility, 
when we consider the negative response from the provinces to 
his social security reform.
<P>
	Finally, the first prize goes to our beloved Minister of 
Finance, and I will give you a few samples of what he said. ``Bill 
C-78 is so flawed that it will weaken existing standards for 
environmental assessment. The bill is lacking in all respects.''
<P>
	``So we have a bill that died on the Order Paper and which the 
government, with its supreme arrogance and total lack of logic, 
now wants to resurrect, although the measure was unanimously 
rejected by Canadians. As unrealistic governments go, this one 
takes the cake. And if there is one government proving it, it 
surely is the present one with its attitude towards Bill C-78. 
First, this bill is based on a completely false assumption. But the 
government wants to hold fast to a vision developed in  the 
1850s and to continue to believe we can produce goods without 
worrying about waste and the frittering away of our resources, 
as if it had no importance whatsoever''.
<P>
	``Both the business representatives and the environmentalists 
heard in committee think this bill is unacceptable''. ``When we 
come to office in two years, I can assure you that no member will 
ask himself if the water he drinks is harmless. This bill will 
cause more problems than it will solve. It should go back to the 
drawing board.''
<P>
	We should not be astonished by the radical turnabouts of the 
Minister of Finance. He is the wind vane of the Liberals.
<P>
	That is what some governement members were saying when 
they were on this side of the House. Should we believe they were 
all victims of the same phenomenon and all have to get a feeling 
of the wind, like the Minister of Finance, before making up their 
minds?
<P>
	The most serious aspect of this sudden change of mind on the 
part of the Liberals is that the Minister of Environment now 
praises this bill and congratulates our leader for having initiated 
it in 1990. She says he is the father of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act and pats him on the back every 
opportunity she gets whereas, at the time, the Liberals were 
certainly not patting him on the back, quite the contrary. They 
were strongly against this bill, as their statements on the subject 
show. That is typical of the Liberals. They are real 
weathercocks. No, worse than that, they are opportunists.
<P>
	As far as this Bill C-56 is concerned, the federal minister 
wants to make sure that, as much as possible, only one 
environmental assessment will be made for each project. Of 
course, and again this is easy to anticipate, she will fall back on 
our leader to justify her bill, but we all know that the bill tabled 
by our leader in 1990 has been extensively amended and that-

Aged 58, Monsignor Turcotte will be able to influence the

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker since 1986 thousands of cattle in Great Britain have 
contracted what is commonly known as mad cow disease.
<P>
	Mad cow disease has an incubation period of up to eight years 
and can be detected only in its advanced stages. There is no 
evidence that it can be spread by animal to animal contact, but to 
be safe Agriculture Canada started banning the importation of 
cattle from the U.K. in 1990.
<P>
	Every year thousands of immigrants enter Canada without 
being screened for HIV. Although many years can pass before 
HIV carriers develop full blown AIDS, the virus is readily 
detectable by a cheap, effective blood test.
<P>
	Is it not in the best interests of the immigrants themselves and 
their families, as well as the Canadian public, for them to know 
if they are carrying the deadly HIV virus?
<P>
	In light of the vote taken two hours ago on Motion No. 285, it 
is now apparent that Agriculture Canada's concern for the health 
of Canadian cattle is greater than the health minister's concern 
for the health of the Canadian people.

	The American Society for Quality Control is the largest

sector by Mayor Brian Turnbull. The fact that Brian Turnbull, 
the mayor of the city of Waterloo, is representing the municipal 
sector reflects the leadership that Waterloo has offered in the 
area of TQM at the municipal level.

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is getting lost in 
studies, which all contradict one another.
<P>
	Having commissioned a study on the financing of the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from Nordicity Group Ltd., 
the minister, obviously unhappy with their recommendations, 
commissioned another study, from Omnia Communications this 
time, to conduct a critical analysis of the work done as part of 
the first one.
<P>
	The second study found that the first one was based on 
concepts so outdated and assumptions so shaky that the results 
were inevitably invalid.
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of Canadian Heritage should have 
conducted the study himself to read into it whatever he wanted. 
It is outrageous to spend public funds this way. How much did 
these contradictory studies cost and how much will the next ones 
cost?

abuse of Canada's immigration system goes on unchecked by 
the government. In fact Ottawa is to blame for much of the 
abuse.
<P>
	On September 9 a Fijian visitor with relatives in Vancouver 
armed with a refugee lawyer claimed refugee status in Canada. 
Officials did not know, however, that he needed kidney 
treatment that he could not get in Fiji.
<P>
	He checked into St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver. Rather than 
being placed on a waiting list or being sent home for treatment, 
federal officials ordered the hospital to put the man at the top of 
the list for dialysis, despite the fact that six terminally ill 
Canadians were bumped from the list.
<P>
	This is an outrage. The refugee system seems to work best for 
those who want to abuse it. In this case it could cost Canadian 
lives. I demand that the minister immediately intervene, tell his 
officials to reverse their decision, put the lives of Canadians 
first, and prevent those with terminal illnesses from coming to 
the country and claiming refugee status just to get medical 
treatment.

nationhood. Canadians want to be part of the process of deciding 
such a national figure as our head of state.
<P>
	In cursory surveys I have conducted in public schools in 
Durham, I have discovered that few of our youth can identify the 
Governor General. This is partly because they or their parents 
have not participated in his selection.
<P>
	Of twenty-four OECD countries only three appoint their 
heads of state and Canada is one of them. I note the election of 
the head of state would not require a constitutional amendment 
but could be done by convention. I suggest that we elect the 
Governor General at the time of a general election. As an interim 
step we could have the House vote on a short list prepared by the 
Prime Minister.

to do with a lack of expertise, as suggested by my friend from

believe he now realizes.

	The good news is that the Offshore Petroleum Board is going 
to review the Hibernia management decision. I am confident it

with deadlines. The work can be just as quickly done at

Instead of reducing Canadian emissions of greenhouse gases at

	Such a strategy sends a clear message to the industrialized 
countries that they do not have to act themselves to reduce their

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not like that at all. In the case of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, I was advised at the beginning of the month, 
as I said before, and I made my decision at that time; if I had 
decided to ask for his resignation, I should have done so then and 
there. The other ministers gave me the information personally, 
on the weekend.
<P>
	When I looked at the guidelines I gave all ministers in 
November when they accepted their appointment, as I explained 
in my speech earlier this afternoon, a very clear distinction was 
made. Communications with judges are forbidden; the guideline 
was quite clear in this respect. In the case of quasi-judicial 
bodies which themselves very often invite the views of all kinds 
of people before reaching a decision, we had a different rule. I 
asked the ethics counsellor to look into this and make some 
suggestions. I hope we will also receive some suggestions from 
members of the Opposition. I heard about the situation 
regarding the other ministers after I asked them to check their 
files.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister felt it was appropriate to 
remind his ministers that it was necessary to protect the 
independence of courts of law, why did he forget to mention that 
quasi-judicial bodies, which often hand down decisions that are 
similar in nature, are even more vulnerable to ministerial 
interference from their responsible ministers?
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: This morning, he 
mentioned all kinds of figures. He even referred to five or even 
10 or 100 cases, but that makes no difference. How could he give 
the impression that the mistake made by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage was not as serious since at least four other 
ministers did the same thing? Does this mean that for him, 
frequency attenuates the seriousness of the act?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the case of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, I 
made it clear last week that when he was informed that it was 
interpreted as a supporting letter, although he as the minister did 
not want to support the application, he himself took the 
initiative of writing to the parties concerned and made it clear he 
did not intend to support any applications before the CRTC. We 
discussed that particular case because he was the Minister 
responsible for the CRTC.
<P>
	In the case of the other ministers, they are not responsible for 
the CRTC but they are members who represented certain 
interests of their constituents. And that is the dilemma I want to 
resolve. I have asked Mr. Wilson to prepare some guidelines on 
the subject, and I hope there will be a debate in the House so that 
people can help us make the distinction, because in the case of 
the CRTC, they invite people to express their views before 
licences are issued. A constituent, his member and in fact 
members of all parties in this House made  representations, and 
a few ministers, who also happen to be members made the same 
kind of representations. Perhaps we will have to find a different 
mechanism so that such members are able to act in the interests 
of their constituents without compromising their 
responsibilities as ministers.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if a minister is unable to make a distinction 
between his duties as a minister and his duties as a member, he 
deserves to be demoted to the rank of ordinary member.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister 
whether he realizes that the mistake made by four other 
ministers as revealed this morning is a serious one. And in that 
case, does he not realize that what his Minister of Canadian 
Heritage did is even more serious, because, in addition to being 
a member of Cabinet, he is the Minister responsible for the 
CRTC and as such was supposed to protect the CRTC against 
undue interference from his four colleagues?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the case of the minister, he himself indicated that he 
did not intend to intervene to support the application. In any 
case, the letter did not indicate that he was going to do so but 
simply that he wanted to be kept informed of further 
developments.
<P>
	As for the ministers who wrote, they did not write to the 
minister. They wrote a letter, which is now a public document, 
either to the secretary or the chairman of the CRTC. As soon as 
such documents are received by the commission, they are put in 
the public file, which any journalist or member of Parliament 
may check at any time. These were support letters like the 
14,000 other support letters the CRTC has received with respect 
to applications during the past year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister seems to be making a distinction between a letter 
of support and any letter of representation. The letters sent by 
the colleagues of the minister of heritage are indeed letters of 
support, of direct interference in the affairs of the CRTC.
<P>
	The Prime Minister had made a commitment to demand 
irreproachable conduct from his ministers and he even made it 
one of his priorities in the red book. Yet, he failed his first test 
miserably. He chose to forgive and forget without first 
consulting the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, who claims to be concerned 
about integrity, explain to this House that he did not personally 
direct his ministers, as soon as they were sworn in, to consult the 
ethics counsellor before getting into trouble like the minister of 
heritage and other ministers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ministers are urged to consult the ethics  
counsellor, who was appointed only a few months ago. The 
guidelines we gave them were clear: No communications 
whatsoever with the judiciary. This prohibition has been in place 
for at least 15 years.
<P>
	As for quasi-judicial bodies, they may be contacted in some 
circumstances but only through the appropriate authorities. So 
they did not address their letters to the minister but to the 
commission's secretary general, who does not make any 
decisions or rulings. I think that only one wrote directly to the 
chairman.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans wrote on behalf of a 
small francophone community in his riding that would like to 
receive French-language television. They are criticizing a 
member for representing people who want to preserve their 
language, French, in difficult circumstances, but I am of the 
opinion that the minister would have failed in his duty as a 
member had he not defended his French-speaking constituents.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> How nice, Mr. 
Speaker! The minister of heritage wrote the Chairman of the 
CRTC on behalf of a small community in his riding. Frankly, 
does the Prime Minister not admit that, as this whole affair 
clearly shows, the government ethics counsellor should be 
accountable not to his office but to the House of Commons, to 
ensure that he has some effectiveness, real power and a decisive 
role?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, among the duties of the ethics counsellor is the 
requirement to submit an annual report to the House of 
Commons. This is part of his duties, of the responsibilities 
assigned to him.
<P>
	I am surprised to hear the tone of voice used by the Bloc 
Quebecois, whose parent company calls people in, humiliates 
them, makes them confess, forces them to change their political 
convictions or fires them because they are not separatists. It is 
worse than it ever was, even under Duplessis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the Prime Minister's 
statement this afternoon. He went to great lengths to compare 
the actions of members of Parliament to the actions of the 
member for Laval West with regard to their inquiries into the 
dealings of the CRTC. What the Prime Minister conveniently 
left out is that unlike these other parliamentarians, the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage is ultimately responsible for the CRTC. 
The Prime Minister is actually saying it is okay for ministers to 
lobby quasi-judicial bodies like the CRTC.
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister allowing this interference to 
continue without taking any action on the matter?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said clearly last week that when the minister realized 
his letter asking to be kept informed was  perceived as a matter 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7423"> 7423 </A></B>
<P>
of recommendation, he wrote on his own to state clearly that he 
did not want his letter to be interpreted that way.
<P>
	I said that his letter was an honest mistake on behalf of one of 
his constituents. I would have preferred that it had not been 
written, but I recognize that nobody is absolutely perfect.
<P>
	I said that we needed better guidelines. The guidelines are 
very clear for ministers calling judges. It is completely and 
clearly described. You cannot do it. That rule has applied to all 
ministers for at least 10 or 15 years. In the case of quasi-judicial 
bodies, because they are different and relate to a lot of different 
cases, we gave more flexibility.
<P>
	In the case of the CRTC, the CRTC invites people to write to it 
to give their opinion about who should or should not get a 
licence. The CRTC received 15,000 such letters last year, five 
from ministers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would not say it was an honest mistake. I would 
say it was a dumb mistake because the minister was in charge of 
the CRTC.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's rhetoric this afternoon would hold more 
weight had he fired the Minister of Canadian Heritage before 
reworking the ministerial code of conduct. As it now stands the 
Prime Minister's actions smack of political expediency and 
desperation.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister appoint a truly independent ethics 
counsellor so that existing preferential rules will be followed 
and will not have to be revised every time one of his cabinet 
ministers gets into trouble?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said earlier that the ethics counsellor reports to the 
House once a year.
<P>
	There is a principle which is very clear in my mind: At the end 
of the day whatever advisers I have around me, whatever 
counsel I receive about a decision, I have to take the 
responsibility. I have taken the responsibility. When the 
minister realized he had made a mistake he tried to correct the 
mistake on his own.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Six months later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It was not six months after 
that. The problem was that he did not realize it had been 
construed like that until the end of September and he acted 
immediately. I said I would check the guidelines and I realized 
the guidelines needed improvement. I hope the hon. member 
will help us find the proper balance. It is the Reform Party which 
states that if members of Parliament do not do their jobs 
properly they should be recalled. This is great. They do not want 
members of Parliament who are ministers not to do their jobs as 
members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are asking the Prime Minister to be responsible. 
He is responsible for his ministers and we are asking him to take 
that responsibility seriously and ask for the resignation.
<P>
	The current guidelines for ministers are common sense. A 
minister should not be seen to be giving preferential treatment to 
his or her friends and should not use this influence for personal 
or political gain. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister put the brakes on a damage control 
machine, muzzle his strategist and do the honourable and 
responsible thing and demand the resignation of the minister of 
heritage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week I said no and this week I repeat, no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was informed as early as October 1 of the 
mistake made by the Minister of Canadian Heritage and decided 
to forget about it and not seek the advice of his ethics counsellor, 
Mr. Howard Wilson. The government consulted Mr. Wilson only 
at the very last moment, that is last Thursday, when the 
minister's mistake became public knowledge.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, on October 1, the Prime Minister 
had already decided to keep his heritage minister, without 
having consulted his ethics counsellor?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can only repeat what I said last week, namely that I 
was informed of the issue, I examined it and I presumed that 
everyone concerned had been consulted before a 
recommendation was made to me by the Privy Council Office.
<P>
	I assumed that Mr. Wilson had been consulted when, in fact, 
he had not. However, this does not change the nature of the 
decision. I then decided that, as the minister had himself taken 
action to correct the situation, and even though I was not 
pleased, he could continue to fulfill his role as minister. I told 
the truth last week when I said that I thought Mr. Wilson had 
been consulted even though this was not the case. I did talk to 
him on the phone afterwards and he agreed with me. At least, 
what he told me did not make me change my mind.
<P>
	In any case, ultimately I am the one who is responsible. I 
cannot share that responsibility with anyone: I am the Prime 
Minister of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we heard a version last week and in the version that 
he is giving now the Prime Minister says that he talked on the 
phone to Mr. Wilson.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7424"> 7424 </A></B>
<P>
	What did Mr. Wilson say to the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry. I did not express myself clearly. I asked my 
staff-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I talked several times to Mr. 
Wilson since then. At that time, however, I asked my staff: ``Did 
you phone?'' They said: ``No.'' I then replied: ``Phone him''.
<P>
	When I rose in this House, my staff had provided me with 
information on Mr. Wilson's opinion. Later, over the weekend, I 
had an opportunity to talk to him and discuss how to proceed in 
the future. This is what we did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>He is contradicting himself!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> No, I am not contradicting 
myself at all. I said that I talked to Mr. Wilson over the weekend. 
And when I rose in this House, as I said last week, I had asked-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> You are confused!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> If you listen you will not be 
confused.
<P>
	So, Mr. Wilson's opinion was given to me, and it was to the 
effect that this was acceptable.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	My office learned in discussions this morning with the 
secretary general of the CRTC, and I quote Mr. Darling: ``The 
commissioners on the subcommittee may have been influenced 
by the minister's letter''.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister decided to support the actions of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage was he aware that the secretary 
general of the CRTC believed that the minister's letter may have 
influenced the process?
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, probably not in this case because the application was 
denied.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that answer is obvious because this whole process has been 
tainted. They had no other choice.
<P>
	The Prime Minister even today has used the minister's second 
letter of September 30 as a defence that there was no 
intervention and that nothing was done wrong. We also know 
now why this second letter was missing from the CRTC file.
<P>
	The secretary general of the CRTC says that the second letter 
was never put in the file because it came too late to be 
considered by the CRTC. This means that when the CRTC made 
its decision it was always under the impression that the minister 
had intervened and it remained so.
<P>
	Given this new information, how can the Prime Minister 
possibly continue to defend the integrity of his minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is proof that the first letter had no effect at all.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the Prime Minister said that he had 
consulted the ethics counsellor. Last Friday, we learned that the 
ethics counsellor was only consulted on Thursday morning, only 
a few minutes or a couple of hours before the speech by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Today we are told that the Prime Minister talked to his ethics 
counsellor, then the Prime Minister claimed that he did not 
express himself well and that, in fact, he had not talked to the 
ethics counsellor. If I understand correctly, the Prime Minister's 
advisors talked to the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I would like to know what the Prime Minister's advisors told 
him of the discussion they had with the ethics counsellor. Have I 
made myself clear enough?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I said is that my office contacted the ethics 
counsellor. When I arrived in the House of Commons, we had 
the ethics counsellor's advice. This is what I said.
<P>
	His advice was given to me personally, and I said in this 
House that there were no grounds in the opinion he gave to make 
me change my mind. Over the week-end, I had the opportunity 
to talk with the ethics counsellor about what we should be doing 
in the future.
<P>
	To avoid further controversy, for the time being, the ministers 
will have to send their recommendations to the ethics counsellor 
who will decide whether or not it is appropriate to send them to 
the various agencies concerned, while keeping in mind that 
every minister is also the elected representative of around 
100,000 citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister said earlier that the ethics 
counsellor agreed with him, and then stopped. Since he did not 
really agree, I presume-we have to guess-the Prime Minister 
added: There were no grounds in the opinion he gave to make me 
change my mind.
<P>
	It might be because his opinion was different from that of the 
Prime Minister. We must be able to form our own opinion and 
the only way we can do so is for the Prime Minister to tell us, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7425"> 7425 </A></B>
<P>
today, what was the message he received from his ethics 
counsellor.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assumed full responsibility for the decision and I have 
nothing to add. I decided that the minister had corrected the 
situation as best he could at the end of September or the 
beginning of October, I accepted his explanations and I chose to 
keep him in the Cabinet.
<P>
	This is my responsibility, not the responsibility of any 
counsellor in the government. I cannot share that responsibility 
with anyone.

about restoring integrity to government is beginning to sound a 
little hollow.
<P>
	Perhaps this government is taking a page out of Mackenzie's 
book when he wrote: ``Integrity is necessary but not necessarily 
integrity''. The Prime Minister said, the red book proclaims, and 
all the Liberal candidates were talking about it, ``open 
government will be the watchword of the Liberal program''.

<P>
	If the Prime Minister really believes in and is promoting an 
open government, why did he not inform this House when he 
first became aware of the heritage minister's letter to the CRTC?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not feel it was necessary. The letter was a public 
letter. The letter was in a file that everybody could consult. 
There was nothing secret about it. You could go and check this 
application. The minister's letter was the same as that of 
anybody else who had written representations in the same file. 
The CRTC welcomes opinion from citizens. The letter from the 
minister was with the pile of letters that were in the file. It was a 
public document. I did not feel I was obliged to reveal anything 
that in theory was known by the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are

something and does not accept responsibility. The Prime 
Minister has a responsibility and he is not accepting it.

<P>
	Would the Prime Minister tell us what recommendation the

Canadian heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

nothing that could influence me to change the decision I had 
taken previously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are 
we to understand from the answer, or rather the lack of answer, 
from the Prime Minister that the ethics counsellor did advise 
him either to ask for the Canadian heritage minister's 
resignation or to force him to leave Cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

efforts against the underground economy. We have done this 
with seven other provinces. We have new agreements with 
virtually all the business and professional associations so we 
can better combat the underground economy.
<P>
	As a result of these measures we have pulled in many 
hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue which was 
not expected by the previous government.
<P>
	I can assure you also, Mr. Speaker, that because of the success 
of the 1,200 auditors we have put into this area we will be 
redoubling our efforts in this regard.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister 
systematically refuses to tell us the ethics counsellor's opinion, 
as transmitted to him by his officials.
<P>
	Is it not true that the ethics counsellor gave a different opinion 
from that of the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have said several times that the counsellor's opinion 
was transmitted to me and that nothing forced me to change my 
mind.
<P>
	In any case, whatever opinion he could have given me, the 
ultimate responsibility lies with the Prime Minister. I took my 
responsibilities because the minister had acted as quickly as 
possible in a situation which, in my opinion, was not fatal, 
because he had not made any recommendation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what exactly did the ethics counsellor say?
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor always tells the Prime Minister 
that the latter must take his responsibilities, which he did.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On October 27 the Minister of Canadian Heritage stated he 
was approached by a constituent, and I quote from <I>Hansard</I>, 
page 7273:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to write a letter drawing the attention of the CRTC to his application for a 
radio licence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The constituent, Mr. Daniilidis, has stated in conversations 
with Reform Party research staff that he never asked the 
minister to write a letter on his behalf.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister explain this contradiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, he certainly went to visit the minister. Perhaps they 
discussed the weather. Perhaps they discussed the application, 
and the minister wrote a letter asking for information on this 
file.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7427"> 7427 </A></B>
<P>
	I was not there. I was not privy to the conversation. However I 
know the minister was visited by his constituent and that lead to 
the letter that is the object of this discussion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister then is suggesting that the 
constituent in fact did ask for a letter. That is very difficult to 
understand.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister initiate a private and independent 
investigation into this whole affair so we can finally get to the 
bottom of it?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a public document. The hon. member should just 
go to the CRTC and look at the file. It is public. We do not need 
an investigation.
<P>
	It looks like the research group of the Reform Party is not very 
good.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister refuses to inform the House on the exact content 
of the recommendation of the ethics counsellor. Since this is an 
issue of integrity and public ethics, will the Prime Minister 
admit that it is now in the public domain?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Of 
course, Mr. Speaker. It is in the newspapers and in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister not realize that he jeopardizes his own integrity 
by hiding the content of that conversation and does he not 
realize that he should reveal the facts as he knows them?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry but the Leader of the Opposition said earlier 
that he did not question the integrity of the Prime Minister and I 
said that the issue was in the public domain. We have discussed 
that. The letter was written by the minister and has been made 
public. The second letter that was sent has also been published. I 
have tabled that letter in the House of Commons and the minister 
has explained the situation to the House. How could we possibly 
be more open? The counsellors advise the Prime Minister; the 
advice they give me is for me alone, they are not for the public; I 
am the one who must make the decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said today that the minister of 
heritage's letter did not influence the CRTC but on the other 
hand the secretary general of the CRTC stated that it may have 
interfered with their decision.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain this discrepancy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it had a lot of influence. The application was denied. 
The minister did not recommend but if you claim  he did, his 
letter was not of great weight because the applicant did not 
receive the green light from the CRTC.
<P>
	I do not know why you can make an argument like that.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would once again ask you to please address all 
of your comments to the Chair. It makes it a lot easier for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this whole situation surely is a comedy of errors. A 
minister of the crown has obviously breached the public trust 
and the Prime Minister gives him a Laurel and Hardy handshake.
<P>
	Given that the Prime Minister will not make public what the 
ethics counsellor advised, how do we know there is not a 
discrepancy here as well?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained 10 times that the ethics counsellor gave 
advice to the Prime Minister and other advisers. The Prime 
Minister cannot get up in the House and say: ``I made that 
decision, but it is not my fault; it is the fault of my advisers.'' 
Everyone will laugh.
<P>
	At the end of the day the Prime Minister is responsible and he 
is the one who decides. That is exactly what I have done. Nobody 
can accuse me of running away from my responsibilities. I do 
not want to blame anybody else. I take full responsibility.

	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The minister said that the eligibility criteria for the Program 
for Older Worker Adjustment are in part arbitrary. An older 
worker in need will only receive benefits if he was laid off along 
with several other workers. Under some circumstances, it could 
be along with a hundred other workers or so.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to address the needs of the older 
workers within his social reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for the question.
<P>
	As the member knows because he read the paper, there are at 
least four or five references to the way in which we would like to 
improve the programs for older workers. Unfortunately some 
people in the House have not read the document as yet and 
therefore are not fully aware of the proposals that have been 
made.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7428"> 7428 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we have established in New Brunswick a job 
core program which is specifically designed as a strategic 
initiative to deal with the problem of older workers. Evaluating 
that project will determine whether it has application across the 
country, providing for a major area of redevelopment for older 
workers.
<P>
	In reference to the specific proposal made by the hon. 
member, I can report to him that applications made by about 75 
per cent of all laid off workers who apply in the province of 
Quebec under the pilot program are accepted, which is the 
highest level of acceptance anywhere in the country. Last year 
we had bought close to $200 million worth of annuities for older 
workers of Quebec.
<P>
	It shows that the program is working effectively. As it is a 
federal-provincial program and we need the co-operation of the 
provincial government, it is going to be very important that we 
have the co-operation of the Quebec government to assist us in 
social reform, so we can have a much better older workers 
program.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister will remember that, before 
appointing the ethics counsellor, he consulted with the leaders 
of all the parties represented in this House and requested their 
unanimous consent before making this appointment.
<P>
	In this context, does he not realize that the advice of the ethics 
counsellor is not for his sole benefit, but for that of the House as 
a whole and, as such, is of the public domain? I would therefore 
ask him to show the transparency expected of him and tell us 
what the ethics counsellor, being the provider of enlightened and 
public advice that he is, suggested he should do in such cases.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I consulted the Leader of the Official Opposition and 
the Leader of the Reform Party before appointing Mr. Wilson, to 
give them the assurance that he would fulfil his duties properly. 
His job is to advise the Prime Minister and the ministers, in their 
capacity as ministers, as well as members of Parliament, 
lobbyists and anyone in a situation of conflict of interest. When 
he advises me on how to run Cabinet, it is to help me make a 
decision as Prime Minister. He is an honourable man and, I 
repeat, when his opinion was reported to me, it did not make me 
change my opinion. I am pleased that the hon. member reminded 
the House of Commons that, before his appointment, the Leader 
of the Opposition and the Leader of the Reform Party, 
considered he was a man of sound judgement and integrity and 
that he had done his job well.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of hon. members 
that November 1 marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of 
the Conference on International Civil Aviation to be held at 
Chicago, Illinois.
<P>
	It was 50 years ago tomorrow that representatives from 52 
countries, including Canada, met to map the future of 
international civil aviation. Their deliberations led to the 
signing on December 7, 1944 of the multilateral convention on 
international civil aviation and the eventual selection of 
Montreal as headquarters for the newly created International 
Civil Aviation Organization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization is a United 
Nations specialized agency responsible for establishing 
international standards, recommended practices and procedures 
covering the technical, economic and legal aspects of 
international civil aviation operations. The organization's 
membership is made up of 183 contracting states.
<P>
	November 1st is not only a proud day in the history of civil 
aviation; it is also a proud day for Canada. The International 
Civil Aviation Organization is the only UN agency with 
headquarters in Canada.
<P>
	We were chosen as the home for this important agency 
because of our instrumental role at the Chicago Conference. 
Canada continues in its leadership role in civil aviation and 
remains a strong supporter of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We salute those who gathered at Chicago five decades ago in 
the closing days of the second world war. In particular, I would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7429"> 7429 </A></B>
<P>
like to recognize three distinguished Canadians who took part in 
those deliberations and who are still with us today.
<P>
	Former Ambassador Escott Reid helped draft the conference 
documents. He now lives near Toronto.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Jean Fournier, the youngest of the Canadian delegates to 
the Chicago Conference, now lives in Montreal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Stanislav Krejcik was a member of the Czechoslovakian 
delegation. He is now a Canadian citizen living in the province 
of Alberta.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians know firsthand the paramount importance that 
safe, regular, efficient and economical air transportation plays 
in building communities, and in contributing to development 
and economic well-being. We are grateful to the International 
Civil Aviation Organization for helping to ensure the safety and 
security of air transportation worldwide.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Commemorative activities, including flag raisings at airports 
across the country, will mark tomorrow's anniversary of the 
opening of the Chicago conference. And in December, in 
Montreal, we will hold celebrations marking the signing of the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It can only be hoped that the same spirit of mutual 
understanding and co-operation that has made the International 
Civil Aviation Organization so successful for over 50 years will 
continue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, commonly known as 
the ICAO.
<P>
	Quebecers are particularly proud that this important UN 
organization chose Montreal and the Province of Quebec for 
their administrative headquarters in 1944.
<P>
	In 1944, air transport was marginal with only 9 million 
passengers. Flying has now become a vital means of 
transportation for the global economy. Every year, over 1.2 
billion passengers fly in total safety. Air transport remains the 
safest means of transportation, an achievement we owe in large 
part to the ICAO. I wish to let this organization know how 
grateful I am for this.
<P>
	Nobody can predict what flying will be like in 50 years. The 
number of passengers will certainly continue to increase, and 
technological progress will bring dramatic changes to this mode 
of transport. I am convinced that the ICAO will be up to the 
challenges of tomorrow, just as it was able to meet those of the 
past.
<P>
	The ICAO is a perfect example of what sovereign nations 
around the globe can do when they co-operate. Through the 
ICAO, 183 member states managed to put in place a safe air 
transport system for their people. It is a major achievement.
<P>
	Given the importance of flying as today's and tomorrow's 
mode of transport, it is more critical than ever to ensure its 
safety. Collaboration and co-operation among the member 
states will remain paramount.
<P>
	In closing, I want to thank and congratulate all those who 
contributed to the creation and development of the ICAO in the 
first 50 years of its existence. I would like to extend to this 
organization my best wishes for continued success in the next 50 
years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to rise today to thank the hon. Minister of 
Transport for bringing the 50th anniversary of the opening of the 
Conference on International Civil Aviation to the attention of 
this House.
<P>
	In the absence of our critic for transport, the member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke, I too would like to extend the best 
wishes of my party to former Ambassador Reid, Monsieur Jean 
Fournier, and Mr. Stanislav Krejcik.
<P>
	We as Canadians can be proud of the fact that the International 
Civil Aviation Organization is located in Montreal. We should 
never take for granted the high esteem in which our country is 
held in these matters.
<P>
	International Civil Aviation Organization standards, more 
commonly known as ICAO standards, affect safety and security 
standards even at airports serving many of our smaller 
communities. These same airports are now in the process of 
being transferred from the federal government to local 
authorities and in some cases even to private operations. I hope 
the minister will ensure that reasonable standards are 
maintained both at privatized airports and in the potentially 
privatized air navigation system, while also ensuring that the 
system does not become overly regulated with bureaucratic 
policies.
<P>
	I am sure that ICAO will continue to lead the way to ensuring 
safe international standards throughout the aviation world and 
that other organizations, both governmental and private, will 
recognize the need and capabilities of countries to work together 
to resolve items of conflict in other areas.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	On a personal note, all of us in this House, especially those of 
us from ridings that are basically only accessible by air realize 
the importance of safe air travel.

	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present to the House in both official 
languages the report of the special joint committee of the House 
of Commons and the Senate on the review of Canada's defence 
policy.
<P>
	This is the first comprehensive parliamentary review of 
defence policy in the history of Canada. Here we present our 
conclusions on the principles, purposes and objectives that 
should guide Canada in setting defence policy.
<P>
	We believe the Canadian Armed Forces is a national 
institution we can all be proud of because of its past record. As 
well, it is of vital importance in the future to Canada's position 
as a world trading nation given our strong interests in peace and 
stability.
<P>
	We have made recommendation to shape a defence policy that 
reflects the balance between what Canadians would like to do 
and what we can afford.
<P>
	I would like to thank the close to 300 witnesses who appeared 
before us over the last seven months and those who sent us briefs 
and suggestions. I also want to thank those members of 
Parliament of all parties who worked so diligently and so 
co-operatively to produce this report. There was a great deal of 
consensus among us and I am confident this report will stand the 
test of time.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
continue what the hon. member just said, I would add that the

policy and the Bloc submitted a dissenting report on some 
points, which is in the same book.

	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I wonder if 
we could seek the unanimous consent of the House to hear 
representation from the Reform Party on the special joint 
committee report by the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the proposal of the hon. member for Labrador. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my Reform colleague and I being new to Parliament 
had not previously participated in any parliamentary 
committees.
<P>
	We consider it a great privilege and also a lot of work to 
proceed with this study. It is my impression that the members of 
the committee were very apolitical in the approach to the studies 
that we conducted.
<P>
	As the member for Labrador has said, we heard from 
witnesses from Victoria to St. John's and from NATO to Zagreb. 
The results of our study are that we have taken into account the 
defence needs of Canada. We have tried to reconcile that with 
the fiscal responsibility that we have to abide by. I am hoping 
that the outcome will find favour with most people.
<P>
	Those who are looking for a revolutionary report will be 
disappointed. However I think when they look at the report and 
examine it, they will find that it is logical, it is common sense 
and it will support Canada in our defence needs through the 
beginning of the next century.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-56, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Prior to resuming debate I 
wish to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 
33(2)(b) because of the two ministerial statements Government 
Orders will be extended by 53 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill today.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament and Reform critic for the 
environment I am pleased to be able to serve as a check on 
government legislation to be assured that it is in the best interest 
of all Canadians and to ensure the continued protection of our 
environment.
<P>
	As opposition critic it is not my intention to simply criticize 
for the sake of being critical. I will support legislation that is in 
the best interest of the environment and ensure this government 
is taking the proper steps toward protecting the environment 
with a fair balance between the economy and the environment. 
However if these factors are not taken into account I will oppose 
the initiative and offer constructive criticism.
<P>
	During the first year of this 35th Parliament the government 
has been slow to move on many issues, including the 
environment. There has been of late a lot of talk and 
grandstanding but not a great deal of action.
<P>
	I am pleased with the direction of this bill. It is a good start. 
However there is a great deal of work to be done in the area of 
environmental assessment. To summarize we need to be 
proactive and not reactive in our approach to the environment. 
Rather than cleaning up our mistakes after the fact we must take 
steps to prevent environmental damage before it occurs. We 
must get out of the wait and see what happens approach and 
begin to look into the future to make constructive and bold 
moves now.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we must lead by example and do 
all that we can to protect what is vitally important to the future 
of Canadians, our own environment. We must ensure that the 
environment that we leave to our children is as good or in better 
condition than that which we inherited.
<P>
	Many will recognize that this is the Brundtland definition of 
sustainable development and in my view this is the direction in 
which we should be heading. We must protect our land and our 
resources to ensure that our children have clean water, 
sustainable forests and unpolluted crop land. We need to ensure 
that when we build a bridge, a hydroelectric plant or a landfill 
that it does not harm the environment, that it does not affect our 
air, our waterways or our lands.
<P>
	One way to ensure that projects are safe for the environment is 
to systematically identify potential environmental 
consequences of projects before they are started. Unwanted 
environmental impacts on people, their way of life and their 
livelihood must be minimized. Environmental assessment 
attempts to predict the effects of potential environmental 
proposals prior to their becoming a reality.
<P>
	To give some historical perspective, I would like to give some 
background on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
The federal government has used environmental assessment 
since 1974 to predict the potential effects of proposed projects 
under federal government jurisdiction. Previous federal 
guidelines under the environmental assessment and review 
process had been drafted originally as guidelines. These 
guidelines were only recently elevated to the status of federal 
regulation.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The federal role in environmental assessment has only 
recently expanded to assess projects that have been approved by 
provincial governments taking place on provincial lands. Under 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, assessments are 
applied to all proposals involving federal money, land or 
responsibility, projects for which the federal government holds 
decision making authority. Federal Court of Appeal decisions on 
the Rafferty-Alameda dam in Saskatchewan and on the Oldman 
River in Alberta confirmed this point.
<P>
	When a provincial assessment has been conducted, every 
project, decision or responsibility requires an environmental 
assessment where some federal concerns have not been dealt 
with or where the federal and provincial processes are not on an 
equal footing.
<P>
	Recently we have seen a number of projects challenged on the 
grounds that they involve federal jurisdiction. There are 
currently four types of environmental assessment to address 
different projects and circumstances. These four types, as the 
minister stated earlier, include screening, comprehensive study, 
mediation and review by an independent panel.
<P>
	The first two, screening and comprehensive study, are the 
most preliminary and account for approximately 30,000 
assessments per year or 99 per cent of all federal projects 
assessed. Screening is usually applied to small scale projects 
that are quite straightforward. Comprehensive study is usually 
applied to larger scale, environmentally sensitive projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7433"> 7433 </A></B>
<P>
	Mediation is the third type and is a voluntary approach to 
environmental assessment by which an impartial mediator is 
appointed by the environment minister to help parties resolve 
issues surrounding projects. It is only used when interested 
parties are few and consensus is possible.
<P>
	Finally, when a project requires further evaluation it is 
referred to the Minister of the Environment for review by an 
independent public panel. This is the highest form of review. It 
is usually applied to contentious projects. It is the type we read 
about in the newspapers. It is important for us to note here that 
these contentious projects amount to less than 1 per cent of the 
total projects assessed.
<P>
	These four different evaluation processes provide a range of 
assessments to meet different project needs. However, what is a 
cause for concern is the fact that it is up to the discretion of the 
Minister of the Environment whether he or she may call a public 
review. What about the other side? What if the minister does not 
call for a review when there is pressure to call for one? There 
appears to be a fair amount of discretion regarding the 
minister's option to simply ignore or postpone a review.
<P>
	I have concerns regarding the amount of ministerial 
discretion allowed in the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. For example, the minister may or may not call for a review. 
The minister appoints the mediator or panel members. The 
minister may allow another federal process to be substituted for 
an environmental review and, finally, rather than hire an 
impartial person to fill the head position of the new agency 
created by the act, the minister fills this position through 
appointment, another potential source of patronage.
<P>
	Another concern I have is how this bill will apply to First 
Nations. I trust the government will have the common sense to 
ensure that our environmental assessment laws are applicable to 
all in Canada, to all Canadians. Whether or not this will be the 
case is presently unclear.
<P>
	It appears that First Nations may be exempt from this law as it 
is unclear where native self-government fits into this 
legislation. We cannot have one set of standards for most of the 
country and another set for the remainder. What occurs in one 
area of the country impacts all Canadians. The laws should 
protect all equally.
<P>
	By removing First Nations from federal jurisdiction in 
environmental assessment we are doing not only a disservice to 
the natives but a disservice to all Canadians, present and future 
generations.
<P>
	Up to this point I have been talking about Canadian 
environment assessment as a whole. Bill C-56 deals more 
specifically with three proposed amendments to the act. I would 
now like to deal with each in turn.
<P>
	The first amendment proposed in this bill is to amend the act 
so that intervener funding for public participation in the review 
process is guaranteed. I support this  amendment as it 
encourages increased public participation.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party strongly encourages public involvement in 
government decision making as this allows the opportunity for 
the public to have direct input into environmental decisions 
affecting their lives. However this amendment must be more 
clearly defined as funding is not detailed in the bill. It is my 
view that funds should come from existing environmental 
department budgets and that the budget should not be expanded 
simply to satisfy the amendment.
<P>
	This type of funding can easily be subject to abuse. Therefore 
it requires clear guidelines with minimum and maximum 
amounts established. Distribution of funds must be fair, 
equitable and reasonable.
<P>
	In terms of accountability, recipients of funding must have 
clear guidelines to prevent misuse of funds and to ensure 
taxpayers' dollars realize maximum benefit. This is vitally 
important at a time when public funds are becoming much 
harder to come by and the public is demanding the best use of 
their ever decreasing tax dollar.
<P>
	There are many stakeholders in the environment decision 
making process including federal and provincial governments, 
the private sector and, most important, the public at large. 
Ordinary Canadians are the most directly affected by the 
environmental impact of projects. For this reason intervener 
funding is an important tool and resource as it enables 
Canadians to participate in the process.
<P>
	The second amendment to the act seeks to ensure that 
responses to public panel recommendations must be decided by 
cabinet. This means that decisions to act or to reject panel 
recommendations are not made solely by the Minister of the 
Environment but by cabinet as a whole. This allows for a more 
democratic system of accounting because rather than one person 
holding all the cards, all members of cabinet can debate and vote 
on the issue. It also reduces the likelihood that environmental 
decisions will be subject to the whims of any individual minister 
as government as a whole is given authority on whether or not to 
carry through on these panel recommendations.
<P>
	The third and final amendment to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act proposed in the bill amends 
subsection 24 by proposing to limit the number of assessments 
to one federal assessment per project. This amendment ensures 
that environmental assessments relating to the same project but 
involving more than one responsible authority, for example 
fisheries and industry, are co-ordinated to avoid duplication.
<P>
	Normally when a project is proposed an assessment would be 
triggered immediately. For example, building a bridge normally 
triggers several assessments by different departments. In the 
past each department would conduct its own review, resulting in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7434"> 7434 </A></B>
<P>
costly overlap, confusion, duplication and a waste of taxpayers' 
dollars.
<P>
	One federal assessment per project will reduce costly and 
time consuming situations such as the Oldman River dam 
project in Alberta. The overlapping and conflicting assessments 
of the Oldman River resulted in numerous court battles and 
many delays, all at great expense to the taxpayer. The federal 
government assessment was forced through the courts while the 
province refused to participate. It was simply an impossible 
situation.
<P>
	Canadians cannot afford to have various departments within 
government conducting reviews over and over again. Such 
extravagant spending as displayed by former governments is 
clearly not acceptable today. Canadians are demanding one 
single comprehensive approach to environmental assessment. 
One federal assessment per project is clearly a step in the right 
direction. However it is not enough to have one federal 
environmental assessment. We need to have one environmental 
assessment, period; not one federal assessment followed by a 
similar provincial assessment.
<P>
	While we may reduce the number of federal assessments we 
still need to address the fact that federal efforts are duplicated by 
the provinces. The federal government cannot legislate one 
assessment within Canada because it can only legislate where it 
has jurisdiction. The provinces also have environmental 
jurisdiction. The fact remains that with two levels of 
environmental assessment there is simply too much duplication, 
overlap, confusion and conflict.
<P>
	We are still faced with the reality that federal assessments and 
provincial assessments may conflict. Even if the two 
assessments agree, a second one is clearly unproductive. The 
funds going to the second assessment would be better utilized 
elsewhere.
<P>
	We need a common set of environmental standards and goals 
for both federal and provincial levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	We require federal-provincial harmonization agreements 
worked out and signed by the provinces and the federal 
government. In this way we will have one set of rules and truly 
one joint assessment per project.
<P>
	It is not enough for the government to say that it is working 
toward federal-provincial harmonization agreements. We have 
had enough talk. Now we need action. These agreements must be 
worked out and signed immediately.
<P>
	At present there is only one federal-provincial harmonization 
agreement in place and that is with Alberta. There are nine other 
provinces that still need to sign on as well as the ambiguity with 
native self-government ironed out.
<P>
	It is clearly the time for federal and provincial governments to 
begin to work together on environmental matters. It is important 
that we avoid turf wars between the two levels of government 
and aim toward common goals because the environment clearly 
has no borders. When it comes to the environment we must put 
our differences aside for the common good of all Canadians for 
this generation and generations to come.
<P>
	Environmental protection should not be viewed, as with some 
members of the official opposition, as meddling in someone 
else's area of jurisdiction. Environmental degradation affects 
the country as a whole. When one area of the country is faced 
with severe depletion of fish stocks or another area prospers 
from its forest industry, the effects ripple throughout the 
country.
<P>
	When it comes to environmental concerns, all Canadians are 
environmentalists as are all members within the House. We may 
differ on how to attain various environmental goals but 
protection of our environment is common to all of us.
<P>
	The question is not whether we should base our legislation on 
federal or provincial regulation but how best the two parties can 
satisfy their concerns and come up with one comprehensive set 
of regulations.
<P>
	Environmental assessment should be conducted jointly with 
the provinces where there is an overlap in jurisdiction. When a 
federal and provincial assessment has been triggered, both 
levels of government should work together to assess the project 
rather than each other doing their own study. Clearly this cannot 
and will not happen without one set of standards and a common 
goal should be shared by both parties.
<P>
	It is my hope and expectation that the minister has taken the 
effort to consult with the provinces and that the legislation and 
the amendments being brought forward today have had the input 
of each of the provinces. It is vitally important that any new 
regulations meet their needs in order for harmonization 
agreements on the environmental assessment process to proceed 
as smoothly and as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Given the nature of Canadian federal and provincial programs 
overlap is inevitable. Environment was not considered when the 
Canadian Constitution was drafted resulting in confusion for 
both levels of government. Even exclusive jurisdiction over any 
particular area fails to guarantee there will be no overlap. The 
division of responsibilities has often resulted in conflict 
between the two powers and has compromised our decision 
making abilities.
<P>
	Environmental assessment has been one of the most 
contentious areas of conflict between federal and provincial 
powers. Both levels of government have legitimate roles to play 
in environment and resource management. However both 
parties must demonstrate a will to set aside their differences and 
work toward the common goal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7435"> 7435 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the government's first priorities should be the 
elimination of overlap because duplication wastes public funds 
at a time when our dollars are in short supply. A single unified 
approach to the environment and environmental assessment in 
particular would result in greater effectiveness with less 
confusion.
<P>
	Intergovernmental harmonization agreements co-ordinate 
activities and clarify roles while at the same time ensuring that 
common objectives and goals are attained. Clearly smooth and 
efficient federal-provincial relations depend upon good 
working relationships and shared policy objectives. For this to 
occur, federal-provincial relations must take a co-operative 
rather than a competitive approach.
<P>
	To illustrate the horrendous cost of duplication, according to a 
Treasury Board study 45 per cent of federal programs resulting 
in expenditures of over $40 billion overlap and compete to 
varying degrees with provincial programs. We simply cannot 
afford this duplication of services.
<P>
	In conclusion, as much as I support the initiative to reduce 
environmental assessments to one project and one federal 
assessment, I support it only as a step in the right direction, a 
step toward one joint federal-provincial assessment. Until the 
final step of harmonization is achieved with all 10 provinces we 
will not have reached the ultimate goal of truly one 
environmental assessment per project.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> During the next five hours

maximum subject to 10 minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate on Bill 
C-56, an Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. This bill will improve some components of the federal 
environmental assessment process.
<P>
	I will take a few minutes to describe briefly the object and 
scope of the amendments before the House and to try and 
explain the principles behind this reform.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to emphasize that these amendments 
reflect the commitments made in the red book, which is the 
agenda of the Liberal Party of Canada. Our government is 
determined to keep these commitments which were made during 
the last election campaign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In our view the three amendments are not only essential to the 
effective implementation of the federal environmental 
assessment process but are also in keeping with the expectations 
of the main stakeholders.
<P>
	We introduced a whole chapter in the red book on sustainable 
development. We committed ourselves to installing an auditor 
general of the environment and sustainable development. The 
minister has already introduced reforms in that regard. We 
committed ourselves to installing a task force on the economic 
instruments that would favour the environment and sustainable 
development. The task force is now at work and will present a 
report to the ministers of finance and of the environment for 
eventual inclusion of their recommendations into the February 
budget.
<P>
	We committed ourselves to an environmental industry 
strategy. The strategy has now been introduced to try to help 
environmental technologies develop themselves and improve 
their strength and efficiency in Canada for the betterment of our 
sustainable development strategy overall. We committed 
ourselves to a review of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act which by the way is a statutory requirement. 
This is now in process.
<P>
	Perhaps the key element of our sustainable development 
reforms and resolve is contained in the proclamation of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act to which we 
committed ourselves. We truly believe and are convinced that 
environmental assessment is the key element to pollution 
prevention, to a better environmental standard which leads to 
quality of life and a sustainable society.
<P>
	Two of the amendments presented in Bill C-56 are aimed at 
meeting repeated requests by environmental protection groups 
from across Canada in recent years. The third amendment is 
designed to reduce uncertainty and delays in the application of 
the federal environmental assessment process, a concern which 
is shared by all stakeholders and certainly by the provinces.
<P>
	If I could speak to the first amendment which has to do with 
participant funding, it provides for the legal guarantee of a 
participant funding program designed to encourage Canadians 
to take part in public hearings held by environmental assessment 
review panels.
<P>
	Participant funding is a major concern of environmental 
groups and is quite understandable. I should explain that the 
environmental assessment of major projects that are subject to 
public hearings is an extremely complex exercise. Generally 
speaking the environmental assessment of major projects results 
in several volumes of technical information. For example, in the 
case of Great Whale several thousands pages of information had 
to be produced and studied. We cannot expect informed public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7436"> 7436 </A></B>
<P>
participation unless the groups representing the citizens at large 
who are directly affected by a project have access to funding to 
state their case.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Participation in the environmental assessment process 
requires staff, it requires technical resources for analysing 
reports, drafting a response, preparing briefs and presenting 
views at public hearings let alone the travel to various points in 
the land. It is a simple matter of equity.
<P>
	Some environmental groups and public community groups 
are faced with tremendous odds when up against huge 
institutions and corporations which have unlimited funding to 
present their case. The need for participant funding is not new. It 
was identified many years ago. The 1987 white paper on the 
reform of the federal environment review process entitled 
``Reforming Federal Environmental Assessment'' addressed 
this need and proposed the establishment of a participant 
funding program.
<P>
	Following national public consultation carried out as part of 
the reform, some funding was made available by the previous 
government. The funds were administered by the Federal 
Environmental Assessment Review Office, FEARO, and were 
provided to participants in the activities of federal or joint 
panels reviewing such projects as, for example, Soligaz in 
Quebec, the St. Marguerite hydroelectric project in Quebec and 
the Vancouver airport project.
<P>
	However, the previous government refused to make a firm 
commitment or to guarantee participant funding for all the 
environmental assessments. In this respect the current wording 
of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act is 
unsatisfactory for it simply allows a minister to create a 
participant funding program.
<P>
	The wording of Bill C-56 goes much further. It creates the 
obligation to establish a participant funding program in keeping 
with the Liberal Party's red book commitment which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act to legally recognize intervener funding as an integral component of the 
assessment process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what we are doing by this very important amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second amendment provides for only one federal 
assessment per project. It results from the more general 
commitment made by the government to improve the efficiency 
of federal government services and to significantly reduce 
duplication. This amendment will ensure that, to the extent 
possible, only one federal environmental assessment will be 
conducted with respect to a project.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act already 
contains many provisions to avoid duplicating similar 
provincial processes. It provides for delegation of authority 
where pre-assessments, comprehensive studies and follow-up 
programs are concerned. It also provides for signing 
harmonization agreements and creating ``single windows'' in 
each of the provinces. The  Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act also includes provisions to facilitate the work 
of joint panels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Several years ago I happened to be minister of the 
environment for Quebec. At that time I negotiated long and hard 
with the federal minister of the time, Mr. McMillan, to try and 
get to the very position we are in today in the act, which is to 
have some sort of a process whereby the federal government and 
the provinces would be able to install joint panels. In the case of 
provincial jurisdictions there would be provincial panels with 
the federal government sending observers if it had an interest in 
the project, or vice versa, or sometimes mixed panels.
<P>
	I remember a case that was under discussion, the airport in 
Saint-Jean, where unfortunately we were not able to arrive at a 
conclusion of this process. Now we will be able to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This amendment has two goals. First, it seeks to co-ordinate 
information requirements throughout the federal civil service, 
should a project be subject to more than one study under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	For example, when a project funded by the federal 
government also requires a permit under the regulation, it is 
theoretically possible that two different assessments will be 
necessary. In such cases, we want to give the developer the 
assurance that the assessment will meet the requirements of all 
the federal authorities involved.
<P>
	Time is the other aspect of this amendment. Whenever 
possible, we want the environmental assessment to meet the 
information needs of federal authorities for the duration of the 
project. We want to avoid asking the developer to conduct an 
assessment at the planning stage, another one at the 
implementation stage, another one when work is temporarily 
interrupted and another one when equipment is no longer used 
and activities are permanently shut down.
<P>
	It is true that the legislation in its present form contains some 
provisions requiring co-operation among federal authorities. 
For example, section 12 stipulates that where there are more 
than one responsible authority in relation to a project, they shall 
together determine the manner in which to perform their 
respective duties and functions. Nothing in the existing 
legislation forces them to require only one assessment for each 
project. This is totally unacceptable if our goal is to have a 
coordinated, effective and consistent process, and I am sure it is 
the goal we are all pursuing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7437"> 7437 </A></B>
<P>
	With this amendment, the federal government is doing its 
share. The amendment is designed to meet the legitimate 
expectations of those who are justifiably opposed to conducting 
more than one environmental assessment for the federal 
government. Combined with the current harmonization 
initiative undertaken by the Canadian Council of Ministers of 
the Environment, I am hopeful that this amendment will help us 
reach our ultimate goal, which is to conduct only one 
environmental assessment with respect to a project, no matter 
how many authorities are involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure the third amendment will contribute to curbing 
Canadians growing dissatisfaction with government and to 
restoring parliamentary integrity.
<P>
	Again I would like to quote the Liberal Party's red book which 
addresses this particular problem. On page 87 it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people are irritated with governments that do not consult them, or that 
disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of the public business 
behind closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The manner in which the previous government dealt with 
panel recommendations certainly fueled the public's 
dissatisfaction with Canada's democratic institutions. Indeed, 
when a major project raised public concerns, the scenario was 
always the same. A review panel was established. It studied the 
possible impacts of the project for months and sometimes even 
for years. It consulted the public affected by the project. It then 
drafted a detailed report containing specific recommendations.
<P>
	However, as soon as one of these reports reached a federal 
minister's desk, unexplainable things would happen. In some 
cases the minister responsible would examine the report and 
make a decision without consulting his or her colleagues. In 
other cases the cabinet would meet to study the 
recommendations of the panel and would decide, for its own 
reasons which it did not have to divulge, to ignore the most 
important ones. In most cases the previous government's 
decisions were completely out of line with the key 
recommendations set out in the panel's reports.
<P>
	Under certain circumstances I agree that this may be perfectly 
justified. Unlike panel members, who are appointed and who are 
not accountable to the public, the members of government are 
elected to make decisions.
<P>
	This said, it is in our view unacceptable for a government to 
entrust a panel of experts with a task of examining an issue and 
with consulting the public and then to turn around and reject 
their recommendations with no explanation for its decision. 
Environmental protection groups and the media were very often 
critical of previous governments' decisions.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	In most cases they felt that short term economic and political 
gains would take precedence over the long term environmental 
benefits that form the basis of most recommendations made in 
the panel reports.
<P>
	If the government systematically ignores the panel's 
recommendations, it will be difficult to restore the public's 
confidence in our institutions, be it in regard to the environment 
or otherwise. In fact the principle of public consultation itself is 
thus called into question.
<P>
	It will also be very difficult to convince proponents to comply 
with the process and to find qualified individuals to serve on the 
panels. Besides, it will not be easy to convince affected 
Canadians to take part in the hearings. How can we hope to 
encourage public participation if the government is completely 
free to ignore all recommendations and if it is not required to 
provide the reasons behind its decisions? Under these 
circumstances, how will the government be able to convince 
Canadians that it made the right decision in the first place?
<P>
	The point is not to tie the hands of decision makers and to give 
non-elected panel members decision making powers, but rather 
to restore a proper and judicious balance. If the government 
decides to accept the recommendations of an environmental 
assessment panel, everyone wins. However, should it decide to 
accept certain recommendations and to reject others, it will be 
required to provide explanations. If its explanations are clear, 
the integrity of the environmental review process will remain 
intact.
<P>
	The problem that arises from the desire to strike a balance 
between ministerial prerogative and the recommendations of 
environmental assessment panels was addressed in the 1987 
white paper to which I have referred before on the reform of the 
federal assessment process.
<P>
	The proposed amendment will require the responsible 
minister to draft a response to the recommendations of an 
environmental assessment panel. This response will have to be 
examined and approved by the governor in council, in other 
words by the cabinet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill meets real needs, and it improves the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. The government's goal is to 
have only one federal assessment on any given project. The 
creation of a participant funding program will encourage 
Canadians to participate in the hearings conducted by review 
panels.
<P>
	Finally, the principle of openness in government will apply, 
because the government will have to respond officially to the 
recommendations made by review panels. Those amendments 
will contribute to restore public trust in federal democratic 
<P>

<P>
institutions. The government intends to proclaim the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act in January 1995.
<P>
	The four required regulations have been published in Part II of 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I> on October 19. The amendments before us 
should be passed as soon as possible, because all Canadians 
stand to gain from their early implementation after the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act has been proclaimed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The environment knows no boundaries. It is a matter of 
equity. It is a matter of common sense. It is a matter of a 
sustainable society for all of us besides the coming generations.
<P>
	I could not help but find it strange when the critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois referred to-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-a guardianship being forced on the province of Quebec. The 
Bloc Quebecois also claims that profound changes have been 
made since the present Leader of the Opposition introduced the 
bill a few years ago. The amazing thing is that, since the 
environment minister made her statement on the proclamation 
of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, there has not 
been a single question asked about that so-called jurisdictional 
calamity. There have been questions on all sorts of things, and 
countless questions on tobacco. But the environment does not 
seem to be such an important issue.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	In fact, not a single question was asked about such a 
supposedly important decision as putting the province under 
guardianship. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition himself and 
his party's critic had every opportunity to make any statement 
they liked on the subject. There were only two, one just before 
the 1993 election and another on October 13, 1994, to the 
<I>Gazette</I>, in which he said that he was satisfied with the law and 
that there was no petty squabble between Mr. Parizeau and him 
on this subject, because he approved of the law and thought that 
it was a good one.
<P>
	We must set our petty squabbles aside and realize that the 
environment is much larger than all of us, that we must 
co-operate and have the will to work together. That is what we 
want to do, on this side of the House, by presenting these 
amendments. We want to be co-operative, positive and build 
things for ourselves and future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a short question of the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis. I will not take all of the ten minutes 
and I will leave ample time for him to answer. As he said before 
in his speech, the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis was 
Minister of the Environment in the Quebec government at one 
point.
<P>
	I would like him to explain in clear and simple terms how he 
can justify his support for the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act when his former government, through the 
former Minister for the Environment, Mr. Paradis-if we can 
mention his name in this House-succeeded in obtaining 
unanimity in the provincial legislature, not only a sovereignist 
vote, not only a partisan vote, but unanimity, on the position of 
the then Liberal government of Quebec, his former government, 
being against any intrusion on the part of the federal government 
in the area of environmental assessment.
<P>
	I think the former Minister of the Environment could easily 
explain the change of opinion he experienced while going from 
the Quebec to the Ottawa government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Mr. Speaker, I cannot answer for Mr. Paradis, 
but all I can say is that when I was environment minister in 
Quebec, I had appointed an associate deputy minister, Mr. 
Divay, who worked actively with the federal government to seek 
the kind of administrative agreement which was signed today 
between Alberta and the federal government.
<P>
	In fact, I could quote several cases of joint work which was 
done as actively as possible, for example, in the case of 
Sainte-Marguerite, in the case of the Lachine canal, which is a 
current case where joint panels have been established between 
the federal and provincial governments. In fact, I would like to 
refer the hon. member for Terrebonne to a statement which was 
made just recently to the Montreal<I> Gazette</I> by the Leader of the 
Opposition-unfortunately, I cannot find my quote, but in any 
case, it is official, it is widely known and I would be very 
pleased to send it to the hon. member for Terrebonne-where the 
Leader of the Opposition is criticizing Mr. Paradis for getting 
angry.
<P>
	He says in the <I>Gazette</I>: ``I do not know why Mr. Paradis got so 
excited, because that legislation is a very good piece of 
legislation''. So, perhaps the hon. member for Terrebonne 
should speak to his leader and ask him why he thought that Mr. 
Paradis got too angry when he intervened on Bill C-13. There 
were several quotes from the Leader of the Opposition. I will 
quote his statement to Mr. Jean-François Lisée on October 21, 
1993. Mr. Jean-François Lisée asked him: ``What is going to 
happen? Are you going to oppose Jacques Parizeau if he comes 
to power in a few months?'', speaking about Bill C-13, the same 
legislation we are talking about today. This was just before the 
election, a few days before the election, and he answered: ``Oh 
no, Mr. Parizeau will also abide by the law. The P.Q. has 
accepted the position''.
<P>
	But later, just recently, a few days ago, he said repeatedly that 
the bill is well-founded, that he does not see in it any federal and 
provincial jurisdictional quarrel and that there is a way to find a 
common ground if we arrive at some agreements. That is what 
we want to do, that is what I tried to do as environment minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7439"> 7439 </A></B>
<P>
in  Quebec. For me, the environment has always been much 
more important than jurisdictional quarrels and petty squabbles.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I believe that every one must respect each other's 
jurisdictions, but we must do it in a constructive way, by trying 
to find solutions instead of confrontational elements. That has 
always been my position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has stated that she is working toward provincial 
harmonization. I would like to draw on the member's expertise 
as a former Quebec environment minister because we seem to 
have a number of opposing forces at work. I applaud the 
Liberal's initiative to work toward harmonization. However we 
have a government in Quebec that is saying that environment is 
its jurisdiction. In the member's experience, is harmonization 
going to happen, will it happen and can it happen with the forces 
that are opposing each other in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my 
colleague who is a fellow member of the committee on 
environment and sustainable development, as is the member for 
Terrebonne. We show in committee that we can work in great 
harmony and in a very positive climate regardless of party 
stripes. It has always been my view that this is the way to do it.
<P>
	For one year I was president of the Council of Environment 
Ministers of Canada. I found there was a tremendous amount of 
goodwill. Sure there were quarrels and disputes as regards 
jurisdiction. There always will be in a federal system. There 
always will be in any system. That is the way the world works. 
At the same time, if we put our differences aside, we can find 
ways to harmonize our views and our objectives.
<P>
	For example, the Canadian Council of Environment Ministers 
has been actively working. Civil servants from the federal 
government and every province have been working together for 
a particular harmonization protocol on this very question of 
environmental assessment. It has worked very actively.
<P>
	During the term of Minister Paradis who unfortunately is no 
longer minister because the government was defeated, Mr. 
Paradis insisted and made sure that a senior civil servant from 
Quebec was present and took an active part in the deliberations. 
Unfortunately that is no longer the case because since 
proclamation of the act Quebec has withdrawn its 
representative. All the other provinces are working actively. The 
minister has written to Quebec's minister praying that he rejoin 
the ranks.
<P>
	I am certain that agreements can be put into place that respect 
fully the provincial jurisdictions. The federal government does 
not want to encroach. All it wants to do is to ensure that when 
federal prerogatives such as the Fisheries Act are involved that 
it complies with the dictates of the Supreme Court, it complies 
with the wishes of Canadians and that among us and between us 
instead of duplicating our efforts we make them complementary, 
integrate them for the benefit of all of us.
<P>
	I am convinced we can do that. We have to have the resolve 
and that resolve starts among us here. If it is transmitted along 
and the provincial governments realize that we want to 
co-operate, to act together rather than confront, it is going to 
happen. I hope it is going to happen too with the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a short question in the interests of time for 
the parliamentary secretary who I know has done a tremendous 
amount of work on the proclamation of the act.
<P>
	Talking about provincial jurisdiction and joint panels, joint 
panels are something I am very supportive of. I believe the act 
has gone a long way to ensuring that joint panels will be able to 
do the job.
<P>
	However, can the parliamentary secretary explain how the 
government will attempt to prevent certain confrontations that 
will exist with the provinces? The public examples which have 
brought us to the act we have today are the Rafferty-Alameda 
dam in Saskatchewan and the Oldman dam in Alberta. Both are 
examples where the provinces, the proponents of the projects 
were adamant about no federal involvement in environmental 
assessment. At the same time these projects point out the 
incredible need for adequate environmental assessment. The 
proclaimed act which was Bill C-13 has gone a long way to deal 
with that.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary give us some idea of how he 
thinks the government will deal with conflicts with provinces 
which are for the most part proponents of projects that are 
problems?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, much has changed since the cases 
referred to by my hon. colleague. First there is a Supreme Court 
decision which makes it quite clear that when the federal 
government has a jurisdiction it not only should get involved, it 
has the duty and obligation to get involved. It does not have any 
chance or opportunity to escape. It must get involved.
<P>
	There was a timidity before on the part of the federal 
government to intervene where it had a clear case of 
jurisdiction, for example on Canadian waters, on fisheries. Now 
this case is clear. There has been pressure from the Canadian 
public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7440"> 7440 </A></B>
<P>
to say to their federal government that it has to get involved 
because it represents a big part of the total jurisdiction.
<P>
	What will happen now in the case of the provinces and the 
federal government is that there will be a sensitization that they 
have to work together, that we cannot confront each other any 
more. I think this will happen.
<P>
	There was a recent case in my own province. The Lachine 
Canal has been an example of a problem which could have led to 
confrontation but a joint panel was extremely effective and 
under the provincial system works extremely well. That is going 
to become the practical way of doing things in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say to my colleague from 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis that I understood something from 
his speech. He is in favour of doing away with overlapping 
provided the issue is resolved in favour of the federal 
government. I think I understood that correctly. We are against 
overlaps, move over, we will take all the room, this way 
everybody will be happy. Except he was not quite that blunt.
<P>
	It is with great interest that I rise to speak on Bill C-56 and the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. That legislation was 
to create a new agency to assess all projects which could have an 
environmental impact. As you will notice, there is no way I can 
agree with that legislation. Indeed, as an elected representative 
from Quebec and a defender of Quebec's interest, I must express 
my dissatisfaction with the federal government's interference 
with provincial affairs.
<P>
	As we all know-and the Minister of the Environment knows 
it as well-there is in Quebec, as in other Canadian provinces, 
an office of environmental assessment. We call it the BAPE. The 
mandate of this bureau is to assess projects that have an 
environmental impact, and it has acquired an international 
reputation. Quebec is a leader in the area of environmental 
assessment.
<P>
	Moreover, the new Minister of the Environment in Quebec 
announced recently that they would legislate to include 
assessment of industrial projects into the existing assessment 
process, even though these projects were already assessed by his 
department. The Bureau d'audiences publiques pour 
l'environnement, or BAPE, is a complete, efficient, open and 
credible process, which answers very well the needs of the 
population.
<P>
	The federal government, by promulgating this legislation and 
tabling regulations on a wide range of projects, imposes a 
standard system to all provinces regardless of the work already 
done by the bureau, in Quebec. The Quebec assessment process 
is operating smoothly and it has proven its worth. Therefore, the 
federal assessment process will only superimpose itself, adding 
to the many duplications we already have in our federal system. 
This bureau will make public administration more cumbersome 
and the debt will keep on growing.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	There will be a Quebec bureau and a Canadian agency, both 
dedicated to the evaluation of projects which could have an 
impact on the environment. Not only will this situation make 
public administration more cumbersome and very costly, but it 
will also be the source of tremendous headaches for proponents 
who will never know to whom they should report. Moreover, 
there is no set timeframe, which could unduly prolong the 
federal evaluation process.
<P>
	On the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact, as I said earlier, 
that the previous Liberal government in Quebec was strongly 
opposed to this bill. Mr. Pierre Paradis, the then environment 
minister, who was a strong supporter of Canadian federalism, 
denounced this bill, going as far as saying, appearing before the 
Senate, that this piece of legislation was a reflection of a 
domineering and authoritarian federalism. It is Mr. Paradis, a 
strong supporter of federalism, and not separatists, who shed 
this light on this bill.
<P>
	Needless to say, at the time, the National Assembly had 
unanimously supported the environment and wildlife minister in 
his fight. What we are talking about here has nothing to do with 
political affiliation or petty squabbles; it is simply a matter of 
plain common sense. Quebecers are outraged by the 
ludicrousness of this bill and of the situation it is creating and 
will create. The total lack of flexibility on the part of this 
government which refuses to take the Quebec process into 
account while amending the act, should not come as a surprise.
<P>
	Moreover, the government seems to forget that the issue of 
environmental assessment is part of the federal-provincial 
harmonization process, as the parliamentary secretary to the 
environment minister mentioned earlier. The process is part of 
the agenda of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment, but while discussions are still ongoing, the 
federal government decides to interfere. What is the point then 
of having any discussion? We can easily predict what the famous 
four-year, $12 million health forum will result in. The report 
must already be written and just waiting to be published. The 
government forgot that the federal-provincial environment 
harmonization process was on the agenda. To what extent should 
we trust this exercise if, at the very first opportunity, the 
government overlooks Quebec's demands and 
recommendations?
<P>
	The government is lending a deaf ear to Quebecers, in spite of 
the fact that they have unanimously expressed their displeasure 
loud and clear.
<P>
	I would like to quote a member from the other party, the 
Liberal member for Ottawa Centre. ``The time has come for the 
different levels of government to agree on a somewhat clearer 
definition of jurisdictions''. That is a Liberal speaking. ``It 
seems to me that the two levels of government should get 
together on matters of environment''. We agree with that. ``The 
minister should take a deep breath, go back a ways and consider  
this goal, that is the co-operation of all parties concerned with 
environmental protection''. Quebec is one of them. ``The gov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7441"> 7441 </A></B>
<P>
ernment must make sure everybody follows suit because if 
another level of government does not approve of federal 
measures, this bill is doomed to failure''. These are his own 
words.
<P>
	By its attitude the federal government is mocking the 
intelligence and common sense of Quebecers. After having 
flouted their legitimate claims, how can the government come 
back to the table in order to integrate federal and provincial 
assessment processes? In any case, after such an insult, there 
will be one player missing at the table, the Quebec Minister of 
Environment having recalled his players to Quebec.
<P>
	As a result, there will be another unavoidable confrontation, 
this time on environmental matters. Considering the 
government's attitude about this question, the future of these 
negotiations is not promising. Moreover, with Bill C-56, the 
government is charging blindly in an area where jurisdictions 
are very vaguely defined.
<P>
	As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the decision 
regarding <I>Friends of the Old Man Society</I>, ``in the context of a 
federal constitution, environmental management should not be 
considered as a constitutional unit coming under only one level 
of government''.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious in this case that the government is ignoring the 
recommendations it has received from all sides on the issue of 
the environment.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister is trying to minimize the controversy 
about Bill C-56 by mentioning that this bill was first introduced 
by the Leader of the Opposition when he was himself 
environment minister.
<P>
	As Mr. Yergeau, a lawyer specialized in environmental law, 
explained so clearly in an article published in a 1992 issue of the 
daily newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>, many words are being put in Mr. 
Bouchard's mouth after the fact. In addition, must we remind 
our friends opposite, who can have a short memory at times, that 
Mr. Bouchard has since found out that the federal system does 
not work and never will? He has had the courage of his 
convictions and left the party. That too should be pointed out.
<P>
	In a speech given on November 3, 1989, the Leader of the 
Opposition said that the governments should take note of the 
three realities dictated by the very nature of environmental 
problems to be resolved. About the second reality, he said-and 
I am repeating the quote from my colleague from Laurentides 
because it is very important to understand this-that in grey 
areas, where the roles were not clearly defined in the 
Constitution, co-operation was essential. He added that, at a 
time when we were realizing that fighting for the environment is 
fighting for life itself and that this fight must be taken up 
worldwide and not be limited to our individual jurisdictions, our 
fellow citizens would not understand  and even less tolerate a 
wrestling match between federal and provincial politicians.
<P>
	This certainly puts matters in perspective, I would say. 
Clearly, the federal government approach was not in keeping 
with the spirit of the bill. In addition, the legislation introduced 
today incorporates major amendments which are in line with the 
bill the Leader of the Opposition introduced five years ago, in 
1989. The legislative committee to which the bill was referred 
made some very substantial changes to it in December 1991, and 
several technical changes were made to the legislation between 
December 1991 and June 1992. It is therefore inappropriate to 
present this bill as coming from the Leader of the Opposition. 
Much water has flowed under the bridge since then.
<P>
	In conclusion, the only consequence of this bill will be, once 
again, to foster duplication under our federal system. Quebecers 
rose up and unanimously expressed their dissatisfaction through 
all the means at their disposal, but the federal government, 
again, did not listen to them.
<P>
	Even federalists recognized the absurdity of putting in place a 
second review panel, but no one listened to them. Even during 
negotiations to harmonize federal and provincial efforts in this 
area, the federal government seized the first opportunity to 
reject Quebec's demands. It is bad faith, pure and simple.
<P>
	We are constantly being reminded that it is a red book 
promise. The government failed to deliver on many of the 
environmental commitments in the red book. Fortunately, the 
Liberal Party recognized the foolishness of appointing an 
auditor for sustainable development and the environment as 
promised in the red book and was smart enough to put forward 
the recommendations included in the Bloc Quebecois's minority 
report.
<P>
	As for the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 
per cent by the year 2000, it was disavowed by the minister 
herself. She could not or would not understand that an 
environmental goal placed under the responsibility of another 
department-in this case, Energy Canada-was totally 
inconsistent.
<P>
	As far as the environment is concerned, the Liberals would 
undoubtedly like to see some pages of the red book disappear, 
probably through recycling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to what 
the Opposition said, including that member and the critic, or the 
one who has the critic's role-she criticizes the Department of 
the Environment very badly for its efforts to serve all Canadians 
so that they can live in a healthier environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7442"> 7442 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, all I heard was ideological ranting about the arrogance 
of wanting to take Quebec's place in the environmental field.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	They talk about provocation, contempt and arrogance towards 
Quebec. They even talk about a kind of domineering, totalitarian 
federalism. You know, those are not solutions, that is not a 
constructive approach for finding environmental solutions. As 
we know very well, Quebecers are perfectly aware that pollution 
knows no boundaries. Everything that happens in the Great 
Lakes, in the St. Lawrence River and even in the Gulf concerns 
Quebec, although some of these places are outside the province.
<P>
	I believe that Quebec and Quebecers recognize the 
importance of finding a common position with the provinces and 
countries that occupy North America, namely Mexico, Canada 
and the United States. It is false for the member to claim that he 
is defending Quebec's interests and that he speaks for Quebec. 
Some people on this side of the House represent Quebec ridings, 
including myself and many Liberal members, and I can tell you 
that we care a great deal for the environment.
<P>
	I can prove that we Liberals were the ones who dealt with the 
<I>Irving Whale</I> and thanks to the close co-operation of my 
colleagues from the Maritimes, the Department of the 
Environment and the minister, who is from Ontario, we were 
able to solve this problem once and for all.
<P>
	I still find it strange for them to say that the federal 
government does not consider the legitimate demands of 
Quebec, or of its governments. I find it curious that they refer to 
the people to make a distinction: They talk about the people, the 
governments and the Bloc Quebecois' headquarters in Quebec 
City, but they do not necessarily discuss the issues which really 
concern the population. And I find it particularly strange that no 
mention is made of existing administrative agreements between 
the federal government and the province of Quebec in the pulp 
and paper sector.
<P>
	Such an agreement was signed in August, to ensure that pulp 
and paper companies comply with environmental standards not 
only in Quebec but also across the country. I believe that success 
will largely depend on our way of doing things, on a 
co-operative approach between the provinces and with the 
United States and Mexico, to ensure standards which will be 
beneficial to Quebecers but also to every Canadian. In fact, 
Quebec relies on a Canadian policy to ensure a sound 
environment for the benefit of its current population as well as 
its future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, what is the question? This is 
certainly a nice speech. I congratulate the hon. member. I would 
like to know where the members for Outremont and 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine were when the time came 
to speak for Quebec regarding a  debt of $34 million owed to the 
province by their government.
<P>
	As I recall, they applauded when their Prime Minister and 
leader said: ``We will not give you that money back''. And they 
were disappointed when the debt was paid to Quebec. That was 
certainly not the issue.
<P>
	If pollution knows no borders and if Quebec should not get 
involved, then why should Canada? Let the United States look 
after the pollution problem.
<P>
	I do not really understand that argument which they keep 
repeating to us, namely that pollution knows no borders. They 
say Quebec should not get involved because pollution knows no 
borders. Canada should not look after that problem for the same 
reason. This argument is somewhat fallacious and it is not very 
solid. I invite the hon. member to attend the meetings of the 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. He 
will learn a lot.
<P>
	As regards the pulp and paper sector, an administrative 
agreement was indeed signed. Our committee met officials from 
pulp and paper companies. These people do not know all the 
details yet. The reports do not clearly define how harmonization 
will proceed. Some consultations have taken place, but no tax 
agreement was signed and that issue is also not clear. This is my 
answer to the hon. member. If he has any other questions, I will 
be pleased to answer them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has indicated how horrible the 
legislation seems to be.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member can indicate why his 
leader said on May 11, 1990 in the Calgary <I>Herald</I>: ``People 
must not expect the government to get out of the assessment of 
federal projects''. Then he went on in May 1990 in the Calgary 
<I>Sun</I> to say: ``We have jurisdiction, we have responsibilities''. 
Most important, the hon. member's leader said on May 11, 1990 
in the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>: ``I think it is a very profound 
responsibility of this government and any federal government to 
fulfil national responsibility, and environment is very much a 
national responsibility''.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member has any comments in light 
of these statements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, these statements attributed to 
my leader concern the environment in general and not the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. To be able to analyze 
or answer a clear question, one must compare oranges and 
oranges. The member quotes statements made by the Leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois when he was environment minister and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7443"> 7443 </A></B>
<P>
spoke in general terms about ecology and the environment. I do 
agree with my leader, as I often if not always do, that  
environment is a national issue, an international issue, an issue 
for everyone of us to consider.
<P>
	Liberal members say that they are very concerned about the 
environment. Obviously, they are and so are, I am convinced, 
the NDP members, and the Reform members. We are too. But 
that is not the question.
<P>
	The question is this: When dealing with environmental 
assessment and standards, should Quebec's jurisdiction be 
respected as agreed after the Constitution, since there is nothing 
about it in either the 1867 Constitution or the patriated one? I 
believe that we should respect the areas of jurisdiction which 
were defined later on.
<P>
	I also believe that environmental assessment, as Quebec has 
been proving for a long time, and as the Liberal government in 
Quebec voted unanimously, should be Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a very short question. 
Imagine that the Government of Canada has a national standard 
on the environment, say for forestry, but the provincial standard 
is not as high as the national standard. Which one would the 
member suggest be followed?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that forestry is a 
provincial responsibility, like natural resources, education-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Standards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Provincial standards are generally higher 
than federal standards. The highest standard would then apply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
further to my colleague's question, I do not think it was 
answered.
<P>
	I would like to pose that question once again, asking about 
specific standards particularly in federal-provincial 
agreements. Could the hon. member indicate whether or not a 
standard which is lower in Quebec is the standard that would 
apply, or if it would be the federal standard if it were higher?
<P>
	The reason I am asking the question is that I think we have to 
differentiate what the issue is. A separatist is basically 
suggesting that we will accept a lower standard if it is for 
Quebec, rather than a higher standard if it was in the national 
interest. I would like to know.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer my two 
colleagues for the second time. I believe there are national 
standards, uniform standards for the whole country. Mr. 
Parizeau was saying during the election campaign that it would 
be very difficult to have uniform standards in Quebec, in 
forestry for example, so imagine what it would be like for the 
whole country.
<P>
	First, as I said before, under the Constitution Act of 1867, 
forestry is strictly a provincial matter. Then, there is no 
problem. Second, a solution applicable in Vancouver might not 
work in Quebec, not to mention Prince Edward Island. If a 
standard applies to British Columbia-your area I believe-I do 
not think we can conclude that it would automatically apply to 
Quebec where the climate is different, the soil is different, many 
conditions are different. How would the standard apply?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	If you were to ask me about fisheries, I would give you the 
same answer. I do not think that a national standard could apply 
to conditions in Quebec, or in Alberta, or in your riding, 
differences are too large.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the Minister of the Environment for introducing 
these amendments today which are in keeping with the promise 
made in the red book. I would like to make some brief comments 
on the interventions by the member for Laurentides when she 
spoke after the minister today.
<P>
	The hon. member started her analysis by referring to the fact 
that the bill being introduced today which amends the existing 
legislation and the existing legislation have no resemblance 
with the original bill known as Bill C-78 that was introduced 
when the present leader of the Bloc Quebecois was Minister of 
the Environment. She added that some 150 amendments were 
made during the lifetime of that bill before it was proclaimed. 
That statement is quite accurate; I was here and she was not. I 
remember very well that a number of amendments were made 
having been proposed by representatives of the NDP, the 
Conservative Party and my party.
<P>
	In that process of amending it we did what is done with any 
major legislation, namely we improved it. We improved it 
within the limits imposed by the bill itself. Therefore that bill, 
known as Bill C-78 and subsequently as Bill C-13, has the 
thrust, the scope and the four corners, to use the parliamentary 
language, that the original bill had. In that respect the member 
for Laurentides unfortunately is wrong.
<P>
	The hon. member objected to the fact that the final legislation 
introduced the term and definition of sustainable development. 
In evolving time considering the progress that term has made in 
its interpretation it has become natural and almost obvious that 
sustainable development was introduced as one of the objectives 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7444"> 7444 </A></B>
<P>
of  that legislation. I am sure that if the then Minister of the 
Environment and now leader of the Bloc Quebecois had been in 
the position of the present Minister of the Environment, he 
would have proposed the definition to be inserted in the bill 
himself. It goes without saying.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides went on to say that fellow 
citizens will not tolerate quibbling between federal and 
provincial politicians. Having made that statement with which 
we all agree she then devoted the rest of her speech to an 
analysis of the situation which revealed a profound desire to 
disagree with the federal jurisdiction as if she were a provincial 
politician. She even brought into the discussion a judgment of 
the Supreme Court in order to make her case.
<P>
	She was repeatedly dissatisfied or annoyed at the fact that the 
present Minister of the Environment in her speech today was 
referring frequently to her leader, as if that were a sign of lack of 
respect for his present political role, having changed sides, so to 
say.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the hon. member indicated several times that her 
main concern in relation to the bill introduced today is one that 
she would interpret to perform a role that would be tantamount 
to an arrogant attempt to encroach on Quebec's jurisdiction. We 
are not aware of any other province interpreting this bill in that 
manner. Actually this bill is supported by and large by 
provinces. No one has seen this bill as an arrogant 
encroachment.
<P>
	What the member for Laurentides failed to recognize in her 
speech is that if the federal government wanted to encroach on 
the jurisdiction of any province it could do so under the 
provision of peace, order and good government. It could 
intervene anytime but it does not. That is the point. It does not do 
so because there is an unwritten understanding that the peace, 
order and good government clause is to be used only in extreme 
cases when necessity makes it absolutely unavoidable but only 
in such cases.
<P>
	Therefore to proclaim to the world that this bill is an 
encroachment on Quebec's jurisdiction is sheer nonsense. There 
is air, water and a variety of natural resources that all levels of 
government share in the name of the Canadian people. No 
province is exempt from that. Neither is the federal government 
exempt from that basic sense of accountability in relation to 
these natural resources.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides went on to say that this bill is a 
demonstration of the centralizing vision of the federal 
government. I invite any member of the Bloc Quebecois to get 
up in this House and support this statement.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides went on to say that national 
standards are being imposed. Tell us which national standards 
are being imposed. We are searching for national standards. The 
exchange of questions with the member for Fraser Valley West 
already showed how much of an openness of mind there is in the 
search for national standards. It is a very difficult exercise. It is 
much more complex than the wall to wall standardization to 
which the member for Terrebonne referred in his reply. It is a 
difficult exercise, no doubt.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to say that Ottawa could force any 
Quebec project to come under assessment. This is stretching it a 
bit too far. As I said earlier, Ottawa could do that without this 
bill under peace, order and good government if it really wanted 
to but it does not do so. To claim that is a political expedient in 
this House to unnecessarily whip up feelings among 
constituents in Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to quote a distinguished but 
unknown lawyer in Quebec commenting on this legislation. It is 
not difficult these days to find lawyers to comment one way or 
another on any piece of legislation. Then she went on to put on 
record an editorial by a writer well known for her objectivity, 
Lise Bissonnette of <I>Le Devoir</I>. Apparently she has written that 
Ottawa is taking over Quebec's energy policy by means of this 
legislation. How absurd can one be? How can one make that 
statement seriously? We must bring this debate down to earth 
and analyse the legislation for what it is and what it attempts to 
do.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	In a flight of desperation, the member for Laurentides 
announced to the world that the federal government is 
attempting to squash economic development in Quebec. At that 
point I had a moment of dismay because I thought it was a very 
unfortunate statement on the part of the critic for the 
environment for the Bloc Quebecois. At that point she revealed 
that she was not speaking as critic for the environment. She was 
speaking perhaps as a political person instructed to demonstrate 
that federal-provincial relations a priori cannot work in this 
country.
<P>
	However, if she were critic for the environment she would 
have not let her guard down and allowed herself to be accused of 
seeing the economy as separate from the environment as she did 
with her statement. She should know better.
<P>
	We have reached the conclusion in this Chamber, in all the 
parties represented in this House, in their contained literature, at 
the OECD in Paris and in Rio in 1992 that there is a strong link 
between the environment and the economy. In some quarters the 
economic thinking has gone even so far as to say that there is no 
economy without the environment, although that vision has not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7445"> 7445 </A></B>
<P>
yet become official in those institutions and agencies. However, 
we are moving in that direction inevitably so.
<P>
	For the official critic for the environment for the Bloc 
Quebecois to make a statement in which she dissociates the 
economy from the environment I thought was very unfortunate. 
She talked like an old-fashioned economist, an economist of 
100 years ago perhaps, not as a critic for the environment, not as 
a politician who understands the importance of integrating the 
economy with the environment, not as a politician who 
understands that in the end the environment is the first and 
major consideration if we want to have a healthy economy.
<P>
	The speech by the member for Laurentides, I am afraid to say, 
reveals a profound and serious conceptual weakness.
<P>
	To conclude on that intervention, I found in essence the 
speech really was activating the flames of confrontational 
federalism instead of searching for the answers through a form 
of co-operative federalism which was done I thought so 
effectively by many other speakers today and in particular by the 
member for Comox-Alberni whose intervention I found 
extremely helpful. We may perhaps have different political 
views but his intervention in outlining where he finds the bill 
weak and where he finds agreement with the bill is extremely 
helpful. I thank him for that.
<P>
	He asked a very key question which was dealt with briefly but 
I would like to go over it for a moment. His question was what 
if-one of those famous what ifs-the minister does not call for 
a review and there is too much ministerial discretion? That is 
certainly a point that we have to examine and to which the 
parliamentary secretary gave an interesting answer. He said he 
believed that in such a case there would probably be profound 
public displeasure, profound public and media criticism and that 
would be the corrective action that would take place.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a very legitimate question to ask. It falls perfectly within 
the classic jurisdiction of the opposition to do so. I certainly find 
that question worth pursuing in search of a desirable satisfactory 
answer.
<P>
	Another question by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni 
was how the bill would apply to the First Nations. He wants 
clarification on that aspect and we will certainly seek it.
<P>
	In essence it seems that this bill is serving the agenda of the 
Bloc Quebecois in terms of demonstrating that federalism does 
not work because of certain actions taken by Ottawa. That is a 
very regrettable political line to adopt. It is unfortunate and it is 
not in the interest of Canadians no matter where they live.
<P>
	If we were to assume just for a moment that Quebec were 
sovereign, it would be the government of Quebec that would be 
seeking from its neighbours the type of environmental security 
and understanding and processes that this bill and the legislation 
which this bill intends to amend is offering right now. It would 
be one of the first steps of any new government. It is difficult to 
understand  the logic of the Bloc Quebecois in criticizing a bill 
that is already in place, to which improvements are being made, 
to an unacceptable measure under federalism but which it would 
be pursuing and very actively so if it was sovereign in the sense 
it is pursuing it at the present time.
<P>
	There is a contradiction here which does not make sense and 
which I would like to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, 
because it seems that it goes to the root of the debate today on 
Bill C-56.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see you are giving me the signal that my time is 
up. I thank you for your consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Davenport having just spoken I 
was very pleased to be here today to be able to hear his words. I 
have a great deal of respect for the member for Davenport with 
whom I shared a fair bit of time in committee looking at Bill 
C-13, the legislation which preceded that which we are 
amending today.
<P>
	I have a couple of questions based on his comments just now. 
The member indicated quite correctly as I see it some of the 
questions which must be asked about the speech by the member 
for the Bloc Quebecois earlier today. In one of those comments 
on one of those points, the hon. member for Davenport talked 
about C-13 and the way in which it applies in the joint panels, 
the jurisdiction issue.
<P>
	Could the member for Davenport explain a little bit further 
this whole aspect about the trigger mechanism that puts in place 
the joint panels. Could he give, as a member from Quebec, any 
examples at all of where those triggers would interfere with 
Quebec jurisdiction. It is my feeling that the triggers quite 
properly represent federal jurisdiction and perhaps there are no 
provincial jurisdiction issues to be dealt with here. I would like 
to know what the hon. member has to say about that.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, in his remarks he talked about the peace, order and 
good government matter. If I am not mistaken, the member for 
Davenport can correct me if I am, in the committee studying Bill 
C-13 we tried to amend the act to put in a peace, order and good 
government clause but failed to do so.
<P>
	I believe the peace, order and good government clause he is 
referring to exists elsewhere. I wonder if under those 
circumstances he would be supportive of looking at the 
amendment in committee regarding peace, order and good 
government specific to this legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the 
hon. member for Davenport I have a housekeeping matter here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7446"> 7446 </A></B>
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing order 38 to inform the 
House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Davenport-Nuclear testing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his question. Regarding peace, 
order and good government I would not recommend that this 
amendment be put in the legislation at this particular point in 
time. I think it would become the object of incredibly 
acrimonious debates and could endanger the entire exercise. It is 
better that that provision remain where it is now and that it be 
invoked as sparingly as possible. It should be therefore 
considered as an item that would not be invoked in single 
legislation as in the case of Bill C-13.
<P>
	Regarding the trigger mechanism, I have extreme difficulties 
in answering that question. I would also like to know where that 
mechanism ought to be placed and when it ought to be put into 
motion. It is more than a technical question; it is a very 
important political question. I would like to study that matter in 
more depth before trying to give an adequate answer.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member with his political and legal 
knowledge has one in his pocket. I would rather look at his 
before I make up my mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, not wishing to abuse the House time 
but wanting the full benefit of the member's experience, I 
thought I might also ask a question in relation to the specific 
amendments in front of us, particularly the amendment dealing 
with intervener funding.
<P>
	When we sat together on committee in the previous 
Parliament, the hon. member for Davenport was quite 
supportive of intervener funding and in fact had some very 
specific comments about how to put intervener funding into 
place.
<P>
	Given the vagueness of the intervener funding amendment in 
front of us today, would the member be willing to consider 
supporting a much broader and perhaps more detailed 
amendment specific to intervener funding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a well-established rule that 
a chair of a committee should play as impartial a role as 
possible. Not only that, but the chair should not take a route or a 
position before an analysis and examination of a bill takes place 
in committee. The member for Davenport happens to be the 
chair of the committee on the environment and sustainable 
development. It really would not be appropriate to indicate what 
he would entertain or support, considering the fact that in most 
cases the decision is made by the members with the chair 
abstaining.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure the government, having introduced this amendment, 
will be willing to look at any positive contributions made in 
order to make the legislation more effective.
<P>
	I would like to give that assurance to the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this bill today.
<P>
	I must compliment the chair of the environmental committee, 
the hon. member for Davenport, who has an outstanding 
reputation of being fair and quite articulate on this issue. He did 
make a comment about serving the agenda of the Bloc. I do not 
know how one can get away from that agenda. I guess they are 
just going to call it the way they want and regardless of whether 
the issue is in the national interest of Canadians, we are going to 
get it from them as far as the separatist agenda is concerned.
<P>
	I suppose what we have today is a party of good intentions 
here with the Liberals and a party of ``what's in it for me'' from 
the separatists. That is truly unfortunate when it comes to the 
environment.
<P>
	The member for Comox-Alberni, who is our critic for the 
environment, raised some very good questions-they were 
addressed by the member for Davenport-about some 
precautions that should be taken in a bill such as this. 
Precautions such as, how do the aboriginal peoples fit into this? 
Do they come under this umbrella? I certainly hope they do. 
What kind of costs will be involved in assessments? I realize we 
are cost conscious. I am sure the government will keep that in 
mind and the idea of a single track, the division of 
responsibility.
<P>
	In my previous job, doing a lot of construction in the hundreds 
of millions of dollars, our biggest problem was duplicity of roles 
with federal fisheries, for instance. It was really a nightmare 
when you are trying to develop projects in the $20 million range, 
trying to deal with federal and provincial fisheries and every 
other bureaucrat who can get involved in these things. They tend 
to just look at the words that are written down in black and white 
and overlook the fact that there are some very good projects out 
there. They tend to be, I think, overly protective and in some 
cases overly pushy.
<P>
	Rather than just push one way, the environment is a two-way 
street. It is something we have to keep in mind.
<P>
	We support Bill C-56 and I am glad to speak to that support. I 
do not often get to say this to the Liberal government, but it has 
come a fair distance to the way our party thinks. It is quite easy 
to stand here and talk about the failures in the criminal justice 
system, immigration and finance. However, you have to give 
credit where credit is due and it is due here today.
<P>
	Why should we not support such an environmental bill? 
Canada's identity should be rooted in a fresh appreciation for 
our land. We have gone too long without a renewal of our 
appreciation for our land. A lot of  things that happen today, the 
garbage that is strewn throughout our countryside, shows that 
we need a fresh appreciation of things. That applies to young 
people as much as to business people today. More often than not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7447"> 7447 </A></B>
<P>
a project must be developed and built and environmental 
impacts are overlooked. Our vision for the future is inspired by 
the importance of our well-being, of exploring, developing, 
renewing and conserving our environment. We have to leave our 
young people with something. We have to leave them with a 
good, clean environment and that is where this bill comes in. We 
also have to leave them with a little of their pay cheque, which 
the government has not got into its mind set yet but we will get it 
there eventually. Meanwhile the government is coming along on 
the environment so we will applaud it for that.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	We strongly support ensuring that all Canadians and their 
descendants live in a clean and healthy environment. I suppose 
we all do that, notwithstanding political agendas, with the 
exception of this separatist body here from which I am hearing 
that there are almost two standards; a federal standard and a 
Quebec standard. If the federal standard is higher than the 
Quebec standard, this group seems to think that it is okay, we'll 
go to the lower standard, as long as it is in their best interests. 
That is not good enough today in Canada.
<P>
	We must have the concept of public education programs, of 
environmentally conscious purchasing. The federal government 
should take a leadership role in environmentally conscious 
purchasing while encouraging the private sector to follow.
<P>
	I do not know how easy this is going to be for the federal 
government. In the organization that I was in before I tried 
environmental purchasing. One of the biggest problems was 
getting suppliers to give you some environmentally sound 
products. They do not produce them in bulk. When the federal 
government goes-heaven only knows how much paper this 
place uses-to get environmentally conscious products it may 
be difficult. However the federal government has an obligation 
to push in that direction.
<P>
	We must buy into the principle of sustainable development, 
which balances the need for a healthy environment with the 
continued growth and progress of Canada's economy.
<P>
	Sustainable development can be defined as meeting the needs 
of the present without compromising our ability to meet the 
needs of the future. ``Environmental considerations must carry 
equal weight with the economic, social and technical 
considerations of a project''. This is a big statement. The 
government should really look at this as one of the main 
principles of the environment. Because in most projects, 
regardless of whether they are a $30,000 project or a $10 million 
or $20 million project, what gets lost oftentimes because you are 
trying to cut costs is the environmental  consideration. 
Somewhere along the line we have to look at it as having equal 
weight with the economic, social and technical considerations.
<P>
	I would like the Liberal government to consider that very 
carefully.
<P>
	We must see the integration of environmental and economic 
objectives in all areas of management in which the federal 
government has jurisdiction. We must support the integration of 
energy development and environmental conservation by 
ensuring that the cost of energy development includes the 
associated costs of environmental protection and by supporting 
conservation of energy and the development of alternative 
energy sources for the purposes of environmental protection.
<P>
	We all know that we have to establish clear federal-provincial 
jurisdiction over environmental matters to reduce duplication, 
confusion and unnecessary regulations. We also have to promote 
partnerships with provincial governments, private industry and 
educational institutions and the public to promote 
environmental protection.
<P>
	Our greatest resource today is sitting in high schools and 
elementary schools. I have been in that business at one time or 
another and very little of a sustainable, consistent curriculum on 
the environment is put forward. A lot of schools go out on field 
trips and they talk about it, but it is not really a consistent issue 
with our young people. That is where we have to start. Our 
young people will be the developers of tomorrow and they will 
be the ones who will come under the umbrella of these 
assessments that will be made under this act.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	We support the development of environmental regulations 
through consultation of industry and the public. We must 
support the multi-partite round table approach as a means of 
finding common ground when developing environmental 
measures.
<P>
	Multi-party round table approaches will work if the issue is 
important enough to all parties. We do try. We have seen the 
attempt to get the health round table discussions going. It is not 
working. The provinces are opting out. A lot of it has to do with 
the fact that the federal government is not offering enough to the 
provinces in the partnership. In the environment we all have an 
equal role. A lot of it is not necessarily money. It is articulation. 
It is experience.
<P>
	We should make government sponsored research available to 
the private sector. I emphasize the private sector. Once we get it 
into the public sector we are back again to all of these grants on 
which governments, Liberal and Conservative, year after year 
have made mistakes. They tend to become patronage pots.
<P>
	If we can just let the private sector lead, they will come up 
with better, higher quality environmental impact assessments 
than will governments. We sometimes fall  into the pit and think 
that only governments can do a good job. That really is not so.
<P>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And post offices.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> And post offices, yes.
<P>
	We must support industrial research and development so that 
in the future emissions from industry will be subject to controls, 
such that water discharged from industrial plants will be equal 
or better quality than the water taken into the plant for its use 
and gaseous emissions will not be harmful.
<P>
	Can you imagine having a standard, a principle that high, that 
the water going out of plants will be of just as high a quality as 
the water going into plants? That is amazing. Those are tough 
measures. Those are the standards that we have to set up here. 
These are the federal standards that my colleague from 
Davenport was talking about a little while ago.
<P>
	If we set the federal standards this high and if those of a 
province are lower, I think most provinces would try to get up to 
the higher standard, notwithstanding the separatist agenda.
<P>
	We must support the restoration of programs for those parts of 
our environment which have been damaged as a result of 
inadequate regulations or a lack of proper enforcement of the 
regulations.
<P>
	This party supports the principle that polluters shall pay for 
its pollution controls. This should be stringently enforced and 
the penalties will be severe enough that polluters will not 
consider them as a licence fee to pollute.
<P>
	A lot of what I just talked about are principles or guidelines to 
which the Reform Party adheres. They are not necessarily 
coming from me but I ascribe to all of them. A lot of these 
principles that we have fit into where the government is going. 
That is nice to see.
<P>
	There are four types of environmental assessments which 
have been covered to some extent. I want to review them for the 
folks that are listening and watching and so everyone 
understands. We have a screening process to assess projects. 
Then we get a comprehensive study. These are incremental. The 
screening process is basically for smaller projects. Then we 
move to a comprehensive study, then to mediation if required 
and then to a review by an independent public panel.
<P>
	I have negotiated many labour agreements in my day. I have 
been in many mediation exercises. I know that is probably the 
best solution when we run into problems rather than ending up 
with a black and white issue where the parties are win-lose. 
Both parties can win in mediation. I commend the government 
for coming up with mediation. Let us hope it works.
<P>
	I want to speak for a few minutes about my concern of where 
the environment is going. That hits home for me as it affects the 
folks of Matsqui, Aldergrove and Abbotsford in my riding in the 
Fraser Valley in terms of air quality. The brown scourge that sits 
over the Fraser Valley today from emissions from Vancouver is 
not only concerning but downright scary.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	If we walk out into the backyards of my home or any of the 
homes in Fraser Valley and run our fingers across a white table 
that has been outside for two or three days, there is black pitch 
coming from the skies. There are diseases. There are effects.
<P>
	We are looking at the assessment of new projects coming into 
the country. The government has to take some concrete action on 
some old things that are kicking around. Air quality is one of 
considerable importance to the Fraser Valley. It is not addressed 
here, that I am aware of.
<P>
	I have a word for the wise. The government should not forget 
those things that exist and just think that Canadians will say: 
``You have a good bill here''. It affects all things that might 
happen in the future. There are things in existence such as air 
quality and water quality in the Fraser Valley that are 
deteriorating substantially.
<P>
	I am going to use my remaining three minutes on what is 
wrong in the Fraser Valley. I hope it will influence the Liberal 
government and maybe get it to move a little better than it has on 
other issues such as immigration, finances and the criminal 
justice system. I always have to remind government members of 
that because they forget so easily over there. Here are comments 
that have come out of some in depth studies: ``environmental 
agencies are urging lower mainland residents to minimize the 
use of their cars until smog levels drop''.
<P>
	Can we imagine in Canada today that the lower mainland of 
British Columbia is getting like Los Angeles? It is hard to 
believe. When I moved there in 1981 Mount Baker could be seen 
as a pristine white mountain. It could be seen very clearly. Now 
on any day there is a brown scourge there. People are afraid.
<P>
	``The unprecedented request, the first in B.C. since the 
regional, provincial and federal governments set up a warning 
system in June, came Thursday as another hot sunny day and a 
layer of warm air trapped air pollutants over the Fraser Valley''.
<P>
	It is ironic, is it not, that the federal and provincial 
governments set up a warning system about air quality? I am 
here to tell the government that we are not interested in warning 
systems. We are interested in repair, in fixing the problem. It is 
useless to warn residents that the air quality is poor. We want the 
problem fixed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7449"> 7449 </A></B>
<P>
	A new public health study suggests that lower mainland 
residents are getting sick and even dying from air pollution. The 
study is part of an unprecedented $10 million. It is yet another 
study, by the way. A multi-disciplinary research effort in the 
Fraser Valley last summer looked at what happened to the lungs 
of 58 farm workers from Matsqui and Abbotsford who worked 
long hours outdoors. That is when pollutants from tailpipes and 
smokestacks combine in sunlight to form a powerful lung 
irritant called ground level ozone pollution, the same smog that 
plagues car choked Los Angeles.
<P>
	I could go on but I see my time is running out. It is important 
to emphasize to government that while the bill addresses the 
new projects, and that is great, there is a bigger responsibility. 
There are a lot of pollutants. There are a lot of things that must 
be addressed that exist today in Canada. I ask the government to 
look at those as well.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley West for his support for 
the bill before us today. I would like to inform him that the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development will be in his part of the world one month from 
now. We will be holding public hearings in Vancouver on 
December 1, 2 and 3. At the urging of his hon. colleague, the 
member for Comox-Alberni, we will be examining some of the 
issues that he raised in the House this afternoon, particularly the 
condition of water in the Fraser Valley River estuary. If there is a 
link between the condition of air quality, the smog that he 
referred to and the chemicals that are emitted into the 
atmosphere by various activities in his region, we will have an 
opportunity to look at that as well.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal administration in Parliament is certainly moving 
swiftly along the track that he is recommending this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is good 
news. I would suggest the committee has its hearings outside 
and breathe a little of the unfiltered air. Maybe that will move it 
on a bit. Perhaps the committee might even want to bring one of 
the Bloc members to see that other parts of Canada have similar 
problems to those in Quebec.
<P>
	I have another point. The regulations by which we all live, the 
law or the legislation, are being changed. I trust members of the 
group that is coming to the Fraser Valley will enlist comments 
from ordinary residents and get a bit away from the lobby 
groups. I understand that is important, but they also need to talk 
to the people who own the houses that are dirty now. They need 
to talk to the people who are affected, such as farmers. They 
need to talk to the people who drink that rotten water out there 
with the nitrates in it.
<P>
	They really should not surface scratch the issue. They have to 
go a little deeper and get down to where the  problems really are. 
I hope this is not just another cursory discussion in a community. 
I will be there and I will be asking some questions along with a 
whole bunch of regular folk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the member concerns his comments about yet 
another study. It is a refrain that we frequently hear from 
members of his party. Yet when he is advised a committee would 
be going to his riding he seems to be quite supportive. I wonder 
if he could explain the inconsistency in that approach for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot stop 
the government from undertaking timely and wasteful studies. I 
doubt very much whether it even looked at the Conservative 
studies that were undertaken on the matter before.
<P>
	There is no question about how much money the government 
wastes. If I am stuck with a group coming in to talk, I am stuck 
with it. This is a majority government and we cannot stop it. 
However I can tell the member that when he comes to the town 
where I live there will be people asking questions. The 
government is going to get its dollars worth out of our town 
because we have a lot to say.
<P>
	They spend a lot of money over there on studies, grants and 
whatnot, but this time they will earn their money when they 
come to our town.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple questions which I will put 
individually to the hon. member.
<P>
	I was quite pleased to hear that he and his party support the 
principle of polluter pay. It is something that I have supported 
for quite some time. It was refreshing to hear that the hon. 
member supports the concept as well.
<P>
	I am wondering, given his respect for the Criminal Code, if he 
is prepared to take the issue of polluter pay one step further. 
There has been talk over the years of adding crimes against the 
environment as a new section of the Criminal Code and applying 
Criminal Code type penalties and approaches to crimes against 
the environment. I am wondering if the member would also 
support that principle.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, actually it is 
Reform Party policy that we would go further than fines for 
polluters. I am not sure at this point how far in the Criminal 
Code we would take it. I am sure it is going to be a subject for 
debate within our own party.
<P>
	The fact is that fines to major corporations make about as 
much sense at times as the fines given to drug pushers. Many 
drug pushers today get $2,000 fines. They turn around and go 
out and sell whatever they are selling, heroin or crack. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7450"> 7450 </A></B>
<P>
make that in 20 minutes or less. If we look at that in the context 
of a corporation  making multimillions of dollars, to fine them 
small $2,000 or $3,000 fines is a waste of time.
<P>
	There has to be a better way, and I think the better way is 
through other kinds of penalties. It is not only part of our policy. 
We will be looking at it in depth as soon as we become 
government in three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the member's earlier 
comments about the Fraser Valley and air quality, I am 
wondering if he has opinions about other issues, that perhaps a 
federal environmental assessment could be done in relation to 
the Alcan project in British Columbia or the Clayoquot Sound 
issue in British Columbia. Are these also issues on which the 
member believes a federal environmental assessment process 
could be entertained?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, somebody 
over there said I have an opinion on everything; they are 
probably right.
<P>
	The assessment of projects, if I have the question right, is 
applicable to virtually all projects, big or small. Kemano is a 
good example and that is being undertaken now of course. I do 
not think it is not the size of the project. I think it is the effect the 
project may have on our environment.
<P>
	I think I have answered the question. I am not quite sure. I will 
leave it at that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
especially happy today to join the Minister of the Environment 
in speaking to Bill C-56, an Act to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	I think that in analyzing this bill, we must pay close attention 
to the actions of Opposition members, particularly members of 
the Official Opposition. In addressing environmental 
assessments, the Bloc Quebecois clearly showed that its 
mandate has nothing to do with protecting Quebecers' interests. 
In fact, the Bloc stubbornly criticizes the proclamation of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, which was designed 
by its own leader. These actions confirm that the only goal of the 
Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, is to look after the 
interests of Quebec's separatist government.
<P>
	As the leader of the Bloc has often said, the environment has 
no borders. In an interview published in the October 13 edition 
of <I>The Gazette</I>, the hon. member who is the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois said this in English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The problem is that the word environment never appears in 
the Constitution so the provinces and the federal government are 
condemned to work jointly. They have to work together. If they 
do not it is chaos.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All levels of government share a great and noble 
responsibility with regard to the environment. All levels of 
government in Canada have a responsibility to ensure that 
development is carried out in a rational way while at the same 
time respecting the natural balance.
<P>
	It is clear that Canadians want jobs, but not at the expense of 
their children or the environment. Of all the tools available to 
protect the environment, the environmental assessment is 
undoubtedly the most effective. In fact, environmental 
assessment is inexpensive preventive medicine. It gives us 
advance warning of the possible environmental impact of a 
project and it promotes informed public participation in the 
decision-making process.
<P>
	If members of this House agree that environmental 
jurisdiction is shared and that environmental assessment is a 
good way to prevent pollution, how can we explain that some 
members opposite stubbornly insist on condemning the 
proclamation of this bill? Let us briefly look together at the 
so-called problems raised by the Bloc's environment critic.
<P>
	When the Minister of the Environment on October 6 
announced the government's decision to proclaim the law, the 
Bloc critic condemned this as a federal attempt to interfere in 
provincial jurisdiction. Of course, such reaction from the Bloc 
Quebecois is quite natural. I must say that I was stupefied when I 
heard those remarks about Bill C-56.
<P>
	In fact, what Bill C-56 does is exactly the opposite of what the 
Bloc is again trying to have all Quebecers believe. If the federal 
government wanted to meddle in provincial affairs or make 
things difficult for Quebec by interfering with its economic 
development, it would not propose the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. It would keep the famous 1984 EARP 
Guidelines Order and it would use it systematically.
<P>
	Why? Because that order allows the federal government to 
examine the environmental impact of any proposal over which it 
has a decision-making power. Do you know how the term 
``proposal'' is defined in the order? It is described as any 
undertaking or activity over which the government has a say in 
the decision process.
<P>
	In concrete terms, this means every project, activity and 
initiative in which the federal government is involved. It also 
includes all direct and indirect subsidies to provinces, including 
equalization payments, as well as every Canada-Quebec 
agreement on regional development, and all federal subsidies to 
businesses. That definition also includes hundreds of licences, 
permits and authorizations delivered every day by the federal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7451"> 7451 </A></B>
<P>
	When he was Canada's Minister of the Environment, the Bloc 
Quebecois leader did read the EARP Guidelines Order. He also 
read the Supreme Court decisions and he quickly realized that if 
the order were to be applied like an act, as instructed by the 
courts, the federal government would find itself in an 
impossible situation. This is why he demanded that a reform be 
implemented as quickly as possible. I must admit that the Bloc 
critic did a nice song and dance. She said that the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act was unacceptable because it 
differs from Bill C-78 which, as you remember, had been 
submitted to Cabinet by the member for Lac-Saint-Jean just a 
few days before his sudden resignation from the Conservative 
government.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	For once, the Bloc critic is partially right when she talks about 
differences. Dozens of amendments were proposed by the House 
of Commons committee and by the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment, which represents the interests of 
all the provinces regarding environmental issues.
<P>
	Let us examine the main amendments together briefly. First of 
all, approximately ten changes to the Bouchard bill were meant 
to facilitate the alignment of the federal and the provincial 
processes. Thus, the Minister of the Environment is now 
required to consult the provinces and to co-operate with them 
before any review panel is formed. Other amendments give the 
federal authorities the power to delegate to the provinces the 
preliminary reviews, the in-depth studies, the mitigation 
measures and even the follow-up programs.
<P>
	Therefore, what we have here is a possible delegation of most 
of the environmental assessments done by the federal 
government. Some other changes promote public participation. 
Several clauses were added to restrain the discretion formerly 
afforded the federal authorities.
<P>
	The Bouchard bill was amended so that the uncertainties 
about the implementation of the legislation would be reduced, 
including in the area of federal activities. But the preamble of 
that bill was changed to include the concept of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc critic is right. The Bouchard bill was 
amended in several important ways. I would like her to say, for 
the benefit of the House, what amendments are rejected by her 
party. In fact, all of the amendments to this famous bill we just 
saw and reviewed are consistent with the vision of this 
government, a vision where the objective is to make sure we can 
act according to the present policy, based first and foremost on a 
progressive federalism.
<P>
	This bill means that we are going to work together with all the 
provinces and also with the general public, and that is what irks 
the Official Opposition. This bill is a prime example of how 
federalism can work when you believe in it. That is the problem 
with the Official Opposition. When they talk about federalism, 
they certainly do not want this system, which is probably the  
best system in the world, to operate properly. That is why they 
say every time that if the Leader of the Bloc left the 
Conservative government at the time, it was because he believed 
and knew that the system no longer worked.
<P>
	I think it is too early to throw in the towel on a system that is 
evolving and responding to the needs of the people. Not just in 
Quebec but in Canada as well, people say that federalism has 
problems. My answer to that is thank God federalism has 
problems, because this means people have changed, people have 
evolved, and our duty as parliamentarians at the federal level, as 
members of this House, is to reflect on these changes and get 
together to ensure that the political system under which we live, 
that the federal system under which we are evolving also 
evolves in line with the expectations of the public.
<P>
	This was just a brief digression. I will get back to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	And if the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act were an 
attempt by the federal government to encroach on Quebec's 
jurisdiction, as I said earlier, let the Bloc critic explain why four 
successive federal Ministers of the Environment came from the 
Conservative Quebec caucus and were so closely involved in 
this reform? They designed it, tabled it in the House, made 
amendments, passed it and defended it during the last federal 
election. According to the philosophy of the Bloc Quebecois, we 
would have to say that probably all the Quebecers who were 
committed to this bill were on the wrong track.
<P>
	In fact, the question is: Does the Bloc have a monopoly on 
brains? Were these people who spoke out in favour of the bill all 
wrong? The answer is simple. As I said earlier, the bill is such an 
eloquent example of viable federalism that obviously they 
would be ill-advised to react positively to the bill, since these 
people, and I am probably repeating myself, are intent on only 
one thing, and that is the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in the process they have lost the ability to 
think objectively, thereby jeopardizing the interests of all 
Quebecers. Well, the people who supported this bill were not all 
wrong. The comments of the critic for the Bloc Quebecois seem 
to point to the presence of a transmission belt linking her office 
with the Quebec government's Department of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. The problem of the Bloc Quebecois 
right now is that it is only a mouthpiece. We could say that it is 
the secretariat of the Parti Quebecois. Members of the Bloc no 
longer have their own identity, their own way of thinking. They 
do not have a specific way of being, a specific philosophy. They 
are like puppets controlled by the government of Quebec which 
is following a separation agenda.
<P>
	Since I am informed that time is flying, I will simply say that 
this bill, like many an initiative from this government, is a 
highly symbolic expression of dialogue. We proved in the past 
that when there is a will to co-operate we can progress. Let us 
remember, for example, the St. Lawrence-Vision 2000 project. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7452"> 7452 </A></B>
<P>
This is a  vibrant example of federal, provincial and municipal 
co-operation. Let us remember the agreements under the 
infrastructure program which helped renew our social 
infrastructure and put a number of people back to work. 
Recently, last June in fact, there was an agreement between the 
provinces to do away with economic barriers. Is it not proof that 
federalism works?
<P>
	Clearly, this legislation is in the same vein and shows the 
same kind of vision. This is why members of the Official 
Opposition have every reason to make the people of Quebec 
believe that this legislation is useless and even harmful to the 
whole of Quebec.
<P>
	In 1981, 13 years ago, the government of the Parti Quebecois 
passed the Environment Quality Act. At the same time, it 
adopted regulations listing the kind of projects which would be 
subject to hearings by the Quebec Bureau d'audiences publiques 
sur l'environnement.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Quebec government forgot to proclaim 
certain key sections of the regulations and today, 13 years later, 
the Parti Quebecois government's process only deals with dams, 
roads and marinas. There is no public assessment of industrial 
projects, no public assessment of mining projects and no public 
assessment of aluminum plants.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude, if I may, Mr. Speaker, on a very 
important point, namely the harmonization of the federal and 
provincial processes. For the past several months, the members 
of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment have 
been looking for ways to facilitate harmonization. Their 
objective is to agree on the implementation of the principle of 
one environmental assessment for each project, regardless of 
the number of decision-makers. It is an arduous task requiring 
the participation of all provinces.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Quebec environment minister recently 
announced that he was withdrawing his officials from the 
federal-provincial consultations on environmental assessment. 
This decision could hurt Quebec businesses as well as 
Quebecers looking for a job. The president of the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec recently condemned this hasty decision on 
the part of the Quebec environment minister. Other 
organizations are to follow suit.
<P>
	To conclude, if the Bloc members want to show that they are 
more concerned about the interests of Quebecers that they are 
about their obsession to separate, they should do two things in 
this House. First, they should support the proclamation of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the amendments 
proposed by the environment minister.
<P>
	Second, if these people were acting reasonably and for the 
sake of all Quebecers, they would recognize the appropriateness 
of this bill for the future of Quebec, the future of Canada and the 
well-being of federalism. They would also have the courage to 
demand that the Quebec  environment minister change his mind 
and take part again in the work of the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment on the harmonization of the 
environmental assessment process. This is what they would do if 
only they had enough courage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we proceed with 
questions and comments, the government whip has the floor on a 
point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), 
I wish to inform you that the next speakers from the government 
will be sharing their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to put a question to the member for 
Outremont who I think spoke quite well on the bill and other 
matters. It is partly the other matters that I want to address in my 
opening comments before I place my question.
<P>
	The debate through most of today centred around issues 
within the province of Quebec. With the exception of comments 
earlier in the day the government speakers have all represented 
Quebec ridings this afternoon so far, including the 
parliamentary secretary, the member for Davenport-I 
apologize, Mr. Speaker, I just realize the member for Davenport 
is from Ontario. I have to rephrase my question.
<P>
	The comments today have centred around the jurisdiction of 
the province of Quebec. The member for Outremont rightly 
speaks for his constituents and the people of his province. I 
believe the question of jurisdiction while it is an important one 
is not the only question that we have to deal with in this House.
<P>
	I had expected members of the Bloc Quebecois at least in one 
of their speeches today as members representing the Official 
Opposition to raise some of the issues which are important to the 
rest of Canada, issues that are over and above the questions of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The member for Outremont must be aware that the province of 
Quebec would have to participate in joint panels if this bill came 
into force with the amendments put forward today.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	How would the member for Outremont advise the members of 
his government to deal with the province of Quebec in matters 
where confrontation might exist over the issues of not only 
jurisdiction but of the joint panels that must be created under the 
auspices of the act?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7453"> 7453 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that this is an 
interesting question, one that was partially answered in my 
speech.
<P>
	As I said, there is already a joint committee sitting at the level 
of all the environment ministers of all the provinces. They are 
all sitting in order to discuss what we are going to do about the 
environment in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They are trying to set national standards so that we can have 
legislation or at least an environmental policy that will be 
consistent from coast to coast.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately the Minister of the Environment of the 
province of Quebec declared weeks ago that it does not want to 
participate any more in that process. According to the minister it 
is a question of jurisdiction; the environment belongs to the 
provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, as I mentioned in my speech, that question has already 
been answered. The problem is that the Quebec Minister of the 
Environment refuses to participate in this process and, as I 
explained earlier, that is where there is a lack of objectivity. 
Every time we try to sit down with the government of Quebec or 
the Official Opposition to discuss national standards or other 
issues for the benefit of Quebecers and all Canadians, they 
refuse to take part in such discussions.
<P>
	I think it is time we start telling Quebecers that the federal 
government is not as bad as some people would like them to 
believe and that the present federal government is actually very 
open.
<P>
	This brings me to say a few words about the issue of social 
reform. You will understand that we cannot give these people 
any credibility when we have just undertaken a social reform 
process in which we want to consult Canadians so that they can 
participate in the development of a new government policy.
<P>
	We are just through the first stage, which was the tabling of a 
discussion paper. The consultation process will 
follow-actually, it has already started. So we are still in the 
early stages of this reform and the ministers responsible in 
Quebec are already complaining that the federal government 
wants to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction, that the 
federal government is again picking on Quebec. I do not 
understand anything any more. If the government presents a 
discussion paper and wants to consult people, if this is 
interpreted as wanting to invade Quebec, I will have to take 
Politics 101 over again.
<P>
	I do not understand anything any more, but it is obvious. Since 
the federal government wants to act openly and present a bill to 
reform part of our federal system, namely our social programs, 
they absolutely do not want to see this process succeed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must say that it is the same with the question of the 
environment. When we are discussing that subject, they do not 
want to enter into discussion with our government. They want to 
separate. They want to move apart so they will not be with us any 
more. As such it is going to be very difficult to deal with them 
over the next few years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member puts a lot of stake 
in consultation. I applaud him for that because I believe that 
consulting is an important part of governing.
<P>
	This bill contains just three provisions. One of those 
provisions is the opportunity for participation by Canadians 
through an intervener funding program or a participant funding 
program. That is a very important part of the consultation 
process inherent in environmental assessment.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	The amendment in front of us provides a very vague approach 
to participant funding. Can the member give us any indication as 
to whether he would be supportive of a more specific intervener 
funding program to ensure that there are adequate resources 
available to those who wish to participate in the process and 
those who wish to be consulted during the process of 
environmental assessment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the question of funding for 
people who want to proceed and be accepted in the consultation 
process, we should have a look at what we are doing. Actually 
the minister of human resources in his consultations on social 
reform decided that he will proceed with some funding for 
organizations across Canada.
<P>
	I believe that on that specific point we have to respect the 
discretionary power of the minister. It depends on what process 
we are going ahead with. If it is a huge transformation in that 
field against it then the discretion of the minister will be used 
accordingly. I am very much in favour of the discretion that we 
kept in that bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on 
Bill C-56, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.
<P>
	I would first like to make a few comments on our environment 
in a general sense. First, environment has a special meaning in 
my constituency of Surrey North. Surrey is one of the fastest 
growing communities in Canada. It has grown and expanded in 
recent years because of both immigration and migration. The 
immigration is mainly Asian and the migration is mainly people 
from the Vancouver area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7454"> 7454 </A></B>
<P>
	The constituency of Surrey North is a mixture of urban and 
rural with the urban increasing at the expense of the rural. That 
alteration along with the population growth and business 
expansion has caused concerns and greater awareness of the 
environmental impacts. That desire is truly tested by an 
explosive population growth.
<P>
	One characteristic of the people of Surrey North and indeed 
the people of the west coast is the desire to preserve the natural 
climate and the environment as best they can. Numerous 
environmentally oriented projects are apparent in the daily 
activities of west coast citizens. A heightened awareness of the 
importance of environmental concerns is demonstrated through 
more and more presentations and/or questions being asked by 
citizens on such things as air and water pollution, the long range 
effects of cutting our trees, right down to their participation in 
recycling programs.
<P>
	Second, another environmental concern is that the wild 
animals are losing their homelands due to the human population 
explosion and the effects of meeting our own needs for survival. 
Only our parks are destined, probably within the next century, to 
become homes for our wild animals unless we change our ways.
<P>
	The British Isles would be a prime example of this. A couple 
of centuries ago large animals such as moose and bear roamed 
on that land through great stands of trees. Somewhere along the 
line lumber gave way to bricks for building the human dwellings 
and the moose, the bear, the large cats and other animals that 
were there gradually became thought of as being indigenous to 
North America.
<P>
	Another example of the abuse of our environment seemingly 
for our need for survival is in the early days of our explorers, 
Jacques Cartier's time for example. During that time it was 
recorded that the fish were so plentiful off our east coast that his 
crew had a tough time getting the oars in the water to move their 
dinghy forward.
<P>
	Today we are all aware of the present situation on the east 
coast where the stocks have been so depleted that the economic 
foundation and livelihood of a region has been seriously 
changed, perhaps forever. Not only is there an economic impact, 
the fish themselves are possibly close to being an endangered 
species.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Another example would be Easter Island where thriving 
civilizations cut trees to build homes and move great stone 
statues. Soon there were no trees left. The homes are no longer, 
the statues are stationary, and the once thriving civilization is all 
but gone.
<P>
	Balancing the wants of people with the capabilities of the 
environment is a challenge which all communities must face. It 
is a challenge which people from Surrey have met so far. The 
industrial expansion of the past few years has not as far as we 
know had a negative impact on our environment. Surrey is a 
community that disproves the notion that industry necessarily 
hurts environment.
<P>
	We must realize as a nation that we can have a thriving 
economy and a healthy environment at the same time. That is the 
sensible approach of the Reform Party. Our blue book states 
support for the concept of ``sustainable development'' because 
``without economic development and the income generated 
therefrom the environment will not be protected or enjoyed''.
<P>
	What Reformers recognize is garnered from what most 
Canadians recognize: the importance of the environment to our 
livelihood as a nation; the importance of the natural resources it 
provides for our economy and well-being; the variables of the 
vast geography and sometimes harsh climate that we must 
encounter; and the preservation of the pure beauty of the natural 
environment which never ceases to amaze us and visitors to our 
great nation. This we must preserve.
<P>
	At the end of the last sitting I drove from Ottawa to Surrey. I 
was taken aback and awestruck by the absolute beauty and 
astounding diversity of our country, from the hills, trees, and 
unique rock formations of northern Ontario to the wide open 
prairies of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, through the 
majestic Rockies and down to the scenic beauty of the west 
coast. If you are able to ignore the areas of clear cut and look 
past the smoke billowing from some factory or mill, the drive 
across our country is an experience all Canadians should share. 
Only after a drive like that does one realize the magnitude, 
greatness and potential of our country.
<P>
	We must always strive to maintain that close link between 
people and their natural environment in this country and 
continually improve our understanding of the earth itself and 
our effects upon it. We are as individuals much more aware 
today of our environment and the effects our actions can have 
upon it. We are also very aware that the various levels of 
government are actively involved in the decision making 
process for many of these very actions involving our 
environment.
<P>
	Bill C-56 including the three amendments is a small step 
forward at the federal level to enhance the process of achieving 
these decisions. It would be helpful first to take a look at the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act itself.
<P>
	The act requires the federal government to study the 
environmental impacts of a whole range of projects that until 
now have escaped public scrutiny. Environmental assessments 
have been done in the past and have not carried the weight they 
should in the making of the final decision. Economic 
considerations have had the tendency to rank higher in 
importance in the decision making process.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act creates the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. This agency 
replaces the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office. 
This office was criticized for being costly because of overlap 
and duplication and for being inconsistently applied. Replacing 
one office with another  may not in itself improve the situation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7455"> 7455 </A></B>
<P>
but the review and revisions and upgrading of the regulations 
governing the agency's role could very well be the key to an 
improved performance. The failure of the federal government to 
provide clear guidelines led to court challenges of high profile 
projects such as the Oldman River dam in Alberta and the 
Rafferty-Alameda dam in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act four 
types of environmental assessments are available to meet 
different projects and circumstances. One would be screening, 
two would be comprehensive study, three would be mediation, 
and four would be a review by an independent panel.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act was a bill 
proposed and passed by the former Conservative government. 
However the act once passed was never proclaimed, meaning 
that it never came into force.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals promised to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act ``to shift the decision making 
powers to an independent Canadian environmental assessment 
agency subject to appeal to the cabinet''. That is on page 64 of 
the red book.
<P>
	On October 6, 1994 the government issued a press release 
stating its intent to proclaim the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. The reasons for the Conservatives not 
proclaiming the act that they passed may not be known for 
certain, but a reasonable guess is because of the wrangling 
among the industry and environmental groups and among 
federal and provincial bureaucrats and politicians over the act in 
general and certain regulations in particular.
<P>
	The former and present Quebec governments opposed this 
act. The former Liberal environmental minister for Quebec, 
Pierre Paradis, appeared before the Senate in an attempt to block 
the bill. And I understand that the present environmental 
minister for Quebec is publicly opposing the proclamation of 
this act.
<P>
	On this issue one must sympathize with the federal 
government, for two reasons: first, that the citizens of the 
country want the federal government to be active in the 
protection of the environment; and second, because the 
environment is an area not outlined in the Constitution under 
federal and provincial jurisdiction. There are to date no clear 
guidelines for the federal government to follow in this area.
<P>
	The federal government must play an active role in the 
protection of the environment and develop clear effective 
guidelines for environmental issues and concerns. The Reform 
Party recognizes the need for federal leadership in this area.
<P>
	Also the new Liberal government has made changes in the 
regulations of the original act and has proposed amendments to 
try to satisfy the concerns of some groups. One change in the bill 
is the dropping of the controversial provision that would have 
forced  environmental reviews of energy exports. This change 
was apparently welcomed by the oil and gas and hydroelectric 
industries but criticized by environmental groups.
<P>
	With regard to the federal-provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
Minister of the Environment is able to develop co-ordinated 
environmental assessment procedures for conducting joint 
panel reviews, thus preventing overlap and jurisdictional 
conflict. The Reform Party supports the co-ordination between 
the federal and provincial governments on environment action. 
We support the reduction of duplication, confusion and 
unnecessary regulation by developing and applying 
environmental criteria through a joint federal-provincial 
process.
<P>
	The present regulations of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act divide the project into four categories: a 
comprehensive study list; a law list; an exclusion list; and an 
inclusion list.
<P>
	The comprehensive study list describes those types of 
projects that must be assessed through a more detailed study. 
The law list is a list of licences, permits, certificates and other 
regulatory authorizations which are required for certain 
projects. An environmental assessment would be triggered in 
this case. The exclusion list describes those undertakings in 
relation to a physical work that do not require an environmental 
assessment. The inclusion list relates only to those projects that 
are a physical activity not related to physical work. It occurs 
when a federal agency issues a permit or a licence.
<P>
	At the same time that the government announced its intention 
to proclaim the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act it 
announced its intention to bring forward three amendments to 
the act. These amendments comprise Bill C-56.
<P>
	One amendment is to legally entrench the participant funding 
program which is an amendment to section 58 of the CEAA. 
This allows for intervener funding for public participation in the 
review process. I agree that public participation should be 
encouraged as long as the funds come from within the current 
department allocations or budget.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Another amendment is to section 37 of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. It requires a cabinet decision to 
respond to the recommendations of independent environmental 
assessment panels. Previously this decision was made by the 
minister only. By making it a cabinet decision opens it up for 
more debate and scrutiny and makes the decision process much 
more democratic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7456"> 7456 </A></B>
<P>
	The last amendment amending section 24 of the CEAA 
confirms the principle of one project, one assessment in the act. 
This aspect of the bill is very encouraging. It addresses the 
possibility of numerous environmental assessments being done 
by the various federal departments involved and now groups all 
that into one assessment.
<P>
	One project, one assessment makes for logical reasoning as 
well as indicating some fiscal responsibility and some 
consideration as to more efficient implementation of the 
project's timetable. Instead of each department involved, for 
example, industry, transport, environment, et cetera doing its 
own assessment over a period of time a panel or committee is 
struck with representation from all departments to participate in 
one assessment.
<P>
	This amendment should alleviate the concerns of business to 
require permits from several federal departments. Under this 
amendment instead of businesses facing multiple reviews they 
would be subject to only one federal assessment. Also this 
principle of one assessment should lower the cost compared to 
having to do several assessments. Another benefit would be to 
speed up the process of implementation of the actual plan. 
Participants would not have to wait for several months or years 
for all the assessments to come in.
<P>
	An improvement on this process would be to bring provincial 
representation in on the same assessment committee. This 
harmonizing would prevent the possibility of federal and 
provincial assessments contradicting each other. It also 
provides for one assessment, not one at the federal level and one 
or more at the provincial level.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to reiterate two of my previous 
statements. First, our environment is of major importance to us 
and concerns relating to it should rank high in our decision 
making process. Second, Bill C-56 is definitely a small, 
progressive step forward in achieving this end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was quite pleased to hear the hon. member's 
commitment to the environment. Anyone who lives in western 
Canada is well aware of the beauty that exists, but all of us know 
that the environment involves much more than beauty. It is 
home, it sustains us. Anyone who lives on this planet knows that 
without the land, the air and the water to sustain us we are 
nothing. I am very pleased to hear of the hon. member's 
commitment to matters of environmental concern.
<P>
	My question deals with intervener funding which is one of the 
amendments to the act. The member expressed support for 
intervener funding and outlined her concerns about additional 
spending with regard to intervener funding. While I believe 
there are probably arguments to be made in this regard, I would 
like to ask if the member has given any thought to the process of 
intervener funding.
<P>
	Who would she consider should examine the list of possible 
interveners? Who would suggest to the panel which interveners 
would be funded? Should a panel be struck to do this? Would the 
panel itself make this decision? Should the Minister of the 
Environment or perhaps the President of the Treasury Board be 
responsible for making this decision?
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I agree with what he is saying. I can sympathize with 
his concerns.
<P>
	When I was researching it myself it became very obvious that 
particular section of the bill was very vague from the actual 
process point of view. There does not seem to be any direction as 
to how that will actually transpire. I assume the results will be 
debated and discussed in committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member indicated support for funding of 
interveners in the process. As the hon. member is well aware, 
her party is taking the position that it is opposed to the court 
challenges program.
<P>
	Could the hon. member comment on what appears to be an 
apparent contradiction of supporting intervener funding but not 
supporting the court challenges program which in effect is an 
intervener process?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. There are two possible approaches. First, when that 
program is actually put in place so that we can have that input in 
the panel from the community it becomes a component of the 
whole program and should be incorporated in the budget of the 
total program. It is not an additional program in itself. It is not 
an add on. It is part of the whole program and should be 
budgeted accordingly in the overall program.
<P>
	Second, we are back to good old Reform policy and ideals, 
that is grassroots input. We firmly believe it is essential for the 
people in the community affected by the project to have access 
to express themselves to the committee. Again it should be 
formalized or structured access. That could come up in the 
process of how the input would come about. The whole program 
should be budgeted in total.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me considerable pride to take part in today's second 
reading debate on the act to amend the Canadian Environment 
Assessment Act, CEAA.
<P>
	In coming years the decisions we take or the consequences of 
those we fail to take with respect to the environment will have a 
profound impact on the legacy we leave our children and our 
children's children. Will the Canada they inherit be the same 
Canada that for the past three years the United Nations has 
called the best place in the world to live? Or, will the Canada 
they inherit be one in which our natural environment, the source 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7457"> 7457 </A></B>
<P>
of many of the comparative advantages we enjoy,  be 
compromised in order to meet the short term needs of today?
<P>
	Some might consider my characterization of these options as 
mere rhetorical excess, but I profoundly believe these are the 
real choices we face.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The previous government spent a lot of time and energy to 
develop the legislation we are now discussing. Eight years ago, 
the then minister was the first to try to integrate a more rigorous 
environmental evaluation process into the laws of the land.
<P>
	Ironically, his successor, now Leader of the Official 
Opposition, was the architect of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. I used the word ``ironically'' because I believe 
that all Canadians should be grateful to him for having 
developed a bill that is basically good but which the present 
Minister of Environment has improved and reinforced.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition's successor actually tabled 
CEAA but was unable to galvanize the political support 
necessary within his own party to get it proclaimed. The current 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party had his chance to 
move CEAA forward. He worked with both House and Senate 
committees to make several positive thoughtful changes to the 
original legislation but he too was unable to proclaim the act. 
Finally the last Minister of the Environment in the previous 
government was unable to get his government to focus on the 
urgent need for CEAA to be proclaimed.
<P>
	The record is remarkable. Over a seven-year period no less 
than five ministers were unable to proclaim this important piece 
of legislation. The legislation represents reform which the 
overwhelming majority of Canadian environmental groups, 
industry associations, provincial governments and ordinary 
Canadians concerned about the environment agree is an absolute 
necessity.
<P>
	There is an important lesson here to which I want to draw the 
attention of members. For various reasons certain misguided 
interests pulled out all the stops to try to prevent this forward 
looking piece of legislation from ever seeing the light of day. 
That is why the achievements of the Deputy Prime Minister and 
the Minister of the Environment on this file are all the more 
remarkable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Actually, in less than a year, she was able to obtain the 
collaboration of interested groups in order to review the four key 
regulations that give the law its real scope and make them more 
precise, more concrete and more rigorous. The minister has 
reinforced the act by bringing forward an amendment forcing 
the Minister of Environment to establish a funding program that 
will allow an enlightened participation of the public to reviews 
and mediation processes.
<P>
	The minister took steps so that the review commissions' 
recommendations receive due consideration by requiring that 
they be submitted to a cabinet decision. Following the wishes of 
the industry she induced an amendment so that decisions could 
be taken more rapidly and in a more co-ordinated way after 
environmental assessments, according to the principle of one 
evaluation per project. In less than a year, the minister did more 
than five Conservative ministers in eight years. Present and 
future generations of Canadians owe her a lot.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment 
and Development pointed out that the environment is where we 
live and development is what we all do in attempting to improve 
our lot within the abode. The two are inseparable. The 
commission was right and remains so today.
<P>
	Environment and economy are inseparable. An environmental 
assessment is the foundation upon which sustainable 
development can and must rest. Conducting environmental 
assessments makes both good economic and environmental 
sense. By integrating environmental concerns early in the 
planning stages before decisions are made, business and 
industry protect themselves from having to deal with 
environmental problems later on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Several features of the new environmental assessment system 
are worthy of note. The first one is public participation, which is 
recognized as essential to any efficient environmental 
assessment. In fact, the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act provides the public with many opportunities to become 
involved in the various stages of the assessment process.
<P>
	It provides for the establishment of a public registry to ensure 
the accessibility of the documents relating to any ongoing 
federal environmental assessment, including those conducted in 
co-operation with a province. It sets into law a participant 
funding program ensuring that resources are made available to 
interested individuals and groups to participate efficiently in the 
process.
<P>
	The second feature that I would like to mention reflects the 
federal government's commitment to changing 
decision-making practices throughout the federal 
administration. Recommendations from public review panels 
will be subject to a joint cabinet decision. Another amendment 
is designed to ensure that only one federal environmental 
assessment is conducted with respect to a project, which will 
permit better coordination of the decision-making process in 
projects where more than one federal department or agency is 
involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7458"> 7458 </A></B>
<P>
	All these interrelated measures will have the effect of making 
federal departments and agencies, as well as cabinet, more 
responsible for the environmental impact of their decisions. 
These measures are an important step in the development of a 
government-wide environmental culture.
<P>
	The third feature is the creation and maintenance of a public 
registry accessible to all stakeholders. This provision will have 
a positive impact on environmental assessment, as an art and 
science, a new and growing discipline. With each assessment, 
more knowledge is gained regarding the complex, symbiotic 
interrelations between people, development and the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not a static process. It is a living, breathing, interactive 
one. The use of public registries does more than just provide a 
rich source of relevant and accessible information for both 
project proponents and those likely to be impacted by a 
proposed development.
<P>
	What is often overlooked is that the public registries provide a 
means of ensuring the institutional memory acquired in the 
conduct of the environmental assessment is preserved. Indeed 
the CEAA reform package we are debating has been carefully 
crafted with the notion that environmental assessment is a 
dynamic process firmly in mind.
<P>
	The fact that we have provided expanded opportunities for 
public involvement throughout the environmental assessment 
process speaks eloquently to this point. We have no intention of 
allowing CEAA to become brittle or irrelevant. Its coming into 
force constitutes the beginning and not the end of the process of 
change. All parliamentarians regardless of political stripe have 
a responsibility to make it work and contribute to its success.
<P>
	The previous government used words like effective, efficient, 
fair, open and transparent to describe its intentions vis-à-vis 
environmental assessment. We on this side of the House have 
acted quickly and decisively to give effect to those words by 
improving and proclaiming CEAA.
<P>
	We have acted because we view sound stewardship over the 
environment as extremely important. Our actions serve to give 
real definition to the words. That is why all members of the 
House can and should support CEAA. We have a responsibility 
to act for future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the member on his speech.
<P>
	As we are both on the environment committee, I was curious 
about his research. I was unable to find the area that deals with 
ministerial discretion on whether or not to look at a project. I am 
referring specifically to the Kemano project in British Columbia 
where the former government basically said it did not need 
environmental assessment.
<P>
	Was there anywhere the member looked when he was looking 
for material for his speech that would cover this in the new bill? 
I was unable to find any and it leaves me a bit uneasy that the 
minister still has the discretion to ignore or postpone an 
assessment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. As I understand the process the minister will be 
receiving advice from the environmental assessment agency 
that is being set up. I would hope that is how the system would 
work.
<P>
	As the member well knows, the process provides for the bill to 
go to committee. These are issues and questions that we can 
raise at that level before final reading of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member spoke about the involvement of the 
current Minister of the Environment and gave her a considerable 
amount of credit for moving the bill forward when other 
ministers had been unable to do so.
<P>
	I agree that the current Minister of the Environment has done 
what few have been able to do in the past, but I recognize what 
some of the problems are. One problem is simply that the bill 
came before cabinet on numerous occasions, just as the 
regulations came before cabinet on numerous occasions. The 
minister and others had to argue with other cabinet ministers 
concerning the ability of the cabinet to move the bill forward. 
Ministers with economic portfolios have always had a stronger 
say in cabinet than ministers of the environment.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if members recognize that one of the amendments 
provides for the greater authority of cabinet to have the final say 
on projects; not the panel, not the Minister of the Environment, 
but cabinet. Is the member prepared at committee to have a look 
at the structure of cabinet where the economic ministers have a 
very strong say in the kind of environmental legislation or 
regulations we have in our country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, one consideration the member 
should take into account is that the proclamation and 
amendment of this bill was in the red book. It was part of the 
Liberal election platform. All cabinet ministers with economic 
portfolios or otherwise subscribe to the red book policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Yes, but it took a year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7459"> 7459 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> The member points out that it took a year. 
However, as I indicated in my comments, the former 
government had eight years and did not proclaim it. It has been 
passed.
<P>
	To answer the question, would I be prepared to look at it at 
committee? It is my role in committee to look at all legitimate 
issues and to make appropriate recommendations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
commenting on the remark by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake who said this took a whole year.
<P>
	This bill is not the only thing we have done in the last year. In 
fact, I was thinking as we went through this legislation today 
that I am absolutely amazed at how much of the red book agenda 
we have been able to get done in our first year. At the rate we are 
going we will have everything in the red book done within the 
first two years when the Prime Minister had said the red book 
agenda would happen over the term of the government.
<P>
	I begin by complimenting the Minister of the Environment 
and Deputy Prime Minister for moving forward on this very 
important legislation, the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. I believe that the balance sheet of a nation will be judged by 
the way we take care of our environment.
<P>
	The environmental assessment legislation is a systematic 
method of identifying potential environmental consequences of 
a proposed project and its impact on people, their livelihood and 
way of life. If these environmental consequences are identified 
early in the planning stages, then plans can be modified so 
potential risks are minimized or ideally eliminated.
<P>
	Environmental assessment is a very logical tool for achieving 
sustainable development, that is ensuring that the needs of 
present generations can be met while allowing future 
generations to meet their needs.
<P>
	I believe the legislation will lead to a whole new measurement 
of the economy. In the past the environment really has not been 
driving the economic agenda in our country. In fact, the 
environment always got a short shrift.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I actually should go back to when my colleague from 
Davenport was the Minister of the Environment in the previous 
Liberal government. He was probably the first Minister of the 
Environment to give the issue such a determined, sustained 
approach. His tenacity in making sure that this issue was always 
on the front burner gave all of us in the Liberal Party a real 
example. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the 
Environment is following through today with that commitment 
from the red book.
<P>
	I noticed in a book that I was reading earlier in preparing for 
this debate, written by Julia Moulden and Patrick Carson, <I>Green 
Is Gold</I>, that we now have industries that are starting to realize 
that if they commit to greening themselves or committing 
themselves to the environmental movement that their balance 
sheets can be much more profitable.
<P>
	Even though the member stated that we were a year getting to 
this bill, ideally it should have been one we handled in the first 
quarter. However the fact is that we have now got the bill in the 
system. It will no doubt pass, we will be setting up a whole new 
structure and the environment will now take on a priority 
position.
<P>
	I would like to say to members opposite that this is a bill on 
which we must all be united. It is a bill that regrettably once 
again the Bloc Quebecois will not support, not because its 
members are not committed to the environment, but because 
once again whenever you come forward with a bill that talks 
about national standards, a bill that can galvanize the spirit of 
the country, legislation that can pull us all together, the Bloc is 
consistent in walking away from it. They find some excuse that 
it impinges on the rights of Quebecers.
<P>
	If there is one thing that everyone is committed to in every 
part of Canada it is saving the planet. I believe that Quebecers, 
once they understand the true meaning of the bill, will probably 
urge some of their Bloc Quebecois members to be a little less 
political and a little more concerned about what truly is 
important for everyone in our society, especially for future 
generations.
<P>
	I stand here today in total support of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments from the hon. member. 
He has spoken on numerous occasions in the House on the 
environment, business and the economy. I always listen 
carefully to what he has to say.
<P>
	I want to indicate that the matter that I was raising about it 
taking a year for the government to bring this bill in was in 
relation to the difficulties that ministers have sometimes in 
dealing with cabinet on environmental issues.
<P>
	In the half minute available to me, I want to say that the 
minister probably could have brought in the bill in the first 
quarter. Consultation with environmental organizations and 
industry was concluded relatively early in the process. But the 
process of getting the new regulations through cabinet was a 
very difficult task. Again I commend the minister but it shows 
that cabinet is still a very powerful body when it comes to 
dealing with issues like this.
<P>
	If the government has the will to see that the environment will 
be a first priority, then the system works. If this government or 
the next government chooses not to have the environment as its 
top priority, then the system does not work. We have to ensure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7460"> 7460 </A></B>
<P>
that parliamentarians and Canadians all have an opportunity  to 
respond to power when there is abuse. I just wanted to clarify 
that matter.
<P>
	The member also indicated the accounting that occurs in the 
country. He talked about green accounting. I wonder if the 
member could tell me if he supports the principle of green 
accounting when we look at the way our country is developing. 
It is not an efficient economy based on GNP, growth and 
development. An efficient economy is one that is based on 
preservation and conservation as much as growth and 
development. Is that important to the member?
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say to the member that I appreciate the question. I believe we are 
on a pathway and that this bill will move us along that pathway 
more quickly in changing our whole system of calculation.
<P>
	Some members have talked about-I know we have talked in 
our own policy group in my riding-about this new notion of a 
human development index rather than a GNP. The GNP system 
is not really sensitive to sustainable development. At least to 
this point it has not been.
<P>
	I personally love the idea of exploring a whole new way of 
calculating the balance sheet, not only of our nation but of the 
planet. The GNP system of old falls off and we convert to a new 
human development index where the environment and 
sustainable development are the core factor and the driving 
factor in the equation.
<P>
	I believe this cabinet and government is one of the first groups 
I have seen in a long time around here that has the courage to 
venture into those waters. The reason I say that is I see the 
reform we are going through in our social security system. I see 
the reform in so many other areas.
<P>
	We are in a period of real reform on so many different issues. I 
am optimistic that in the not too distant future the whole notion 
of a human development index will be the new way we measure 
our whole economic system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure to speak to the issue of the environment.
<P>
	As we have heard today all of us are concerned about the 
environment. We are concerned about the air; we are concerned 
about the water; we are concerned about the soil around us.
<P>
	Often we look at the environment and we see the radical end 
of things on the scale. Then we see the radical things on the 
industrial scale. As all of us recognize it is really the middle 
ground, the ground of compromise, co-operation and in many 
cases the ground of trade-offs. We have to understand these 
trade-offs.
<P>
	Often someone says: ``You're getting kind of hard on 
environmentalists''. I answer: ``Yes, but I don't want to live in a 
cave and go out and grow my own food. If I don't want to do that, 
then I have to make trade-offs in order to live the way I want 
to''.
<P>
	I have a long background in the area of environment. 
Professionally that was my training. I was involved 25 years ago 
in the Conserver Society. I went around the country talking 
about what we could do to conserve our society, recycling and so 
on. I must admit it was kind of an off topic back then. We were 
not very popular when we talked about it. A lot of people did not 
know what we were talking about.
<P>
	I came from that age of <I>Silent Spring</I>, of the environmental 
impact studies. I worked for the Canadian Wildlife Service. 
From all that background I gained a real appreciation of 
preservation of the environment.
<P>
	As well I have learned that the environment is not in the 
domain only of socialists and liberals but is of concern to 
everyone. I want to assure the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake that when we form the next 
government we will be concerned about the environment and 
will place it high on our list of priorities.
<P>
	I want to also address the member on the reforms that are 
going on. We are part of that overall reform.
<P>
	I want as well to quote from our blue book on the 
environment: ``We want to establish clear federal-provincial 
jurisdiction over environmental matters. We want to reduce 
duplication, confusion and all of the unnecessary things that so 
often go with government. We believe the government should 
provide federal leadership, encourage partnership, encourage 
private industry to get involved, encourage educational 
institutions and of course encourage the public to be part of 
these environmental protection studies''.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	The environment is related to all of us and interrelated. There 
are many things wrong and those have been identified here 
today.
<P>
	We must of course be equal to everyone and we must go for 
equal enforcement. In looking at Bill C-56 I think we go at least 
some way to accomplishing what we want to. Certainly the one 
assessment will save time and money and will avoid some of the 
duplication of so many examples we could talk about.
<P>
	Participatory funding. Having been involved in that 
grassroots level of trying to participate in environmental 
involvement, I can certainly appreciate having that as part of 
this bill. I think if that is properly administered and decisions 
are made properly that that can be a great plus for people 
wanting to get involved in projects and understanding them 
better.
<P>
	The decision that the cabinet, not just one minister, will make 
the decisions regarding this of course becomes even more 
credible today. A lot of us are reading the recent book published 
about the last government and that would convince us even more 
that we want more than one minister deciding anything.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7461"> 7461 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a lot of examples that we need to confirm the need for 
a bill like this. We have of course, and this has been mentioned 
many times, the Oldman River dam project. The environmental 
assessment that should have been triggered and was not would 
have saved so many dollars, so much confusion and so many 
problems that have now gone on with a project like that. It has 
demonstrated and caused a confrontation rather than 
co-operation.
<P>
	We must avoid duplication. It emphasizes we must have 
provincial co-operation and third parties involved rather than 
just through the courts of law.
<P>
	Federal-provincial duplication is enormous. This is one area 
this bill does not address adequately that I would like to see 
possible amendments to. We must resolve these 
federal-provincial problems. That is essential with getting on 
with the job.
<P>
	I use an example of a company in my constituency. I have a 
letter from the Alberta environmental minister, Brian Evans, in 
which he says: ``I can assure you that the issue of duplication 
overlap is at the top of the agenda for Canadian ministers of the 
environment''. He goes on to say that the agreement that Alberta 
has signed will go a long way to help solve the problem.
<P>
	An Alberta government document goes on to state: ``This 
agreement will greatly reduce the burden placed on industry 
because of a dual regulatory framework. From now on the 
Alberta government will be the primary representative in 
dealing and contacts with the pulp and paper industry''. He goes 
on to describe other industries. He continues: ``The 
establishment of a single window at the provincial level does not 
relieve industry from the obligation to comply with federal 
regulations. Each level of government retains its respective 
legislative powers and can take legal action against defenders''. 
While it has moved some way it has not moved all the way.
<P>
	I will go on with some examples and look at some of the 
background where this harmonization just has not occurred. One 
thing I would like to stress here today is that we must get the 
harmonization of this environmental assessment program. I 
think all sides would agree. I am disappointed to hear some of 
the dissenters to that whom we have heard from today.
<P>
	I would also list four items that have been identified for me in 
my constituency. There is a big problem with reports between 
provincial and federal governments. There is a great variation 
between what they are asking for and yet they end up getting to 
the same place.
<P>
	Second, there is a real perception that business is doing 
something wrong and that they are always doing something 
wrong. The lack of co-operation where one government does 
not trust the other one has to be alleviated. We must get away 
from the idea that in fact industry cannot pay for and be involved 
in some of this analysis. We also must look at the regulations to 
be sure  they are realistic. Again, I have many examples of 
where unrealistic legislation is in place in terms of environment.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	The duplication of regulations has played havoc with 
particularly smaller oil companies. I can summarize some of 
this by listing four major areas. The purpose of most regulations 
is reasonable. However they become ridiculous when the 
administration of the regulations and the people involved begin 
to protect their own turf and refuse to be reasonable or 
co-operate with the other branches of government for fear of 
losing their power. Again we have many examples of that.
<P>
	We must also be concerned about their competitiveness 
within Canada. The number of reports keeps increasing which 
greatly handicaps smaller companies. Having one extra person 
to complete reports in a plant involving 10 people is quite a bit 
different than adding one person in a company of 500. We must 
consider that. We must keep these companies competitive.
<P>
	I quote an example from one of my constituents: ``In the early 
1980s I was closely involved with the major grassroots complex 
being built close to Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta. Over a period 
of two and a half years the company had to make a total of 4,200 
submissions, permits and other formal requests from every 
conceivable government branch in three layers of government. 
Many of the pieces of information was repeated many times over 
because a given permit could only be issued for 30 days. If we 
informed one level that the same information was sent two 
months ago to, say, the federal environmental group we were 
told that confidentiality prevented moving information between 
departments and the same information would have to be 
submitted in the new format requested''.
<P>
	At the end of the project a complete listing of the total number 
was sent to the Alberta economic development department for 
review because no one could believe the number and they were 
dismayed and shocked by the number of reports. We must 
address that. We must do something about that. We are literally 
putting small business out of business because of environmental 
regulations and no co-operation between levels of government. 
It is reasonable then. We must deal with this. We must address 
this problem.
<P>
	Going on, the lack of co-operation seems to go on and on. I 
will not get into all of this because I intend to deal with another 
subject. What we must do is end the duplication, the lack of 
co-operation, the protecting of different departments' turf that 
goes on in this whole area of environmental testing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7462"> 7462 </A></B>
<P>
	I finish this section off by saying I have an example of the 
bureaucratic growth that has gone on. In terms of water testing 
for a number of oil projects in Alberta the company does a 
complete set of independent lab studies. These go on, and I have 
copies of them, for some 30 to 40 pages. Then the province 
comes along and does the same testing and sampling and it goes 
through all of the expense and duplication of 30 or 40 pages. 
Then the federal government comes along and does all the same 
testing and it does 30 or 40 pages of reports on the same 
material. Neither side will talk to each other because each side is 
afraid of losing its jobs.
<P>
	That kind of environmental holding back of companies has to 
end. An example of the growth of bureaucracy in licensing is 
where reports used to be four pages, today they are 34 pages. 
Whether it is air emissions, sulphur emissions, or whatever, the 
reports go on and government grows.
<P>
	If I had to encourage anything I would encourage the 
harmonization of this environmental conflict and the 
co-operation between all of these levels of government and all 
of these bureaucrats.
<P>
	I would now like to get into another area which I have been 
involved with some 30 years now and that is in the 
environmental area that I feel involves all of us. A lot of people 
sort of laugh when I say I am really interested in this subject and 
that is the subject of landfills, the subject of garbage. The 
problem that all of us have is universal. It is a problem where 
everybody says: ``Don't put them in my backyard, put them over 
there''.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a universal problem across this country. There is a 
problem whether one is a landowner or whether one lives in a 
city or town. There are some basic problems that make this a 
federal issue. When we phone the Department of the 
Environment here, we are told: ``That is not our area, that is a 
provincial area''. This is a good example of where there are roles 
for the three levels of government.
<P>
	Let me propose what I have in mind. First, the biggest 
problem is from the seepage going on underneath the ground. 
We are contaminating groundwater. We are contaminating 
lakes. We are contaminating rivers. We are doing things to our 
environment that will only come forward 50 or 100 years from 
now.
<P>
	It is fine to build deficits and say: ``Well, we know we are 
going to have those to deal with''. Now we are going to tell them 
they are not going to have water to use. We must address that. 
What is the solution? There are solutions. One problem is they 
cost money. I think if people understood the problem and the 
potential time bomb they were creating, they would deal with 
this.
<P>
	Recycling, composting and incineration are all areas that 
somebody in Canada needs to look at. We could be world 
leaders. How can we work this through the provinces and 
through the cities? What happens now is  the feds say: ``Well, it 
is not our area. We cannot touch that because it is provincial''.
<P>
	I see the federal government providing the umbrella. I see the 
federal government providing the research and development, 
the technology, the gathering together of information, putting 
together the seminars it takes, getting the experts involved. I see 
it being the resource for all other levels of government. I see the 
provinces providing a unified delivery of the service and then I 
see the municipalities as the operators of whatever that facility 
is now.
<P>
	What happens today? Today we have the municipality doing 
the research, trying to decide what it should have. Meanwhile, it 
does not have the money, the technology or the people. It is not 
in a position to try to deal with that subject.
<P>
	I would like to see in a bill like this the ability and the 
encouragement of the federal government to get involved in this 
issue. It is an issue for everyone. All of us have garbage 
problems. It is one where I think we are putting our head in the 
sand in trying to deal with it.
<P>
	In summary my party and I would support this bill. It could go 
much further in the area of environmental leadership. I could see 
it taking on, as I say, things like landfills. It should speed up the 
process. It should save money. It must get involved in 
co-ordinating federal-provincial areas. It allows third party 
input and it does protect the individual from government force.
<P>
	Finally, the environment is a world issue. Being a member of 
the foreign affairs committee I can relate to the fact that this is a 
global problem. If China builds 18 huge coal generated power 
plants, that air will be over Canada in a couple of days. That air 
is going to affect us. That is air that we will have to breathe. We 
cannot be just a province or Canada. We must be the world when 
it comes to environment.
<P>
	I encourage all politicians to be concerned about China, the 
South American rain forest, and sustainable development. We 
can all play a role in that. We cannot put our heads in the sand 
any longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the member on 
his remarks. I want to deal with that part of his speech where he 
dealt with the ideas of composting and recycling.
<P>
	I agree with the member. This is an area where we could be 
world leaders.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	We are world leaders right now. The problem as I see it is that 
we do not have the political will to implement some of the 
technologies we have in the area of taking care of our garbage in 
a proper way. I believe this is so important that taxpayers would 
probably support us spending their money to make sure an 
aggressive campaign such as the one the member described was 
implemented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7463"> 7463 </A></B>
<P>
	I had difficulty in that often we have been conditioned by the 
Reform Party that spending is something that its members are 
very shy about. Is this an area where the Reform Party would 
shift its traditional attitude?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are areas in which 
we would not cut. We would be selective in our cutting and our 
balancing of costs. One area certainly would be environment 
where we would see no cutting. Our blue sheet said that possibly 
we might see in the area of criminal justice and environment an 
increase in spending.
<P>
	I would like to think the entire House could get behind a 
project like this one and show environmental leadership. The 
provinces need it and we could get them onside because it is a 
universal problem. If somebody can provide a solution for a 
universal problem, we could very easily get them onside. We 
have to get out there. We can call it a crusade but we have to 
handle the problem.
<P>
	We can have people pay for it. I believe that user pay will 
work in this area. Instead of paying $3 for handling their garbage 
people would in fact pay $6. I really believe they would if they 
knew what they were getting for their money. The big problem 
of people and of us not wanting to spend money is that we see 
waste and we cannot see value for our dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the member for 
Red Deer whom I compliment on his speech. He certainly 
brought some interesting ideas to the Chamber. I was very happy 
to listen to him today.
<P>
	In particular I was very pleased with the words that he used in 
his opening remarks. He talked about this being the ground of 
co-operation, the ground of compromise. Those are the grounds 
on which I believe the country was built. We live in a very 
diverse nation. Different people from coast to coast have relied 
on co-operation and compromise to see them through from day 
to day and year to year.
<P>
	The country was built on those grounds. I am very pleased to 
see the hon. member recognize those grounds at this time. I can 
only hope the same rules will apply to other issues in the 
Chamber when we are dealing with issues of great concern to the 
diverse peoples who live within our borders.
<P>
	My question deals with the issue of the Oldman dam that the 
member for Red Deer raised. Bill C-13 now provides some 
triggers that automatically gets the federal government involved 
in a project assessment. When I asked a similar question of the 
parliamentary secretary earlier today, he talked about the 
federal government being timid in the past in its approach to 
some of the issues guarded by the provinces.
<P>
	Could the member for Red Deer indicate whether he believes 
the federal government has a right to intervene when some of 
these triggers are in place and provincial governments hesitate 
and resist federal government involvement in the projects they 
are promoting?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, the real answer to that 
question is to get involved early enough. What so often has 
happened in the past, whether they have been political deals or 
lobby groups or special interest groups or whatever, is that there 
has been a real slow response by the federal government.
<P>
	The provinces have been slow but the federal government has 
been slower. The real answer to the problem that the hon. 
member raises is the speed of response. We hear about these 
projects. That is when the federal government should get in, 
provide the leadership role and start negotiations and 
compromising with the provincial governments. That is where it 
has to happen early rather than late as in the Oldman dam.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short supplementary 
question. In his speech the member also talked about water 
testing, in particular water testing for oil companies in Alberta.
<P>
	The member may be aware of a project near my constituency 
where Esso Resources has been withdrawing water with the 
approval of the provincial government from an aquifer that runs 
under the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Communities 
in my constituency have seen reduced water flow as a result of 
the work in Alberta. There has been a tremendous amount of 
wrangling between the Saskatchewan and the Alberta interests. 
There has been no room for federal government assessment or 
work to date.
<P>
	With the member's experience would he consider the support 
of a national water act that would help to bridge some of the gaps 
between provincial government interests and others to ensure 
that water is available to all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, we should realize that 
water will be the most important resource we have in the 21st 
century. I believe that puts us head and shoulders ahead of the 
rest of the world. We have something like 9 per cent of world's 
fresh water supplies. We have to keep it fresh and pure.
<P>
	Not knowing the exact details the member puts forward, I 
would think legislation to protect and preserve the water supply 
is essential and vital to the survival of the country. I firmly 
believe it is the most important resource we have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just noticed the clock. It is 
my understanding that we have only 10 minutes remaining in the 
day. I do have at least the full 20 minutes allocated to me. I 
wonder if the House would not like to see the clock and allow me 
the full 20 minutes when the House next convenes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7464"> 7464 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
prepared to agree with that if the House will then agree to put the 
question at that point.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could ask for 
further clarification. Are we only speaking about the 20-minute 
intervention or are we also including the 10-minute question or 
comment period? It is just the straight 20 minutes.
<P>
	Members have heard the suggestion of the government whip. 
Is that agreeable to the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for the 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake will have 20 minutes and I will put 
the question forthwith upon conclusion of his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I seem to have achieved something extra to what I 
wished. I was suggesting that when the House sits next I would 
conclude my remarks. However I am quite prepared to do so 
now.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on this very 
important bill. I have had a considerable amount of influence 
over the bill during the last four years. I am very much aware 
that the bill has been at least seven years in the making. When it 
was first proposed to the previous Parliament by the now leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois and then Minister of the Environment, I 
happened to be the New Democratic member responsible for 
environmental protection issues. Therefore I was asked by my 
party to sit in on discussions of Bill C-78 and to represent the 
New Democratic Party throughout the committee process on the 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	I was quite taken by the responsibilities I was given at that 
time because the House will recall there was a great deal of 
criticism of Bill C-78.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	The government began at that point a process that I think 
should be recommended for many other pieces of legislation. 
What began with Bill C-78 was something called a prestudy of 
the bill. In other words before the bill was introduced in the 
House the specific bill was presented to the parliamentary 
committee to have a look at it and allow for some intervention 
before the government actually introduced it and before the 
government would claim ownership of the wording of the bill.
<P>
	The prestudy process gave us an opportunity to examine the 
bill without the partisan interventions that occur often when 
sides dig in on a debate and will not yield any ground. The 
prestudy phase of Bill C-78, short as it was, began the process of 
openness about the bill.
<P>
	When Parliament of the time prorogued and the new 
Parliament began, the bill was reintroduced as Bill C-13. I had 
hoped at that point that with the prior work that had been done by 
the parliamentary committee Bill C-13 would have been 
amended by the government before being introduced into the 
new session. That not being the case, we were given an 
indication that the bill would be amended in committee with the 
approval of the government.
<P>
	We began the process of amending the bill. Again something 
happened in committee that I am very proud to say I was a part 
of. I would commend it to the government and to future 
governments as a way of dealing with legislation in a very 
non-confrontational way. The government indicated that it was 
prepared to accept amendments from the committee and we 
proceeded to approach the bill with that understanding. I 
submitted over 110 amendments to the committee for study.
<P>
	The point that I want to emphasize is that the committee chose 
to bring in legal experts to sit with us in the committee while we 
went through that amending process. Two environmental 
lawyers who had appeared as witnesses were brought in by the 
committee, Mr. Bill Andrews and Mr. Brian Pannell. They sat 
around the table and advised members of the committee about 
the legality and the practicality of amendments.
<P>
	It was a great exercise and one from which the committee 
benefited a great deal. In fact the country benefited a great deal 
from it because Bill C-13 was amended with their assistance. As 
a result the bill that has now been proclaimed by the government 
is the bill we amended. The member for Davenport being a 
member of the committee at the time, myself and others worked 
very hard to find the best possible bill in the spirit of 
compromise that needed to exist to achieve that result.
<P>
	The environment committee is presently doing a massive 
study of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. I would 
commend the use of environmental legal experts when the 
committee sits down to conduct its final review of the act and 
write the report that must be written which may indeed result in 
some additions, changes or amendments to the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. I believe the process of utilizing 
legal experts was of great benefit to us.
<P>
	Now we are at the point where after a year of waiting we have 
Bill C-13 proclaimed, the agency about to be established, a new 
environmental assessment process about to begin, some new 
regulations in place that are going to guide us through some very 
important assessment work into the future, and a couple of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7465"> 7465 </A></B>
<P>
amendments before the House to allow us again the opportunity 
to have a look at the bill.
<P>
	I will raise it in committee as well, but I believe the three 
amendments I support, the three amendments in front of us, are 
not sufficient to make the bill the important bill it could be.
<P>
	I mention a couple of things in this regard. The first is with 
regard to intervener funding. We have raised it a number of 
times in the House today. The intervener funding process is 
absolutely crucial to the positive workings of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act itself.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact, as we are well aware, proponents of projects generally 
have access to the capital they need to see that project through to 
completion. They budget for the preparation of environmental 
assessment reports. They budget for the public hearings that 
may take place. They are prepared to deal with that. However, 
without adequate intervener funding there cannot be adequate 
assessment quite simply because those who wish to challenge 
the proponent do not have the same access to capital as the 
proponent does and budgets for.
<P>
	It is very important that we set out a very specific intervener 
funding process to ensure that it is not only adequate but indeed 
meets all the criteria that we have established in the past for an 
intervener funding program that works positively. I commend 
the government for seeing the need to move forward with 
intervener funding in more specific terms like this. I hope that in 
the committee we will be able to broaden that out.
<P>
	I also suggest that the committee have another look at the 
regulatory process while looking at the act and there is the 
opportunity to review it. The regulatory process is what 
provides for the workings of the environmental assessment. The 
act sets out the guidelines but without the regulations the act is 
not much. The regulations make it work. This is why we have 
noticed and recognized that the regulation making process itself 
has been so controversial, so complex and has involved so much 
time.
<P>
	Members of cabinet, industry, and the environmental 
community have all had input into the regulation making 
process. However members of the House of Commons speaking 
for all Canadians have not had the opportunity to respond to the 
final product they have produced. Unlike the act where we can 
debate parts of it, we can go to committee and study parts of the 
act, in terms of the specific regulations members of Parliament 
in the House of Commons do not have the same opportunities to 
challenge parts of the regulatory process.
<P>
	It is time we looked at an amendment I raised two years ago in 
this very Chamber. It was an amendment similar to a clause in 
the existing gun control legislation that allows for members of 
Parliament and members of the other place to call before 
committee certain regulations for scrutiny. We should have a 
similar clause in the legislation that would allow us to call 
certain pieces of regulatory decisions and discuss them in 
committee.
<P>
	The process of ultimate cabinet responsibility should also be 
examined. Although I am supporting the amendment about 
cabinet responsibility at the moment, I do believe that at a time 
when governments are demonstrating they cannot be 
trusted-we had a government in this country for nine years that 
proved that-we have to ensure it is Parliament and the people 
of Canada in the end who have a full understanding and 
responsibility for matters like this.
<P>
	When a panel makes a decision based on a tremendous amount 
of information, the government should be looking very 
seriously at the results of that panel hearing. When cabinet 
makes a final decision on a panel recommendation members of 
the cabinet can never have read that recommendation but have 
been influenced by many members of industry who perhaps have 
been speaking to them in another context but have made their 
wishes well known. The secrecy of the cabinet room should not 
be the final arbiter of public environmental process.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	In any case I do recognize the accountability of government 
through the cabinet process. As I say I support the amendment 
before us, but it is important that perhaps the committee look at 
this process and see if there is not another way of dealing with 
this very important and specific issue.
<P>
	I believe very strongly in the concept of environmental 
assessment. I heard the witnesses who appeared before the 
committees on Bill C-78 and Bill C-13. Witnesses from the 
corporate community indicated very strongly that they wanted 
to see an environmental assessment process that was up front 
and took the issues on early and did not come at them after the 
fact.
<P>
	The court rulings that have been made across the country have 
indicated clearly that the guidelines that existed and continue to 
exist until Bill C-13 was proclaimed were inadequate to meet 
the needs of the country. Therefore Bill C-13 although it is not 
the one I would have written had I been the Minister of the 
Environment is very much a bill that moves us forward. 
Certainly the amendments in front of us do that as well.
<P>
	We have the opportunity to move this process forward a great 
deal further than the three amendments do. I hope the committee 
which will receive this bill at the will of the House at the end of 
my remarks tonight will look seriously at taking the bill a little 
further than the government is prepared to move at this point in 
time.
<P>
	I appreciate the co-operation of the House in allowing me to 
finish my remarks. In that spirit of co-operation and 
compromise I will not abuse the time of the House.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARTESTING">NUCLEAR TESTING</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs if he would urge the 
Prime Minister on his visit to Beijing to raise with Chinese 
authorities the need to end nuclear testing for the sake of 
planetary security.
<P>
	The non-proliferation treaty, or NPT, was signed in 1968 by 
approximately 160 nations. As part of this treaty countries with 
nuclear weapons have agreed to work toward the reduction of 
their nuclear arsenals and to work toward a comprehensive test 
ban treaty. Developing countries agreed not to develop nuclear 
weapons in exchange for information regarding peaceful uses of 
nuclear power.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	However since 1964, Britain has carried out some 44; France, 
210; and the United States more than 1,000 nuclear tests. During 
the last few years testing has virtually been suspended. Since 
1991 Russia has not tested any weapons nor has the United 
States. Britain has not undertaken any testing in recent years 
either. All major countries have put in place voluntary 
moratoria.
<P>
	Two weeks ago the Government of China carried out its 41st 
test. Therefore in addition to my earlier question to the Prime 
Minister, tonight I am asking the minister of external affairs 
whether he will personally take an interest in the negotiations of 
the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which will 
run out in 1995.
<P>
	Will Canada play a leadership role at the United Nations? Will 
Canada on behalf of all Canadians press the UN for a new treaty? 
Will that new treaty, first, ban the use of all nuclear weapons and 
weapons tests, and second, provide for better enforcement 
powers to the International Atomic Energy Agency so that better 
comprehensive monitoring of compliance can be carried out on 
behalf of the world community?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in continuing to 
conduct nuclear tests China is breaking the tacit moratorium 
which has been observed by all nuclear weapon states. China has 
said it will participate in comprehensive test ban treaty 
negotiations. Nonetheless continued testing by China draws into 
question its commitment to the early completion of the 
comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member it is true that on 
October 7, 1994 the People's Republic of China conducted its 
third underground nuclear test since the start of the CTBT 
negotiations.
<P>
	Although Britain, France, and the former Soviet Union, now 
the Russian Federation of the United States, have all instituted 
national testing moratoria, China has refused to stop testing, 
arguing that it needs further tests to catch up technologically 
with other nuclear weapon states.
<P>
	What Canada has done is encourage the People's Republic of 
China to engage in responsible, international behaviour with 
respect to arms sales and nuclear proliferation. To this end we 
have pressured China to end its testing program. Following the 
second test, our ambassador at the Conference on Disarmament 
in Geneva made a strong public appeal and, as members  know, 
following the last test the Chinese ambassador was called in by 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7467"> 7467 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and was apprised in no uncertain 
terms of Canada's condemnation of continued nuclear testing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who will be heading off to China very 
shortly, has been fully briefed on these matters and intends to 
raise them with the highest levels of the Chinese leadership.
<P>
	Canada's relationship with China on non-proliferation 
matters are complex. In some areas, like the cut-off and NPT 
extension, there is near-term potential for productive 
co-operation. On others like testing we will continue to press 
China to do the right thing and to join the other nations in 
banning nuclear testing once and for all.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.29 p.m.)
