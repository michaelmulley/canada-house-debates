<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LABOUR CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 7 consideration of Bill C-19, an act 
to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and 
of Motions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 30. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to the Group No. 2 
amendments to Bill C-19.  First I will address one of the most 
important amendments which has come forward on this bill.  It is 
proposed in the interests of maintaining democracy and protecting 
the rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code states that the board may order a 
representational vote on union certification to satisfy itself 
that the workers want a union.  Our amendment calls for the board 
to, without exception, hold a representational vote when 35% of 
the employees sign cards indicating they want union 
certification.  This amendment would ensure that the wishes of 
the majority of workers in a workplace are upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closely related to that amendment is our Motion No. 30 which 
would do away with the intent of Bill C-19 to allow the CIRB to 
certify a union even when there is no evidence of majority 
support if the board believes in its wisdom that there is 
sufficient support to justify certification.  This turns 
democracy and labour relations upside down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of under what conditions this certification 
would be allowed would be entirely in the hands of the CIRB. 
Bureaucrats rule.  We have seen in the sovereign province of 
Ontario what happens when there is this type of labour 
legislation.  The Wal-Mart case in Windsor is an example of what 
would happen in federally regulated industries if Bill C-19 were 
to pass without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To refresh the memory of hon. members, the Ontario Labour 
Relations Board ruled that Wal-Mart agreed to certify the union 
even though the employees at the Windsor store voted 151 to 43 
against it.  That was in May 1997.  The board contended that 
Wal-Mart had pressured the employees to vote against the union 
with threats that the store would close if it were unionized. 
Now the employees are fighting to get rid of their union and a 
decertification drive is under way.  Why should they have to go 
through that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings up another problem with Bill C-19.  There is no 
provision in the bill for secret ballots.  If there were a 
provision for secret ballots, both in certification and in strike 
votes, then there would be no problem with questions of pressure 
being applied to workers because nobody would know how they 
voted.  The people of Canada who send us here have a secret 
ballot when choosing their representatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meat and potatoes issue of who is going to represent them 
at the bargaining table, we do not and will not extend the voting 
privilege by secret ballot to working people regarding whether or 
not they want to certify union <I>A</I>, union <I>B</I> or none of 
the above.  Whatever happened to freedom of association in this 
country?  This is an absurdity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has another related anti-democratic measure which was 
partially smoothed over in committee, but not to the extent that 
it is yet acceptable to the Reform Party, and that is the 
requirement that employers must provide union organizers during a 
certification drive not only with the names of their employees, 
which is certainly fair ball, but also with their phone numbers 
and addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone was bucking union certification in their workplace 
would they want their phone number or their address to be made 
public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through this sort of thing in this country about 50 
years ago when the Liberal government of the day, in its wisdom, 
brought Hal Banks into Canada to break the seamen's union and to 
set up a union more to the satisfaction of the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It got the names and addresses of the members.  There were 
seafarers who had their legs broken.  There were even captains of 
vessels, who were not directly involved because they did not have 
to belong to the union, but because they were suspect of having 
taken the wrong side they were beaten up.  The goons knew where 
everybody could be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we have come a long way in the last 40 or 50 years. 
There is not the extent of union goonism now that there was in 
those days and it is not protected, aided and abetted by our 
federal government.  Nevertheless, it still happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has worked in forestry, anyone who has had anything 
to do particularly with the ports of this country, knows that 
people still have to watch their step if they do not want to get 
their nose smashed.  That is the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House should be realistic enough to appreciate that 
the whole world does not live in the little gilded cage that we 
inhabit on Parliament Hill.  Things get rough out there in the 
real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be setting people up to be in a position where 
they have to step up and say “Yes, we agree” in order to 
protect themselves and their families.  That is nuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privacy issue.  Even the privacy commissioner, our late, 
lamented privacy commissioner who is no longer with us, said that 
this is a very clear invasion of privacy.  It is anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 now has been partially ameliorated.  It says that the 
employer does not absolutely have to provide this information 
because the employee can take the initiative and go to the 
employer and say “Please don't give them this information”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in itself sets him up because then, in the workplace, that 
worker can be fingered.  They can say “Hey, he did not want us 
to know where he lives.  He did not want us to know his phone 
number.  Why?”  It is a bit of a half-step, but it does not 
nearly go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the big problems with certification without majority 
support.  I do not know who on earth came up with that stroke of 
genius. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carried a union card.  I imagine there are other members 
of this House who have carried a union card. 
I swear to God if I had ever been confronted with a situation 
like that where a group of bureaucrats said “that union is going 
to represent you and you have no choice in the matter” I would 
not have been a happy camper.  If we do not get rid of any other 
bad features of this bill, and they are legion, surely by passing 
Motion No. 30 we can get rid of that one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final thing I would like to mention is final selection 
arbitration.  We have been promoting this very strongly in the 
debates on this bill and I will not go into the details as I am 
sure the House is now familiar with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strike coming up in the very near future with the air 
traffic controllers.  They are ready to hit the bricks at NavCan. 
They and NavCan management are so far apart there is absolutely 
no possibility of reaching an agreement without outside 
interference. As usual, both sides of the debate are sitting 
there waiting and hoping the federal government will save their 
bacon by passing back to work legislation when it happens; the 
old routine. They can snarl and growl and start the strike but 
the federal government will come to the rescue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had final offer selection arbitration this sort of thing 
could not happen, would not happen.  The parties could freely 
negotiate and at the end of the day it would be settled by 
arbitrators and life would go on without a lot of difficulty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
begin by describing some of my background because I believe it 
helps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my life before coming to parliament I worked in the forest 
industry for 25 years, largely in labour-management situations, 
the IWA being the major union, but there were other strong union 
areas.  Port Alberni within my riding has been a strong union 
town for many years.  The people there have been well paid.  The 
union has served them extremely well.  I can recall approximately 
15 years ago when Port Alberni was in the top two and for about 
five years in the top five per capital income in Canada largely 
because of the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions have served people particularly well.  However, this 
legislation in my view tears some of that down.  First and 
foremost, unions must represent their people.  This bill would 
allow the certification of a union without that representative 
vote, without 50% of the people within the union saying they want 
to do this.  If we go back to unions 50 or 60 years ago there 
were a lot of tactics involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall talking to some of the older people in Alberni when if 
they were not on the right side of the union a rake could be 
dragged down the side of their car or their child could come home 
with a bloody nose because of what dad did.  Those were the old 
style tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this bill does not address the real issues.  With the old 
bill, the old ways, people had to certify for a vote.  The union 
cards had to go forward, they had to sign and say they want to 
certify a union.  Unfortunately this new bill will bypass that 
situation where the labour board thinks that there may be a 
situation, just perception, and then we end up with a union.  We 
end up with a union the workers may not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am baffled. Whose interest is this supposed to serve? In my 
view unions were to serve the employees they represented. This 
portion of the bill would undo that because clearly, as in the 
Wal-Mart case, the majority of the employees did not want to be 
unionized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address essential services because there 
are a number of facets in this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues we always get depends on how vocal the item 
is.  We all are familiar with our local municipal strikes. The 
first thing that does not get picked up is the garbage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very good tactic because it is visible, it is right 
out front.  However, if there is an issue that is not visible and 
not up front, it can be causing the same pain but people do not 
see it.  There has to be some provision for an essential service, 
and I will go back to my home province of B.C. If the B.C. 
ferries go on strike for an extended period of time, that is a 
major disruption in people's lives, particularly on the island. 
There needs to be some way to address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Motion No. 7 calls for the board to hold a representative 
vote when 35% of the employees sign cards indicating they want a 
union.  We believe that is fair and reasonable because it upholds 
the majority position of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 30, the bill would allow the CIRB to certify a 
union even if there is no evidence of majority support, and this 
is if the board believes there would have been support had it not 
been for unfair labour practice.  This is the Wal-Mart case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of what constitutes an unfair practice is 
simply left up to the board. Again we have a group of people, 
somewhat untouchable, deciding the fate.  We feel this is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Wal-Mart case we have talked about many times it was 151 
to 43 against certifying yet the government certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are a number of areas we will be talking about today. My 
colleagues and I will push this issue because we feel it is 
paramount.  It indicates the pushiness of this government, the 
unfeeling nature where it wants to push.  It is not just in 
labour.  It is in Senate appointments, it is in the backbench 
Liberals being told to jump up. It is an attitude of the way 
people should be represented.  The Reform way is distinctly 
different from the Liberal way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to these amendments on Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My thrust today is going to be from an employer's perspective. 
There are a lot of people in this House who are concerned about 
the worker perspective, but what about the employer's 
perspective?  We have heard some comments on that, sort of 
painting that a bit, but let us go a little further with that for 
a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a good case to illustrate the danger of some of these 
amendments is the Wal-Mart case we have been alluding to, but let 
us take that case and put it in a broader perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case a number of employees were working to certify a 
union and have a union within the Wal-Mart operation. With these 
amendments the situation that employer finds himself in is that 
he is now asked by the board if he will potentially shut down the 
operation if a union is certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That employer finds himself in a very difficult situation.  He 
consults with his own legal counsel and he is told if he says 
yes, there is a problem because he will be perceived to have 
taken a position that is intimidating the employees and therefore 
that position will be used to justify certifying a union even 
when less than the majority of the employees support doing so. So 
it might not be a good idea to say yes because now no matter what 
they vote, as long as over 35% of the people are in support of 
it, there will be a union.  If he says yes that will be perceived 
to be intimidation tactics against the membership or against the 
employees.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other option he could be advised to do would be to say he is 
not in support, he will not shut down the operation. If he takes 
that position he also runs the risk that should at some point in 
the future his situation change so that he cannot continue to 
operate without some sort of temporary closure or a long term 
closure, he has now opened himself up for all kinds of legal 
liability, lawsuits and persecution in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore he cannot say yes, he cannot say no.  What can he say? 
He can say no comment.  That is what was said in the Wal-Mart 
scenario, “we are not going to make any comment, we are not sure 
what we are going to do”.   It would seem that would be safe 
ground, but the amazing thing is that the labour board took that 
no comment and interpreted that as a statement of intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an employer takes the no comment position they are still 
perceived to be intimidating their employees.  This really 
underlines our concerns about how this section can be misused. 
This is a perfect example. It is the reason why so many of us are 
bringing this forward to the House and to Canadians in general. 
We have a clear case where the employer has no room to move, no 
matter what position he takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is this employer really concerned about?  Who is he trying 
to meet the needs of?  We paint these employers as if somehow 
they have some grudge against their employees. That is certainly 
not the case, in particular with this operation.  These are 
employers who are concerned about the livelihood of their 
employees, their families. They want to make sure there is a 
viable operation for years hence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have a labour board that puts these employers in an 
absolutely no win situation.  It is that kind of thrust that has 
concerned Reformers in a variety of arenas, not just this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who would support this kind of amendment are those people 
who feel government is going to solve all our problems and if we 
could just get more government we would solve all our problems. 
They put their faith in government which is a big mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a micro example of the theme that runs through our 
current state in Canada again and again of those who say “I 
trust the government.  I trust the labour board.  I trust these 
people to always look after our best interests”.  That is 
abdicating our responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been a nation founded on people taking their 
responsibility and acting on it.  These amendments, in particular 
the ones that say less than the majority of employees can express 
their will and impose that will on the majority of the employees 
by not requiring a majority vote, totally usurp the history and 
tradition we have of Canadians taking responsibility, being able 
to express their own personal desires, let those desires be 
reflected in a vote and with the majority of support move ahead 
on that basis. These amendments are totally counter to that kind 
of thrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the basis for a very serious concern on the part of 
Reformers and will continue to be the concern of Reformers on 
this bill and any other kind of legislation that comes forward 
from this government.  This party is representing grassroots 
Canadians who remember their history and who are concerned about 
having their country hijacked by an overzealous bureaucracy which 
feels it knows best without listening to grassroots Canadians. 
These grassroots Canadians have shaped our policies and put us 
here in the House of Commons.  They are fighting to get their 
country back from an overzealous bureaucracy and the ones I have 
met and know are not going to give up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to engage in the debate on Bill C-19 and the 
amendments before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened intently to my hon. colleague.  I am in agreement 
with a number of the comments he made in regard to the Group No. 
2 amendments that we are discussing.  We are discussing important 
amendments to an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus first on Motion No. 6.  Procedures and 
scheduling problems needlessly prolong board decisions. Motion 
No. 6 that the Bloc has put forward relates to that.  The bill 
streamlines the Canada Industrial Relations Board's procedures by 
allowing it to make decisions without oral hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often a number of briefs are presented which are quite 
complicated and have quite a lot of information in them. At this 
stage it is necessary that individuals have an opportunity to 
follow up on those briefs, to ask questions and to further 
explore through an oral hearing exactly what the information is 
that is being put forward. Without the opportunity to have an 
oral hearing and to simply rely on the written word without a 
chance to follow up, we do not have an opportunity to fully 
disclose the information available and make a good decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that in this place in our committee meetings.  We receive 
a written brief.  We go through the written brief.  Witnesses 
come before us.  We do not simply decide on the written brief. We 
look at all the information that is presented.  Often a witness 
will read the brief to us and then we have an opportunity to ask 
the witness questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same kind of situation should apply to the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board.  It is wise to be able to follow up and ask 
questions on the information presented in those briefs. Without 
doing that, we are asking people to wade through a mountain of 
documents and to come to a decision without any input from the 
individuals who have written the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the opportunity for an oral hearing.  It will help 
expedite some of the minor cases and will streamline the process. 
In the end it should save taxpayer dollars.  We think that 
particular amendment by our colleagues in the Bloc goes too far. 
We need the opportunity for oral hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about Motion No. 7 which is a Reform motion, a 
democracy related motion.  The Canada Labour Code states that the 
board may order a representational vote on union certification to 
satisfy itself that the workers want the union. Our amendment 
calls for the board to hold a representational vote when 35% of 
the employees sign cards indicating they want union 
certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment ensures the wishes of the majority are upheld. 
We are talking about democracy and a bill that is going to put 
something in place that affects a great number of workers.  As a 
member of a number of different unions I have had the opportunity 
to voice my concerns to my union representative and even further 
than that in a democratic way.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would certainly ensure that the wishes of the 
majority are upheld.  How can we even argue that upholding the 
will of the majority is something that would not be a positive? 
Of course it is a positive and something that definitely needs to 
be added to the bill.  That is why I speak in strong support of 
Motion No. 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to Motion No. 8, there should be a vote of the 
majority of the members in the employers group before action is 
taken.  Bloc Motion No. 8 would weaken the employers association. 
It is a common practice for a group of employers to join forces 
and have one agent represent them in negotiations, which only 
makes sense.  At the same time, of course, the amendment removes 
the requirement that the board must satisfy itself that the 
employer representative is no longer qualified to act in that 
capacity before revoking the appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment being proposed by our colleagues in the Bloc 
provides for the automatic removal of the employer rep upon the 
receipt of an application from one or more of the employers in 
the group and the appointment of a new representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Motion No. 30, we support this amendment which we 
are bringing forward.  The bill allows the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board to certify a union even if there is no evidence 
of majority support if the board believes there would have been 
support had it not been for the employer's unfair labour 
practices. The determination of what constitutes an unfair labour 
practice is left up to the CIRB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to the issue of democracy and talk a 
little bit about some of my experiences as a union member.  This 
is an important bill and changes have not been made for I believe 
25 years to the act.  If the government is intent on making 
changes, it is imperative that it make changes that are positive. 
In making those changes it should take the time and effort to 
ensure that it is a bill that is positive for both employers and 
employees, that it is fair, democratic and represents the wishes 
of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the information related here in these motions under 
Group No. 2 are of concern.  I mentioned this earlier in my 
speech but I would like to go back to it because it is at the 
crux of the issue.  The most important and crucial part of the 
bill is democracy. Rather than go on to other points, I would 
like to continue to focus on the democracy aspect of Motion No. 
7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a union member, on occasion situations arose where 
there was unrest in terms of labour negotiations, contract 
settlements and whatnot.  Fortunately with every union I was a 
part of, the employer group that worked with the union was able 
to resolve the issues it had and was able to go on with a 
harmonious working relationship.  A key thing in any bill having 
to do with labour relations is that the employee group and the 
employer are able to work together to solve any disputes they 
might have in a way that continues on that working relationship 
with the employee group and the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases we have seen friction which has affected the 
relationship between the employer group and the employees. If 
there are going to be changes to the bill, time needs to be taken 
in order to work out all of the amendments in all parts of the 
bill so that it works in a very effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that democracy is very important and 
Motion No. 7 addresses that concern.  It would allow for the 
views and wishes of the majority to be represented.

this important bill, Bill C-19. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to speak on Bill C-19 which is an act to amend part 
I of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see workers in industry.  It is very important for us to look 
carefully into the industrial relations that are governing the 
businesses in this country.  Many workers feel intimidated and 
that their rights are not the way they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever we do here in this Chamber should protect the rights of 
the majority, not the few in society.  In the labour force I 
believe that most of the workers believe that their rights should 
be preserved. That can be done when they are given some 
protection such as with secret ballots.  If they are not voting 
by secret ballot, there could be intimidation, there could be 
some other dangers.  Their rights will not be preserved to the 
extent they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be opposing this part of the bill because it does not 
give freedom to the workers.  It does not create the necessary 
balance which we want in industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provisions of the bill do not give workers the right to 
express what they want to express.  To create a balance between 
the majority and a few of the workers, we should give them the 
freedom to express their views which can only be done by secret 
ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some experience in talking to workers who belong to 
unions in my constituency. I am told that some members of the 
unions are not satisfied with the way they are allowed to express 
their thoughts, their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in closing that with Bill C-19, industrial relations are 
important and the rules to govern workers are very important. 
Whatever we do in this Chamber we should do to benefit the 
majority of the people in Canada.  To respect the wishes of the 
majority we should allow the workers to express their wishes by 
secret ballot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to speak to Bill C-19, the labour code, and the 
amendments which are before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start off by saying how important the 
legislation is to the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla and in 
particular the forest workers in our province.  It is interesting 
to note that this is forestry week in Canada so it is very 
important that the legislation be debated in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other industries are also vital and important for the economy of 
British Columbia.  Ranchers, loggers, people in the mining 
industry, all of those people have a stake in what is before us 
in Bill C-19.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is important to the people who work in those 
industries that are vital to the economy of British Columbia and 
all of Canada, the industries that make our country so vibrant. 
Today I will focus on the importance of Reform Party's motion on 
democracy.  It is important not only to this legislation but to 
the way the country operates.  If we truly want democracy to 
prevail in Canada, if we want it to be more than just a mere 
facade or a word we use now and then, we should make sure 
democracy is reflected in the legislation that goes forward from 
the House.  That is why this is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code states that the board may order a 
representation vote on union certification to satisfy itself that 
the workers want the union.  Our amendment calls for the board to 
hold a representational vote when 35% of the employees sign cards 
indicating they want union certification.  This amendment ensures 
the wishes of the majority are upheld.  That is a very important 
part of the legislation.  We are putting forward a democratic 
principle.  That is why the bill is so important to the official 
opposition in Canada.  We want to ensure those workers have every 
democratic tool available to receive the proper consideration 
when it comes to union certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is worthy of the support of the entire House.  We 
should give it our due consideration.  Regardless of party, 
whether the New Democratic Party or the Conservative Party, all 
members should support the motion, including a few Liberals who 
might have a democratic bone in their bodies somewhere, although 
we do not see that demonstrated in much of the legislation that 
comes before the House.  The way they instituted party 
discipline, for instance, when it came to the hepatitis C vote 
before the House, there was no democratic bone in anyone's body 
on that side of the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tool, a principle and a pillar of what we stand for as 
Canadians.  We should have these democratic principles.  If we do 
not, this place certainly is just a theatre for the public to 
watch from the galleries on occasion just to satisfy themselves 
that it appears to be a democracy.  In true essence it is nothing 
more than a place where we act out legislation that the 
government will ram through in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very important for the workers of Canada.  I rose 
to speak today in particular about workers in British Columbia. 
They want the ability to join unions.  They want to be able to 
freely choose the union they wish to participate in. They want 
the democratic tool to do so.  It is only reasonable the House 
would give them the power to ensure they have a vote and are able 
to use the democratic principle we sometimes enjoy in the House 
of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-19, the bill we are talking about today, is about 
democracy.  That is why I want to speak to Bill C-19, 
specifically to the motions in Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in the House before about how strongly I believe 
in democracy and freedom, freedom of competition and all these 
things that we in Canada quite often take for granted.  The 
Reform Party and many other parties in the House are trying to 
propose amendments to the bill to get back to the freedom, the 
democracy we so cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the bill died in the Senate in the last parliament, 
Bill C-66.  It has now been reintroduced in this parliament with 
minor changes.  I do not think very serious changes have been 
made.  That is why we see so many of the opposition parties 
proposing amendments.  It is very important that we take the bill 
seriously and try to accomplish something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this place we often forget that as political parties we have 
the job of working together to create legislation that is good 
for the country, and especially in this case good for labour. I 
am excited to see that many members in many parties are taking 
the chance to make the legislation better.  I hope the Liberals 
will work with us in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I will speak a bit to Motion No. 7.  Reform has 
always been fighting for more democracy, especially in various 
organizations and particularly in labour organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is democracy in motion.  I think all of us in the House try 
to work toward it by representing our ridings and the views of 
our constituents.  I know Reform finds this very important.  It 
is something we try to push toward, especially at report stage of 
Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically on the whole issue of the representational vote 
when groups of people in labour want union certification, Reform 
believes, and I think many people agree, that as long as 35% of 
people in an organization want union certification they should be 
allowed to have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interest of democracy and in the interest of having 
labour work effectively.  That is one of the things we are 
pushing for in Motion No. 7.  The whole premise behind this 
motion is that we want the wishes of the majority through a 
democratic process to be upheld.  Quite often we forget that in 
the daily events of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are innocent people out there who are trying to work for 
the common good.  They are trying to support their families and 
their livelihoods.  We should be able to put legislation through 
the House and work toward putting legislation through the House 
that is in the interest of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also talks about many other things when it comes to 
labour and arbitration.  The core of anything that happens when 
it comes to labour has to be based around democracy and what is 
good for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to focus on protecting the views, especially in this 
case, of the majority of people who want to see changes happen in 
a positive way through labour.  We need to allow the democratic 
process to work.  As I mentioned, overall that is something that 
leads hand in hand to creating more competitive markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as we know, members opposite seem to want to put 
many obstacles into the process of trying to create an effective 
markets, trying to create more competitive markets and trying to 
give Canadian workers the competitive edge they need to compete 
in a global society.  I am upset to see that.  I would hope they 
would put the interests of workers first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads into the whole view of competition, freedom and 
access to global markets. 
Many of the changes that have been made in Bill C-19 would affect 
the way grain is transported and the way we can access foreign 
markets.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a step back and see the way the world is evolving, we 
see the way competition has continued to grow and how we have 
achieved a sense of a global market.  We need to give all the 
advantages to Canadian labour and to Canadian business to be able 
to compete in foreign markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a step back and see how we can help the process 
of getting democracy in motion and getting labour legislation to 
reflect it.  We need to do all we can to support it.  Overall we 
will see a much more democratic, much more healthy part of our 
economy evolve from that.  As well labour will reflect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major point is something we cannot forget.  As much as 
we like to often hear members on the far left talking about 
restricting globalization, restricting competition among foreign 
countries, I cannot comprehend that.  For me and from my 
background I feel it is fundamental that we have freedom of 
competition.  That must be reflected in our labour laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about allowing groups in Bill C-19 to have formal 
certification to unionize, it has to be allowed with that 
democratic percentage, that vote of 35%.  Also we have to move 
toward a further goal of allowing Canadian labour to compete in 
foreign markets.  We need to give Canadians, Canadian businesses 
and Canadian labour the competitive advantage.  We need to allow 
them to compete in global markets and we need to support them 
when they want to achieve those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is supposed to uphold these types of visions.  It is 
supposed to uphold the strong convictions of making Canada more 
democratic, making it a better place to live and giving the 
advantage to Canadians to provide for themselves.  Unfortunately 
we do not see that applied often in much of the legislation that 
is produced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to take a step back and evaluate what we 
are doing here today.  I urge them to ask themselves how we can 
make this place better, how we can help make legislation better 
to represent Canadians and labour.  Even if it means putting 
party lines aside, it is a goal we must have as federal 
legislators to do what is right for the country.  That is what we 
must work toward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is National Forestry Week in Canada and how 
appropriate and sadly ironic given the terrible fires that are 
raging in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada boasts 235 million hectares of commercial forest land.  We 
have a thriving industry of private woodlot owners who provide 
important environmental, economic and social benefits to their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite such good news, there are still a number of major 
hurdles that our forestry industry must overcome, due in large 
part to the policies of this government.  For example, the 
Liberals have eliminated the federal-provincial forestry 
agreement that was established by the Conservatives in the 1980s 
which provided much needed funding for silviculture management. 
In addition, Canada's taxation policies do nothing to encourage 
landowners to invest in sustainable management practices that 
would allow for increased fibre production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we celebrate National Forestry Week, I call on the government 
to recognize the tremendous contributions made by private woodlot 
owners to our economy.  Investing in our forest industry today 
will ensure its viability for future generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, newspapers 
across the country are publishing government documents that show 
clearly that from the seventies and the eighties the Liberal 
government knew and did not act on the tainted blood issue. It 
had information that could have prevented this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the real reason this government will not go back and 
compensate before 1986 because the Prime Minister was a member of 
the cabinet that could have prevented this tragedy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the documents referred to in this morning's reports were all in 
the hands of Mr. Justice Krever.  He took them into account when 
he prepared his report in three full volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of that report makes it clear from the chronology that 
it was really 1986 when those responsible should have and could 
have acted to put tests in place to verify the presence of these 
contaminants in the blood supply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
documents are a real potent reminder of what exactly this 
government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulators ignored reports in the <I>New England Journal of 
Medicine</I>, a prestigious medical journal.  They also ignored 
what other countries were doing.  They grossly underestimated the 
numbers of people infected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government shirked its responsibility in those days. 
Why is it shirking that responsibility today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Justice Krever said that compensation for hepatitis 
C victims should come from the provinces.  He made no reference 
to support coming from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that, this government through the Minister of Health 
took the lead in bringing the provinces to the table to work out 
a compensation plan and put $800 million on the table, with the 
provinces coming up with only $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows our concern.  This shows our sense of commitment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the file is 
still open and I think the noose is tightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is the government in the seventies and 
eighties had access to that information.  When Judge Krever asked 
for the documents to show what the cabinet said about this, what 
did it do?  It closed the file.  It would not let anybody see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is not the reason that those files were closed is that the 
Liberal government cares more about its own than about victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, he is misstating completely.  I reject this premise with 
respect to the position of this or previous governments and the 
position of the Krever commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this material was made available quite freely and openly to 
the Krever commission.  Mr. Justice Krever took it fully into 
account.  He commented on it to the extent he considered 
necessary and he said compensation should be paid to all victims 
and it should come from the provinces. 
In spite of this we have exercised our concern.  We have 
expressed our concern through bringing the provinces to the table 
and offering $800 million.

the federal government is a senior partner in this issue and the 
Deputy Prime Minister knows better.  The facts are clear. The 
federal regulators knew the blood system was contaminated prior 
to 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal regulators knew that surrogate testing was 
available.  The federal Liberal government of the day chose not 
to implement that testing.  As a result thousands of Canadians 
were infected with tainted blood and have hepatitis C.

right thing, and compensate all victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member overlooks the fact that all the documents 
referred to in the report this morning were in the hands of Mr. 
Justice Krever when he examined the history and came to his 
conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from his report, it is clear from a reading of his 
chronology, that it was in 1986 when those responsible could and 
should have acted and put tests in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize the point made by the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Even after his lengthy years long study and his three volume 
exhaustive report, Mr. Justice Krever recommended compensation be 
paid by the provinces.  Notwithstanding that, this government 
showed leadership by arranging for compensation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Okanagan—Coquihalla. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government is responsible because it was the federal 
regulators who made the error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a solid month now we have been hearing the government 
denying its liability.  In fact, it has been blaming other 
governments.  The Liberals have no problem fingering a government 
when they were not in power.  The fact is this scandal goes back 
to the Trudeau Liberals.  Why does this government insist on 
protecting its own political butts instead of protecting 
Canadians through a healthy blood system?  Compensate all 
victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, a week ago in the House the hon. member's party was 
urging us to accept the Krever report.  If that is the case why 
does it not continue with that position and accept that Mr. 
Justice Krever called for compensation of all victims but he said 
it should be done by the provincial governments?  He did not find 
the fault that the Reform Party is inaccurately and unworthily 
trying to attribute to previous Liberal governments.

federal government is in such a hurry to create a place in 
history with its millennium scholarships that it is shamelessly 
fiddling about with its financial statements and including an 
expenditure of $2.5 billion in 1997-98, when the foundation does 
not yet exist and no scholarships will be given out until 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times will the auditor general have to rap the knuckles

CIDA has done its utmost to address the problems of the most

Mr. Speaker, this report was received yesterday by us and by the 
Ontario and Quebec governments subsequent to discussions a number 
of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting proposal.  It does entail the expenditure 
of public funds. As the hon. member knows full well, I have been

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a member of the transport committee that is

that these people did not bring it up when they appeared before

</I></B></P><P align=left>If this product is so financially attractive, the six companies

quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canso Trawlermen's Co-op and the ACS company of Mulgrave

<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

I should say the good news is that there is more shrimp available 
this year than last.  In one area at least, area 6, it is 
substantially higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem side of this is that the requests of those who wish 
allocations, including the communities to which the hon. member 
referred, far exceed the shrimp available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a very difficult decision.  It will probably be made 
within the next four to ten days.  I assure the member that the 
representations made by the people in his province, as well as

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been informed that due to the soft shells of the crab 
this year fishermen have been forced to comply with a 48 hour 
notice to close the fishery in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By confining fishermen to an area that is insufficient and by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

fishery that the hon. member mentioned is one of conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns with conservation because the biomass of crabs 
has declined quite dramatically.  We expect that there will be a 
turn up in some two to three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we have to take conservation measures.  When it

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services explain: (<I>a</I>) what public tendering processes

Madeleine</I>; (<I>b</I>) how many passengers and cars this ship can

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  In so far as Public 
Works and Government Services Canada and Transport Canada are 
concerned: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The operator, CTMA Traversier Ltée, identified the 
availability of a used vessel.  There was no public tendering 
process.  As has been the case in the past when it was in the best 
interest of the public to do so, Treasury Board of Canada has 
provided approval for the purchase of the <I>M.V. Madeleine</I>, then 
named <I>M.V. Isle of Inisturk</I>.  In acquiring this vessel the Crown 
benefited from exceptional circumstances as a result of an offer 
from Irish Ferries Limited to sell the vessel to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The <I>M.V. Madeleine</I> can carry over 1,000 passengers, 258 
automobiles and 29 tractor trailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The <I>M.V. Madeleine</I> entered into service on July 5, 1997. 
During its operating season (between July 5, 1997 and December 31, 
1997) the ferry carried 51,790 passengers, 18,424 passenger 
vehicles and 1,393 commercial vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note: The ferry service does not operate between late January and 
the end of March, depending on ice conditions.  In addtion, the 
<I>M.V. Madeleine</I> underwent a scheduled refit between November 5 to 
December 5, 1997, during which time the <I>M.V. Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I> carried out the <I>M.V. Madeleine</I>'s schedule service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The subsidy for the 1997 operating year was $2.4 million, 
which is equal to the amount of the previous year.  Subsidy 
levels are expected to remain the same for the foreseeable 
future.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LABOUR CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK183">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House The House resumed consideration of Bill C-19, an act to 
amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts as reported (with amendment) from the committee; 
and of Motions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 30. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in debate on Bill C-19. The most  controversial aspect 
of the examination of the Canada Labour Code is, without a 
doubt, the matter of replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, only two provinces have passed legislation at this 
time to restrict employers' use of replacement workers, or scabs 
as we call them in Abitibi, during work stoppages. 
Those two provinces are Quebec, where there have been 
restrictions since 1977, and British Columbia since 1993. 
Ontario had adopted similar mechanisms in 1993, but these were 
done away with in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where sectors under federal jurisdiction are concerned, there 
have been numerous conflicts which have raised greater awareness 
of this issue, but to date the code contains no clauses banning 
the use of replacement workers during work stoppages.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force found that, despite the opposing points of view 
of labour and management, there was one point on which they both 
agreed, which was that “no one believes the use of replacement 
workers is justified if this is intended to do away with a union 
or to undermine its role, rather than  to obtain an acceptable 
collective agreement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the majority of the task force recommended, there will not be 
a blanket ban on the use of replacement workers.  The Canada 
Labour Relations Board will, however, be empowered to order an 
employer to cease to use such workers during a strike— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that 
the hon. member for Abitibi is not addressing Group No. 2. He is 
speaking to a motion which will come up later in the debate, we 
hope, unless the Reform Party amends it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is totally out of order.  Not that this is not interesting 
but it is totally out of order when we are supposed to be 
looking at Group No. 2. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières is quite correct that we are supposed to be 
debating the motions in Group No. 2.  However, there has been a 
good deal of latitude during the course of this debate and it 
would be unfair of the Chair to be particularly restrictive to a 
particular member in light of the fact that there has been quite 
a bit latitude.  Perhaps the member for Abitibi would be 
conscious of the remarks of the member for Trois-Rivières and 
every once in a while talk to the debate at hand just to keep us 
on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will endeavour to keep the debate more closely 
relative to the specific motions at hand.  I thank the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières for bringing this to my attention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your judgment and 
the comment by the member for Trois-Rivières.  It is true, I did 
notice a certain latitude in the speeches since this morning. 
It is the only time today.  We have until 1.30 p.m.  It is true 
that we can speak about the motions in Group No. 2.  If members 
want me to speak about the motions in Group No. 2, I have just 
done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of task force members said they would not recommend 
a general ban on replacement workers during illegal work 
stoppages. Members did, however, recommend a certain number of 
amendments to the code so that these workers would not be used 
to reduce bargaining rights and so that the rights of workers in 
a bargaining unit who were on strike or locked out would be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adoption of these measures constitutes a balanced solution 
to the issue of replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did I depart from the motions in Group No. 2.  I did so 
because, during the last postal strike in 1997, the federal 
minister, the Liberal member for Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, 
decided, as the minister responsible for Canada Post, not to 
bring in strikebreakers, or scabs.  That is the reality of a 
minister of action who, by his decision, helped workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the words strikebreaker and scab do not have the 
same connotation in the other provinces.  Nowadays, we speak 
about replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to say today, leaving aside the motions in Group 
No. 2, as the member for Trois-Rivières pointed out, is that, in 
November 1992, I introduced a bill in the House of Commons to 
amend the Canada Labour Code so as to prohibit strikebreakers. 
It was also intended to amend the Canada Labour Code in order to 
prevent crown corporations from resorting to strikebreakers 
during a dispute to maintain essential services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now, and this is important, Quebec's major 
labour organizations have been taking a civilized and 
responsible approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the future of our workers in Canada, in Quebec, and in 
Abitibi, federal and provincial crown corporations should, in 
any general strike, follow the example of the federal minister, 
the Liberal member for Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, who, during the 
last strike by Canada Post, introduced a general ban on 
employers bringing in other workers to replace striking 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us follow the example of this minister.  Let us follow the 
example of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to speak to the motions before us today.  I am going to 
concentrate on two of the motions. Primarily I am going to talk 
about democracy and the democratic rights of labour union members 
and workers to choose their agents in order to basically have a 
say in what happens to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it might be illustrative for all the eager Liberals on 
the other side, those who really want to hear examples and facts, 
to tell them a bit of my own personal experience since I worked 
for many years in what would be called a compulsory union shop. 
That is rather remarkable since I am a professional 
mathematician.  I taught at the Northern Alberta Institute of 
Technology.  At the time when I started there was no union there. 
It was run by the provincial government directly as an arm of the 
department of advanced education.  We had no union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that those were some of the finest years we had 
because we were able on very short notice to make adjustments to 
salaries and benefits as needed in order to attract qualified 
staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened a few years later that the provincial government on 
being pushed by certain numbers of people there allowed the 
formation of a union, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees. 
Because we were run directly as an arm of the federal government, 
we were then forced into membership in the union.  Preceding that 
all we had was a loose association.  It was called the CSA, the 
civil service association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil service association before the union was able to bring 
matters of concern to the employer.  We did that at the local 
level at the institute and most of our grievances were dealt with 
fairly and quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along came the government giving its approval to the union and 
we then had a forced union membership.  Instantly a number of 
things happened.  Instead of having one boss, we now had two 
bosses.  Instead of having quick and easy ways of adjusting our 
working conditions, salary and so on, it became a cumbersome 
legal thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying all this, I am not in any denigrating the unions or 
the union movement.  As has been stated by a number of other 
people, there has been a number of very positive contributions 
made by the unions over the past number of years in this country 
and in other countries in improving the lot of workers. But there 
are some situations where a union shop just does not fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our professional capacity there as instructors it did not 
fit. The reason I say this is we were not permitted to exercise 
our democratic rights.  As a matter of fact, and this will come 
perhaps as a surprise to some members, I was actually for a time 
the president of the local of the union there.  I got totally fed 
up with the union guys at headquarters telling us what we had to 
ask for and totally ignoring what our membership at our place of 
work wanted.  It was very frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In expressing my frustrations against the union my colleagues 
said that's our man, and lo and behold they elected me and I was 
the president of the local because I was ready to stand up for 
democracy.  I suppose I was a reformer before Reform was even 
invented.  I thought the wishes of the people represented took 
precedence over the organization to which they belonged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were forced into the union and here I was a member of that 
union.  I tried my best to represent our wishes.  I was trying as 
much as possible to co-operate with our employer, with the 
administration of the place.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When occasion required it, on behalf of our members I made 
forceful representations in order to correct things that were not 
right.  Most of my frustration was with the union.  It would not 
listen.  We had very inequitable treatment. We were taxed by the 
union about three times as much as the average for that union. 
We were about 10% of the total membership so it really did not 
have to worry about us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked formally if we could get out of the union.  We asked 
our employer, the department of advanced education, if we could 
form a professional association and represent ourselves.  It was 
not even considered.  It would not take it forward.  It was so 
afraid that the union would then call a strike against the whole 
province and as a result it would tie everything up.  The 
employer was totally intimated by the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say on one hand the unions have a positive role to play, 
one of those roles is not intimidation.  One of those roles is 
not to hold everybody else hostage in order for them to promote 
their agenda.  It must be done democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a period of time there were some very interesting 
developments.  In 1982 the province of Alberta decided to cut 
loose the technical institutes and the colleges from direct 
control and direct administration of the department.  Instead 
they had new boards appointed.  I will not get into a discussion 
of political patronage appointments at this stage.  That is not 
on topic and I know I would be called on it on relevance.  So I 
will not talk about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were called on to choose our bargaining agent. There were at 
each of these institutes and colleges a number of instructors and 
teachers.  We were called instructors where I worked.  There were 
750 instructors at the place where I worked and there were about 
750 instructors at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. 
There were a number of different locations with a large number of 
people.  It is quite practical to have a collective agreement in 
situations like that.  No problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They asked if we should have the Alberta Union of Provincial 
Employees continue to represent us or should we go on our own. 
Having the board of governors come in gave us that window of 
opportunity to choose.  Under the new legislation there was a 
choice for a new institution, a new organization for the members 
to choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a good debate.  It was a great debate.  I love a good 
substantive debate.  I love one where all the members opposite 
are listening without heckling.  I do not hear a voice of protest 
from any of them as I speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really was a great window of opportunity and we discussed it. 
In the industrial area of our institute there was a greater 
favour to maintain a union.  They thought it would have greater 
clout.  The argument on the other side was that if we had our own 
association, free from the central office of the union, we could 
concentrate fully on what we were about at our institute. It was 
decided that we would have a vote.  The vote that decided we 
would go on our own was as high as it had been on our previous 
straw votes where we had asked if we wanted to get out of the 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that we were given the democratic right. 
There was a vote held.  As I recall, 85% of the members of our 
staff said let us form our own association.  I was then further 
honoured to be asked to be the founding president of the new 
staff association.  I was there to organize it and put it all 
together. We had a great time representing our people.  The key 
is that the people had the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill before us denies the union members, the workers, that 
actual choice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states that if there is some external outfit such as the 
employment relations board it can say those people have a union 
whether they want it or not.  That is not democratic and is a 
violation of the very principle of democracy.  Therefore I speak 
very strongly against this bill as it is now stated and very 
strongly in favour of the Reform motions which will amend it and 
fix it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is up.  Could I have unanimous consent 
to continue for a few more minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There is not 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not know how unanimous consent can be denied without 
a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
calling quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the cackling from across the aisle from our 
colleagues who do not seem to take too great an interest in this 
important debate about democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the kind of procedural games the government plays is 
shameful.  We just saw my hon. colleague from Elk Island try to 
extend his limited remarks on this very important bill and was 
denied by no one except some Liberal who poked his in from behind 
the curtain carrying a cup of coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what has happened to the traditions of democratic 
debate and deliberation in this place but I do know what the 
government is intending to do with Bill C-19.  It is attacking— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As a point of fact, 
that is not who denied unanimous consent.  Let us try to keep the 
remarks elevated somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am doing just that and I 
hope my hon. colleagues in the government will keep their conduct 
in this place elevated.  That is not what I see.  It is not what 
I see in this bill and not what I see in the way they dismiss 
debate in this House.  They know that what is introduced by a 
minister representing the bureaucrats in his departments is going 
to be passed regardless of what is said in this place, regardless 
of what they say, regardless of whether they sit in this place 
and debate bills on second reading or in clause by clause or in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that in so far as democratic deliberation is 
concerned, this place has been turned into a joke by this and 
previous governments.  I know that many of the members opposite, 
honourable members, confident people and people of integrity, sat 
in this place and debated bills like Bill C-19 when the previous 
Progressive Conservative government sat in a majority on the 
government side.  They tried to debate things while in opposition 
and said the same things I am now as an opposition member, that 
the bureaucrats run the departments, they run the minister when 
it comes to Bill C-19, and the minister runs the backbench 
majority of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is not working and it is not working in Bill C-19. 
Labour department bureaucrats have written a bill that overrides 
the fundamental principles of liberal democracy on which this 
country relies.  They say that a hand picked group of patronage 
hacks who sit on the Canadian Industrial Relations Board, people 
of real integrity and principle like Ted Weatherill, will be able 
to determine whether workers are forced into a union against the 
will of as many as 70% of the members.  That is what Bill C-19 at 
page 14 states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says the board may order a representational vote on union 
certification to satisfy itself that the workers want the union. 
They do not have to.  They can certify the union themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who?  Not the workers.  Who?  Not the members of parliament. 
Not democratically elected representatives, but hand picked, 
unaccountable, unelected, patronage appointees of the government. 
They have more power in this bill than do ordinary working 
Canadians.  That is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the members opposite—what members there are 
opposite—can support a bill that undermines the principle of 
democracy.  All we are saying through Motion No. 7, through our 
effort to amend this section of the act is that yes, workers have 
the right to collectively bargain.  Yes, they have the right to 
gather together and to enforce their rights and to negotiate 
their rights as a collective bargaining unit. Never should a 
union be imposed on individuals at a workplace unless they invite 
it upon themselves.  That is called democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right here, what we are seeking to do through Motion No. 7 moved 
by my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-19, in Clause 13, be amended by replacing lines 22 to 
24 on page 14 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“13.  Subsections 29(1) and (2) of the act are replaced by the 
following: 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>29.(1)  The Board shall, for the purpose of satisfying itself as 
to whether employees in a unit wish to have a particular trade 
union represent them as their bargaining agent, order that a 
representation vote be taken among the employees in the unit 
where it is satisfied that at least thirty-five per cent of the 
employees in the unit are members of the trade unit applying for 
certification. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simple and it speaks for itself.  I cannot understand why 
the government members opposite would not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the testimony that was brought before the human 
resources committee on this legislation.  People like Mr. Clem 
Paul, president of the North Slave Metis Alliance said on this 
matter “The Metis do not want unionism forced on them because of 
the collective wishes of other groups in the workplace”. The 
Metis want to be free to join a union or not, according to the 
wishes of the individual.  Imagine, freedom.  Mr. Paul 
understands that but the labour minister, his bureaucrats and the 
backbenchers do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Paul went on to say “The choice of whether membership in a 
union benefits the worker should be the decision of each person 
who is free to make it for themselves.  Restrictions on our 
freedom to benefit from opportunities coming available for the 
first time will harm us”. He is speaking of the Metis people 
becoming full partners in any groups of Canadian society. This is 
somebody whose people are struggling to get a leg up economically 
and they see the danger implicit in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. John Keenan is vice-president of human resources at 
Falconbridge Limited, a major national mining company that has 
created thousands of good paying jobs in our economy.  On this 
section of Bill C-19 he said that “unionized labour is a reality 
of working life.  As long as there are equitable checks and 
balances in our system, the labour relations system, we can work 
in a harmonious fashion with our union colleagues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say “As it is now proposed, this section of the 
code will polarize labour-management relations and bring us back 
into the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s when labour relations 
were at a very low ebb in this country.  We made a lot of 
progress and it is not appropriate to turn back the clock”.  He 
also said that his company was not consulted on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Jim Utley is vice-president of human resources at Cominco, 
another major employer.  He said on this section that “a secret 
ballot for all certification decisions would address these issues 
and ensure that employees are given an opportunity to express 
their views privately and without either the union or the 
employer looking over their shoulders”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem with guaranteeing a right to a secret 
ballot, he asked, and so do I. He goes on to say “The process is 
the cornerstone of our democratic society, yet the proposed 
legislation expounds circumstances where this fundamental right 
is denied employees”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witnesses went on and on and on at the labour committee, at 
the human resources committee saying that this is an attack on 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues opposite why they do not accept the 
principle we are proposing in Motion No. 7.  It is the principle 
of democracy, the principle that nobody should be coerced by the 
power of the state to give up some of their freedoms, to give up 
forced union dues unless they give their consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that started small <I>l</I> liberal democracy was 
the principle of no taxation without representation, that people 
cannot be coerced by the power of the state to surrender the 
fruits of their labours, or to surrender some of their individual 
liberties unless they concur in that process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 by refusing to require a secret ballot vote for 
certification with the support of the majority of members would 
do just that.  It would force up to 70% of the people at a 
workplace into a union even though they expressed their clear and 
heartfelt objection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has happened.   It happened under the rabid labour 
legislation introduced by the socialist parties, in Ontario under 
Bob Rae and in British Columbia under that maven of economic 
growth policy, that real democrat Glen Clark.  Those two 
provinces had the same kind of provision where the provincial 
labour boards could certify a union even against the express 
wishes of the majority of the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  In Windsor, Ontario the Wal-Mart employees 
voted 151 to 43 against union certification.  But the Ontario 
Labour Relations Board hacks, appointed, unaccountable, unelected 
appointees, using Bob Rae's labour code said “Sorry. We do not 
like the outcome of this vote.  We are going to force the 151 to 
accept what the 43 wanted”. That is not democracy.  Neither was 
it democracy in B.C. when the workers at the Wal-Mart store in 
Nelson voted overwhelmingly against union certification and the 
B.C. relations board overturned that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I encourage hon. members opposite to stand up for the 
democracy they represent by having been elected to this place and 
let workers exercise it through a secret ballot in the workplace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
has turned into a very spirited debate.  I want to thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for recognizing me so quickly so I can get to the nub of 
this debate today and the things which concern me about Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in a lot of bills there is a lot of material in Bill C-19 
that is easy to support.  The idea of a labour code for Canada is 
not a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this bill is a revamp of what we already have and it 
is not a bad idea to update it.  It did come in in the last 
parliament and the government had second thoughts about it and 
for some good reasons, which I will get into in a minute, decided 
to drop it from the Order Paper. Now a year later it has been 
brought back in this parliament. We have seen significant 
amendments proposed by the official opposition in committee and 
in the House to try to bring the balance we think is necessary in 
labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the logging industry for many years. In the logging 
industry in British Columbia if the company is of any size it 
likely means it is a unionized company.  I have lived on both 
sides of that equation.  I worked for a number of years when our 
company was not unionized.  I was there during the unionization 
vote when the members voted to join the union. Without getting 
into any of the coercive nature that this bill talks about that 
the employers might enter into, I could give a tale of woe from 
the other side on that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even so, the IWA is not a bad union to work with and we were 
happy to do so for many years.  Even after we were unionized, 
even though I was in essence the employer with the ability to 
hire and fire, the union did not mind.  I was a member of the 
union even then.  The union did not seem to mind.  It took my 
union dues and was quite happy to do that while I was on the 
workforce for many years.  Eventually I went into full time 
management.  I have seen it from all perspectives.  In those 
perspectives it is important that the word balance in labour 
legislation be a key principle that we follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example one of the amendments we proposed in committee 
involved the privacy of individuals as to whether or not they 
wanted their name to be released to a union when an organizing 
drive occurred. I would suggest there is a balance here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union I believe has a right to talk to individuals in the 
workplace, to put forward its proposals, tell workers why it 
thinks they should belong to a union and why the workforce should 
be unionized. That is a right unions have. One of our basic blue 
book principles is the right to organize, to strike peacefully 
and so on.  That is a right workers need to have.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing that though is also the right of workers to their 
privacy.  In other words, should the employer have to give the 
names, addresses and phone numbers of workers to a union 
organizer?  That should be the choice of the workers.  It is an 
interesting word which the previous speaker used quite often, the 
word choice. They should have the choice.  By all means they may 
be very interested in that information.  They may say to the 
employer “Send them my name and address.  I would like to hear 
from them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have a different view.  They say “That is my 
choice.  I may want that, but if I do not want that, it is my 
right to say my name is not on the list.  I do not want anybody 
telephoning me at home.  I do not want them knocking on the door 
of my private dwelling.  If they want to talk to me, they can see 
me at work because that is what this is all about”. That is 
their right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is balance between the rights of the organizer to organize 
as they should have and the rights of the employee, the 
prospective union member, to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to speak to the idea of the relevancy of what the member 
is talking about. We are supposed to be talking about Group No. 2 
which I believe is Motion Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 30.  Really, what the 
hon. member was talking about has no bearing whatsoever on 
Reform's motion or— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect he is 
speaking directly to Motion No. 7 which amends 29.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up by 
saying it is very relevant to Motion No. 7. I am trying to build 
the case in this debate that the idea of balance is brought in by 
our Motion No. 7.  I use that as an example. We brought in an 
amendment and the government accepted it which I think that was 
good and very wise in that case. I would urge them again on this 
one, Motion No. 7 to get to the nub of this debate, which is to 
try to bring balance into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do workers have the right to organize?  A quote from our party's 
principles is that Canadian workers have the right to join 
unions, to organize, to strike peacefully.  That is a basic 
democratic right in a free society. We say that is a right and it 
must be maintained. Now we get into the how to make this a 
balanced and fair procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my company was unionized many years ago it was a pretty 
straightforward process although I will not get into some of the 
shenanigans that went on.  The process in essence was that union 
organizers did their best to convince employees they would be 
better off in the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was kind of a strange twist at the time.  I remember thinking 
it was so ironic.  We had just sent our entire staff and their 
spouses on a free trip to Hawaii.  Maybe that was coercion but 
what happened of course is that they used all kinds of tactics to 
organize.  They will do that.  Organizers have their own way of 
doing that.  They convinced enough workers to go so they 
convinced them in a vote.  People voted and they were able to go 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we go to the labour relations board and say this should not 
happen, that this was an injustice? We said we would have to 
adjust some of our things accordingly. They wanted to be paid on 
a scale and they asked us to remove all the bonuses.  I could not 
understand it, never could and never will.  We removed the bonus 
system and other stuff and they preferred it.  That was the 
workers' choice.  They made the choice and went ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice is theirs and should be theirs in a secret ballot. 
There should be no way they have to stand up at a public meeting 
and ask if anyone dares to stand up against the motion and people 
cower in the background.  Of course not. They should be able to 
say “I am going to go to the ballot box and make my vote.  I 
either want to join the union or I do not”.  It is their choice 
to make.  By all means, that is the balance.  That is the check 
and the balance in itself in the secret ballot box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this motion tries to correct is the error in the government 
legislation.  The government can say “Only a third of the people 
voted for that but we think we know better than they do.  We 
think we can read their minds, we are omniscient. 
We have that special power available only to government ministers 
and we can tell that they did not really mean it, so we will 
override their democratic choice and we will get them to join 
that union whether they like it or not”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what would happen on the decertification side.  What 
would the unions say if they said that only 35% voted to 
decertify but they could tell the rest of them did not really 
mean it?  Sure they voted, it was a secret ballot, they put their 
minds around the issue and they made it up on their own, but 
really they are what?  Are they children?  They are not.  These 
are adults making a choice in a free and democratic society. They 
should no more be decertified on a 35% vote than they should be 
certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple case.  If the board said that it felt something 
coercive was going on, if it felt somebody was out of line in 
some way, then it should order another vote.  It should say that 
it will not stand for whatever the activity might be.  If the 
union is out of line by pressuring somebody or the employer 
threatens somebody, we can deal with that.  That is illegal.  You 
cannot coerce people on this.  So we are going to deal with that 
activity and then we are going to order another vote.  As a free 
society we have secret ballots and choice on so many issues.  We 
should also have that choice to join or not to join a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Reform motion tries to bring that balance into the 
legislation.  There is a need for workers to make that choice and 
they have a right to know that choice will be respected when the 
ballots are counted.  This balance is not in this legislation. 
The balance we propose under Motion No. 7 brings it back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to talk about final offer binding arbitration and 
another way to balance conflicting interests but I will do that

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, this clause of Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code, is dealing with successor rights in a 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are suggesting here is that a large section of this 
successor rights legislation should be removed because it 
basically gives too much discretionary power to the minister. We 
really do not think it is appropriate that the minister has the 
power to say which federally regulated industries or businesses 
are going to have this successor rights applied to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and departmental officials have explained to the 
committee and to me that the biggest concern here was with 
preboarding screening at airports.  When the people providing the 
services at the airports would organize then usually what would 
follow would be the sale of the business providing the contract 
to the airport. 
The sale of the business would nullify the union that had just 
been organized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department was telling us that it had a large concern in the 
area of security for airports, and that it was continually 
training and retraining people to do the work of screening at the 
airports.  There was the possibility that security would not be 
as efficient and as effective as it should be.  Perhaps we should 
give the minister and his department that much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that we are not willing to allow the 
minister carte blanche on deciding which industries would be 
affected by these successor contracts, which businesses would be 
handcuffed by not being able to renegotiate with their employees 
should they take over in a bona fide sale condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other parts that apply to this portion that determine 
and define what is meant by sale, which in any sort of leasing 
program or rollover the business is deemed to have been sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from British Columbia is most anxious to speak to 
this bill and to this amendment.  He has instances where 
railroads have been willing to close spur lines and private 
companies have been willing to buy up the line from them and 
start short line railroads.  It is a disincentive to those 
fledgling businesses to take a contract that is going to handcuff 
them into paying the same sort of wages and benefits that CPR or 
CNR have been paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disincentive to business.  Some members on the 
government side have some concern with this part of the act.  I 
am hopeful they will have an opportunity to address this in their 
remarks and I am hopeful they will concur with the Reform Party 
that this should be addressed.  I am anticipating their 
overwhelming support for my motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Rainy River has some expertise in the 
railroads.  I am positive that he will be on his feet in a few 
minutes to tell us about the great benefits in the railroad 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some merit to the aspect of preboarding screening. 
Everyone in Canada should feel secure that preboarding screening 
is done with the utmost of care and that no foreign materials or 
contraband can be smuggled on to aircraft.  We all feel a lot 
better about that because we use those services so often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to matter what bill we are addressing in this 
House.  Over an over again the governor in council has been given 
the latitude to make all kinds of rulings that should be 
addressed in legislation rather than left to the whim of the 
minister and cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government when it was in opposition certainly must 
have made similar representations at that time. 
I am very concerned because of what might happen through orders 
in council.  I would ask them to consider very carefully this 
aspect of the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successor rights provided in this bill will have the effect 
of really tying in anybody who is a bona fide purchaser of any 
federally regulated industry to whatever contract the predecessor 
had.  If the company was not flourishing at the time that the 
seller sold then it would be very difficult for a fledgling 
person to step into an area where he would have to compete with a 
global supplier as in the case of the railroads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta there are short line railways. If they had to compete 
with all the classifications found in the unions as far as job 
descriptions and all the rest it would be very difficult for 
them.  As it is they are in a position where they can provide a 
very effective service with minimal amounts tied up in labour 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One particular operator in Alberta is the engineer of a very 
successful short line railroad.  I am sure he would most 
concerned if he were to read these portions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other sections of the bill we have to be very cognizant that 
the legislation the House of Commons passes should have some 
benefit for the average person in Canada.  The average person in 
Canada is very dependent on the state of the economy, whether it 
is buoyant, stagnant or whether it is actually going backward. 
We would have to assess every piece of legislation to that effect 
and assess whether the average Canadian will benefit from the 
things we are talking about on the bill or whether this will make 
it easier to form unions, thereby benefiting the union bosses 
rather than the union rank and file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain there are other members who would like to add their 
wisdom to this portion of the bill which I would be most 
interested in hearing. I encourage members to vote in favour of 
this most sensible amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, successor rights provisions in 
the Canada Labour Code have not been interpreted to apply where 
there is a change of contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result when employees of a contractor elect to unionize and 
bargain collectively they often lose their jobs or are forced to 
give up monetary benefits when the contract is awarded to another 
contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recommended by the Sims task force, Bill C-19 does not extend 
successor right provisions to loss of contract situation.  The 
bill does include a provision applicable only to airport 
preboarding security screening contracts which serves a number of 
purposes.  It protects the remuneration of a group of low wage 
employees who have lost their employment when a contractor has 
been able to win a tender by lowering wage rates.  It codifies an 
existing Transport Canada policy which was negotiated with the 
airlines in 1998 to address questions about the quality of 
preboarding security screening services at Canadian airports. 
The official opposition has put forward a motion to delete 
paragraph B of the provision which would authorize the governor 
in council to extend application of this provision. Extension of 
the provision would be considered only should serious problems 
attributable to contract retendering arise in other services or 
sectors and only following thorough consultations with affected 
parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Motions No. 9 and 28 introduced by the 
Reform Party member, because they are related. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the best way of understanding the doublespeak too 
often characteristic of legislation and officialdom is to read 
the explanatory notes provided by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are to take from Motion No. 9 is that, because of the 
problems caused by the airline industry's practice of awarding 
successive contracts for pre-board security screening services, 
Transport Canada concluded, in 1988, an agreement with Canadian 
to protect the salaries and benefits of employees when pre-board 
security screening services were put out to tender.  This is the 
policy that is codified in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill adds that it will be possible to extend the application 
of this provision to other sectors of activity that might, of 
course, be designated by regulations made by the governor in 
council.  This has to do with the whole idea of the 
privatization of certain public services.  Members know how 
popular this is right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the matter of the continuity of existing collective 
agreements, that is the improved general working conditions 
employees have managed to acquire over years, very often 
decades, of labour relations, particularly with respect to 
wages.  This is what the Reform Party wants to lay open to 
question again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is most unfortunate, in our opinion, because these are 
social gains which have enabled us to live in what can be 
described as a civilized society, benefiting from the gains 
acquired by the labour movement at the cost of great struggle, 
and we must not forget this.  Those gains have led to a more 
just society, at least in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform motion lays all of this open to question again, as it 
refuses to acknowledge the previous contractor, or in other 
words the obligation of the new contractor to provide employees 
with the same benefits they received before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is also subtly challenging the board's ability 
to intervene.  In order to be consistent with its own rather 
sneaky attack against the low wage earners, against unionized 
workers, it says that the board ought not to have the power to 
intervene under section 47.3, which deals with the previous 
contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It wants this to be removed, which would mean the board could no 
longer invoke section 47.3, which applies to contractors and 
allows the board to require the party against which a complaint 
has been filed—since there is a right to file a complaint if one 
feels one is not being properly treated by a new contractor—to 
cease to contravene these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of eliminating section 47.3 and the possibility of 
intervention if such cases do occur when there is more 
privatization as a result of increased deregulation and 
government withdrawal from certain areas, this will prevent the 
board from being able to order the employer to pay employees an 
amount equivalent to, or in excess of, the amount they would 
have been paid by the employer if there had not been a 
violation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives a very good idea of the sort of mentality to be found 
in the official opposition, within this so-called reform party, 
which reforms from underneath, widens the gap between the rich 
and the poor and delights in the monstrous profits made by 
private industry, where there is no requirement to be 
accountable, except to the shareholders. They are almost 
congratulating themselves on the widening gap between the rich 
and the poor.  They want to bring everyone down to the same 
level. They challenge such commendable things as unions.  They 
challenge them instead of recognizing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working conditions of the honest worker are at stake. 
This is what is being challenged by those who have a say, who 
polish their halos as they bend parliamentary procedures, as we 
have seen recently, and they are doing this on the backs of low 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must decry this with our very last breath, because, in the 
end, workers' dignity is at issue.  The aim is to make the 
biggest profits with the lowest expenditure on the backs of the 
employees.  This was curbed in the evolution of societies 
through the intervention of unions and the arrival of social 
programs.  It was regulated somewhat.  In today's neo-liberal 
context, there are lawyers of their ilk who defend the widening 
of the gap between the rich and the poor, and I think it is our 
job to criticize them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
quite interested in these clauses.  I did rise to speak to some 
of the other motions to try to convey our views and why we are 
not in favour of Reform's motions to amend Bill C-19 at this late 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions we are dealing with now, Nos. 9 and 28, deal with 
successor rights, a fundamental principle that we should be happy 
to have strengthened and enshrined in our code because it is a 
matter of basic fairness again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many of the changes in Bill C-19, it finds its origins 
in the fact that we are striving for a balanced situation to be 
put in place that is more fair to all the parties.  It deals 
specifically with airport workers.  However, we can take this 
idea further because with the privatization and more and more 
frequent sales and mergers of companies, this issue comes up more 
often in the federally regulated industrial relations climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are recent horrifying examples that have worked out to the 
detriment of workers.  For instance, in the privatization at 
Goose Bay, non-military people are now being hired back by the 
private contractor at about half the wages they used to make 
before.  The instances were piling up to the point where it was 
necessary to take some steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any of these motions are going to really help us 
to achieve social justice.  I do not think one can ever achieve 
social justice through parliamentary means, frankly, because that 
is the job of the labour movement.  It is the union's job to 
achieve economic and social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can do is try to create the legislative framework within 
which unions can function, prosper, flourish and do their jobs. 
Bill C-19 tries to deal with the historic imbalance that exists 
between employers and employees, the imbalance in the power 
relationship.  We are trying to level those things out so that 
people have a fighting chance and can deal with each other on a 
level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the motions that Reform is trying to advocate here 
worry me because there is always something just below the surface 
that is kind of sinister about Reform motions.  It is cause for 
concern.  It is not even that far under the surface.  It is 
sometimes quite overt.  A person can be presumed to have intended 
the probable consequences of his or her actions. It is a well 
known point in law.  The probable and predictable consequences of 
many of the motions the Reform Party is advocating would be that 
it would be much more difficult for workers to form a union. 
It would be much more difficult for workers to negotiate 
benefits through their union, and all those predictable things.

the Hill.  In fact, copies were delivered to my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is using Bill C-19 as a launching pad 
to try to kick off its campaign to introduce right-to-work 
legislation in this country.  It failed to do that in the 
province of Alberta.  Even a right winger like Ralph Klein threw 
the idea out because it is an obsolete, out-dated and divisive 
concept.  It has tried to introduce it into parliament in a 
back-handed, back-door way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are legitimately trying to make Bill C-19 better, those 
members are trying to tear down the whole idea with a rather 
sinister package of motions which really undermines the whole 
concept of freedom of association, the right to collective 
bargaining and the legitimate role of unions to try to elevate 
the standards of wages and working conditions for the people they 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with fair wages.  Fair wages benefit the 
whole community.  In the richest and most powerful civilization 
in the history of the world, someone would have a hard time 
arguing why we should be tightening our belts and rolling back 
when banks and corporations are making record profits.  Who will 
advocate for working people that point of view if unions will not 
make the argument for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really am worried by the tone and the content of some of the 
motions put forward by the Reform Party.  I think there is an 
underlying objective here.  I used the word “sinister” and I do 
not think it is overstating things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members seem to have, whether it is stated right up front 
or coming in the back door in some kind of sleazy way, a 
secondary objective.  I can point out one case certainly.  They 
were arguing that when 35% of the cards are signed, under Bill 
C-19 a vote will be ordered.  The labour board may have a 
supervised vote so that workers can then choose whether they want 
a union or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change they made would result in having a vote every time. 
Even if the workers' representative went to the labour board with 
85% of the cards signed, their change states that the labour 
board shall order a vote.  Workers would have to vote even if 
they demonstrated 100% support.  They are making people vote 
twice.  How democratic is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are those members not satisfied that people have voted once? 
Will people be made to vote until the desired result is achieved? 
They talk about democracy.  That is nothing short of sleazy.  It 
is an abuse of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members are trying to slip in a secondary objective with 
something which, on the face of it, might look like a reasonable 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were only asking that the board shall order a vote if 
35% of the cards are signed, but if 51% of the cards are signed 
or 50%-plus certification is automatic, I could then vote in 
favour of the motion.  But that is not what they mean.  It is a 
much bigger package than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to point out some of these 
things before the end of the day.  I have a feeling we are going 
to be up and down a number of times saying that those members are 
abusing democracy again.  Although I should not say that because 
filibustering is a legitimate tactic that members use in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it makes me wonder how it is in the best interests of 
the Canadian people.  It makes me wonder whether they have really 
thought about the 100,000 prairie farmers who are very anxious to 
see Bill C-19 go through so they can ship their crops with the 
comfort of knowing that things will be handled and there will not 
be any work stoppages interfering with the movement of their 
commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have they talked to the UGG?  Have they talked to the pool 
elevator operators?  Have they talked to the prairie farmers and 
received their okay for dragging this bill to a halt and 
preventing Canadians from having the advantage of this very 
worthwhile piece of legislation?  I do not think so, because the 
prairie farmers who those members like to think they represent 
would give them an earful.  I think they would tell them loud and 
clear that they want passage of Bill C-19 because it has merit 
and value.  It is good for Canadian working people and it will 
create balance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In some of their remarks they even had the audacity to suggest 
that Bill C-19 is going to somehow have an impact on our ability 
to trade internationally, that it is going to hold us back.  They 
were talking about the guy from Papua, New Guinea.  It is 
completely absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact the countries that are moving forward, the 
countries that are making progress, are the countries that deal 
in a tripartite way, where business, government and labour sit 
down at the table together to chart a social and economic plan 
and platform.  It is not divisive.  These guys are living in 
the past.  They want to smash unions.  They want unions out of 
the way.  They do not recognize the legitimacy of unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to move forward if we have that mindset.  The 
hon. member for Trois-Rivières is nodding his head because 
Quebec's model follows those lines.  Labour is a legitimate 
practitioner in the community.  Labour is seen to have a valid 
opinion and is consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party finally gives up trying to bash unions and 
trying to be shills for the right to work movement and the Fraser 
Institute, maybe we can move forward as a country in a truly 
tripartite fashion.  I think that is what Bill C-19 speaks to and 
that gives me some hope that there is an interest in dealing with 
issues in that way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
are two things I could do; however, I am going to do only one. 
My temptation is to get into this tirade of nonsense that we were 
just subjected to, but I am not going to do that.  I am going to 
talk about the amendments in Group No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You have some support on the other side 
there, Werner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  I am so pleased that for a change the 
government has seen some wisdom coming from the official 
opposition.  That is very good and I commend government members 
for it.  I hope that when it comes to Group No. 2 they will 
remember that and vote in favour of the motion that the official 
opposition has presented.  It is very significant that they do 
that because democracy is at the heart of this issue to a large 
degree.  There are a lot of things at the heart of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get to the actual amendment that is being 
proposed by the official opposition.  I would like to read that 
part of the bill which is being deleted by this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the bill we see that the connecting word is 
“or”.  We can do this specific thing that is being codified in 
the legislation that currently exists governing airports, 
employees and the contracts that exist.  Then it says “or”.  We 
want to leave that first part in because to codify that is 
advisable and a good thing.  But after that we find the word 
“or” and it states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) provided any other service that may be designated by 
regulation of the Governor in Council,— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That opens the door to anything.  It is so wide open we could 
drive half a dozen trucks through it and we would not know they 
had gone through.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on the recommendation of the Minister, to another employer or a 
person acting on behalf of that employer in any industry that may 
be designated by regulation of the Governor in Council on the 
recommendation of the Minister. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is so wide open that it really takes away one of the 
fundamental considerations in running a business or in 
negotiating a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I have to slip at least one point in here to respond 
to the tirade of remarks that we heard just a moment ago. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition in no way opposes the organization of 
labour into groups to negotiate contracts.  In fact we encourage 
that in a way that allows that kind of organization to take place 
in the most democratic fashion that can be devised.  That is at 
the heart of this issue.  Having done that, we need to recognize 
that if we are going to have contracts like that—and the idea of 
successor rights deals with those contracts—the one thing we do 
not want in those contracts is ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph (b), which we are deleting from the proposed bill, 
makes it totally ambiguous as to who will and who will not be 
designated by the governor in council on the recommendation of 
the minister, and who should be included or excluded in terms of 
successor rights.  That is precisely what contract negotiations 
are all about.  They take away the ambiguity of salary schedules, 
they take away the ambiguity of benefits, bonuses, group 
insurance plans or whatever the employee benefits might be.  All 
of those are written into the contract to take away that 
ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successor rights that presently exist ensure that the 
employee who has been employed by a previous contract can 
continue on through to the next employer when doing the same kind 
of work as the employee was doing under contract with the federal 
government.  The employee is employed by the minister. However, 
paragraph (b), which we want to delete, opens it up so wide that 
nobody knows what in the world is going on.  One of the major 
reasons we oppose this is because of the ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we want definite, specific certification 
requirements, we want specific recognition of what exists or does 
not exist in terms of successor rights.  We want that for three 
reasons:  it provides stability, predictability and confidence 
for the contractor, the existing business, the employer and the 
government.  We want to know what it will cost us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe my ears sometimes when the government seems to 
say only this far and no farther, but in the next instance it 
seems to have an absolutely open door.  For the life of me I 
cannot understand some of the nonsense we heard yesterday about 
the absolutely open, unaccountable regional development agencies. 
They can come forward, make applications, present their budgets, 
have no measurable objectives, change their mandates every three 
or four years and the government say this is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know how much an employment contract will cost.  Then 
we can plan our budgets properly.  We also want to be able to 
predict what the new employer will be involved in with this group 
of employees.  We want to be confident that the contract will not 
be changed arbitrarily or that if another employer were to take a 
related contract that somehow another union would come in and 
change the employer's relationship with the employees.  Then we 
would have a contradiction and a major conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the beginning of this bill.  This is the 
number one purpose of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment implements reforms to the industrial relations 
provisions of Part I of the Canada Labour Code, to provide a 
framework for collective bargaining that enhances the ability of 
labour and management to frame their own agreements and allows 
workplace disputes to be resolved in a timely and cost effective 
manner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the underlying principle which is supposed to be 
governing this legislation.  It is a wonderful statement.  Who 
would not agree with that kind of statement?  Then we see a 
provision like this and we ask:  What does that do to bring about 
harmony and stability?  What does that do to create planning, 
consistency and the confidence that this will work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing the way in which Liberals can twist logic.

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should apply 
a portion of tax dollars raised on fuel sales to the maintenance 
of the rural road system in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon 
in Ottawa.  I know the majority of members in the House would 
much prefer to be in their ridings or with their families. 
However, I assure them that I will make sure I keep their 
attention totally rapt on an issue that is extremely important 
not only for constituents in my riding but for constituents 
throughout our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue I have brought forward is not a terribly romantic one. 
It is not something that people can stand on soapboxes, make 
wonderful speeches and get very emotional about.  Even though 
there is no romanticism tied in with the issue, I can assure it 
is a very vital issue.  The issue is one that is the economic 
lifeline of rural Canada, particularly western rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as put forward has not been deemed to be votable, 
which is unfortunate and I mean that very sincerely.  I know 
members of the Liberal government would be more than happy to 
support an issue of this nature.  A number of members on the 
government side have these issues and problems cropping up in 
their communities, particularly those in rural Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the economic lifeline of rural Canada.  This is the 
economic lifeline of western Canada wherein the commodities 
produced in rural western Canada are commodities that have to 
travel across a transportation system to get to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agricultural industry is a huge industrial sector in Canada. 
We are known nationally and internationally as the providers of 
agricultural products second to none.  In order to take the 
product from the farm gate and get it to world markets it 
requires a transportation system and infrastructure that are in 
proper condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald saw transportation as a link of this great 
country.  He saw it through the railroads.  Now our 
transportation systems have changed quite dramatically over those 
years.  We now have dramatic changes in air travel.  We have 
dramatic changes in rubber traffic and travel on road systems. In 
fact, back in Sir John A.'s day he would not have expected the 
kind of travel we have now on the electronic highway.  If the 
truth be known, it is still the simplistic transportation system 
of roadways that is so very important to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural infrastructure is deteriorating as we speak. 
The rural infrastructure is in peril.  It is in absolute disarray 
at this point in time, the reason being there are no federal tax 
dollars going into our national highways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of Liberal policy, the reduction of transfer payments 
and their impacts on provincial governments, provincial 
governments have cut back on their own infrastructure.  They are 
also responsible for ensuring our national highways are 
maintained, upgraded and rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no federal money going into the national highways 
program.  The reconstruction and maintenance of the Trans-Canada 
Highway are done on the backs of the provinces.  The provinces 
spend their money.  I give them full credit, particularly the 
western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba.  They have done an exemplary job with perhaps the 
exception of Saskatchewan which has not put a lot of money into 
the Trans-Canada Highway.  The other three western provinces have 
put substantial dollars to twin the highway which is the vital 
transportation link across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have done it with provincial dollars and without federal 
dollars.  Thus they do not have any provincial dollars to put 
into secondary roads.  I speak today of the secondary roads which 
are the vital link to our rural communities and to major market 
areas.  That downloading has caused severe problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look in our mind's eye at producers in rural Manitoba, 
rural Saskatchewan or rural Alberta.  No longer do have the vital 
rail links we have talked about, have heard about and have in 
fact experienced.  As a result of CN and CP rail abandonment 
programs the short lines going into communities have now been 
abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only option for producers in the areas is to transport their 
commodities—and we are talking huge bulk commodities in most 
cases—across rural municipal roads that do not have the benefit 
of tax dollars to the same degree as federal government.  These 
roads unfortunately cannot be maintained by small rural 
municipalities which have a smaller assessment base today than 
they had previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are taking the commodity and transporting it many more 
miles than they had to years ago.  In their wisdom grain 
companies, and rightfully so, are developing new and major grain 
terminals, high throughput terminals.  By example, I have four 
new terminals being built in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With four new high throughput terminals also comes the 
abandonment of the smaller grain elevator which in most cases was 
located close to the producer.  Producers only had to travel 
perhaps 5, 10 or 15 kilometres to arrive at an elevator.  Now 
they have to travel in some cases up to 100 kilometres on rural 
roads for which there is no money available for maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are now using much larger vehicles such as 
semi-trailers and B-trains or a semi-trailer with a little pup 
attached.  Unfortunately they take a grave and great toll on 
highways in the rural areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta.  This is a great dilemma for the RMs.  Because of the 
downloading from the provinces and no money coming in, obviously 
the opportunity of getting product to market becomes less and 
less possible and more and more expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This little preamble explains why I am here, why we are here and 
why this issue is so very important.  The real issue is how to 
get dollars to the real area of responsibility.  The real 
responsibility lies with the federal government.  It lies with 
the federal government to put in place a national highways 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not talk specifically to that right now, but let us look 
at the waterfall effect.  If there were a national highways 
program where the federal government put in dollars and 
provincial governments did not have to spend money on the 
Trans-Canada Highway or major routes, they could then put their 
money back into where it is necessary right now in rural 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada remains the only developed country in the world that does 
not have a national policy for highways.  Canada has a national 
policy for air, marine and rail, but none for the mode that 
conveys the most people and the most goods.  That is deplorable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking today that dollars be identified simply from a 
percentage of the excise tax raised on fuel.  This does not take 
a rocket scientist to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government collects from taxpayers billions of 
dollars a year through taxes on fuel.  Virtually none of that 
money goes into the actual area it should, infrastructure and 
road improvement.  It goes into this big black hole called 
general revenue and is spent on wonderful projects the Liberals 
see fit to support such as the backbencher's millennium fund and 
other areas of responsibility.  It certainly has not gone into 
the compensation package for hepatitis C victims, but I was not 
to mention that in this speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has said it would allocate 50 cents of 
every dollar of anticipated surplus for new priorities.  It would 
be my humble opinion to suggest to the government it should start 
helping rural Canada by endorsing the principle of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls on the federal government to make a real 
commitment to rural Canada.  The rural road system is a vital 
element to Canadians from coast to coast, but in particular my 
area of responsibility, western Canada, has not been given a fair 
and equitable consideration in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the committee on Private Members' Business did 
not deem the motion votable.  Unfortunately the majority of 
committee members did not see it as an important enough issue to 
deem it votable.  I think there would be a wide range of support 
from all members if in fact they had the opportunity to vote on 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canada will receive less than 2% of all federal 
investment in highways during the next five years.  Cash flow 
projects from Transport Canada suggest that during the next five 
years the federal government will contribute about $900 million 
to eastern Canada for highway construction.  Western Canada will 
receive $13 million, of which zero goes to Manitoba, $2 million 
goes to Saskatchewan, zero to Alberta, $6 million to B.C., $4 
million to Yukon and $900,000 to the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that municipal governments cannot continue to carry 
the financial burden of the maintenance of these roads without 
more financial contribution from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba alone the federal government will collect 
approximately $140.7 million in road excise tax this year and 
zero will go back to Manitoba in that same time.  The federal 
government has not committed any funding toward Manitoba's 
provincial highway system for the 1998-99 fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years between 1992 and 1996 the federal government 
allocated on average $6.4 million per year to Manitoba despite 
collecting in Manitoba an average of $124 million per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about the equalization funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  The equalization payments have already 
been cut.  The equalization payments have been reduced by some 
35% in the meantime.  I am trying to concentrate specifically on 
the excise tax that is being collected, $140 million out and zero 
back into roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality the federal government has only put 4.8% of the money 
it collects from Manitoba road users back into Manitoba roads. 
That is deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that of the $27 million the western 
grain transportation adjustment fund allocated by the federal 
government to Manitoba in 1997 very little went back to roads. 
The Liberal government of the day decided it was best to put it 
into the electronic highway as opposed to the rural 
infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some alternatives.  As a matter of fact the president 
of UGG said that moneys generated from the sale of the hopper 
cars that will take place, the $250 million to $350 million, 
should go back into rural road infrastructure.  Its president, 
Mr. Ted Allen, said that investment in road infrastructure at 
both the federal and provincial level had failed to keep up with 
the pace of the burgeoning growth in the agriculture sector.

thought up.  The money should be put back into the programs that 
we should have right now such as rural roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president also noted that the federal government collects 
over $4 billion in fuel tax revenue annually, but last year spent 
only $270 million nationally in road infrastructure. That being 
said I would like to say that the federal government in fact does 
have a mandate. It is a federal responsibility to make sure that 
the infrastructure in the transportation system in this country 
is in working order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy that is developed and generated from rural Canada is 
immense. We have to make sure that the infrastucture stays in 
place in order for us to enable the economy to further develop. 
We must further develop that infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this motion recommends that the 
government dedicate all the revenues from fuel taxes to just one 
purpose, maintaining Canada's rural road system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let us make it clear that from day one this government has 
recognized the importance of Canada's infrastructure to improve 
our quality of life, unlike the hon. member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first actions we took upon taking office in 1993 was 
to launch the $6 billion Canada infrastructure program together 
with the provinces and municipalities as partners.  The program 
was extended last year with an additional $425 million federal 
commitment.  This joint effort has benefited both urban and rural 
communities by strengthening their competitiveness with improved 
infrastructure, including rural roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also be very clear about the consequences of supporting 
the motion we are debating today.  In 1996-97 excise taxes on 
fuel amounted to $4.4 billion.  By earmarking these funds for 
rural road maintenance, the government would then have three 
options:  reduce spending in other areas by the same amount; 
raise taxes by $4.4 billion; or let the deficit re-emerge, one 
thing that the hon. member is very familiar with given the fact 
that he is from the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want their health spending, education 
assistance or old age security cut by $4.4 billion.  They do not 
want their taxes increased by $4.4 billion.  And they certainly 
do not want the deficit to reappear after having made so many 
sacrifices to get rid of it.  Clearly none of these options is 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, earmarking taxes is an idea that is 
fundamentally flawed.  It would curtail the government's ability 
to respond to new and emerging priorities. It could result in 
overfunding of some initiatives and underfunding of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be effective, government has to be flexible so it can adapt 
quickly to changing priorities.  That is why the government's 
current policy is to direct all revenues into the consolidated 
revenue fund from which all initiatives are funded.  Simply put, 
earmarking taxes would tie the government's hands by limiting its 
ability to address important priorities as they arise.  It is 
simply bad policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government is in much better fiscal shape 
than it was even several years ago and that it will have more 
room to manoeuvre in the years ahead and more resources to 
address important issues, but we must maintain a realistic 
perspective in this regard.  In an era of limited resources 
government must be focused.  It must work in partnership and it 
must only act where it can make a difference.  It must take a 
balanced approach to the overriding objective of building a 
strong economy and a secure society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget announced a historic fiscal achievement and 
reconfirmed our balanced approach to building a strong economy 
and a secure society.  It announced that the federal books would 
be balanced in 1997-98 for the first time since 1970.  We will 
also balance the budget this year and next year.  It is the first 
time in almost 50 years that Canadians will see three consecutive 
balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to fiscal responsibility to put an end to credit 
card government does not end there.  We will reduce Canada's debt 
burden through a two front strategy of stronger economic growth 
and a concrete debt repayment plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has always recognized that a healthy bottom line 
is a means to an end and not an end in itself, unlike the Reform 
Party.  The 1998 budget uses our new leverage for strategic 
investments in areas where government can make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example the budget launched the Canadian opportunities 
strategy. The strategy, including the Canada millennium 
scholarships, will improve Canadians' access to knowledge and 
skills, something that the Reform Party is not in favour of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides funding to increase the Canada child tax 
benefit by an additional $850 million in two steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving Canadian health care is one of the government's core 
priorities.  That is why as our books improve one of our first 
and most significant initiatives was to introduce legislation to 
increase the Canada health and social transfer cash floor from 
$11 billion to $12.5 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the 1998 budget also begins the process of general 
income tax relief which is a key priority for Canadians and for 
the government.  We all know, as it has been said often in the 
House, that at the outset tax relief measures would be modest 
because the financial dividend that makes them possible is modest 
as well. The budget announced reductions in taxes for those who 
can least afford to pay them, low and middle income Canadians. 
These measures will provide close to $1.6 billion in tax relief 
to 14 million low and middle income Canadians, that being 90% of 
all income tax filers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the government's priorities.  We believe that they 
reflect what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to build a strong economy and a secure society, one 
that can provide Canadians with the opportunity and the ability 
to succeed in an ever evolving economy while still ensuring their 
security and well-being.  Our approach is delivering real 
benefits for Canadians today and a robust outlook for Canada as 
we look toward the new millennium.  We saw the unemployment 
numbers just the other day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have to make choices.  We have to make choices about 
what priorities we should pursue as a government and ensure that 
those priorities reflect what Canadians tell us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earmarking over $4 billion in revenues for rural highway 
maintenance would not be the best choice for Canada or Canadians. 
That is why I urge all members to reject the motion before the 
House.  It is bad policy. It is a policy that does not reflect 
Canadian priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that what the government has done since 
1993 does reflect what Canadians have asked for.  We see the 
fruits of our labour.  We see that Canadians have made 
sacrifices. The government is not about to squander the 
sacrifices Canadians have made by imposing a policy upon them 
that would not reflect what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not start to earmark money and get into the 
whole scenario where it is overfunding in one area, underfunding 
in another area and ultimately having to make choices. To do what 
the hon. member is asking we would have to raise taxes.  We would 
have to make cuts in other areas in order to fund $4.4 billion to 
do what the hon. member is asking.  That is not what Canadians 
are asking for. It is certainly not what the government is 
prepared to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the shortage of money the parliamentary 
secretary refers to could be solved if we gave all the national 
highways to Bombardier.  There is always money for folks like 
them.  Then there would be no argument here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary's dissertation and I 
lost track of the number of times I heard the words “our 
government, this government, my government”.  This is Private 
Members' Business.  I do not think the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is clear on the concept.  In fact he is hardly clear on 
any concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only country in the western world that has no 
national highway program or even a coherent national highway 
policy.  This country has 900,000 kilometres of public roads, 
streets and highways.  Of them, 202,000 or 22% are in my own 
little province of Saskatchewan and a minuscule fraction, 15,000 
kilometres are federal roads mostly in parks and on Indian 
reserves.  Another 24,400 kilometres are part of the designated 
national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government collects a whopping $5 billion annually 
in fuel taxes of which $4 billion comes specifically from highway 
fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. parliamentary secretary that the excise 
tax on fuels was initiated in response to the first fuel shock. 
It was used to buy up a bunch of private oil companies. It was a 
portion of the discredited national energy policy.  It was a 
stick with which to beat the Canadian people.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  We are not using the excise tax for that purpose 
any longer.  But has anyone ever heard of a government ceasing to 
collect a tax that it does not use for the purpose that it was 
designed for?  Good heavens, we are still collecting the income 
tax which was brought in as an emergency measure to finance the 
war effort in World War I.  We still have the excise tax that was 
brought in to help us through the first oil shock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To cut this down to a little finer geographic limit, on gasoline 
alone, not diesel, the federal fuel excise tax in the prairie 
provinces is $650 million.  The annual return to those provinces 
is limited to a few million, very few million as we heard from 
the hon. member for Brandon—Souris.  For their excise taxes they 
get back a little bit of WGTA compensation for roads and a 
minuscule share of the famous infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning Saskatchewan, I have to disagree with the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris.  Saskatchewan has actually given up on the 
predatory federal government and has started on its own to go 
ahead and twin the Trans-Canada Highway.  With partners like we 
have in the federal government there is just no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan actually had all its money on the table four years 
ago for the twinning program.  The feds negotiated but when it 
came down to the short strokes and discovered that the 
Saskatchewan government was serious, it ran for the woods.  Now 
we are paying for it ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give some numbers. This is the place where 
numbers should be discussed as it is a technical subject.  The 
U.S. invests 31% of its gas tax revenues in highways.  Germany 
invests 38%.  Italy invests 45%.  Australia invests 50%.  France 
and Spain invest 65% each.  Great Britain invests 100%.  Canada 
invests 4% in highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With rail line abandonments we are having a disaster in our 
transportation system in western Canada.  The highways and 
municipal roads are falling apart.  Nevertheless, I do not have 
exactly the same take on this as the member for Brandon—Souris. 
I do not think the feds should take dedicated fuel tax revenues 
and put them directly into municipal or rural roads. I do believe 
that the government should give a reasonable portion of them to 
the provinces to use, as they would naturally bring them back 
into the municipal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the government should meet its obligations and do 
something about our disgraceful national highway system.  We are 
a laughing stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one little stretch of the famous Trans-Canada Highway 
in the western edge of my riding, 108 kilometres, that has killed 
39 people in the last 20 years.  People call it the death strip. 
It is one of the places where the Saskatchewan government is now 
starting to do some twinning.  It is in the Maple Creek area. 
This is only one death strip.  There is another one in the 
Kicking Horse Pass.  There is another one not too far out of 
Revelstoke.  They are everywhere and this government will not 
pony up to its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time we had legislation in this country to bring in a 
national highway system.  We actually completed a Trans-Canada 
Highway of sorts way back in 1961 but since then nothing has 
happened.  We have a federal government that shirks its 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Automobile Association has come with a plan which I 
and my party have supported now for a number of months.  I think 
it makes eminent sense. 
They say “We know the federal government is addicted to this 
excise tax.  It cannot just put it all from whence it came into 
roads where it should go.  So give us back a mere 20%, two cents 
to the litre”. Within six or seven years we would have a 
national highway system that we would not have to be ashamed of, 
that would not be killing our citizens, that would not be forcing 
people driving from eastern to western Canada to divert down 
through Michigan in order to avoid our national highway.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening right now.  It is not just mom and pop on 
vacation but the commercial trucking industry is picking its way 
down through the United States in order to avoid the use of the 
Trans-Canada Highway.  That is embarrassing. That is disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Reformer of course I cannot avoid talking about costs. The 
hon. parliamentary secretary alluded to it.  We would not have 
money to do surveys on the desirability of sodomy if we were 
going to spend money on public roads. But if we do not look after 
our roads they disintegrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first 12 years the cost of maintaining a paved road is 
only $500 to $1,000 per annum per kilometre.  At that point 
deterioration accelerates and we have to start resurfacing at a 
cost of about $80,000 per lane kilometre.  After another 12 years 
pavement break-up begins and full reconstruction has to be done 
at a cost of about a quarter of a million dollars per lane 
kilometre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the old saying, a stitch in time saves nine.  If we 
looked after these roads, if we gave them the maintenance they 
deserve, we would not be getting into the box we are in now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trans-Canada Highway is old by highway standards.  The two 
lane highway we have through most of the country was actually 
built in 1961-62.  It has to be fixed.  Nobody except the feds 
has any money and the feds glom every nickel they can get.  It is 
about time they started to live up to their responsibilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the motion by 
the member for Brandon—Souris.  I will first read the motion, so 
we can put the debate in context. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should apply 
a portion of tax dollars raised on fuel sales to the maintenance 
of the rural road system in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first read the motion, we tend to want to support it, 
because when as members we realize that the rural road system in 
our riding, in our region, is not necessarily adequate, we feel 
that something should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it is like knocking at the wrong door.  The 
federal government should not be looking after the rural road 
system.  We have increasingly of late been looking at the 
possibly of developing a home care system, which the government 
would look after across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is the same in the case of the rural road system. 
It is under provincial jurisdiction, and if there is one 
government not equipped to look after it, it is the federal 
government.  We need only look at the past mess in the whole 
business of federal government transportation policy 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, they decided some 15 years ago to close a railway 
line.  That put huge pressure on the road system and resulted in 
endless numbers of trucks on the road.  Now, we are having to 
repair the road in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province has to pay for the bad choice by the federal 
government because the regional road system needs to be 
maintained.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to put things in perspective.  The jurisdiction 
is provincial and the responsibility, municipal.  A whole 
process already exists to manage this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a model or an approach for the future we might 
contemplate, it might well be the infrastructure program.  The 
Bloc has already indicated its support for renewal of this 
program. 
It earned the congratulations of the President of the Treasury 
Board, who said to us on April 3, following our request, that he 
appreciated the Bloc Quebecois' support for the Canada-Quebec 
infrastructure works program and wanted to assure us that our 
viewpoint would be given all due consideration when the federal 
government examined the options for the future of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might be an approach.  If the federal government wants to 
spend a third of the money in such a program and leave it up to 
the local level to decide its priorities and how best to improve 
its regional network, this might be the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this arrangement must not provide for programs that 
would allow the federal government to intervene directly in the 
rural network. 
This would be in contradiction to its recent practice in the 
transportation sector of divesting itself of ports and airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 30 years of administration, we have seen that 
costs have skyrocketed.  Costs are always higher and things are 
always more complicated when the government which has the 
jurisdiction is further removed from the reality and costs are 
always lower when the closer government assumes responsibility 
and accountability for the work done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is perhaps another approach to be considered. In the 
end, it is always the same consumer who pays. 
If people want a good rural road system and if they want the 
appropriate level of government, be it municipal or provincial, 
to have the money available, the federal government could simply 
reduce its tax grab and allow the government responsible for 
developing the rural road system to collect the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the solution proposed will not correct a very 
real problem.  If people decide to let the federal government 
invest in this project, they will never be able to ensure that 
it is accountable and that the money collected has actually been 
spent on the rural road system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member for Brandon—Souris, I have examples in my riding 
of manufacturers that could benefit from a better rural road 
system. 
In Saint-Joseph-de-Kamouraska, there is a small company located on 
a rural route that needs a better road system for reasons of 
improved accessibility.  This would help with its economic 
activity, the development of its markets and the transportation 
of the goods it produces. In the case of examples such as these, 
I think that something should obviously be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example in my riding is highway 185 between 
Rivière-du-Loup and New Brunswick.  This highway has experienced 
an incredible increase in car traffic because of the improvement 
in communications and the fact that the Rivière-du-Loup sector, 
among others, is a regional transportation pole.  We would like 
to see additional money invested in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that no one in our region would criticize the federal 
government for deciding all of a sudden not to go ahead with the 
purchase of submarines for $750 million but rather to make this 
amount available to local governments to help improve the 
highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the highway system was developed after the railway 
system, which had itself been developed along an east-west axis 
that no longer meets current development priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road system must be developed on a north-south axis so we can 
travel from Vancouver to Seattle, from the western provinces to 
the U.S. Midwest, or from Ontario and Quebec to New England, 
which would ensure better access to the North American market 
and promote exportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, the federal government should ask itself 
whether it is really investing in the right areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us avoid asking the federal government to intervene in the 
rural road system in Canada.  It lacks the efficiency for this. 
Besides, this is not its responsibility.  It is a provincial 
responsibility, a municipal responsibility.  The proof of this 
lies in the implementation of the first phase of the 
infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, we have spent money on projects in a number of 
municipalities, and since the municipality was in charge of the 
project, the work could often be done at half the cost it would 
have been for a higher level of government to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local government knows what is required.  It knows what is 
needed, it knows what additional resources are needed to get 
results.  But let us not get federal government money involved. 
We will lose more in administration costs than we will gain in 
actual investment in the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen this in the past, systems that cost so much 
to administer that the funds do not get to those they are 
intended to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to point out that I recognize the 
good intentions of the hon. member behind this motion, but I do 
not see this as the right solution to a real problem. 
The real solution lies more in getting the federal government to 
look after its own affairs a little more, to ensure that it runs 
its own affairs more efficiently, to agree to decrease the tax 
burden on Canadians, so that the governments responsible for 
such projects will be the ones to levy taxes as they are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road system, whether rural, provincial, or Canada-wide, is an 
essential tool of economic development, and when the federal 
government said that it would subject all of its actions to the 
criterion of rural impact, I trust that this was not with the 
intent of intervening in areas in which it cannot be efficient.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to be part of the debate today on the matter of great 
importance for rural Canadians.  I congratulate the hon. member 
for focusing our attention on the state of rural roads in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With over 90% of the land mass, one third of the population, one 
fifth of the employed workforce, rural issues demand more 
attention than they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primary industries comprise the bulk of rural Canada's economic 
vitality.  This trend comes from industries such as energy, 
forestry, minerals, agriculture, fisheries and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a rural road infrastructure there is no way to get at 
these resources or to get them to markets around the world. In 
such a large country with economic prospects flung far and wide, 
we need good roads or this country will go nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an exaggeration to say the economic contribution of 
rural Canada is enormous.  Rural Canada produces almost half our 
exports.  Our world trade surplus in 1995 was $73 billion, a 
staggering success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic output of rural Canada accounts for close to one 
fifth of the GDP.  It is not all fresh air and lemonade.  Rural 
Canadians contribute far more than their share to the economic 
vitality and to the standard of living of Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to all that rural Canada remains neglected. Services 
and infrastructures are poor in many areas and government and the 
private sector have been unable to overcome these difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the March 1997 report of the House Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources, a report entitled “Think 
Rural”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing from a great many witnesses on the state of rural 
Canada, the committee had this to say about rural roads: 
“Existing deficiencies in transportation and infrastructure, 
especially roads, were repeatedly brought to our attention.  We 
were informed that the rural infrastructure in place is often 
poor quality and that there is a complete lack of highways in 
remote regions.  We were told that rail and air transportation is 
often inadequate and existing rural air transport is 
prohibitively expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Federal policy initiatives in transportation have historically 
been detrimental to maintaining rural transportation 
infrastructure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have it, a crisis in the midst of our economic engine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council of Ministers of Transportation has given a name to 
the rural road network in this era of globalization.  It is 
simply called the strategic economic network.  The council 
recognizes that for Canada to thrive under globalization we must 
have the ability to access our resources whether they be 
renewable in the form of fisheries and forestry or untapped 
deposits of wealth such as mines.  Without it, the council says, 
Canada will suffer under globalization and the living standards 
of Canadians will deteriorate quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just about a few more bucks for asphalt.  Canada 
needs a strategy for rural roads.  Indeed there is need for a 
comprehensive strategy for all of rural Canada.  We need 
effective strategies to develop exports, high technology, 
education and medicare.  These are all important but we neglect 
rural Canada at the peril of Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canadians, whether they live in the wide open spaces or in 
small towns, understand that nature has a balance.  When the 
government tore up the railways in many parts of rural Canada, 
including Atlantic Canada, the burden previously borne by the 
rail network fell to the waterways and roads.  Now the 
infrastructure of the waterways is falling into disrepair and 
naturally then into disuse with no support from government or the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural transportation system is out of balance.  Essentially 
all we have left are roads, or very soon this will likely be the 
case.  The removal of rail from the transportation picture means 
more trucks and larger trucks.  That takes a toll on the road 
network.  Roads in disrepair or roads built cheaply because of 
scarce public funds being diverted to other priorities mean 
weight restrictions and delays.  This affects economic 
performance and can be a factor in whether or not investments are 
made in certain rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a business in my constituency is transporting shellfish over 
roads which cause delays the product takes longer to get to 
market.  Smaller loads are required which are less profitable and 
losses in product quality are inevitable.  Not all the problems 
are economic.  Poor maintenance can result in conditions that 
make driving dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most rural roads are not double lane or twinned highways. 
Studies have proven that the types of roads which separate 
oncoming traffic are much safer, but if we do not have enough 
money for even a proper rural road network then double lanes are 
a luxury rural Canadians will not see.  They will have to 
continue to face more dangerous driving conditions.  This is 
clearly a problem, so what do we do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing to recognize is that in Canada roads are a 
provincial responsibility.  However the federal government has a 
tradition of contributing to road building.  When we compare the 
share of federal funding by governments in other countries, we 
see shares of between 30% and 65%.  Our share is about 5%.  In 
countries that share Canada's challenge of overcoming great 
distances and a style of federal government mixed with state or 
provincial jurisdiction, the U.S. and Australia have committed 
their federal governments to funding 100% of the construction, 
maintenance and rehabilitation costs of national highway systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there have been many calls for many years for a new 
national highway policy.  Such a policy might co-ordinate the 
road building efforts in this country if for no other reason than 
to make the business sector more efficient in light of the demise 
of rail and expensive air transport.  Such a national policy 
could address in a significant way the issues facing the rural 
road network, but these issues must be embraced by a powerful 
strategy with the full support of government, much like the 
deficit fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inadequate infrastructure hampers our ability to compete.  It 
is as simple as that.  In February 1997 the Standing Committee on 
Transport studied the issue of a national highway policy.  It 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee agrees with all those who have said that the only 
way a National Highway Program can be implemented is if the 
federal government makes the commitment to provide long term, 
sustainable and secure funding. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the Standing Committee on Natural Resources calls on 
the federal government to enact a national rural development 
policy with a minister responsible for such a national project. 
The committee studied the issue of rural roads and concluded that 
the federal government should enter into a new cost shared 
agreement with the provinces to implement a national highways 
upgrade for rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also suggested that federal tax assistance of 
limited duration should be provided to businesses willing to 
operate short haul rail lines, serve as regional air carriers or 
as rural airport landlords, manage and maintain rural docks and 
harbours, or construct road infrastucture.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the committee recommended that the federal government 
should review its application of cost recovery to services 
provided in rural Canada to ensure that undue financial burdens 
are not imposed on industries operating in rural and remote 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the question of rural roads cannot be 
considered in isolation from the greater question of rural 
development.  It is my understanding that the government has 
taken some steps which include that some thought is being given 
to a national rural development policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food announced the 
rural lens policy.  This policy is designed so that government 
programs and policies are put through the rural lens so that 
rural issues are given due consideration before the government 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe the government has failed its first test by 
privatizing the services delivered at the military base at Goose 
Bay.  This policy would seem to be a pilot project to privatize 
services at military bases across the country and to take 
control, profits and opportunities out of rural communities.  I 
do not see how this benefits rural Canada whatsoever.  I do not 
see how this rural lens was applied at all in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this momentum I would like to suggest that applying 
the fuel tax to the maintenance of rural roads is only one 
option.  The rural transportation network is so important to the 
entire issue of rural development that one cannot be considered 
without the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the cabinet is studying a response 
to the think rural report.  Perhaps momentum will develop to 
solve problems such as rural road maintenance.  I am confident 
that when the challenges of rural development are treated in this 
manner only then will rural road maintenance and development 
receive the resources they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is to be congratulated for his concern.  This 
may very well be part of a comprehensive solution to the 
difficulties in rural Canada and how to tap the enormous 
potential which exists there.  I join him in his concern and hope 
all members will ensure that the government introduces a proper 
rural development policy that will solve the problems the hon. 
member has highlighted today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a 
perfect example of the importance of Private Members' Business. 
Some of the best ideas that have come to parliament have been 
through private members.  This is absolutely one of the best 
examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that has an insatiable appetite for tax 
revenue and does not have a clue about what is important to the 
people of the country.  Instead it wastes its money on all sorts 
of crazy things and the highways of the country are going 
downhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a calculation of government taxes when it comes to 
gasoline which I actually shared in the previous parliament. This 
being a new parliament it is time to share it again.  In the 1994 
budget the Minister of Finance announced a 1.5 cent a litre 
increase in tax on fuel.  What he was not telling the people was 
that there was GST on top of that tax.  That tax is added first 
and the GST is computed when all other taxes are in. Not only are 
the provincial and the federal taxes taxed with a GST but it is 
added on at the very end.  That made that increase 1.605 cents, 
not the 1.5 that was actually touted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a little calculation that showed that gasoline is taxed at 
177%.  Here are my premises.  Before the election as well as now, 
if I begin with an earning of $2.78, with what I earn at the top 
of my income level I get taxed on 40%.  $1.11 goes to income tax. 
I am now left with a $1.67.  I take that $1.67 over to the 
gasoline station to buy some gasoline.  What happens?  There are 
taxes that we pay directly at the pumps in terms of excise taxes 
plus the taxes oil companies or retailers pay.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that is money that comes from me, goes to the government in 
the form of taxation and accounts for very close to another 40%. 
Forty per cent of $1.67 is 67 cents and I am left with $1.00 to 
buy gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I pay $1.67 in taxes, having purchased $1.00 worth of 
gasoline, it is a 167% rate of taxation.  If the government 
cannot live with that it is really shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support this bill.  It is a very wise and 
important bill and a very necessary bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to sum this up as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, refute a couple of the comments by the 
parliamentary secretary.  As usual, there was quite a substantial 
amount of fearmongering.  Not once in the motion does it deal 
with $4.4 billion per year going into this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it deals with is a portion of the excise tax raised on 
gasoline to go into an area where it was meant to go in the first 
place, highways, roads and, in this case, rural road 
reconstruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting for a moment $4.4 billion per year.  What I 
am suggesting, however, is a plan.  Is that too much to ask for, 
a priority that is being set and a plan that is set to deal with 
the priority?  It may well mean $250 million a year over a 20 
year period.  It may well mean $350 million a year over a 10 year 
period.  However, all I am suggesting is that the government get 
its head out of the sand and understands that there is a serious 
problem out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Bloc unfortunately likes to make sure 
there are distinctions between federal and provincial 
jurisdiction.  I am not getting into provincial jurisdiction. If 
indeed the plan should be that the provinces ultimately make the 
decision as to where that money should be spent I would applaud 
that.  Take the money being generated by federal taxes, give it 
to the provinces and then they can apply it to the priorities on 
road construction.  It is not that difficult a concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If provinces are now spending their dollars to fix federal 
responsibility roads then those dollars cannot be spent for 
provincial roads.  This is not difficult to understand, so please 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some suggestion that other priorities would be 
affected substantially such as health care, education and all 
those wonderful priorities that we all recognize as being very 
major priorities.  I suggest then that perhaps the $500 million 
that was spent in cancelling the EH-101s could have better been 
spent on road construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the $800 million blown by this government on the 
Pearson airport deal could have better been spent on road 
construction.  Let us not confuse the issue with the priorities 
of health care and education.  Let us just suggest there is a 
problem.  A plan should be put in place and the plan dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about a national highways program with the next 
private member's motion I would like to table. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hour provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the item is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.28 p.m.)
