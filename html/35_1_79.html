	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
occasion of Environment Week, I would like to report that the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development recommends the appointment of a commissioner 
who would help to ensure that the federal government pursues 
policies and programs that are environmentally sustainable. 
What does all that mean?
<P>
	It means the commissioner would evaluate and review federal 
policies, laws, regulations and programs and identify those 
which encourage and those which impede Canada's shift to 
environmentally sustainable development. The commissioner 
would report to Parliament. The commissioner would help in the 
shift toward sustainable development and would also comment 
on whether Canada's policies meet international commitments.
<P>
	The members of this committee, most of them at least, urge 
the government to act quickly in the implementation of the 
recommendations contained in this report.

today, the Allied Forces reversed the course of history on the 
beaches of Normandy. The operation that took place on June 6, 
1944, marked the beginning of the end of the military and 
political hegemony of the Nazis and the Axis forces.
<P>
	Taking part in the invasion on D-Day were units of the 
Canadian 3rd Infantry Division and the Canadian 2nd Armoured 
Brigade. Also present at this historic moment in the liberation of 
Europe by the Allied Forces were more than 50 ships of the 
Canadian Royal Navy and 37 squadrons of the Royal Canadian 
Airforce.
<P>
	This day is dedicated to all those Canadian and Quebec men 
and women, for the sacrifices they made in the defence of 
freedom on a day that was finally to lead to the end of the Second 
World War.

would like to share with members of this House the pride we feel 
in my riding of Calgary North at the achievements of Ms. Sri 
Chaudhuri.
<P>
	Sri Chaudhuri is a grade 12 student at Sir Winston Churchill 
High School in northwest Calgary. She has just received top 
honours at the National Science Fair in Guelph, Ontario. Sri won 
six awards including best overall project, the gold medal in the 
physical sciences division, and the Manning award for 
innovation.
<P>
	Her project demonstrated it is possible to use high frequency 
sound to break down toxic organic compounds that contaminate 
the environment.
<P>
	Sri is the first young scientist from western Canada to have 
won this national honour.
<P>
	Today as we remember the men and women who fought 
valiantly to safeguard our future, it is especially fitting to 
celebrate the achievements of a new generation of young 
Canadians like Sri Chaudhuri who is conquering obstacles to 
help preserve our environment.
<P>
	On behalf of the citizens of Calgary North, I extend sincere 
congratulations to Sri Chaudhuri.

<P>

him at ease by making them feel comfortable. He had a sense of

He was a man of many interests and talents.

	In addition to being an active member of his community, Tom 
was involved with the business life of Delta and the lower

those who watched television programming from the beaches of 
Normandy this morning will have been given some idea of the 
conditions which prevailed when Canadian troops came ashore 
50 years ago on June 6, 1944.
<P>
	Overcast skies and cold blustery winds made for a rough sea, 
especially for the small landing craft carrying our troops to the 
Normandy shore. As a result, many seasick Canadian soldiers 
flung themselves into the swells and on to the windswept Juno 
beach to face their determined and well-fortified enemy. By the 
end of this longest day, 359 Canadian soldiers would be killed, 
541 would be wounded and 47 would be taken prisoner.
<P>
	By the time the second world war ended more than 42,000

a multitude of social needs. To the implementation of such 
programs as health and recreation, child care, employment

YMCA has been instrumental in building the mind, body and

college in Kingston in order to accommodate the officer cadets

from Saint-Jean will amount to $75 million. The negotiations 
between Quebec City and Ottawa are still deadlocked.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether she continues to use 
economic arguments to justify the decision to close the military 
college in Saint-Jean, when the cost of training an officer cadet 
in Saint-Jean is $52,000 per year compared to $83,000 in 
Kingston.

facts she has just stated by reading the articles in <I>Le Devoir</I> 
which were written by an authorized and very credible 
journalist.
<P>
	I would also ask her how she can insist on invoking budgetary 
reasons to justify the decision to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean, when for the expansion alone of the college in 
Kingston required because of this closure, the contracts that will 
have to be awarded in order to accommodate the officer cadets 
from Saint-Jean, will cost almost $75 million.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

information given by the Leader of the Opposition is not true. It

<P>

that the government now denies it will expand the military 
college in Kingston and that the expansion plans, that we know 
about, are justified by the transfer of the officer cadets who used 
to study in Saint-Jean? I would urge the Deputy Prime Minister 
to check the facts and to make accurate statements in the House! 
We are dealing with serious issues here!

Ontario's Minister of Francophone Affairs refused to act on the 
request from the Commissioner of Official Languages, who 
asked the Government of Ontario to make an exception so that 
Kingston could become a bilingual area. This refusal by the 
Ontario government comes just before the cadets are to move 
from the military college in Saint-Jean to Kingston.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister still maintain that her 
government wants to make RMC in Kingston a bilingual 
institution and make that city a showcase of bilingualism when 
the Government of Ontario systematically refuses to make 
Kingston bilingual?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the Ontario 
government's decision expresses more or less the same policy as 
the Bloc Quebecois. It accepts institutional bilingualism at the 
federal level but not at the provincial level. That is similar to the 
Bloc Quebecois's policy in their platform.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Deputy Prime Minister not agree that the 
Ontario government's attitude means that Kingston will not 
have French services before the year 2000 if that city is not 
bilingual? Is it really the Liberal Government of Canada's 
bilingual showcase?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Ontario government's policy is exactly the same as the Bloc 
Quebecois's: it does not accept bilingualism at the provincial 
level. I ask you, as I ask them, to join us in defending the rights

life after only six years of contributions?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the government House leader has 
indicated on many occasions, a commission has been set up to 
examine this. The government will be dealing with it when the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope it does 
not take another six months.
<P>
	On February 8 I asked the Prime Minister about the exorbitant 
pension plan. He told me I did not understand the system. I do 
understand the system. The retirement allowance is legal and 
represents 4 per cent of what we contribute and is matched in a 
multiple of 2.4. The retirement compensation allowance 
represents 7 per cent and each dollar we put in is matched by a 
multiple of 7.8.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I have to elaborate so you people understand. Is the 
7 per cent portion of the retirement allowance act legal in light 
of the fact that the private sector can only match funds up to 5 
per cent each?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
simply want to repeat what my colleague the Minister of

<P>
	The government is committed to legislating the matter of 
members' pensions. He said we would be dealing with the 
matter after receiving the report of the commission which is 
studying issues involving the pay and pensions of members 
which has to be set up after every election. The government will 
be proceeding along those lines as soon as it gets the report, has 
a chance to study it and reach some conclusions.

include your Speaker when you are addressing questions or 
giving answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The fact is a two-tier system has been set up by politicians for 
their pension plan that is completely out of line with the private 
sector. There should not be two sets of laws in our country; one 
for the people and one for the politicians.
<P>
	Before the House recesses in three weeks, can the Minister of 
Finance or the Solicitor General guarantee our party that we will 
get a response to this overly generous retirement compensation 
allowance?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at the end of this month, finance ministers will meet in 
Vancouver. It appears that the federal government intends to 
discuss the main recommendation contained in the preliminary 
report of the finance committee on the GST reform, and follow 
up on it. The recommendation proposes that the current GST be 
replaced by another GST, that all provincial taxes be combined 
with this tax, and that the tax base be expanded to other goods 
and services not currently covered.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the minister 
confirm that, at this conference, he intends to start negotiating 
with his provincial counterparts on the amalgamation of the 
GST and provincial sales taxes to create a single tax, and that the 
technical aspects, the procedures and the scope of that tax will 
be determined by Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is well 
aware that I have not yet received the report. As soon as we 
receive it, hopefully before the meeting to be held at the end of 
the month, we will certainly want to have discussions with the 
provincial Ministers of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
will the Minister of Finance confirm his government's intention 
to force Quebec to extend the new GST to food items, medical 
care and medication, and to impose, in Quebec, this new hidden 
tax which will be even more despicable than the original GST 
for Quebec and Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
full well that this is not our intention. Our intention is to sit with 
all the provincial finance ministers, have real discussions and 
implement, if we can, what consumers, small businesses and 
Canadians want, namely a truly harmonized tax.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, week after week we in the opposition have shown 
examples of Liberal patronage appointments.
<P>
	The recent appointment of Michel Robert as the new Oka 
negotiator is a perfect example of the Liberal do as I say, not as I 
do policy.
<P>
	Who can forget the howls of outrage and indignation when the 
former government appointed Bernard Roy, a former Tory aide, 
as Oka negotiator, yet the Liberals have done exactly the same 
thing.
<P>
	My question is for the government House leader, whose 
government has made a big deal about its ethics counsellor, yet 
it has proven that it does not have the basic integrity required to 
live up to its rhetoric. Does the government expect a new ethics 
counsellor to be its moral conscience or to clean up the awful 
mess of patronage it is creating?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the Prime Minister makes an announcement of his 
proposal on the commitment to have an ethics counsellor it will 
be open to the opposition parties to comment. In the meantime I 
would ask them to wait until the Prime Minister formally puts 
his proposal to the House and the public.
<P>
	I think that would be the only fair and reasonable way to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that was not the question. I was talking about restoring 
faith and integrity in Parliament itself.
<P>
	Time after time we have seen appointments to big <I>L</I> Liberals 
for advertising contracts, for committee contracts. The list goes 
on.
<P>
	How can the government House leader stand up and say these 
appointments of well known Liberals are not patronage 
appointments and will he stop them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we made a commitment to appoint people on the basis of merit 
and on the basis of competence. The hon. member's suggestion 
that there are not any competent people in a particular political 
party flies in the face of common sense.
<P>
	The government is committed to making appointments on the 
basis of merit and competence. Since close to 51 per cent of 
Canadians support the Liberal Party, I do not think that half the 
Canadian population should be excluded from consideration for 
appointments.

double hulled ships, the Deputy Prime Minister stated, and I 
quote: ``The double hull legislation was passed last year. I do not 
know where the Bloc member and his colleagues were at that 
time, but the legislation already exists''.
<P>
	In fact, the legal counsels of the transport department we 
talked to confirmed that there is no such legislation in force. Let 
me remind the House that Bill C-121, an Act to amend the 
Canada Shipping Act, passed in 1993, does not require ships to 
have a double hull.
<P>

the minister tell us exactly what piece of legislation on double 
hulled ships she was referring to?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

was legislation on double hulling. Indeed there is legislation on 
double hulling. It was passed last year. It applies to new ships.
<P>
	The reality is that we also have double hulling applying to 
ships that are carrying oil cargo.
<P>
	In respect of other ships, which I assume is the member's 
intention, if he is suggesting that all ships be double hulled in 
order to ply Canadian waters in any part of the country I would 
suggest that his own proposition would see the port of Quebec 
closed down today if he had his way.

respect democracy, something that unfortunately does not exist

financing to voter contributions, that is to say excluding 
corporate donations, the way it has been in Quebec for 17 years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question raised by the 
hon. member was a legitimate question. He asked whether there 
was any intent to force public servants into contributions that 
they should not be making.
<P>
	The answer is no, clear and simple. There is no intent to twist 
anybody's arm or indeed to have any direct contact with public 
servants. It was a mistake made because we purchased a list 
from a private company.
<P>
	I would hope the member would honour the fact that a mistake 
was made. We apologized for the mistake we made. We said to 
every public servant across the country: ``Don't feel compelled 
to respond to this letter that was sent in error''.

	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is addressed to the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of agriculture.
<P>
	The tender fruit industry is presently experiencing trying 
times and it has asked the minister to recognize its plight and to 
come to its aid before we lose some of the best agricultural land 
in Ontario and indeed in Canada.
<P>
	Is the parliamentary secretary ready to give some assurances 
to the tender fruit growers in the Niagara Peninsula?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
recognizes full well the importance of the Ontario tender fruit 
industry. I emphasize the fact and stress that the industry has 
about $25 million in commercial sales a year.
<P>
	The industry presented the government recently with a 
document entitled ``Partnership for a Revitalized Ontario 
Tender Fruit Industry''. That document is under review by the 
staff of the department.
<P>
	As recently as this morning I met with a number of 
department personnel to discuss that. I can assure the hon. 
member and the industry that we will be meeting in the very near 
future with the industry participants to work together to 
strengthen and revitalize the industry.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice regarding the FAC or 
firearms acquisition certificate. I have a question from members 
of my constituency wondering about training personnel to 
administer the courses.
<P>
	Could the minister assure us that he does have personnel in 
place to teach the courses because the courses are mandatory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, in each of the provinces 
there are people who have been trained to give the courses to 
ensure that those who make application for the FAC can be 
prepared for the course requirements.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
come to my attention that there are factual errors in the 
handbook or the manual that has come out. I would ask the 
minister to check that out. Firearms experts in my constituency 
say there are factual errors in that.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question for the minister. In terms of 
setting the fee for this particular course we have heard anywhere 
from $75 for the course up to $200 and $300. Is the actual 
amount of the fee for the course mandatory, or is it up to the 
trainers' jurisdiction or their personal preference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been assured that the 
contents of the course are complete and accurate, but in view of 
the statement made by the hon. member I will make further 
inquiries of the department to ensure that is so. I will let her 
know what I learn as a result of those inquiries.
<P>
	So far as the fees are concerned, the fees are actually 
prescribed by the provinces on the basis of cost recovery. I can 
again research further detail on that and let the hon. member 
know in writing what the details are. However the principle is 
cost recovery and the amounts are set by the provinces.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mistake 
the government made when it decided to close the Collège 
militaire royal in Saint-Jean and transfer the students to 
Kingston is obviously turning into a nightmare. The expected 
savings will not materialize and might even be offset by 
renovation costs.
<P>
	My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Defence. Can he confirm whether RMC officials in 
Kingston are planning major renovations to accommodate 
students from Saint-Jean and offer special courses which are 
available in Saint-Jean but not in Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, I personally 
checked today to see if the statements published this week-end 
in <I>Le Devoir</I> were correct.
<P>
	According to National Defence officials they are incorrect 
and there is no plan to spend $50 or $75 million in Kingston. 
Furthermore, they indicated that the area where the cadets have 
their meals was being upgraded, but that the work had been 
approved by the previous government as part of a larger 
renovation project which had been planned before it was 
decided to close the Collège militaire royal in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Therefore, no new money has been allocated to transfer the 
cadets from Saint-Jean to Kingston.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Agriculture. Last December, certain pessimists took 
delight in saying that the future of supply management in 
Canada was doomed. Obviously, the truth was quite another 
story.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary give this House some idea of 
the long-term projections for this industry? Can he also give us 
a status report on his department's review of supply 
management?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

report, as we know, that a task force was established in January 
to discuss with all stakeholders in the industry the future of 
supply management and orderly marketing in those sectors in 
Canada.
<P>
	Those meetings have been taking place. The five commodity 
committees are meeting on a regular basis. I am proud and 
pleased to say that all stakeholders in the industry are taking part 
in those discussions. We will be reporting the very optimistic 
results of those discussions. The industry will be prepared to 
meet the challenges and the opportunities of the Uruguay round 
of GATT negotiations when they are implemented in 1995.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago today boys 
became men. Fifty years ago today men became heroes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I was there this morning with all other hon. 
members who felt an incredible pride when the national anthem 
<I>O Canada</I> was sung everywhere for those who worked for 
democracy in Canada 50 years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	D-Day began the Normandy campaign. The Normandy 
campaign began the liberation of Europe.
<P>
	Today we honour the 14,000 young soldiers who landed on 
Juno Beach. We honour the 1,000 who were killed during that 
landing and we honour the combined efforts of millions of 
women and men who sacrificed terribly for five years to end the 
scourge of Nazism.
<P>
	The Regina Rifle Regiment, the Canadian Scottish Regiment, 
the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, le régiment de la Chaudière, the 
North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment, the Queen's Own 
Rifles of Canada, the Stormont Dundas Glengarry Highlanders, 
the North Nova Scotia Islanders, the Highland Light Infantry, 
the Cameron Islanders of Ottawa, the First Canadian Parachute 
Battalion, les Fusilliers de Sherbrooke, the Fort Garry Horse 
Regiment and the Sixth Armoured Division.
<P>
	The names ring of history but the landing on the beach of 
Normandy was not the romance of history books. War is not 
romantic. Real human beings died on the beach. Real human 
beings died in the frigid channel. Real human beings died on the 
barbed wire. Real human beings lost husbands, fathers, brothers 
and friends. Real human beings lost their children.
<P>
	Many of us alive today have no memories of D-Day and yet 
we must remember. To paraphrase the Prime Minister speaking 
this morning as he did so eloquently in Normandy: ``They didn't 
ask us if we were Quebecers, Ontarians, westerners, easterners; 
they didn't ask us what language we spoke when they called us 
to the service of our country, and we responded literally by the 
hundreds of thousands''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, I was proud this morning. I was proud to hear <I>O Canada</I>, 
which symbolizes democracy because of everyone who died 50 
years ago. Very few of us will ever be called upon to display as 
much courage as our soldiers on the beaches of Normandy.
<P>
	My great-grandfather, an Acadian whose name was 
Gaudreault and who died in the First World War, the Magdalen 
Islanders and people from all over rallied to the cause of 
democracy and represented Canada with incredible pride. Very 
few of us will have to choose to give our lives for others' 
freedom.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The liberty to speak out; the liberty to separate; the liberty to 
exercise democracy in a way that Canada has shown both at 
Dieppe and on D-Day and over the years that they did not die in 
vain.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As we celebrate the decisive battle for the liberation of 
Europe, we praise the survivors and we mourn the dead.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It would be wrong to imagine that victory was foreordained. 
The war was not a book or a movie in which the good guys were 
bound to win. Except for the bravery of our soldiers and our 
allies, we could be living under the swastika today. Our soldiers 
faced down a criminal regime which deliberately murdered 
millions of people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4868"> 4868 </A></B>
<P>
	The efforts of 50 years ago set the foundation for peace and 
unity in Europe and the democracy that we experience in our 
country today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our way of life, our prosperity, our pride in being Canadian, 
our being ranked first among all coutries in the world, our 
individual and collective freedom, our sense of international 
community were built on the determination of all those soldiers 
who had to land in the icy waters of the English Channel on June 
6, 1944. Thanks to them, the Gaudreaults, the Baldwins and the 
Clancys, thanks to them, we have made tremendous strides in 
the past fifty years and forged solid ties of friendship with other 
peoples.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The great danger is the belief it could never happen again. The 
sad reality is that today in many places throughout the world 
forces of great evil are in control and are continuing to slaughter 
innocent people. Hundreds of millions of human beings on our 
earth remain deprived of the most basic human rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Hundreds of millions of human beings in this world are 
deprived of the most basic human rights. Hundreds of millions 
of our brothers and sisters live under tyrannical and murderous 
regimes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The vigil for peace must be constant. We pay true honour to 
our heroes only if we use the lessons of the past to guide us into 
the future. We pay true honour to our heroes only if we 
understand that liberty and freedom can never be taken for 
granted.
<P>
	We pause today for a few moments of reflection out of 
respect, but our obligations remain for a lifetime. Our duty is to 
pass on to coming generations the principles for which our 
armed forces fought on D-Day.
<P>
	Throughout Canada today children prepare for their summer 
vacations and their trips to the beach without a care because 50 
years ago soldiers, barely older than children, put their lives on 
the line on the beaches of Normandy. People gave up their youth 
to safeguard the future of young people.
<P>
	We say prayers for those who lost their lives and we offer 
thanks to those who survived. However, we remember that the 
soldiers at Normandy did not fight just so that we could say a 
few words of thanks. They fought to give us a chance to build a 
better world. Our true thanks can only come through our actions 
in offering future generations the same opportunities that they 
gave to us.
<P>
	We can best pay tribute for the sacrifices made 50 years ago if 
we keep faith with the ideals that inspired those sacrifices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes democracy hurts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes democracy and free speech hurt. Sometimes they 
hurt people who are concerned about the future of their country, 
but the reality is that what Normandy gave us 50 years ago is the 
opportunity to stand in this place and fight for the survival of our 
country or for its breakup. The reality of what those soldiers did 
on D-Day was to bring to Canada a real sense of liberation that 
says: ``Whatever your views, whatever your opinions, whatever 
your agenda, we welcome them'' because that is the democracy 
for which they fought.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ceremonies taking place here today and elsewhere 
are an expression of the gratitude we feel as well as an 
opportunity for us to reflect on the meaning of June 6, 1944, and 
on the lessons to be learned from that fateful day on which the 
largest military operation of all time unfolded.
<P>
	The word gratitude does not begin to convey the full measure 
of the debt we owe to the 5,000 Canadians of all origins and to 
the tens of thousands of allied soldiers who selflessly made the 
supreme sacrifice during the battle of Normandy.
<P>
	Words can never express the debt we owe to those lying 
silently in the cemeteries doting the coast along the landing 
beaches, their graves marked by white crosses and bearing 
inscriptions which tell the tale of 20-year-old boys who died in 
the name of democracy and freedom.
<P>
	We also owe a debt of gratitude to their fellow soldiers who 
survived the fury of battle. They returned home to their families 
carrying with them the memory of their fallen comrades. How 
can we not think of the mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, 
widows and betrothed, and orphaned sons and daughters left to 
grieve for those buried on foreign soil? Their pain, sacrifices 
and selfless actions were made greater by the reasons that 
inspired them. On this day, we must also remember the nurses 
who worked in the hospitals on the front, as well as all those who 
toiled in the factories and plants.
<P>
	The importance of the Allied landings in Normandy cannot be 
overstated. The invasion marked the beginning of the final 
assault by the Allied forces on Berlin. Forced to defend itself on 
two fronts, Hitler's army surrendered less than one year later, 
shortly after our troops linked up with Soviet divisions.
<P>
	The success of the landing in France clearly demonstrated the 
combined industrial might of the United States, Great Britain 
and Canada. Above all, it was an expression of democratic 
solidarity. Hearts and minds were mobilized in the quest to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4869"> 4869 </A></B>
<P>
defend the  principles of freedom that underlie all truly 
democratic societies.
<P>
	At a time when the very principle of our collective allegiance 
was threatened, our citizens rallied to take up arms. The threat 
must have been perceived as great indeed for a people as 
fundamentally peaceful as we are to become involved as we did 
in the most devastating armed conflict in history.
<P>
	The determination was also great to erase the threat of any 
future conflict. If there is one view shared by all veterans who 
are haunted by the terrible atrocities they witnessed, it is their 
condemnation of war.
<P>
	We owe more than mere gratitude and admiration to those 
who lay down their life or endured terrible suffering. We have a 
duty to them to remember, because it is by remembering the 
horror of war that we will remain vigilant defenders of peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is with gratitude and humility that I pay tribute to the 
Canadian men and women of every background, race, religion, 
language and political persuasion who laid down their lives in 
Europe, or lost their friends and comrades and returned to 
Canada, some maimed, and all forever marked by an experience 
of tragedy and a knowledge of bravery and sacrifice of a kind 
rarely encountered in our times.
<P>
	In remembering the sacrifices made on D-Day, let us resolve 
once more to honour the memory of the men and women who 
fought against fascism by continuing in our day the struggle for 
democracy and human rights. In order that the spirit of 
democracy be allowed to flourish, and not simply its structures, 
I would wish for us all throughout the coming years the 
understanding and sensitivity that we perhaps experience in 
heightened degree on occasions such as this when we remember, 
above all, our shared values and common democratic goals.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the sixth of June, 1944 Canadians joined allied forces in the 
assault on Festung Europa, Fortress Europe, a continent held for 
more than four years in the iron grip of the Axis forces: Adolf 
Hitler's Third Reich and Benito Mussolini's fascist regime.
<P>
	Prior to the D-Day invasion Canadians had twice been 
engaged against the Axis: at Dieppe on August 19, 1942 and in 
the Italian campaign which started with the invasion of Sicily on 
July 10, 1943.
<P>
	In these previous actions Canadians took heavy casualties but 
established themselves as a formidable adversary; determined, 
courageous and effective fighting troops, respected and feared 
by their opponents.
<P>
	On D-Day the five Normandy beaches to be assaulted were 
designated Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. On this, the 
longest day, more than 150,000 allied soldiers would complete 
their crossing from England to occupied France.
<P>
	Inland over 23,000 U.S. paratroopers had jumped into battle 
while another 57,000 American soldiers landed on the beaches 
designated Utah and Omaha.
<P>
	Concurrently British and Canadian troops had jumped or 
landed in gliders while 60,000 British and 15,000 Canadian 
troops joined the assault on the beaches, the British on Gold and 
Sword while the Canadian came ashore on Juno. Thus, one in ten 
of the allied forces landed in the D-Day invasion was Canadian.
<P>
	This ratio carried through to the total Canadian population 
with over one million of Canada's 11 million people in uniform 
and behind them was a Canadian public committed to supporting 
the war effort. Canadians were united in rejecting the 
totalitarian forces of Germany, Italy and Japan, a regime which 
had it not been effectively opposed would have subjected the 
world to a reign of terror, discrimination and oppression.
<P>
	Canada's D-Day success resulted from a combined effort of 
navy, army and air force units, 109 ships and 10,000 sailors, 
15,000 soldiers and 37 RCAF squadrons working as a team.
<P>
	Canadians achieved two firsts during the Normandy 
campaign. The Canadian 7th Brigade was the first formation to 
reach its D-Day goal, and 441, 442 and 443 squadrons RCAF 
were the first to commence air operations from French soil since 
the allied 1940 withdrawal from France.
<P>
	The Canadians who went ashore at Dieppe, at Pachino, at 
Normandy and those who fought to liberate the rest of Europe 
considered themselves ordinary people but they were willing to 
jeopardize their all to support a cause in which they believed.
<P>
	I want to conclude with a quote from Jack Granatstein's book, 
<I>Normandy, 1944</I> where, speaking of Canadians who landed on 
D-Day, it is said:

	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I wonder if I 
could have the unanimous consent of the House to speak on this 
occasion on behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
thanks to colleagues for agreeing to my request.
<P>
	I think it is only appropriate on the 50th anniversary of D-Day 
that we have an opportunity to reflect in the House and across 
the country, to gather together all those feelings and thoughts 
and reflections that we have had over the last few years as a 
number of different 50th anniversaries have come to us as a 
result of the 1990s.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4870"> 4870 </A></B>
<P>
	I think of the 50th anniversary of Dieppe, the 50th anniversary 
of the Italy campaign, the 50th anniversary of Hong Kong, the 
Battle of the Atlantic, and all the other campaigns and battles in 
which Canadians participated with equal courage.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Today is the 50th anniversary of D-Day and something which 
I think brings it all together because this was the last big push; 
this was the beginning of the end.
<P>
	I am very glad to be able to rise on behalf of my colleagues in 
the NDP caucus to express our appreciation for the men and 
women who participated in the D-Day landings and to extend 
our warmest wishes to all the survivors who are here today in 
Ottawa and overseas with the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I would like to particularly mention, if I might be parochial 
for a minute, the two Winnipeg regiments that participated in the 
D-Day landing, the Fort Gary Horse and the Royal Winnipeg 
Rifles.
<P>
	Finally, as a young person I had an opportunity to go to 
Europe. The people of my generation went with packsacks on 
their backs, Canadian flags on their backs, hitchhiking or 
bicycling as the case may be. I first came face to face with the 
sacrifice that young Canadians of a previous generation made 
when I was cycling through Holland in May 1971. I saw a big 
cross and a monument. My friend and I stopped. We had a good 
look. It turned out we were in a placed called Bergen-op-Zoom. 
There is a Canadian war cemetery with about 2,000 Canadians 
buried there.
<P>
	We started to look around and seeing it was a Canadian war 
cemetery, we started to look at all the different headstones. It 
struck us, as we were 19 at the time, that most of the men lying 
there were the same age as we were. We could not leave until we 
had visited every grave. It took us a number of hours. We were 
captured by the weight of the images before us.
<P>
	Ten years later as a member of Parliament I had an occasion to 
go to another Canadian war cemetery in Edegem. It struck me 
then, as it struck me when I returned again when I was 40 to 
Vimy, how really young these men were. I did not know how 
young they were the first time I was in a Canadian war cemetery 
because I was the same age as they were. Having looked again 
when I was 30 and again when I was 40, I realize what these 
people gave up and what they sacrificed. That is what we 
remember here today.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to announce today on behalf of 
the President of the Treasury Board that the federal government 
is lifting the freeze on the amount of grants in lieu of taxes which 
agent crown corporations pay to municipalities across Canada.
<P>
	The decision to lift the freeze that applies to properties owned 
by agent crown corporations such as Canada Post and the CBC is 
retroactive to January 1, 1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government's objective was to remove a major 
irritant in relations between municipalities and the federal 
government. This is the area in which municipalities have not 
collected their fair share of realty taxes since 1992. The amount 
available for paying these grants in lieu of taxes had been frozen 
since an announcement by the previous federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works and Government Services will 
undertake a review of the municipal grants program so as to 
ensure that the fiscal relationship between the federal 
government and the municipalities is stable and predictable.
<P>
	Finally, the federal government expects to face severe fiscal 
constraints in its 1995 budget. Municipalities have been asked 
to recognize this and refrain from taking advantage of the lifting 
of the freeze by targeting crown corporation properties for tax 
increases.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is normal 
for the federal government to give grants to municipalities in 
return for their services to Crown corporations. To lift the freeze 
on these grants and continue to index them to inflation is only 
fair and should always have been done in the past.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tells us that the government expects 
to face severe fiscal constraints in its 1995 budget. His 
statement contains no surprise. Given the 1994 budget plan, all 
Canadian taxpayers will face harsh financial realities in 1995. 
What is really needed is a global and comprehensive review of 
the tax system and of all federal government spending, instead 
of what is being proposed today in the minister's statement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
extend a compliment, although a qualified one, to the Minister 
of Finance for today's announcement regarding the lifting of the 
freeze on grants in lieu of taxes that crown corporations pay to 
municipalities.
<P>
	Certainly governments should live up to their tax 
responsibilities if they expect the public to do so, especially 
since the Minister of National Revenue and taxation has just 
raised the interest from 6 per cent to 8 per cent on late payments 
on income tax payments.

	Recently higher levels of government have been accused of 
passing on the burden of fiscal restraint to lower levels. It is nice 
to see the situation changed in this instance. Now if only the 
federal government would take the same attitude toward such 
things as maintaining funding for health care, another source of 
intergovernmental dispute might disappear, or if it cannot, allow 
provinces some flexibility.
<P>
	One small comment in the minister's announcement does 
however cause me a bit of concern and that is his comment that 
the federal government expects to face severe fiscal constraints 
in its 1995 budget.
<P>
	I wonder if this is the same minister who has been assuring 
this House and the Canadian public for months now that the 
government will meets its budget targets, it will reduce the 
deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, and it will create jobs for everyone, 
and yes everything is coming up roses. Has he looked at the 
interest rates lately?
<P>
	I look forward to hearing just what kind of fiscal constraints 
the minister expects so the Canadian taxpayer can have an idea 
of what to expect as well.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-37, an act to amend the 
Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to introduce debate on 
second reading with respect to Bill C-37.
<P>
	In beginning may I observe that last week the government 
took steps to improve the youth justice system in Canada, both 
in terms of immediate and long term changes to the justice 
system for young people. By introducing Bill C-37 the 
government addressed the very real public concerns about 
crimes of violence by youths in Canada.
<P>
	The government recognizes the importance of public 
protection in the justice system, but it recognizes that protection 
of the public is best achieved through the rehabilitation of 
offenders wherever possible.
<P>
	The government emphasized the accountability aspect of the 
justice system and at the same time, it fulfilled commitments it 
had given to the electorate last year during the election 
campaign.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All Canadians want to raise their children in safe and 
crime-free communities. But we do not always agree on the best 
way to reach our goal.
<P>
	There is no miracle solution, no panacea. However, I believe 
that this bill represents a step in the right direction, a better way 
for the federal government to deal with young offenders, 
especially those guilty of serious offences.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to touch upon the essential elements of Bill C-37 as I 
introduce second reading debate in this Chamber. As I do so, 
may I invite the attention of hon. members to the balancing 
aspects of the legislation, to the distinctions it draws between 
for example, violent and non-violent crime, and between young 
offenders in different parts of the age groups covered by the 
legislation. I ask hon. members to agree that those distinctions 
based on a rational assessment of risk and of need are an 
appropriate adjustment for the youth justice system in Canada.
<P>
	I deal first with maximum penalties for murder. Bill C-37 
would increase to 10 years in the case of first degree murder and 
to seven years in the case of second degree murder the maximum 
penalties in youth court for those convicted there of murder. 
This change is motivated by an acknowledgement on the part of 
this government that Canadians recognize that the present 
maximum penalty for first degree murder of five years is simply 
not sufficient to reflect society's abhorrence and condemnation 
of what is simply the most serious single criminal act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By toughening up sentences, we give a clear indication to our 
young people that serious offences also have very serious 
consequences, whether they come before a youth court or an 
adult court.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second significant change introduced by Bill C-37 has to 
do with those 16 and 17-year old young people who are charged 
with the most serious crimes of violence. The bill would adjust 
the present transfer provisions in dealing with those young 
persons so as to obligate them to satisfy the youth court judge 
that their trials should be held in youth court. Failure on the part 
of such persons to persuade the judge would result in their being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4873"> 4873 </A></B>
<P>
tried in adult court and facing the sanctions which the criminal 
law provides in adult court.
<P>
	I ask members of the House to observe that this is not an 
automatic treatment of 16 and 17-year olds in the youth justice 
system. We do not favour an automatic transfer of people in that 
age group. Rather it is simply a reverse onus for the test on 
transfer that exists at present, obligating those persons of that 
age when charged with the proscribed crimes to bear the burden 
of persuading the youth court judge that they should remain in 
the youth court.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The offences in respect of which this changed onus applies 
are: murder in the first and second degree; attempted murder; 
manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and aggravated 
assault. Simply, it applies to the most serious crimes of personal 
violence in the code.
<P>
	Our purpose in proposing this change to the transfer provision 
is to reflect the belief of this government that when alleged 
offenders at the highest ages of the age range covered by the act 
are accused of crimes of the most serious violence, then they 
should bear the burden of establishing their entitlement to be 
tried and sentenced in youth court.
<P>
	The third change to which I would draw the attention of the 
House has to do with victim impact statements. As I met with 
victims and their families over the last several months, I was 
impressed with the extent to which such persons want to have a 
role in the administration of criminal justice, particularly youth 
justice, that permits an acknowledgement of their pain and their 
loss. By introducing in youth court the same opening for the 
filing of victim impact statements in the sentencing process as 
exists at present in criminal courts generally, we will extend that 
right to victims and their families.
<P>
	The next change of significance has to do with the sharing of 
information. The changes we propose will enable peace officers 
and the provincial director for youth justice and other 
appropriate authorities to share with school boards, schools or 
other institutions or agencies, information about young people 
involved in the criminal justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The current provisions have had the unintended result of 
impeding the communication and sharing of information 
between experts working with young offenders, such as police 
officers and school authorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have been persuaded from my meetings with members of 
police forces, school board trustees, high school principals, 
worried parents, indeed young people themselves, that the 
structure and the scheme in place at present often works against 
the kind of partnerships we need in society to deal with the threat 
of youth crime, to deal more effectively with protecting students 
and staff and others when young people are prone to violence. 
The changes we propose will enable the sharing of  information 
responsibly so as to overcome that structural difficulty.
<P>
	The new system proposed in Bill C-37 will require the 
recipient of information, for example the principal or the 
official in the school, to keep that information private. It will be 
shared only with those with whom it must be shared for the 
purpose of putting precautions in place. It will be kept separate 
on file from the educational record of the young person, and then 
the information will be destroyed when the young person has 
left the jurisdiction, for example of the school board.
<P>
	The next change to which I wish to refer has to do with the way 
in which Bill C-37 affects the manner in which the courts 
respond to non-violent crime by those covered by the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Adolescents who are guilty of minor infractions should 
assume concrete responsibility for their acts and repair the 
damage done to their community whenever possible.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For us the emphasis should be and must be upon non-jail 
sentences for young offenders who commit non-violent crimes.
<P>
	Some 10 years ago, when the Young Offenders Act was 
drafted, introduced, debated, enacted and proclaimed, the stated 
expectation was that the emphasis for young people caught up in 
the criminal justice system would be on community based, 
positive, rehabilitative dispositions so that they were not sent to 
custody and nothing more. The emphasis was to be on 
restorative justice so that young persons who made mistakes 
would be punished and corrected but could learn from it through 
a community based program involving supervision to get them 
back on track.
<P>
	For the most part that promise has not been fulfilled. In fact 
the level and extent of custody as a sentence for young offenders 
are vastly higher than first expected. Over 30 per cent of those 
young offenders found guilty in youth court receive a sentence 
involving custody. Over half those in custody are there for 
non-violent crime.
<P>
	Studies establish the outcomes for those held in custody are 
not as good as for those who are not. At the same time the cost of 
custody vastly outweighs the cost of other dispositions. Over 
$350 million a year is spent in the youth justice system on the 
costs of custody nation-wide.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4874"> 4874 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government which contributes $160 million a 
year to youth justice finds that $130 million of that sum goes to 
help defray the cost of custody. The Department of Justice 
estimates that it costs somewhere between $70,000 and 
$100,000 a year to keep a young person in custody.
<P>
	Surely the direction we must take is that plotted by Bill C-37 
in this respect which emphasizes that in cases involving 
non-violent crime jail as a penalty must be a last resort. The 
emphasis in that direction flowing from the bill arises by the 
provisions that require those who prepare reports about young 
offenders, predisposition reports for example, to explain if they 
are recommending a custody term why all other dispositions are 
inappropriate. They call upon the judge sentencing the young 
offender to resort to custody only when other dispositions are 
not appropriate. Then they call upon the judge to state the 
reasons, if custody is the sentence, why other dispositions are 
not appropriate or available.
<P>
	If we shift the focus through these changes in the statutory 
framework and if we follow up on this initiative in working with 
our partners in the provinces to ensure community based 
dispositions are there in a meaningful way, we will surely turn 
the page to a better day for youth justice in the country.
<P>
	We encourage community based dispositions in the statute. 
These changes will advance that encouragement. Hopefully the 
money saved with the reduction in custody costs can be devoted 
toward the development, the funding and the administration of 
positive and helpful community based dispositions for 
non-violent young offenders.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the question of records.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Through this bill, we are proposing changes, for example, to 
the provisions on offenders' records. These amendments will 
facilitate the difficult work of police officers who conduct 
inquiries concerning these offences, and they will enable 
authorities to retain for a longer period the criminal record of 
young offenders who are found guilty of serious crimes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Surely the provisions with respect to records in Bill C-37 
reflect common sense. Those young offenders who are 
convicted of minor infractions or the less serious offences for 
the first time should have their records kept for a shorter period 
so as not to stigmatize them or interfere with efforts to advance 
their education or their employment. At the same time those 
who commit serious offences should have their records retained 
for a longer period, and in the most serious offences some 
forever.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Those are some of the principal changes proposed in Bill 
C-37. I also emphasize that the bill must be seen in the context 
of the general parliamentary review we have initiated through 
my letter last week to the chair of the  House Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	In that letter I asked the chair of the standing committee, after 
considering and reporting to Parliament with respect to the bill, 
to undertake a comprehensive review of the Young Offenders 
Act and of the youth justice system in Canada in general; to look 
at present social circumstances; to examine our experience with 
the Young Offenders Act during the past 10 years; to engage 
Canadians in the discussion; to hear from a wide spectrum of 
persons with experience with the act; to examine how the youth 
justice system in general could be improved; to look at the cost, 
the purpose and the principles of the present act; to determine 
how to weave our priority for crime prevention into the system; 
to comment on how the youth justice system should reflect the 
changes we are considering in connection with special program 
review, on how we can get parents more involved in juvenile 
justice, and on how best to restore and enhance public 
confidence in the youth justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this review is essential, to allow for a more 
thorough examination of other aspects of the act and to get the 
public's reaction on juvenile delinquency in general.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is essential that Canadians be involved in the process of 
reassessing this statute. As I made clear in my letter to the chair 
of the standing committee, I want the committee to look at 
fundamental issues surrounding the present act including the 
ages to which the statute applies and how best to deal with repeat 
offenders.
<P>
	At the same time I tell the House there will be a parallel 
process in place involving the provinces and territories so we 
will have the views of our provincial and territorial partners in 
the process and we can look together at questions like cost 
sharing because they have the responsibility for administering 
the statute and we must be sensitive to their views.
<P>
	I should also tell the House I have asked the standing 
committee to report on the second phase of its work by February 
1 next. I have given the chair my assurance that the government 
will respond quickly to the recommendations the committee 
may sees fit to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the government firmly believes that 
these changes will provide adequate flexibility to provinces, so 
that each will be able to administer and implement the act while 
taking into account its own specific situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4875"> 4875 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe the changes we have proposed, the distinctions we 
have drawn and the emphasis we have selected meet the 
imperative of public protection while preserving the 
fundamental principles of the statute and enhancing juvenile 
justice in the country.
<P>
	I commend the bill to the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice has finally caved in to pressures from the 
most conservative elements of his party. Bill C-37, which 
proposes to amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal 
Code, draws its inspiration from a philosophy that is repressive.
<P>
	Although they criticized the amendments proposed by the 
Liberals as lacking in vigour, I am sure Reform Party members 
will be very satisfied. This bill responds to many of their 
demands. I remind you of the debate on May 12, 1994, on the 
Reform Party motion.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This debate gave us a chance to measure the full extent of the 
philosophy-I know that is a very big word-of the Reform 
Party with respect to youth.
<P>
	How do they see young people, these people who want to 
punish them at all costs because they imitate adult behaviour? 
How do these supporters of repressive policies see young 
people? Listen to what was said by the hon. member for 
Westminster-Burnaby: ``Our young people, the promise for 
our future, are seen by many not as our hopeful legacy for 
tomorrow but as strangers to be feared''. There is more: ``Young 
people speak differently, they do not want to dress anything like 
the rest of us, they do not seem to value or give due regard to 
what we hold dear''.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to say: ``Indeed there is an innate 
sense that the fundamental social order of the community has 
broken down when the average Canadian thinks of youth 
crime''. At the time, I responded by saying that if the hon. 
member introduced this kind of motion, he must be convinced 
that young offenders were, both numerically and socially, a 
criminal group that was a severe threat to public safety.
<P>
	At the time I objected to this motion because it reflected the 
hysteria of a few agitators who were using some unfortunate 
aspects of recent cases for clearly political ends. On the same 
occasion, I asked the Minister of Justice not to give in to 
reactionary pressures within his own party.
<P>
	Today, we see that the bill introduced by the Minister of 
Justice is intended first of all as a concession to unruly members 
of his own party, who could easily be mistaken for members of 
the Reform Party. A repressive bill, because its only purpose is 
to repress, despite the high sounding principles contained in the 
amendments in the first clause.
<P>
	This kind of legislation would reflect a disturbing view of 
society, and I think what was said by the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby during the debate on May 12 was the 
most incredible and most disturbing embodiment of this view.
<P>
	If these comments had not been reproduced in <I>Hansard</I>, it 
would have been hard to believe that this was actually said in the 
Parliament of a country that is supposed to be the most 
democratic in the world. I would like to make a few general 
comments before discussing the merits or lack of merits of this 
bill.
<P>
	The attitude of these reactionaries tells us far more about their 
perception of the problem of juvenile delinquency than about 
the problem itself. Both Liberal and Reform Party members 
have only one thing to say about youth crime, and it is that the 
solution to the problem is in the penitentiary. I believe, and I am 
supported in that belief by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, 
that repressive legislation never achieves anything but 
repression.
<P>
	Using repression as a deterrent will never reduce the already 
low rate of youth crime. Does prison prevent adult crime? Why 
would it be more of a deterrent in the case of a young person who 
is less aware of the consequences of his acts?
<P>
	This bill sends a very positive message indeed to our young 
people. You are children and infants as far as civic duties go, but 
responsible adults before the Criminal Code. You do not have 
the right to vote or buy a house or open a business, because you 
are not responsible, but if you do not act like good citizens, you 
will go to jail, because you are responsible for your actions.
<P>
	This is very simply put, but I think we must use simple terms 
to explain to some people that the problem is not that simple, 
that it is not enough to throw a young person into prison to make 
him smarten up, that society will not be better protected if our 
prisons are filled with new inmates, and that being sentenced 
like adults will not deter young people from committing adult 
crimes.
<P>
	However, this is tantamount to asking that the legislation be 
dropped. Unfortunately, although the government means well, 
the bills sole purpose is to appease a faction of the public by 
sending young people over 16 to court for very serious crimes. 
This will surely reassure the fanatics and quiet them down for a 
few months, but this will not prevent criminally inclined gangs 
from continuing their activities. On the contrary!
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Here again, we see an adult model. Just as adult criminal 
elements resist police by organizing, we see juvenile criminal 
elements banding together to resist law enforcement. The 
message is clear: you are criminals, act like criminals and we 
will treat you like criminals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4876"> 4876 </A></B>
<P>
	I wholly subscribe to the words of Queen's University law 
professor Nicholas Bala, an expert in the area of young 
offenders, who was quoted in the <I>Toronto Star</I> of June 3 as 
saying that ``Whoever believes that our society will be better 
protected by this legislation is sadly mistaken''. The same 
article also quoted Dr. Clive Chamberlain, a Toronto 
psychiatrist who treated 65 young people who had committed 
murder. He was saying that the money would be better spent on 
family support than on amendments to the act.
<P>
	We could go on for hours quoting all the arguments against 
harsher treatment of young offenders, but they would not 
impress those who want an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
<P>
	I will conclude this long introduction by an observation. 
Several members, especially from the Reform Party, quote at 
length letters they received from constituents concerned about 
young offenders. I am starting to believe that the concerns of 
these citizens are directly related to the political activism of the 
extreme right. I see a direct relationship between the number of 
virulent letters we receive and the fact that the riding has elected 
a Reform Party member. Indeed, I did not receive a single letter 
from Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario or Manitoba, but I got 
boxes full from ridings in southern British Columbia and 
Alberta who, strangely enough, elected Reform Party members.
<P>
	I ask you: are people in Langley, Rosedale, Courtenay or 
Chilliwack really scared of young people? Do they consider 
young people like strangers you should be wary of? Are they 
hiding in the closet waiting for these barbarians, armed 
naturally since, by a strange coincidence, they are also opposed 
to arms control? Are young people in British Columbia and 
Alberta more dangerous than those in the east? What inspires 
such a frenzy against young people?
<P>
	I am convinced that citizens in both these provinces are just as 
well informed and democratically minded as people in the rest 
of the country. The scare campaign orchestrated by a few 
members from western Canada brings us a daily quota of 
stereotyped form letters, often mailed in bulk. None of them 
articulate a personal opinion. I would have liked one of those 
who signed them to send me a hand-written letter he would have 
composed and mailed himself. The Reform Party does not 
impress anyone with those tons of impersonal documents.
<P>
	Through its excess, this campaign shows its authors for what 
they really are. I hold Reform members responsible for the fear 
expressed by some of their constituents. It should not impress 
the minister nor the House. Even if I were to be harassed by such 
tactics till the end of my mandate, I will never depart from my 
principles.
<P>
	They are simple and can be summed up in one small sentence: 
Treat humans humanely. It is something I have never heard in all 
the emotional speeches given by the hardliners. Humanity, 
generosity, understanding. It is  indeed what the first clauses of 
the bill seem to promise. We are told with great pomp that the 
bill is preventive, that it will set up intervention mechanisms to 
address crime by young persons and that it is aimed at 
rehabilitating young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It is all talk, no action. Young persons are going to be 
rehabilitated in prison. It is in prison that intervention 
mechanisms will be set up. It is in prison that the underlying 
causes of crime by teenagers will be dealt with and that the 
framework for disciplinary action will be developed. And it is 
again in prison that young persons will learn that they are 
responsible for their crimes.
<P>
	We had not seen such an example of legislative deceit in a 
long time. Where are the provisions for implementing clause 1? 
How is the minister planning to follow through on this lofty 
statement of principle which sounds the death knell on all the 
efforts of these past 30 years?
<P>
	Clause 1 marks the end of the rehabilitation philosophy. It 
signs its death warrant, making sure that it will be bogged down 
in correctional red tape. It is a smokescreen.
<P>
	I will now deal with the major provisions of the bill, the ones 
the minister would quote if we were to ask him where is the 
beef? The major reform brought about by this preventative piece 
of legislation aimed at rehabilitating young offenders, is to 
automatically send them to adult court.
<P>
	Indeed, in spite of the consensus on this issue in Quebec 
which, incidently, administers a true youth protection act, in 
spite of all the valuable opinions provided to the minister to the 
effect that the legislation gives good results, is spite of all that, 
and because of the cries of a handful of activists, 16 and 
17-year-olds will be proceeded against in adult court for 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual 
assault and aggravated assault. In every case, the young person 
will have to convince the youth court that he should remain 
under its jurisdiction and not be referred to an adult court.
<P>
	This new legislation, which is primarily concerned with 
rehabilitation, provides that the maximum sentence will be 
lengthened to ten years for first degree murder, and to seven 
years for second degree murder. In the case of an accused over 
14 years of age, the court will have discretion to order that the 
young offender be referred to an adult court, except where a 
minor offence is involved.
<P>
	Several MPs will certainly point out that juvenile crime has 
been declining drastically since the initial amendments made to 
the former Young Offenders Act. Statistics compiled by the 
Department of Justice also tell us about the proportion of serious 
crimes committed by young people. You do not have to be an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4877"> 4877 </A></B>
<P>
expert to figure out that most offences against a person involve 
16 and 17-year-olds. Social conditions, personality changes, 
the  existence of gangs and leaving the family home explain, to a 
large degree, this unavoidable and normal result.
<P>
	Babies do not commit murders. Children do, exceptionally, 
and young teenagers, rarely. By the age of 16 or 17, young 
people are closer to the adult model. It is therefore unavoidable 
that this group will commit somewhat similar offences. People 
keep referring to the murder committed by two 10-year-olds in 
Great Britain, but this tragic incident must not make us forget 
that childhood is the universal age of innocence and that when 
children do something wrong, it is invariably the reflection of 
something done by an adult. Close to 54 per cent of crimes 
against a person are said to be committed by 16 and 
17-year-olds.
<P>
	I also noted that the group just before that one, namely the 14 
and 15-year-olds, accounted for 36 per cent of those crimes. In 
other words, 90 per cent of offences for which the legislation 
seems to provide diversion mechanisms are, or could be, dealt 
with by a common law court.
<P>
	Why does the minister not simply repeal the act? At the rate 
things are going, the legislation will only apply to 12 and 
13-year-olds, unless the minister implements the brilliant 
proposal by the Reform Party and lowers the age for criminal 
liability to ten years of age. In fact, why not bring it down to 
seven? Is that not the age of reason?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	This bill reinforces the transfer procedure to the judicial 
system. Even though the minister announced that he would not 
force any of his provincial counterparts to go along, he is 
obviously helping those who favour harsher justice. The 
minister can rest assured, because he probably will not have to 
force any of the ministers, since his bill gives them all the 
leeway they need to give stricter instructions to their Crown 
attorneys.
<P>
	Nonetheless, I can only hope that if this bill ever passes, 
Quebec will continue to render justice in youth courts and to 
pursue its rehabilitation objectives rather than steer a course 
toward repression, all means of which are warranted under this 
bill. It is not surprising that the headline on page one of the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> last June 3 read that rehabilitation would lose 
priority if the bill was adopted as is.
<P>
	Those who are familiar with the system know that requests for 
transfers to adult courts are not always simple. They often 
correspond to proceedings within proceedings with all parties 
having their witnesses and experts appear. Hard line supporters 
should attend such hearings at least once in their life. Up to now, 
transfer requests were only treated in youth courts by Crown 
attorneys, with whom the burden of proof rested.
<P>
	Imagine what the new procedure introduced by the minister 
will be: young persons charged with a serious offence will have 
to prove that they should be tried in youth court. Every 
procedural tactic and constitutional argument will be used, 
including interlocutory appeals up to the Supreme Court. These 
motions will be similar to extradition proceedings. It is going to 
be a waste of energy and public funds, and through it all, young 
persons will learn how to foil the system and scoff at the law.
<P>
	I totally agree with William Trudel, Toronto vice-president of 
the Criminal Lawyers Association, whose views are widely 
shared by the legal profession. He warned the minister that this 
new referral procedure will be very costly and very contentious. 
It will first be challenged under what will seem like 
well-founded constitutional arguments.
<P>
	Besides, who in the Liberal Party is responsible for 
constitutional issues? I am not talking here about division of 
powers, an issue far from settled, but about fundamental rights 
enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The minister 
does not ignore the fact that excluding 16 and 17-year-olds from 
the universal system is obviously a discriminatory measure. In 
fact, since the Young Offenders Act includes all young persons 
under 18 years of age and over 12 years of age, who would argue, 
based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that 
such an obvious exclusion is fair and reasonable?
<P>
	If all young Canadians are protected by the YOA, they should 
all be treated the same way, on a equal basis, whatever the public 
opinion is. In fact, constitutional texts all aim at protecting 
individuals against public condemnation, restoring and 
maintaining equality among all men and women and ensuring 
fair judicial proceedings. I repeat, this bill respects neither the 
spirit of the Young Offenders Act nor the guiding principles of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	This reform would make two categories of young people for 
some offences, whereas all young people are included in the 
definitions of the Act. This is age-based discrimination. If this 
House passed this discriminatory bill anyway, I predict and I 
hope that the courts will strike down the justice minister's new 
law because youth courts and appeal courts will certainly have 
to deal with this kind of case if and when the proposed 
amendments take effect.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Not only does this bill remain strangely silent on the fine 
principles but, although intended to protect society, it will 
achieve exactly the opposite result.
<P>
	By seeking to repress, the minister is putting in place 
mechanisms which are bound to make the law itself challenged. 
Rehabilitation will no longer be a goal; social reintegration is 
now only a remote objective. The key word now is protection of 
society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4878"> 4878 </A></B>
<P>
	I say that the essence and the very reason for the law have 
been set aside. Moreover, by seeking the maximum deterrent 
effect through repression, the means to act and the courts' 
authority are being reduced.
<P>
	A law is not just a piece of legislation in a collection of 
statutes. It must be applied and people have to live with it, so we 
must think of its impact on society. I say that it will be a social 
disaster.
<P>
	Just as much as the minister, I am revolted by violence, but 
not only youth violence. Do we hear those fanatics from the 
West who demand internment for ten year old children complain 
about the non-stop violence on television? Will the Liberal 
Party table a bill to control these programs broadcast to young 
people? These same reactionaries flood us with letters 
denouncing gun control. Reform members and the Liberal 
Party's right wing should do some serious soul searching.
<P>
	One of the reasons why our society generates violence is the 
lack of effective control over firearms, which are the weapon of 
choice for murderers of all ages including young people.
<P>
	Yes, I am outraged, as outraged as these reactionaries, by 
murder. I am revolted by sexual assault. I am outraged and 
disgusted by the decline in morality in our society as a whole. 
And I am outraged when I see that these murders are committed 
with firearms that the right-thinking members of the Reform 
Party and the Liberal Party would like to see circulate without 
restrictions. But my outrage is not like that of the pharisees who 
single out young people to assuage their own guilt because they 
feel powerless to educate our youth.
<P>
	Social violence does not come from young people but it is 
picked up by some of them. Newspapers put isolated cases on 
their front pages to sell more copies. How do they invariably 
report on cases involving young people? By denouncing the 
sentences given out and fuelling the spirit of vengeance and 
powerlessness. This spirit of vengeance is the symptom of a 
disease which undermines our Western society, a society that 
generates its own violence like an internal combustion engine. 
This violence tears at the social fabric and isolates the young 
people who are its first victims. This violence that we show and 
maintain as a favoured way of affirming success, we pass it on to 
these children and we then act outraged when one of them 
commits a murder, as though we as adults should have a 
monopoly on evil and stupidity.
<P>
	We are transferring our feeling of guilt. We refuse to accept 
that a person who cannot yet be seen as responsible can be tried 
for a crime in the same way as someone who ought to be 
considered a responsible person. This instinctive, irrational and 
primary reaction is triggered by the notion of vengeance, 
something which is foreign to Canadian democracy.
<P>
	Ten years ago, a reform of the whole process was undertaken 
after countless public consultations. Since then, in those 
provinces where the law is well understood and implemented 
adequately, juvenile delinquency is controlled in a modern, 
effective and humanistic way.
<P>
	In 1984, we chose to deal with the problem by putting in place 
a rehabilitation process rather than leaving young offenders 
stuck in the dead end of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Juvenile delinquency certainly does exist. The law is not 
designed to prevent it but to control it. Social conflicts will exist 
as long as we live as a society.
<P>
	Crime is the expression of social conflict at the level of the 
individual. Whether the delinquent is an adult or a minor, he 
must face the justice system when he violates the social peace 
code. There is social conflict when an act committed by an 
individual disturbs social peace. Delinquency and crime will 
always exist because they are social phenomena. Criminal laws 
do not make criminality.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Hardliners think that juvenile delinquency exists because of 
our Young Offenders Act. In their narrow view, they see a cause 
and effect relation between the cold blooded murder of a corner 
store owner and the fact that no criminal liability is put on the 
young murderer. For them, everything is simple. If a young 
person becomes or remains a delinquent, it is because he is not 
subjected to the Criminal Code provisions. Based on this view of 
the past, young people would be better citizens if sentences were 
harsher.
<P>
	They still do not understand that the Young Offenders Act did 
not invent juvenile delinquency. They fail to see that young 
people are more violent because society as a whole has become 
more violent. They do not realize that despite the existence of 
the Criminal Code, in Canada about 500 murders are committed 
by adults in Canada every year. These murders are just as 
intolerable as those committed by young people.
<P>
	Reform Party members, whether they are in Liberal disguise 
or wear the true colours of the Reform Party, may not have 
realized that the 1984 legislation was a considerable change 
from the previous legislation on young offenders that had been 
in effect since the beginning of the century.
<P>
	Contrary to what they say in their speeches which smack of 
disinformation, the present legislation treats the young person 
who commits an offence as a responsible human being, but 
always within a special framework set up to provide for his 
rehabilitation
<P>
	In 1984, Canadian society had become sufficiently mature to 
realize that a young person who committed a first offence, even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4879"> 4879 </A></B>
<P>
a very serious offence, must be given every opportunity to 
understand the consequences of his actions and to rehabilitate 
himself.
<P>
	Unlike the system for adults, who are assumed to be 
responsible, the young person needs to develop within a 
supervisory framework. That was the view in 1984. They were 
right then and the same approach is still taken by all sectors 
responsible for dealing with this problem. However, it is not the 
position taken by the extremists and reactionaries who have 
managed to enlist the Minister of Justice for their crusade.
<P>
	In any case, experience has shown that in Ontario and Quebec, 
the system works very well. Perhaps the provinces where the 
hysteria about the subject is greatest have yet to introduce 
effective mechanisms.
<P>
	I would urge hon. members from the Prairie provinces and 
British Columbia to take a look at the youth protection agencies 
and youth courts in their provinces and find out whether they 
have this kind of institution which is indispensable to the proper 
application of the legislation. Maybe they should start 
campaigning in their own backyard. Perhaps they should send 
the protest letters they receive in such numbers to the members 
of their provincial legislatures.
<P>
	By the way, I think that what was said by the Quebec and 
Ontario ministers about this legislation is a good indication of 
how it will be received in Quebec City and Queen's Park. A very 
conclusive experiment was conducted in Quebec at the Centre 
Boscoville, covering the rehabilitation and social integration of 
24 teenagers who had been found guilty of homicide and were 
admitted to this reform institution between 1968 and 1983. I 
repeat that Quebec is probably the province where the 
application of the Young Offenders Act has been most 
comprehensive.
<P>
	I also repeat that western reactionaries would do well to look 
at the Quebec experience. Maybe they would, then, stop seeing 
young people are strangers that you should be wary of, as the 
hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby was saying. He 
seems to have forgotten that he was young once.
<P>
	The study conducted in Boscoville demonstrated that all these 
young people had a good prognosis, that there had been no 
subsequent offence, nor any return to delinquent behaviour. The 
murders had circumstantial and neurotic causes. Moreover, the 
follow-up of these young offenders showed a perfect social 
rehabilitation, some having very good positions in society.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	A document from the research branch of the Library of 
Parliament dealing with the impact of repressive measures 
concluded: ``Increasing the capacity to punish by passing 
harsher legal sanctions could lead to longer prison terms for a 
larger number of young offenders''.
<P>
	``The advantage for society, in the short term, is that it would 
be protected from the offender. However, this solution would 
further strain the already insufficient resources affected to 
detention and rehabilitation infrastructures-and assumes a 
greater criminalization, without reducing the crime rate''.
<P>
	Some members in this House see young people as the enemy. 
Whether they express a personal opinion or are echoing the fear 
of some of their constituents, the message they send to young 
people is vindictive.
<P>
	I reread the speech that the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby made in this House on May 12 of this 
year. I hope that we will never again hear, in Parliament, such a 
war cry against young people. I would like Parliament to 
repudiate this desire to set up a police state.
<P>
	Our attitude towards juvenile delinquency will reflect our 
democratic commitment. I call upon the conscience of every 
member. I urge everyone, irrespective of their political 
affiliation, not already committed to a more repressive attitude 
towards young people, to consider seriously, from the bottom of 
their hearts, what we are debating today.
<P>
	I am convinced that on the government side, there are 
members who will not take an active part in this debate, but who 
are torn between their party line and their own sense of social 
justice. I am asking them to counterbalance the action of their 
colleagues who are vigorously campaigning in favour of the 
hardening of the legislation and demand a more in-depth 
reflection on juvenile delinquency.
<P>
	I have already quoted various statistics during previous 
debates, and I do not want to bring any more numerical data to 
the debate. Statistics only explain the past. Even if they can be 
used to show trends, they can only reflect outdated situations.
<P>
	At the risk of having to quote numbers regarding the past few 
years, I will talk briefly about that period when crime by young 
people went down. The experience in Quebec proves beyond any 
doubt that the system is working. I am not saying that it works 
perfectly. Do criminal courts work perfectly?
<P>
	The system is working to the general satisfaction of all parties 
involved, starting with those in the judiciary, who all say not to 
change anything for the time being. Why is the Minister of 
Justice not listening to those who deal with this problem on a 
daily basis? Because he lets people tell him what to do, because 
he was unable to convince the cabinet and members of his party 
that nothing would justify such a drastic switch towards 
repression.
<P>
	Because the minister, whose extreme competence and honesty 
I deeply respect, is being unwillingly caught up in a popularity 
contest. The Liberals are dragging behind Reform Party 
activists. The Liberals are being told what to do by Reform Party 
supporters. The minister has no other choice. Between those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4880"> 4880 </A></B>
<P>
who are calmly telling him  that the system is working and those 
who are crying wolf, he chose the latter.
<P>
	Unfortunately in so doing he is promoting a repressive piece 
of legislation, divorced from the reality and the underlying 
causes of crime by young people, to quote clause 1 and its 
meaningless wording. Now that the minister has thrown a bone 
to silence those who were barking the loudest, how is he going to 
put some balance back into the administration of the law?
<P>
	Let us not be naive. Even if the minister is promising a review 
in committee, his bill is complete. Unfortunately, we will wait in 
vain for intervention mechanisms dealing with young people 
identified as redeemable, which would counterbalance the 
harshness of these repressive amendments.
<P>
	Since 16 and 17 year old young offenders committing serious 
crimes must now prove to the judge why they should remain 
before the youth court, there should be provisions in the act for 
the implementation of some solid care and rehabilitation 
structures. In other words, in such instances, the judge receiving 
a request for the maintaining of the jurisdiction could consider 
that the youth court offers good corrective measures that would 
achieve results at least equivalent to those promoted by this bill 
which proposes transfer to a criminal court.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The judge could then consider that the law provides for 
treatment by the youth court to be just as efficient as any 
treatment by an ordinary court. There is no doubt that the burden 
of proof will be considerable for young people if the bill is 
passed as it is worded now. All cases will be transferred to adult 
court except when exceptional circumstances justify otherwise. 
And as if this was not enough, the minister adds to it. Young 
people will be subject to the rules of the Identification of 
Criminals Act. Their records will be kept for longer periods and 
information on young offenders will no longer be confidential.
<P>
	In other words, according to clause 29 of the bill, any young 
person can now be fingerprinted. Except in certain cases, the 
young persons' records would be considered the same as any 
other court or criminal records and, in spite of the limits 
proposed in the bill, anybody could consult them at any time, in 
the public interest. Where is the minister going?
<P>
	A bill aiming at reintegration into society, rehabilitation and 
identification of the underlying causes of juvenile criminality? 
That is all bluff. Where is the minister heading? We now know 
where he is heading; I do not think he believes in the values 
which inspired the 1984 reform. I do not feel he is seriously 
proposing that rehabilitation be the fundamental principle.
<P>
	While at present the support workers are all professionals, 
tomorrow, they will be members of the police forces.
<P>
	To my knowledge, police officers do not have any kind of 
mandate to rehabilitate accused persons. The only message to be 
derived from this bill is that there will be more young people in 
federal penitentiaries, not less youth crime, more young inmates 
among the prison population, more young people learning how 
to become lifelong criminals. Having read and reread this bill, I 
can see no other message.
<P>
	If this were question period, I would ask the Solicitor General 
how much more the Liberal Party expects to spend on the 
incarceration of young people in federal penitentiaries.
<P>
	Bill C-37 amounts to nothing more than sentencing young 
people to prison. Those who had been loudly demanding such 
action are congratulating the Minister of Justice. He has just 
scored a lot of political points by currying favour with this 
radical faction.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois are mindful of the serious problem 
associated with violence that is not only committed by young 
people, but is also inflicted upon them. We refuse to push the 
panic button and we invite all those who are interested to 
consider our experience in Quebec. We call upon this House to 
give the existing legislation some more time and to listen to 
those working in the system who all agree that the status quo 
should be maintained for the time being.
<P>
	The existing legislation strikes a difficult balance between the 
need to protect society and the need to rehabilitate young 
offenders without turning them into criminals, between the need 
to prevent crime and the need to spare young offenders from a 
life of crime.
<P>
	I intend to vote against this bill which seeks to make crime 
punishable by making criminals out of young people.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to move, seconded by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Abitibi:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the

Transcona-Tobacco packaging; the hon. member for

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-37 and respond to the long awaited changes to the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act in its operation is critical to 
Canada's view of the justice system. Its implementation touches 
at the very heart of the future of our society. Freedom from fear 
ranks with food and shelter as one of our basic needs. Our 
communities today are crying out in their fear for the safety of 
innocent people walking in our neighbourhoods. They are 
deeply concerned for the safety of their children in playgrounds 
and schools, even in their homes. Every week we hear another 
horror story involving young offenders and violent crime.
<P>
	Ottawa police arrested young offenders after the drive-by 
shooting death of Nicholas Battersby.
<P>
	Three young offenders in St. Jerome, Quebec, were arrested 
after a shooting spree. They were in possession of rifles, 
handguns and hand grenades.
<P>
	In British Columbia, Jason Gamache was found guilty in 1992 
of rape and murder of a six-year old girl. When she was reported 
missing Gamache aided in the search for her and spent hours 
babysitting her siblings. Gamache was just 16 years old when he 
committed this offence and had been previously convicted of 
sex offences involving young children. The public had no way of 
knowing. The Young Offenders Act prohibits publication of 
details which might identify such an offender.
<P>
	Just over a month ago an Edmonton woman was stabbed in her 
home by teenage burglars while trying to protect her children. A 
few weeks ago a 14-year old was stabbed with a pair of scissors 
in the hands of a 10-year old boy during a soccer game at 
Medicine Hat, Alberta.
<P>
	In a small town near Kelowna, B.C., a 44-year old family man 
is recovering in hospital after being hit on the head with an axe. 
Two 16-year-olds have been charged.
<P>
	A 72-year old man was murdered outside his home in 
Saskatchewan by a young offender. The sentence: the maximum, 
three years in custody.
<P>
	In Edmonton last month a teenager was shot in the back of the 
head with a stolen handgun. The alleged killer is a 16-year old 
repeat offender who was on probation for another crime.
<P>
	In 1992 a man had his car totally demolished by six young 
offenders. The penalty for this group: none. They were let off 
scot-free.
<P>
	Two weeks ago the father of a 10-year old girl was out for a 
walk in his own neighbourhood in suburban Mississauga when 
he was viciously beaten to death by young offenders. The 
motivation: a robbery attempt.
<P>
	As we struggle with social programs to address the causes of 
our youth turning to crimes such as alienation, family 
breakdown, and drug and alcohol abuse, we must also address 
the effect youth crime has on our families in our communities. 
By failing to take bold action to correct what has largely not 
worked and introducing legislation just to mollify a restless 
public and fulfil an election promise with the call of trust us, the 
government has fallen short and let us down despite its well 
intentioned effort.
<P>
	The Liberal red book speaks of safe homes and safe streets as 
a basic right and a distinguishing characteristic of Canadian 
society, while pledging to combat the 40 per cent increase in 
violent crime that has crept in to threaten that basic right.
<P>
	The proposals brought forward in the bill are woefully 
inadequate to reverse the current trend I have mentioned. 
Tinkering with the internal mechanisms of the act does not rally 
community confidence. Nor does it reflect an attentiveness to 
community concern. It is merely a top down, we know best 
answer to an increasingly aware and justifiably demanding 
populace.
<P>
	It is said that the proposed amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act will improve public protection by improving the 
act's ability to deal effectively with serious crime.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I have heard the government's side today. We in this corner of 
the House take government members as sincere. However it is 
possible to be sincere but sincerely wrong. I applaud the 
government that the bill today is not going to be the last word on 
amendments to the act during this Parliament. The two stage 
approach offered by the government is indeed welcome.
<P>
	I have said a lot in the House about the shortcomings of the 
Young Offenders Act. I have made very specific and pointed 
suggestions both on paper to the justice ministry and in a speech 
in the House. One wonders if anyone ever listens. Certainly folk 
at home wonder if the government does any adjusting at all to 
public grassroots input as distinct from the bilateral 
negotiations with the provinces and those on the inside of the 
justice system community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4882"> 4882 </A></B>
<P>
	We will constructively criticize the many shortcomings of 
Bill C-37. However we are thankful the government is finally 
prepared to change some parts of the Young Offenders Act, 
largely in response to the pressure that we in this corner of the 
House have brought. We will be Her Majesty's loyal, 
constructive alternative with advocacy for improvements to Bill 
C-37 based on what the community wants rather than merely on 
what Reformers want.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is full of problems, but we will likely support any 
small measure to shift the emphasis within the juvenile justice 
system away from its reputation of being too soft. A new Young 
Offenders Act must be socially resonant and clearly 
demonstrate Canadian society's values and Canadian mores. It 
must be an instrument not only of rehabilitation and treatment 
but also of deterrence and orderly denunciation.
<P>
	The criminal justice system must be a mirror reflecting the 
community's sense of what is right and wrong and what is 
socially acceptable. People are looking today at an image that is 
distorted, that has little relevance to the social order we have 
that may have formerly existed.
<P>
	Parents are concerned for the safety of their children. They 
are demanding an accountability of the justice system to the 
community. They want to have a sense of ownership in the 
process of justice. They are frustrated and angry that the current 
system seems to operate for and around a select enclave of 
justice professionals: the criminologists, the legal community, 
corrections workers, offender care agencies and the police.
<P>
	Offenders seem to be the ones protected by legislation and are 
the preoccupation of the system. Victims, particularly victims 
of violent crime, do not feel well served. They have little 
opportunity to represent a public denunciation of violent crime. 
There is no legal recognition for their stake in the general 
proceedings.
<P>
	The YOA does not require statutory service of proceedings to 
victims for court appearances. A whole new community 
accountability model of justice is required to address the needs 
of public concern and involvement. The public at large can also 
be a victim as the publication of names in critical and violent 
and repeat offences is not routine. The violent young offender 
can be released to offend again with no assurance of safety and 
the public has no way of knowing the person is in their midst.
<P>
	Particular concern is expressed by teachers and social 
workers who traditionally had no access to a dangerous 
offender's history. It is pathetically futile for a teacher to 
reprimand a student and order a detention for bad behaviour in 
the classroom when the student has been involved in the latest 
convenience store robbery or is living in a local group home 
because he has committed sexual assault. It shortchanges not 
only the teacher and the other students in the classroom but also 
the young offender.
<P>
	There are many programs in the educational system tailored 
to deal with problems the students are encountering, but the lack 
of vital information about a student precludes the opportunity 
for that student to reap the benefit of those very programs.
<P>
	Social workers who are called to work with the young person 
have no way of knowing the full character of the young offender 
they are supposed to help. It is somewhat like asking a gourmet 
chef to prepare a meal and supplying only unmarked packages 
for the ingredients. It is a little recipe for disaster. Yet we spend 
millions of dollars on social programs and provide workers who 
are uninformed and ill equipped for what they face.
<P>
	The new half-measures place a monitoring burden perhaps 
solely on the youth worker for in systems advisory, another 
bureaucratic nightmare. The whole business of non-disclosure 
is an abstract premise at best based on a hypothetical, on a hoped 
for future reformation of the offender.
<P>
	The government recognizes the problem, for victims have 
died directly because of the non-disclosure provisions of the 
YOA. Now we are going to open it up a little. How many 
bureaucratic screw-ups will have to occur before it must be 
recognized all non-disclosure provisions that go beyond the 
adult standard of control should be scrapped. The government 
admits the problem. Let us deal with it square on.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The judiciary is also faced with a dilemma when resulting 
from non-disclosure of records in adult courts. Once a young 
offender has served the prescribed sentence for a serious offence 
and then five years more has elapsed, youth records are no 
longer admissible in court. This provision is based on the belief, 
or should I say the hope, that a run-in with the courts will 
motivate a young offender to rehabilitate and have a chance to 
contribute to society without the fear of his young foolish 
mistake unreasonably standing in his way.
<P>
	Nine pages of this bill relate to amendments around a faulty 
premise. I say clearly to the minister let go of these outdated 
notions and stop the tangled bureaucratic response. One line in 
the act would suffice that would simply state that a youth court 
record and an adult criminal record are one and the same, a 
continuum to be kept in one computer, handled like all criminal 
records. The bill requires the RCMP to have a separate 
repository for youth records.
<P>
	All these provisions are social engineering at its worst.
<P>
	Take for instance the case of a convicted paedophile. If he 
manages to escape detection for five years and then offends 
again, the judge in adult court is not allowed to hear the pattern 
of record and he is bound by stare decisis of the courts of appeal 
to sentence as a first offender. The judgment is based on 
inaccurate information and the offender is treated accordingly 
and truth does not appear in the courtroom as the judge is 
deliberately misled. If a lawyer deliberately misled in the  court 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4883"> 4883 </A></B>
<P>
it would be contempt. This is repeated countless times in 
countless courtrooms across our land, and the government 
would have us believe it is seriously responding to the 
submissions and correspondence it has received from Canadians 
in recent months.
<P>
	Society sees violent crime as an abhorrence needing 
retribution and a sensible social defence response. If a violent 
offender of 16 or 17 years of age is kept within the bounds of the 
Young Offenders Act the maximum penalty available for first 
degree murder would be 10 years. If that same violent offender 
were dealt with in adult court, the penalty for first degree 
murder would be life imprisonment with no parole for 25 years.
<P>
	While 10 years under the new proposal would seem to be 
sufficiently harsh, the reality is that probably only six years 
would be spent in detention, with the remaining four years being 
spent under community supervision. How tragically painful for 
the families of the victim and perhaps how dangerous for the 
community. It is blatantly obvious that this provision is written 
for the protection of the offender, and a violent one at that, with 
disregard to the rights or protection of the victims, past and 
future.
<P>
	Anyone capable of committing a premeditated murder at 16 or 
17 years of age must surely be accountable to society at a level 
commensurate with the severity of the crime. I choose to 
highlight the charge of first degree murder as that is as severe as 
it gets in Canadian law. This does not even begin to touch less 
serious crimes, which in reality seem no less serious to the 
victim. I say this clause does not appropriately respond to these 
offenders. These criminals are not young offenders; they are 
youthful appearing adults and should be treated as such.
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum there are youngsters 10 and 
11 years old who are flexing their muscles and daring society to 
take them to task. Under the provisions of Bill C-37 they remain 
untouchable. By the time they are 12 years old they are street 
wise and are becoming increasingly sophisticated in testing the 
system. When they finally appear as young offenders they are 
often already beyond being intimidated by the system and the 
successive warnings and breaks they receive as young offenders 
become meaningless. They are often too deeply entrenched in 
the game to see or desire a way out.
<P>
	I believe that 10 and 11-year olds, if brought under the 
umbrella of the justice system, publicly denounced and placed 
in programs of education and rehabilitation, would be much 
more responsive to efforts to set them straight.
<P>
	Sometimes violent patterns in children are identifiable at the 
kindergarten level. Schools and social helping agencies 
respond, but by the time these exceptional children are 12 years 
of age, a justice system response of monitoring and intervention 
is problematic. By identifying these young offenders before 
they graduate into the teen world of crime set before them, we 
drastically reduce the number of youthful adults we are  forced 
to deal with six years down the road. This is social engineering 
at its best.
<P>
	Statistics indicate that of the 42 murder cases heard by youth 
courts in 1992-93, 25 cases or 60 per cent involved 16 and 
17-year olds. That means a full 40 per cent of the cases involved 
children 15 and under. Of the 74 cases of attempted murder, 39 
per cent were 15 and under. Manslaughter saw an even split of 50 
per cent. For aggravated assault, some 311 cases or 32 per cent 
were 15 years old and under.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	These are astounding figures in themselves, but consider the 
burden placed on the youth court system and the correctional 
facilities. It has been argued that 16 and 17-year-olds should 
not be placed in full adult prisons, a position we endorse. There 
is ample flexibility within the correctional system to 
accommodate the youthful adults who would be sentenced in 
adult court.
<P>
	It is imperative that 16 and 17-year old violent offenders be 
removed from the environment in which true young offenders 
are housed. The younger we are able to begin the process of 
education and rehabilitation, the greater chances of success. 
Seeing negative role models who are 16 and 17-year olds who 
can exert tremendous power over the younger population 
decreases the chances of positive redirection.
<P>
	Teens themselves are frustrated and concerned about how 
they are perceived within our society. There are so many young 
people who are really trying to make a positive contribution to 
their world. They see themselves as victims within the youth 
culture. They are in fact victims of the violence which is so 
prevalent in the high schools.
<P>
	Inner city schools have gang wars between ethnic groups, 
punkers, skinheads and others of diverse styles and attitudes as 
well as drug dealers. These differences erupt in fighting over 
territories and are typified by aggression using weapons. It is 
easy to say that the problems of the schools are provincial 
jurisdiction, but if there is little accountability for violence 
under the law the schools have little recourse.
<P>
	Teens often feel that society blames them for all its problems 
and they feel condemnation for just being young. At a recent 
high school meeting of 40 young people, my colleague, the 
member for North Vancouver, addressed the issue of the Young 
Offenders Act. Thirty-nine of the 40 students raised their hands 
to appeal for changes to the act. Locally about 250 students 
participated in a march through downtown Hull to protest the 
violence of a schoolmate's death. Melanie Moore was quoted as 
saying: ``We just want all this violence to stop''. Student Renée 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4884"> 4884 </A></B>
<P>
Moreau feels that the accused should be tried in adult court as 
``at that age he is conscious of what he has done''.
<P>
	These young people are tired of being painted with the same 
brush as those who are doing the offending. They are fed up with 
losing close friends to violence. They are sending a very clear 
message to us in this House that they demand change.
<P>
	We have received correspondence from parents who are 
terrified to send even young children to school because of 
threats from older students, typically 10 to 12-year-olds. They 
would bully, set up vigilante parties and generally make it 
impossible for their targets to function in the classroom, 
hallways or schoolyard. The assault is often so subtle that it is 
many months before parents or teachers are aware there is 
anything wrong. By definition these bullies are young offenders 
and should be held accountable.
<P>
	One failing of the age parameters corresponds directly to the 
situations I have just outlined. The police are very reluctant to 
become involved in answering calls involving children under 12 
years. The result is that the schools and parents are left to deal 
with such behaviour with little community resources available 
to them. The offenders are therefore left to wreak havoc until 
their 12th birthday, when they are often firmly entrenched in 
antisocial behaviour.
<P>
	Parents cry for help but receive little satisfaction. The case of 
Michael Smith has been mentioned in this House before. He is 
the 11-year old who has stolen over 30 cars and stands defiantly 
dedicated to continue to do so until he turns 12. Michael is quite 
literally an accident going somewhere to happen as he careens 
through the streets of the Vancouver area. His mother has 
publicly denounced his behaviour in the press identifying him 
and his actions but authorities are powerless to help her. More 
tragically, our system is unable to help Michael. He is 
desperately crying out for limits to be set and under the Young 
Offenders Act and now under Bill C-37 we stand unable to 
provide those limits. He is not a young offender by definition.
<P>
	The Liberals speak so eloquently that the causes of violent 
crime are patent, and they are poverty, and they are 
dysfunctional families, and they are abusive children and it is 
hopelessness. I am sure Bonnie Hartwick, Michael's mother, is 
not pleased that the minister has so glibly packaged and labelled 
her life in one line of rhetoric. That her pleas are falling on deaf 
ears is ample proof that this government really has no clue about 
the reality of ordinary people's lives. I suggest that the 
hopelessness she feels is a direct result of the age limits the 
minister is unwilling to change.
<P>
	The minister announced highlights of the bill which merit a 
focused response even at second reading. Increased sentences 
for teenagers convicted of first and second degree murder in 
youth court are increased to ten and seven years respectively 
from the former five years maximum.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	In reality for first degree murder within the maximum 
10-year total sentence Bill C-37 provides six years of custody 
followed by four years of community supervision. Only by 
exception after a hearing can a judge choose at the automatic 
annual court reviews of custody sentences that an offender can 
be kept in custody another year rather than receive community 
supervision. It can only be done if the offender if released is 
likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm. The 
maximum, no minimum stated, combination sentence of jail and 
community supervision is 10 years for the individual murder 
offence. Second degree murder brings a maximum seven years, 
a four and three combination.
<P>
	There is enough inherent discretion and flexibility in the adult 
system for individual circumstances to be taken into account for 
the adult consequences to generally apply to youths 16 years and 
over. The age of operation of the YOA remains unchanged at 12 
to 17 inclusive under Bill C-37, rather than to the desired 10 to 
15 inclusive.
<P>
	An adult convicted of first degree murder is liable to jail for 
life without eligibility for parole for 25 years, section 742(a) of 
the Criminal Code, but may apply for judicial review of the 
period of ineligibility after 15 years, section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. A person convicted of second degree murder is liable to 
jail for life without eligibility for parole for a period between 10 
and 25 years, section 742(b) of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-37 expands the consequences for murder within the 
Young Offenders Act. Therefore, by this greater accommodation 
it will be less likely that youth murderers will be transferred to 
adult court. The result may bring about a softening of the law as 
more murderers will remain under the Young Offenders Act and 
then be released earlier instead of being transferred to the adult 
court under the former provisions.
<P>
	The bill highlight also mentions that 16 and 17-year-olds 
charged with serious personal injury offences can be transferred 
to adult court unless they can show a judge that public protection 
and rehabilitation can both be achieved through youth court. For 
this new category the onus is on the offender to demonstrate. 
Previously it was the crown which had the onus to demonstrate, 
as it still does on all other transfers to adult court applications.
<P>
	Currently a young offender must be 14 years old to be eligible 
for transfer to adult court and must have committed an 
indictable offence, section 16 of the YOA. Bill C-37 
additionally says that those 16 and 17-year-olds who commit 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual 
assault and aggravated assault will have the onus on them to 
show they should not be transferred.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4885"> 4885 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will not admit the basic flaw of the YOA, as 
all youths 16 and 17 years should be judged in adult court. There 
will likely be many more transfer hearings under C-37 which 
are expensive, full trials used to determine where the real trial 
will be heard.
<P>
	The Reform alternative would retain transfers but they should 
be available for any youth charged with an indictable offence. 
However, the threshold of appropriate circumstances, section 
16(1.1) for transfers is quite high from the precedence of the 
case law. The likelihood of inappropriate transfers to adult court 
is very remote under the Reform alternative. They would be 
used only rarely if all 16 and 17-year old youth were already in 
adult court.
<P>
	C-37 extends the time that offenders 16 and 17 years old at the 
time of offence who have been convicted of murder in adult 
court must serve before they can be considered for parole. 
Parole eligibility currently is five to 10 years, section 742(1) of 
the Criminal Code. C-37 makes it 10 years for first degree 
murder and seven years for second degree murder. The minister 
announces this provision as a highlight. In view of the public's 
lack of confidence in the national parole board this is a minor 
change that cannot be considered as a provision ``that would 
crack down''-from the justice news release of June 7.
<P>
	First degree murder, the most heinous category, planned and 
deliberate, should be applied the same for all in adult court: no 
parole eligibility for 25 years, the fair exchange for removing 
the death penalty.
<P>
	Next is proposed that there are improved measures for 
information sharing between professionals such as school 
officials and police and selected members of the public when the 
public's safety is at risk, as well as retaining the records of 
serious young offenders longer. This is a tangled provision but 
hopefully it does loosen things up so that a province can 
designate social workers and school authorities to be given 
confidential information about offenders they have dealings 
with.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	The basic non-disclosure aspects of the YOA unfortunately 
remain. The misguided blanket media publication ban remains 
concerning identifying an offender even though the operations 
of local young offender courts are open to the public.
<P>
	The argument that the media will sensationalize does not hold 
and there would be no difference in operation from the adult 
system. Only the high profile and socially significant cases will 
be published, as they should.
<P>
	Media publication of court operations is fundamental to the 
effectiveness of general deterrence as well as developing public 
confidence in the justice system.
<P>
	The media restrictions for youth court should be the same as 
adult court. Any half measure qualification of non-disclosure 
for youth court is unacceptable.
<P>
	The government defends C-37 under the United Nations 
standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile 
justice, the Beijing rules: a child is someone under 18 years; in 
courts the best interest of the child should be a primary 
consideration. Current Bill C-254 refers to these measures. It 
suggests children should not become soldiers under 16 years, 
and yet they are still to be treated as children until 18 years? It 
also suggests that in courts the best interest of the child should 
be paramount but does not address the balance for the offenders' 
victims.
<P>
	The government is making a most stretched argument to 
defend the YOA by invoking the United Nations thereby telling 
Canadians what its standards should be rather than submitting to 
community judgment on the results the system delivers.
<P>
	The YOA applies to the wrong set of youth. The complicated 
provisions arise largely because of the misapplied age of 
operation. Young offenders should be dealt with more 
compassionately and separately from adults based on the theory 
of diminished capacity to formulate intent, mens rea, guilty 
mind, and to fully appreciate future outcomes.
<P>
	Separation also addresses the contamination theory from 
older hardened criminals in adult institutions. Privacy 
provisions also rest on the clean slate, fresh start theory in the 
hope that young offenders can be rehabilitated.
<P>
	There is no evidence that the complicated system that has 
been developed to address these ideas is needed. It is not much 
more than an abstract ideal. However, it is a fact that victims 
have been killed as a direct consequence of the YOA privacy 
provisions.
<P>
	The YOA has not received the support of the public because it 
is basically flawed concerning the age of application. We 
maintain there is consensus around the operating of a separate 
youth court system that should apply to 10 to 15 years inclusive 
rather than the current 12 to 17 inclusive.
<P>
	The concept of dealing with young offenders differently from 
adults is sound. However, how that is actually accomplished 
reflects differences in social values. We propose that the justice 
system must be accountable to the community for the results it 
delivers. Does it denounce crime in a public, straightforward 
and speedy way that inspires confidence? Does it seem fair to 
all? Is it flexible but firm in its role of protecting the 
community? Does it balance the rights and needs of victims with 
those of the accused?
<P>
	Canadians currently spend millions on social services for 
young offenders. Appropriate public response to crime must be 
broadly based with adequate investments in the public school 
system, recreation and social services. The role of a vibrant 
economy is also important, but it is  too easy to always say we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4886"> 4886 </A></B>
<P>
need to throw more money at a problem. We need to respond 
better to the social causes of crime.
<P>
	However, societal concerns cannot be used as an excuse not to 
tighten up the justice system while we work on the broad social 
policy objectives.
<P>
	The juvenile justice system in its operation should mirror the 
adult system as much as possible if it is to be understandable by 
the community and develop general deterrents.
<P>
	Consequently, the YOA court should be completely open to 
the press. YOA court records should be one and the same as 
adult criminal records and the same rules for the control and use 
of adult records should apply to the YOA: access, 
dissemination, subsequent court use. Without the social 
engineering limits of the YOA justice must be seen to be done as 
well as done.
<P>
	We advocate the increased use of a variety of residential 
young offender facilities, some of which may be secure. 
Alternative measures such as diversion from further court 
process, community accountability panels, victim 
reconciliation programs, community work service, restitution 
orders, fines, educational attendance programs and treatment 
programs for behavioural disorders and substance abuse are all 
being used at present at great expense to the taxpayer.
<P>
	The community could always use more helping alternatives 
but there are financial limits. There is no end to the demand for 
more and better social programs, and government must balance 
its priorities.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Although C-37 tries to encourage the broader use of 
non-custodial alternatives there is no additional cost shared 
funding forthcoming related to the C-37 initiative.
<P>
	In summary, it is my prediction that the half measures of C-37 
are not going to fundamentally alter the operation of the young 
offenders system and future results will still bring outcries of 
dissatisfaction from the community.
<P>
	The Liberals gave us the Young Offenders Act after years of 
wrangling at the end of the former Liberal administration. It was 
an overly optimistic social experiment, idealistically designed 
around a wishful view of the community rather than reality. We 
have now lived with the consequences of the YOA for 10 years. 
It has been amended and improved by the Conservatives, as the 
first version passed by this House was bleeding heart Liberal in 
the extreme. It was a bureaucratic approach from the experts 
down to the community.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is finally an admission for the Liberals that the 
original YOA was fundamentally flawed. The public pressure 
has been building against the misguided YOA and C-37 is 
another in a line of amendments to reflect reality rather than 
idealistic theory.
<P>
	As the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
undertakes the more long term fundamental review, I hope the 
government will remain open to the common sense view of 
ordinary Canadians and let them have what they have been 
asking for. Canadians have said loud and clear they want a 
juvenile justice system that they can have confidence in.
<P>
	As Reformers we will work to let the people speak so that our 
legal system reflects a higher standard which Canadians 
deserve.
<P>
	The motion of the Bloc members is oppositional in an 
unhelpful manner. It says if it is not their way then it should be 
no way and do not amend the act at this time.
<P>
	Reformers are the true opposition and we will work with the 
government to make the YOA reflective of what the community 
wants. Again I say let the people speak and Reformers will bring 
their voice to this House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Bruce-Grey.
<P>
	I am pleased to be given the opportunity to speak to the 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act as presented by the 
Minister of Justice. I have studied for many years the behaviour 
of young people across the spectrum from so-called normal to 
abnormal, in part as a parent in anticipation of the needs of my 
three sons and also as a family practitioner with a large 
adolescent practice.
<P>
	After all these years I still cannot say what I understand or that 
I can always predict the reactions of young people to the 
stresses, anxiety and confusing conflicts created by the 
transition from child to adult.
<P>
	I believe I have gained some valuable insights into these 
issues with the help of my three sons and my young patients, 
many of whom confided in me over the years the nature of their 
feelings and anxieties, and by yet others who were brought to me 
by their parents or social workers because of problematic 
behaviour.
<P>
	I do know from painful experience that the solutions to the 
problems of young people's behaviour, violent or otherwise, are 
neither simplistic nor linear because the problems and anxieties 
that beset our youth are highly emotional, complex and volatile, 
and the answers need to be flexible, individually focused and 
multi-faceted. They also need to strike a careful balance 
between the requirement to punish and the need for 
rehabilitation and prevention.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament for a very metropolitan urban 
riding the issue of young offenders is particularly pertinent. I 
have heard from many of my constituents, both adults who are 
anxious and fearful, and youth, particularly street youth who are 
homeless and lost.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4887"> 4887 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe I have heard all sides of this complex, emotional and 
controversial issue and I agree that there is urgent need for 
appropriate and sensitive action. It is in this light that I have 
assessed the amendments to the Young Offenders Act proposed 
by the justice minister.
<P>
	I will not go into specific details of each amendment, as time 
does not permit. I will instead deal with the overall intent and 
philosophy of these changes. I believe that they need to fulfil 
three specific criteria: safety and protection, accountability, 
which must include punishment and rehabilitation, and cause 
and prevention.
<P>
	We need to balance within these concerns the rights and 
responsibilities of all persons, the victim, the offender, the 
justice system and society at large.
<P>
	I will deal first with the issues of safety and protection. I think 
we all agree that our responsibility as parliamentarians is to 
ensure that Canadians are protected from harm and to maintain a 
safe environment for them to live in wherever possible. We 
know that women, seniors, youth and the most vulnerable in our 
society live with anxiety and fear because of the perceived or 
real escalation of violent crimes among our youth.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Allaying these fears and ensuring safety are of prime 
importance. To do this it is essential to securely isolate young 
offenders at least until we can be sure that they are rehabilitated 
enough to re-enter society without threat.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice's amendments concerning the 
lengthening of sentences for severe violent crimes regardless of 
age address this issue appropriately. The provisions for the 
sharing of information regarding the violent offender with those 
in society who have responsibility for the safety and protection 
of others such as school authorities, law enforcement officers 
and child welfare workers will also be effective in ensuring 
public safety.
<P>
	At the same time by restricting the information only to those 
who have a clear need to know and authority to act, the minister 
has achieved a balance between protection of society from the 
young offender and protection of the young offender from 
understandable but illegal vigilante action and media 
sensationalism.
<P>
	With regard to the second issue of accountability and 
punishment, I believe that the amendments separating the 
punishment for severe violent crimes such as murder, rape, 
aggravated assault and manslaughter from those of the less 
severe young offences address appropriately the maxim from 
Gilbert and Sullivan's ``Mikado'', that the punishment must fit 
the crime.
<P>
	Punishment should take into consideration not only the 
enormity of the act and the culpability of the perpetrator but 
must also be mindful of the responsibility to impart a lesson. If 
this responsibility is not observed then punishment is nothing 
more than revenge.
<P>
	I believe this important balance is achieved in the new 
proposals that would allow a judge to authorize medical or 
psychological assessment of a serious or chronic offender and to 
impose treatment in rehabilitation as part of a sentence. The 
amendment that allows for a victim impact statement is another 
extension of this accountability lesson. It teaches the offender 
that singular, specific acts of violence have far reaching 
consequences that affect the lives of more than the victim.
<P>
	Further to this whole issue of culpability, I support fully the 
minister's decision to keep the minimum age of the young 
offender to 12. I believe, based on my experience as a parent and 
family physician, that young people under 12 do not fully 
comprehend the broader, more abstract concept of cause and 
effect, especially in the very serious crime of murder.
<P>
	There is a clear difference between a child's understanding of 
right and wrong and the more mature understanding of the tragic 
consequences of murder and rape, especially on the victim's 
family and on the permanence of the deed. Our children do not 
live in a vacuum. Media messages today glorify and condone 
these extreme acts of violence and minimize the enormity of 
effect, often rendering them trivial and commonplace, 
especially to a child. Persons under 12 are children.
<P>
	Moreover, the amendments that now require a young offender 
between the ages of 15 and 17 to be treated in adult court further 
strengthen this concept of maturity as a factor in culpability.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to address the proposed amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act under the third criterion of cause and 
prevention. In this, the International Year of the Family, we have 
a clear duty to all children, especially as parliamentarians to 
Canadian children.
<P>
	Children and youth are among the most vulnerable in society. 
In the early years of life they depend on us completely for 
security and protection. We have a responsibility as parents and 
later as teachers to guide and nurture them, imparting to them a 
sense of self-esteem and worth, an understanding of our societal 
values, also furnishing them with the skills for coping with the 
conflicts and stresses of life within the context of good 
citizenship and with regard for rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	Our children and youth have no secure ground on which to 
build a future. In these times of economic instability and 
unemployment our children are filled with a sense of futility and 
hopelessness. As they see us, adults, buffeted often helplessly 
by these endless stresses, they also experience our sense of 
powerlessness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4888"> 4888 </A></B>
<P>
	In this environment some of our young people are fortunate 
enough to weather these stresses in a family atmosphere of love 
and security, but there are many others whose fears are 
compounded by the isolation of neglect and abuse. Our 
neglected and abused children come from all social and 
economic groups. Abuse is not only an active thing, it can be 
inflicted passively when we deny love and guidance.  If then 
some of our children and youth act out their feelings of anxiety 
and powerlessness in violent behaviour we must seek not only to 
be protected from their actions and to punish them 
appropriately, but we must also recognize these actions for what 
they are, a tragic response to seemingly insurmountable odds.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Whenever we exert our right to punish we must be conscious 
of our responsibility to rehabilitate and our duty to prevent the 
creation of further generations of lost and violent youth.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we must act now as a priority to provide 
resources for families who need assistance in coping with 
difficult and recalcitrant children and youth. However these 
measures must be remedial and preventive rather than punitive.
<P>
	Like it or not, our youth are our hope for the future. We are the 
only ones who can influence that future by how we deal with the 
problems today.
<P>
	I support the justice minister's amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act because I believe they present realistic solutions 
to the problems of today while building a secure and safe future 
for tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for her speech and ask a few questions.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has gone part of the way in 
acknowledging that 16 or 17-year-olds who commit murder and 
attempted murder perhaps should be tried in adult court. 
However the onus has been switched. Why not just put them into 
adult court and not go through this exercise of switching the 
onus?
<P>
	Second, it was not clear from the hon. member's speech why 
the Young Offenders Act should not be amended to incorporate 
the youths of 10 and 11 years of age.
<P>
	This morning as I was leaving my house I had to stop my car, 
get out and go back because a youth whom I had seen walking 
down the street opposite my car was heading into our back yard. 
I ran back and yelled: ``Hey, what are you doing there?''. It was a 
person of this younger age scouting out a house. This was in 
Vanier.
<P>
	I want to know why we would not incorporate a system that 
captures these people so that they are held responsible as well.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> I forgot your first question. I do not believe that is 
what the minister means by changing the onus for 15 to 17-year 
olds to be tried in adult court. He said they should be tried in 
adult court and it should be shown why they should not be tried 
in adult court. It is clear they will be tried for very violent crimes 
in adult court and the onus is on them to prove that they should 
not be tried in this court. I think that is very appropriate.
<P>
	Second, you talked about lowering the age from 12. I made it 
quite clear that I do not believe we can put 12-year olds and 
under 12-year olds in the same category. I do not believe that the 
abstract concepts of crime and punishment really apply to young 
people. I say this from experience, both as a parent and as a 
practitioner who had lots of young people in my practice.
<P>
	We need to help these young people by prevention, by 
remedial help and by helping their parents with the resources 
they need to help bring their children into line. However we 
should not be throwing these children in jail at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Statistics Canada, British Columbia has 
the third highest youth crime rate in Canada after the Yukon and 
the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	Could the hon. member for Vancouver Centre tell me what 
impact the amendments to the Young Offenders Act will have on 
young people in two specific areas, namely the tougher 
sentences and the referral to adult court which I, like the hon. 
member, think is automatic?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> With respect to increased sentences, it is in fact 
appropriately punishing the young people for the very serious 
crimes. Sorry, what was the second part of your question?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I think we are just about out of 
time. The hon. member is going to be the next speaker so he will 
have a chance later on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
digress for a moment. Fifty years ago today something 
significant happened. I want to make reference to it.
<P>
	There were three Victoria Cross medalists in my riding of 
Bruce-Grey, Messrs. Bishop, Holmes and Currie. Billy Bishop 
was a World War I flying ace. He worked as a consultant and 
helped to train people for the second world war. David Currie 
was married to an Owen Sound girl by the name of Isabelle Silue 
and I understand she is still alive and lives in Ottawa. Thomas 
Holmes was 18-years old-these people were only between 18 
and 25 years with an average of maybe 22 years old-when he 
stormed a bunker two or three times, giving his life to throw a 
grenade into a pillbox. Eleven Germans had surrendered to him. 
I would like to pay tribute to them as well as one more person, 
<P>

Lloyd Clark who was at Passchendaele and was also on the

<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Ever since I rose in the House to respond to the throne speech, 
one of the things I hoped we could do was work collaboratively 
together. The Young Offenders Act is one of those topics. All 
members owe it to their communities to make them safer.
<P>
	We owe it to Canadians to be as factual and as analytical as 
possible in dealing with the issue that most critically involves 
striking a balance between the rights of the victim, the offender 
and society in general.
<P>
	No matter what our political stripe or gender or cultural 
perception, we must get this one right. In our daily work we deal 
with tax issues, procedural issues, political issues to mention a 
few. I would argue with my colleagues on all sides of the House 
that this is one on the human side like no other.
<P>
	Simply put, all members in the House and Canadians in 
general want to be in a community that is safe and secure. This is 
a public policy issue and a priority for us as a government.
<P>
	In this democratic forum I call on all sides to make sure that 
we benefit from the discussions here. The hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert made a good presentation and a passionate one. I 
know that she does a good job for the province of Quebec, 
notwithstanding the fact that she disagrees with us completely 
and would like to make an amendment to the act.
<P>
	In the era of Aristotle and Plato the justice issue was 
discussed. I am intrigued by the fact that in this debate in the 
year 1994 we are attempting to debate that very notion. This is 
an intergenerational problem and it requires from time to time 
that in places like the House of Commons we debate this kind of 
policy.
<P>
	Margaret Mead, the sociologist that studied society, said that 
a family that did not care for all of the children within that 
family was a family that would fail. In every society she studied 
there were problems in terms of the way the family is.
<P>
	The way we deal with our young people is very important. 
Recently, during the election, I had a whole lot of street kids 
right in front of my campaign office. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
by the end of the election they were all working with me. One 
guy even got five bucks. He got his picture in the papers. They 
changed completely. They tell me that a lot of adults walk right 
by them, not admitting they exist. Sometimes we have to look at 
ourselves when dealing with young people.
<P>
	Recent events within various communities have increased 
public fears, fueled the debate and intensified the attacks on the 
Young Offenders Act. Canadians empathize and are saddened by 
the tragedies. However I strongly feel that we must analyse and 
make sure that we do not get into misinformation and prompt an 
emotional response to this question. The minister is trying to 
find a good balance to make sure that some of those needs are 
met by allowing youths to say why they should not go to  adult 
court, of sharing information with the police, the teachers and 
the people in the community that require it and using all those 
agencies within the communities to make sure that when the 
person is convicted that they are going to be able to work with 
them in order to get them rehabilitated.
<P>
	It is all well and good to put a person in jail, but sooner or later 
he has to come out. If the apprenticeship they get in prison is one 
that teaches them to be criminals, that is what you are going to 
get. If the response is one we can deal with in our communities, 
which is one of caring and and trying to find out what makes a 
person tick, there are certainly going to be some individuals who 
will respond. When I took psychology we studied people with 
the xyy chromosome and some postulated that there was not 
much that could be done with people who had that tendency.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	If members watched the movie <I>One Flew over the Cuckoos 
Nest</I> they will remember McMurphy. At that time frontal 
lobotomies were given which removed parts of the brain. 
Members will remember that when they did that to McMurphy 
he was no longer the person we knew. That was something that 
happened in mental hospitals and was a response to a problem of 
humanity.
<P>
	Human beings are very complex organisms. I listened to 
members from both sides of the House saying: ``We are 
legislators, we pass legislation''. One thing I want to say in 
passing is that in this legislation we are trying to strike a 
balance. There can be no perfect solution because God created 
each one of us differently but equally. It is that diversity which 
has made us the kinds of people we are. We allow that.
<P>
	There are societies where they use very harsh methods. I just 
came back from South Africa. In South Africa if a person 
committed a crime and was caught they were brutalized, beaten, 
their families were intimidated, incarcerated and virtually 
disappeared. Some were even killed.
<P>
	Do you know what is the response to that kind of harsh 
system? If criminals saw your face they would kill you. It got 
very bad in that community.
<P>
	Statistics from the United States tell us that more people are 
incarcerated there than in any other country in the world. They 
have extremely violent crime activity and it seems to be 
increasing so I do not know if that system would help us.
<P>
	Incarceration costs us a lot of money. Why not provide some 
means of restitution, some means of rehabilitation. Let us make 
sure we have the infrastructure to ensure that the needs of people 
are met in our communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4890"> 4890 </A></B>
<P>
	I fully support the example in the recent study by the John 
Howard Society. It estimates the cost of keeping a young person 
incarcerated as $191 per day. The minister mentioned earlier 
that it costs some $70,000 to $100,000 to keep a person in jail.
<P>
	If those resources were reallocated and we do not put young 
people in jail for activities that are not severe and could be 
solved, we could reallocate those funds to those people, making 
them into productive people in our communities and getting 
them back into society.
<P>
	A lot of human tragedy is involved in this debate, both on the 
victim's side and the offender's side. I do not want to make light 
of what has happened in some peoples' lives in terms of the just 
desserts situation or any other situation that has occurred within 
the last little while.
<P>
	The amount of crime in our society, as based on studies, is 
really going down. According to StatsCan, the number of youths 
arrested for all crimes fell by 4.7 per cent in 1991. Less than 3 
per cent of young offenders charged with a violent crime 
committed a serious personal injury crime.
<P>
	The murder and manslaughter rate is less than 1 per cent. As 
bold and horrible as violent crime is we in government have a 
duty to act responsibly. It is correct for us not to panic and that 
we make the changes being considered by the minister.
<P>
	No one can critically analyse youth crime without considering 
societal conditions and the root causes. There are simple 
solutions to this. I would ask members to give this the weight it 
deserves in this discussion.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Young Offenders Act reflect 
a reality. We know that youth crime is related to societal 
conditions, poverty, school failure, substance abuse, child abuse 
and neglect, spouse abuse, unemployment and dysfunctional 
families. However this does not make excuses for violent 
offenders.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, a balanced approach by the minister is what we 
would require. I urge all members on this side to take a balanced 
approach. We do live in a society in which we have to allow 
people to reach their potential. We do not incarcerate people. 
That is not our technique. I think the minister has found the best 
balance in his solution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to assure the hon. member that, first of all, 
the opposition will co-operate on an issue like young offenders. 
We will certainly work on and examine this bill very seriously.
<P>
	However, when we deal with such an important issue on which 
there seems to be unanimity in Quebec, a unanimity that is 
growing in the other provinces, you may find that our 
involvement will be one of opposing this measure. But you can 
be sure that we do it for young people, because 10-, 11-, 12-, 
17- and 18-year-olds are not  here to defend themselves, few 
groups will defend them, and I think it is our duty to do so.
<P>
	However, I have a little question for the hon. member. I 
listened attentively to his speech and I like his approach on the 
issue of young offenders. Compared with the justice minister's 
bill before us, which everyone, except the government, of 
course, recognizes as a more repressive approach than that of the 
hon. member, which, as I understood from his speech, 
emphasizes rehabilitation and social reintegration.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me where he stands on all 
this, how he reconciles his approach with that of the minister 
through Bill C-37.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the member for not 
speaking in his first language.
<P>
	In my previous job as a mayor one of the things police asked is 
that the names be made public. I believe there is a mechanism 
for that. In some cases when young offenders only had a 
five-year sentence they knew that the five years went very 
quickly and that did not give them a chance to be introspective 
and to take courses to get rid of their inhibitions and some of the 
problems that they had in working in society. The latitude that 
the minister put in there will help.
<P>
	I say to the member opposite that basically what we have is a 
tightening up, to some degree. He is right, we are moving toward 
a more strict society. In order for a society to work and to have 
the judges, police and teachers on side we have to take some of 
these measures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for 
the member who just gave a very good speech.
<P>
	I agree with him in the sense that we ought not to be 
incarcerating people thinking that thereby we can make them 
good. As a matter of fact, I do not believe there is a law that we 
can pass that will make people good.
<P>
	I grew up in a very special home, one in which we were not 
permitted-I grew up before there was television-to listen to 
radio programs which had violence. We were not permitted to 
settle our differences with violence. It had to be with negotiation 
and compromise. As a youngster I grew up so that as an adult for 
me to impose a criminal act on someone else was not even within 
the realm of my thinking.
<P>
	How does the member propose to deal with those people who 
did not have that training, who do not have that built in morality 
that restrains them? How do we restrain those who actually find 
it very easy to pick up an axe, a gun or a knife to harm other 
people?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4891"> 4891 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I have enough 
time for this question but I will try to answer it very quickly.
<P>
	I guess censorship is another question. We do not censor 
things. People are supposed to know what is reality and what is 
not. I agree with the member. Most of us on this side of the 
House who grew up during his time know that there were very 
strict acts and most of us tried to confront that.
<P>
	There is a great tendency within society as it stands now. I 
taught high school before I came here. A child may be subjected 
to four or five parents and there are some complications in those 
relationships. In a lot of cases they are given love. Talk to people 
from the children's aid or anybody who takes kids in who cannot 
deal with them. Unfortunately there are no tests for families, and 
part of our problem is to try to do that.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The other alternative is to lock them up, shoot them or hang 
them, and that is not what we do in our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a few words, to begin, I think I can say, and not be 
too far off the mark, that an elephant has just brought forth a 
mouse; the elephant, of course, is the problem of young 
offenders, you understand.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed an amendment 
which the House can accept, for the sake of young people who 
need help in Canada.
<P>
	After receiving much media coverage, reading thousands of 
briefs and attending federal-provincial conferences, the 
minister let it be understood that the problem of young offenders 
was very complex and deserved special attention to produce 
amendments for correcting the deficiencies in the system. The 
big problem of youth is supposed to be solved with the bill we 
have in our hands.
<P>
	So where do we stand? What is the wonder prescription to 
achieve this objective? So as not to be accused of distorting the 
major points of the bill, I will use the justice minister's press 
release of June 2. Here are the ingredients of the wonder formula 
to deal with the problems of young offenders.
<P>
	First of all, the minister proposes extending the penalties for 
adolescents found guilty in youth court of first- or 
second-degree murder to ten and seven years respectively. What 
a stroke of inspiration. We see that the essential element of the 
bill is repression. Indeed, the government stresses this point at 
the outset so that everyone understands.
<P>
	Secondly, the minister proposes referring to adult court 16- 
and 17-year-olds accused of an offence involving serious 
bodily harm, unless they can convince a judge that the 
objectives of public protection and rehabilitation can both be 
met if they are judged in a youth court.
<P>
	This is an important change. In our system, one is presumed 
innocent until proven guilty and the Crown must prove beyond 
any reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty; however, if the 
accused is 16 or 17 years old, he is presumed to be an adult for 
the purposes of his trial unless the public interest does not 
require it.
<P>
	Under our laws, an underage person will have to show that the 
public can be protected and he can be returned to society if his 
case is referred to youth court; this is a dangerous breach of legal 
principles which concerns me greatly.
<P>
	With this bill, the government is dividing 16- and 
17-year-olds into two classes: persons under 18 who are docile 
and can be rehabilitated and those who, at age 16 and 17, are 
incorrigible, as implied in the bill. If we can speak of the long 
arm of the law, we can now say that it is also selective.
<P>
	How can such unfair treatment be compatible with the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? In any event, we in 
Quebec have at least 25 years of experience in reintegrating 
young offenders in society. Although we need to invest to 
expand the program, and although I agree that a lot remains to be 
done, we have a system to provide support to a young person 
who needs help. But in those English-speaking provinces where 
rehabilitation is not a priority, where will a 16 or 17-year-old 
go, even if he asks for protection under the Young Offenders 
Act? I am quite sure that legal precedents will quickly be created 
and based on the principle that a 16 or 17-year-old must be held 
accountable for his acts, must be treated like an adult, must be 
dealt with by an adult court, and must also be sentenced as an 
adult.
<P>
	In the reform he tabled last week, the minister also lengthens 
the sentences to be served by 16 and 17-year old offenders who 
are found guilty of murder by an adult court, before they can be 
eligible for parole. Again, the underlying message being 
conveyed is one of repression.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The fourth element mentioned by the minister to help young 
people avoid getting into trouble with the law is to improve the 
sharing of information between professionals, for example 
school authorities, the police and some public representatives, 
when public security is threatened, and to retain criminal 
records for a longer period in the case of young offenders who 
have committed serious crimes.
<P>
	I am curious to see how clause 38.(1.14) will be interpreted as 
regards public security.
<P>
	Many well-meaning but tactless people will append the 
criminal record and the court order to the academic record, 
precisely for so-called security reasons. What a nice introduc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4892"> 4892 </A></B>
<P>
tion, for the young person, to this self-proclaimed tolerant and 
generous society.
<P>
	The message is quite clear when you read the bill, especially 
as regards that issue. It says: you are a petty criminal and we will 
make sure that you do not forget that. We will try to ensure that 
you are periodically reminded of that by appending this 
information to your school record.
<P>
	If the provisions of this bill are strictly implemented, a young 
delinquent will spend more time in an institution, will have less 
chance of rehabilitating himself and, when he gets out, will be a 
branded person. The last ingredient of the minister's recipe is 
rehabilitation and treatment. We cannot say much on this 
because the minister certainly did not elaborate on this 
particular point. He merely said that, in the case of young 
offenders, rehabilitation and treatment will be used when 
appropriate.
<P>
	I am sorry, but I believe that a 10, 11, 14 or 17 year old has a 
right to whatever rehabilitation or treatment is required in his 
case. This should not be a conditional but, rather, an 
unconditional provision in the bill. Once again, our views are 
very different.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice told us he consulted a lot of people, 
including representatives of the legal profession, police 
officers, school authorities, provinces and many others. Among 
all of the proposed amendments, I wonder which ones were 
requested by the Quebec Minister of Justice, the Director of 
Youth Protection, the Quebec Judicial Council or even the 
National Assembly of Quebec? Which criminologist or 
sociologist in Quebec would want such repression? Who in 
Quebec asked for this kind of amendments?
<P>
	If the minister held consultations, and I am sure he did, we can 
only conclude that, for the government to have come up with 
such a flimsy effort, as I said earlier, the Liberal Party of Canada 
must have felt unbearable internal pressure from Western 
Canada. To please the majority, they once again ignored the will 
of Quebecers, even though Quebec had made it very clear what it 
wanted. To be heard, the National Assembly of Quebec as well 
as Bloc members in this House have always maintained their 
positions.
<P>
	As I intend to make myself clear, maybe for the last time, I 
will quote none other that the Quebec Minister of Justice whom 
the federal minister allegedly consulted. On May 4, Mr. Roger 
Lefebvre, Liberal minister in the Quebec government, said: ``I 
think it is important for the federal and provincial governments 
to focus their actions more on rehabilitation than on repression. 
Young offenders need help and support to re-enter society. It is 
important not to condemn in advance all young offenders who 
commit violent crimes''.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister, a federalist I might add, is happy with 
the bill introduced by his big brother. Yet, according to the 
Quebec Minister of Justice, the message was made very clear at 
the federal-province conference. Mr. Lefebvre sums up his 
position in this way: ``At the federal-provincial conference of 
the Ministers of Justice which took place in Ottawa on March 23 
and 24, I had several opportunities to express the positions of 
Quebec, particularly on the proposed amendment to the Young 
Offenders Act. I also said that the Quebec government intends to 
pursue and intensify its search of durable and effective solutions 
that will meet the real needs of young people, and leave some 
hope for their future''.
<P>
	I would like to expand a little bit on that point of view because 
it is important to understand the inconsistencies in the current 
situation. I stressed that federal action must be respectful of 
Quebec jurisdiction and seek to reduce overlapping so that 
Quebec does not end up with higher costs.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I also indicated that experience in Quebec has shown that the 
present maximum sentence of five years is adequate for an 
overwhelming majority of murders committed by young people. 
The present transfer mechanism for serious offenses makes it 
possible to judge young offenders in a regular criminal court 
when their rehabilitation requires a long period of detention that 
cannot be determined.
<P>
	And in the last paragraph, we have the explanation of the bill 
of the federal minister of justice. It is Mr. Lefebvre who says this 
to the National Assembly on May 4: ``It seems to me that it 
would be more appropriate to make better use of current 
legislative tools for referrals instead of changing the rules, as 
some of the other provincial ministers of justice indicated 
during that federal-provincial conference''. That is clear 
enough. Without having been present at that federal-provincial 
conference, I can say that Quebec City's concerns did not carry 
much weight in the decision of the federal justice.
<P>
	I consider the Minister of Justice a progressive and I have a lot 
a respect for him but, unfortunately, I have to say that this bill is 
disappointing and dangerous. With due respect for the opposite 
opinion, I can say that the alarm has been sounded. Next time, 
what principle of our justice system will disappear? Who will 
take the rap so that we can silence and calm right-wing people? 
This bill misses the target and ignores the real flaws and the 
present problems.
<P>
	I hear members of the government telling me that I am playing 
well my role of official opposition in criticizing a bill coming 
from the Minister of Justice. However, I will do more than that. 
Sometimes, I dream about putting myself in the place of a 
minister to try to understand his position, to follow his logic and 
to ask myself what I would have done if I had been in his shoes. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4893"> 4893 </A></B>
<P>
In the present case, it has been difficult for me to understand the 
minister's position and to follow his logic, but in spite of  it all, I 
would have never meddled with the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The problem is not the act, but its application. Indeed, if I had 
been in the place of the Minister of Justice, I would have 
outlined the situation in this way. First, I would have encouraged 
Western provinces and other Canadian provinces to follow the 
example of Quebec where rehabilitation is the basic objective. 
In summary, I would not have reinvented the wheel, I would 
simply have insisted on respect for the meaning and the purpose 
of the Young Offenders Act as it now stands. We do not even 
know the results of the latest amendments to the act and we 
already want to bring in some new ones. We cannot deal with 
such an issue on the short term, we must know where we are 
going.
<P>
	Second, I would have talked about statistics because they are 
important. The most recent statistics show that crime by youths 
is declining. The media exaggerate the situation and the public 
has the wrong impression about today's young people. However, 
in larger cities, statistics seem to be influenced by a series of 
factors like the presence of gangs, new cultural communities, et 
cetera. Some of the things that certain members said in their 
speeches called this to mind.
<P>
	Also in my dream, as justice minister, I would have 
introduced a program in partnership with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in order to encourage the development, 
effectiveness and efficiency of youth houses, streetworkers, 
centres and other places for young people, by means of 
employment and development programs and sections like 
section 25. I think that prevention, education and 
consciousness-raising can prevent crime. I would not have 
condemned anyone but I would have tried to understand the 
problem and eliminate it at the root. The bill does not mention 
anything to that effect.
<P>
	Third, the public rightly responds to the facts reported by the 
media. One particular case which recently resulted in a general 
outcry deals with the robbery of a convenience store by minors 
who were controlled by adults. The organizer of the crime, an 
adult, was sentenced to two years in jail even if a murder was 
committed in that store. This kind of case is not new. It is 
well-known that well organized criminals and unscrupulous 
bums use young people to do their crimes.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Is the minor the problem or the adult? We all know that a 10 or 
11-year-old looks up to his elders. They are prepared to do 
anything to be accepted, even commit armed robbery or kill 
someone. In this case, the culprit is not the 10 or 11-year-old. 
The real criminal, the dangerous offender is the adult who uses a 
young person for his own perverted ends.
<P>
	And what did the minister put in his bill to stop this shocking 
and shameless exploitation of young people? Nothing.
<P>
	If I were the minister, I would have proposed amendments to 
the Criminal Code. I would not be satisfied with the current 
sentences these adults receive when they are caught. A person 
who conspires with a minor to commit a crime should answer for 
the same crime as the minor. That is why I would have proposed 
a new section in the Criminal Code, to follow section 465 which 
deals with conspiracy, and to be referred to as section 465.1 
``conspiracy with a minor''.
<P>
	I am not an expert on legal drafting, but to give hon. members 
an idea of what I would like to see in this section, I will read you 
a section that would have read as follows: ``Except where 
otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions 
apply in respect of persons who conspire with minors to cause 
them to commit offences: <I>(a)</I> everyone who conspires with a 
minor to cause him to commit an offence in the meaning of 
section 231, first degree murder or second degree murder, in the 
meaning of section 239, attempt to commit murder, in the 
meaning of sections 233 and 234, manslaughter, in the meaning 
of section 273, aggravated sexual assault, in the meaning of 
section 268, aggravated assault, is guilty of the indictable 
offence of which the minor is accused and liable to the same 
punishment, provided under each of these sections, to which he 
would be liable if he had himself committed the offence''.
<P>
	The second paragraph of this section would have read as 
follows: ``Everyone who conspires with a minor or causes him 
to commit any other offence punishable on summary conviction 
or an indictable offence is, if the offence is committed by the 
minor, guilty of the offence as though he had committed the 
offence himself and is liable to the same punishment''.
<P>
	This section is intended to fill a gap in our legislation. It 
would send a very clear message that trying to be clever by using 
young people in our country is a criminal offence. In this way we 
would deal with the real problem.
<P>
	Since in many cases, the adult would receive a more severe 
sentence than the young offender, the objective of this 
amendment would soon be reached. We cannot just stand there 
and let a young person's life be ruined. We need constructive 
proposals. Unfortunately, I am not the Minister of Justice, and 
this House has to live with Bill C-37, where it looks like in the 
minister's mind, there has to be a link between repression and 
crime. However, nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	I believe that we should not forget the extensive study 
undertaken last year in the United States, in two or three states 
where the young offender legislation had been amended to 
lengthen sentences. It shows that, instead of going down as 
expected, the crime rate among young people went up. How do 
you explain this? I do not know. I am not a psychologist, but I do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4894"> 4894 </A></B>
<P>
know that it is true. To  claim that repression is going to lower 
the crime rate is ludicrous.
<P>
	Bill C-37, in its present form, is contrary to Quebec's policy 
and legislation regarding youth protection. It flies in the face of 
the motion passed nearly unanimously, on May 5 last, by the 
Quebec National Assembly, as if we were no longer part of the 
federal government's concerns. Fortunately, I do hope that the 
House will seize the opportunity to backtrack offered by the 
Bloc member for Saint-Hubert, with her proposed amendment. 
There is no shame in admitting that one was wrong, and I believe 
that this amendment gives the House of Commons the 
opportunity to acknowledge that it is proceeding a bit too fast 
with an issue as important as young offenders. It could be that 
the consultations undertaken by the minister did not yield the 
expected results.
<P>
	We must realize that the decision the House is going to make 
regarding young offenders will have far-reaching consequences 
since it will alter the course of their lives. It is not a decision we 
can make lightly.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would also mention people we have not talked 
about yet, except in a question I asked one member, and who are 
not mentioned in the repressive amendments of the minister. I 
am referring to native young offenders.
<P>
	If we look at the figures of Statistics Canada, as we go west 
the crime rate increases. In the Yukon and the Northwest 
Territories the figures are alarming. The rate is over 30 per cent 
in the Northwest Territories. What is the minister going to do 
with all these young people, where is he going to put them?
<P>
	Is he going to build special institutions for young offenders? 
Is he going to increase funding for legal aid? Who is going to 
assume the defence of the poor? How much is it going to cost? 
These questions have to be answered and I am very surprised 
that western members, who claim to be the Official Opposition 
on certain issues, did not take up the case of the people who 
elected them and are directly affected by these amendments.
<P>
	Finally, with these amendments the jails are going to be full, 
we will have to build more, and there will not be much 
rehabilitation, because the demand will be much greater than 
what the province can provide, given that no money was ever 
invested in rehabilitation and social reintegration.
<P>
	For all these reasons I will support the Bloc Quebecois' 
amendment and vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member opposite a few questions about the 
information he gave concerning the lack of co-operation or 
consultation between the Government of Quebec and the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	That is not quite accurate. At any rate, I want to know where 
he got his information, because I know that the Minister of 
Justice of Canada did consult his provincial colleague.
<P>
	Furthermore, we on this side of the House are also concerned 
about crime prevention. The Minister of Justice said that this is 
the first in a series of measures that we will bring in as the 
Government of Canada in a real effort to prevent youth crime. 
This is not the only measure; it is one of a series that we want to 
introduce as a government.
<P>
	As far as repression is concerned, I do not think that the bill is 
repressive, that is not really what we want to do in the 
legislation; we want to try to help young people who are 
involved in crime, to help them so they do not continue on that 
path all their life, to act early to break the vicious circle of youth 
crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer these 
questions. First, I said that I was convinced the minister had held 
consultations.
<P>
	The problem is that he consulted with his ears plugged. For 
example, what the Quebec minister of justice asked for and what 
the legislation now says are two completely different things. In 
other words, the federal justice minister consulted his provincial 
counterpart, but did not accept any of his suggestions and 
rejected everything that Quebec asked for regarding young 
offenders.
<P>
	In fact, I believe a unanimous resolution was passed last May 
5 by Quebec's National Assembly, asking that the federal justice 
minister not amend the Young Offenders Act, which works just 
fine as it is. Of course, there is always room for improvement.
<P>
	However, it is not by lengthening sentences and by 
implementing amendments such as these that the objective of 
the Young Offenders Act will be reached.
<P>
	According to the justice minister's release, this is just the first 
stage. The minister seems to want to bring changes in two 
stages. However, I find this to be a curious strategy, in the sense 
that we are taking a stand regarding that first stage and will tell 
the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs what we expect from 
a consultation process.
<P>
	In my opinion, this process is biased and, in any case, it gums 
up the works for the debate we want to have at the second stage. 
The hon. member may not be pleased by the fact that I use the 
term repressive. But take a look at what people say outside this 
House. Psychologists, criminologists, sociologists, provincial 
politicians and journalists are almost unanimous in saying that 
this legislation is repressive.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Out of five salient points mentioned by the minister, three 
directly relate to longer sentences and to the reversal of the 
burden of proof in order to be heard by a youth court. I am sorry, 
but these provisions are repressive. There are no other words for 
it. Three points  out of five-a clear majority-are repressive. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4895"> 4895 </A></B>
<P>
Consequently, I feel I can refer to this bill as a very repressive 
measure. This answers your three points.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
this day, June 6, we remember the principles of peace and 
freedom and the ability of courageous people to overcome 
oppression and evil and to maintain these principles. It seems 
there are certain principles under attack within our own 
community. People are not at peace; they are not free when they 
are under threat to their life, their property and their well-being.
<P>
	My hon. colleague mentioned that a principle of justice has 
been eradicated by the bill. I would simply like to ask him what 
principle of justice has been eradicated by the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I may not be an expert in 
criminal law, but I did practice law for seven years and I have 
always understood two facts about our British-style system of 
justice. First, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
<P>
	Second, the burden rests with the Crown to prove guilt beyond 
a reasonable doubt. In the matter now before us, in Quebec and 
in other provinces, there are laws on the books that say that a 
young person is considered to be an adult when he or she reaches 
18 years of age. That is a principle. If the proposed legislative 
changes are adopted, a 16- or 17-year-old could be tried for a 
crime as a adult. To my mind, this provision flies in the face of 
the principle whereby everyone is treated equally under the law. 
In the case of some 16- or 17-year-olds, the government would 
be saying that while you are considered a minor under certain 
laws, we have adopted others which say that you are an adult and 
will be tried as an adult.
<P>
	I find this approach extremely dangerous. It opens the door to 
setting aside other, perhaps more important, principles. Just 
how far is the government prepared to go to appease the people 
on the right and silence those who may be misinformed or even 
manipulated by groups who distort the facts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
fully support the bill but my colleague opposite raised a concern 
that I share, that is the whole issue of young people 16 and 17 
years of age having to prove to the judge that they should not be 
transferred to adult court. I agree with him that this would 
appear to be a problem where the accused is forced to prove his 
innocence.
<P>
	However I note the minister said in his remarks today that the 
final decision on whether or not a young person goes to adult 
court, if I interpret the minister correctly, is entirely at the 
discretion of the judge. Surely that answers my concern and the 
concerns of my colleague opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> As far as referral is concerned, Mr. 
Speaker, there are two points I have not raised yet, but that really 
worry me. When we talk about referral, we talk about the whole 
justice system. This is going to be very costly. I cannot wait to 
see how much this new referral process will cost to the justice 
system? Also, this bill will make the procedure more 
cumbersome.
<P>
	I would like to give a straight answer to the hon. member, but I 
seem to have forgotten what was his question was. I think it had 
to do with judges, but I am not sure. Can he remind me of his 
question?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think another member wishes to ask a 
question. I will recognize the hon. member for 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must certainly comment on the hon. member's presentation this 
afternoon. He has made it very clear that he does not agree with 
the bill the minister has brought forth. We on this side of the 
House believe that it is a very balanced approach. Today we 
celebrated the 50th anniversary of D-Day. Times have changed 
over the past 50 years, there is no question.
<P>
	I particularly want to zero in and ask a question of the hon. 
member on the second component of the presentation made by 
the Minister of Justice with regard to the justice committee 
taking on a study of the cause, what has caused in recent years 
the tremendous increase in young offenders.
<P>
	Having worked with young people over many years in several 
different capacities it is a concern to me. I know it is to the hon. 
member. I wonder if he might like to touch on that factor. 
Ultimately what everyone on this side of the House wants, and I 
am sure those on the other side of the House, is not to have to 
deal with the situation because the young people are not getting 
themselves into those problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, answering this question is 
easy because it is not true that there has been an explosion in 
youth crime. The statistics even show a decrease except, as I 
said earlier in my speech, in the major centres like Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver where there are gangs, where new 
arrivals try to enforce their own brand of justice, and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4896"> 4896 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not true that there has been a tremendous increase in 
youth crime and I think it is wrong to try to give that impression. 
According to the statistics I have which cover the period from 
1972 to 1992, the number of crimes of all kinds is exactly the 
same, give or take four or five. It is wrong to talk about an 
increase. We will discuss it in detail in the Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs, but it is wrong to talk about an explosion, as 
we will demonstrate before the committee.
<P>
	What I do not like in the referral or the minister's request is 
that we will adopt the Young Offenders Act. The committee 
considered that, of course, but it also planned a second phase to 
consider the amendments I want. We know that the minister 
consulted or at least said he consulted several stakeholders. 
Does the bill really meet these stakeholders' requests? I doubt it.
<P>
	I will now take this opportunity to respond to the hon. member 
who asked me a question earlier that I just remembered. Yes, it is 
true that, under the referral system, the judges will decide 
whether or not young offenders will be transferred to adult 
court. Quebec has room to accommodate these people and I am 
convinced that the jurisprudence that will evolve in Quebec will 
be rather similar to that of Ontario but very different from that of 
Western Canada. Why? Because Quebec and Ontario have 
started to develop a whole system to accommodate these young 
people, including youth protection and rehabilitation 
centres-Quebec already has several such centres.
<P>
	What will happen in Western Canada and the Northwest 
Territories? They do not have any rehabilitation centres where 
they can send their young offenders. So my main conclusion is 
that the jurisprudence will be much tougher in Western Canada 
and they will take the opportunity to transfer all these 16- and 
17-year-olds to adult court. That is what I question and what I 
find very dangerous.
<P>
	I hope I have answered the question this time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my voice to the 
debate on the proposed amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act. I stand as someone who has worked for over 30 years in the 
education system, working with young people as a school 
teacher, as a vice-principal, as a principal and in several 
capacities as counsellor. I am also a mother of two black 
Canadian children. I am very concerned about all Canadian 
youth, including the situation of black youth in the country.
<P>
	We heard from across the way that the elephant gave birth to a 
mouse. This is not reality. We are talking about Bill C-37 which 
is intent on addressing the reality of the situation that faces us 
today in our communities.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	My constituency office in Etobicoke-Lakeshore receives 
numerous calls on a daily basis: calls for reforms to the act, calls 
from Canadians concerned about the safety of their families, 
concerned about their communities, concerned and fearful when 
they read the daily barrage of media reports and stories that 
speak about teenage vandalism, random acts of violence, use of 
weapons, et cetera. Some of the people I have spoken to about 
the issue tell me that juveniles are laughing at the present system 
of justice. They want to see reforms to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Public consultation has indicated a major dissatisfaction with 
the present treatment of young offenders. The bill is the justice 
minister's response to Canadians to provide Canadians with 
immediate action that would particularly address violent 
crimes.
<P>
	I will direct my remarks to the situation around the call for 
action. On June 2, 1994 the justice minister introduced this 
comprehensive, two-phase set of proposals to amend portions 
of the 10-year old Young Offenders Act. These proposals reflect 
an extensive process of consultation and consideration 
regarding violent young offenders who commit serious crimes. 
The proposed amendments will improve the act's ability to deal 
effectively with serious youth crime and improve public 
protection.
<P>
	There are several highlights to these proposals: increased 
sentences for teenagers convicted of first or second degree 
murder in youth court; dealing with 16 and 17-year-olds charged 
with serious personal offences in adult court unless they can 
show a judge otherwise, and we heard the debate a few minutes 
ago between the Bloc member and the member on this side of the 
House about the decision of the judge that public protection and 
rehabilitation can both be achieved through youth court; and 
extending the time that 16 and 17-year old young offenders who 
have been convicted of murder in an adult court must serve 
before they can be considered for parole.
<P>
	Bill C-37 calls for improved measures for information 
sharing between professionals such as school officials, police 
and selected members of the public when public safety is at risk, 
as well as retaining the records of serious young offenders a 
little longer and encouraging rehabilitation and treatment of 
young offenders in the community when appropriate.
<P>
	Some members of the Chamber will have us believe that these 
measures are not tough enough. We heard the debate this 
afternoon. They are seeking harsher penalties for each category 
of the Young Offenders Act. Some even advocate a hard line 
approach that would call upon applying the act to offenders as 
young as 10 years of age. They argue that the public will be 
better protected from the serious antisocial behaviour of some 
children if these children were included under the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4897"> 4897 </A></B>
<P>
	A federal-provincial committee studied the minimum age 
issue in 1990 and recommended keeping the age of 12 and 
strengthening provincial legislation where required. The act 
covers youth under the age of 18 and was set at 17 because many 
adult rights and responsibilities, for example voting, alcohol 
consumption, et cetera, begin at age 18.
<P>
	However many criminologists have argued that the preventive 
and rehabilitative strategies available in the youth court system 
are in the long run more effective at reducing youth crime than 
strategies which rely mainly on the deterrent factor associated 
with the adult penal system. In the long run harsher jail 
sentences, tougher parole laws and bigger prisons will not make 
our communities any safer from violent youth crime. Quick 
measures will not provide a long term solution to the issue of 
young violent offenders.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	What should be done and what will be done once the second 
phase of the government's plan goes into action is to change the 
conditions that create violence among young people. We must 
respond to the issue of violence among young people with well 
thought out strategies to change the root causes of such 
behaviour.
<P>
	I know that over the next six to eight months the justice 
committee will be undertaking a thorough assessment of the 
Young Offenders Act. We must involve our young people in 
these discussions, as well as those in the community who are 
most affected by fear of crime.
<P>
	We must not create a punitive repressive youth justice system 
that will target blacks, natives and the poor. The long term 
solution will call for co-ordination between the community, 
social services and the justice system to tackle the complex 
questions surrounding youth crime.
<P>
	Violence against women and children, poverty, shortage of 
recreational facilities, lack of opportunities, dysfunctional 
families, racism are all underlying factors which lead to youth 
crime. We must all work together toward seeking alternatives.
<P>
	Prevention of violence and crime will surely be our ultimate 
goal, not the punitive way in which some members of this House 
would have us go.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have an easy question for the hon. member. In her 
speech, she talked about the transfer to adult court and she 
seemed to be in favour of the system proposed by the Minister of 
Justice in his amendments. Does the parliamentary secretary not 
realize that under the present system a young offender between 
the ages of 14 and 17 can be transferred to adult court? If the 
prosecution asks for the transfer to adult court of an accused 
between the ages of 14 and 17, the judge can order the transfer, 
in which case the regular system applies and the sentences are 
the ones set for adults.
<P>
	If she is aware of that, why does she want to change a system 
which has been operating for 10 years? If it is because of a 
particular problem, I would like to know what it is and how we 
could solve it, apart from the proposed amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, the changes that are proposed 
and the changes that have occurred are as a result of the serious 
consultation which has taken place. We have also looked at the 
age at which the responsibility of sentencing could be placed on 
individuals as a result of the kind of crime committed. When the 
member says they could be transferred at age 14 directly into 
adult court, I am not sure whether he has missed the part in Bill 
C-37 which speaks to this consideration. The decision of 
moving from youth court to adult court is made by the judge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member that I know that, 
according to the bill, a young offender between the ages of 14 
and 16 can be transferred. The transfer system remains, but I 
wanted to draw the attention of the hon. member to the fact that 
the system exists in the present act, for young offenders between 
14 and 17. I wanted to point that out to the hon. member.
<P>
	In her answer the parliamentary secretary says that the 
decision to propose automatic referral to adult court for 
offenders aged 16 and 17 had been taken after serious 
consultation. I would like to know which groups asked for those 
changes or in which provinces they were most vocal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, at this point I cannot delineate 
for the member which provinces and which groups provided the 
specific input for the bill before us. It is important to note that 
we were attempting to deal with serious crimes, first and second 
offences, the ability of the judge to decide whether the crime is 
serious enough or the offence is serious enough to be moved.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate 
in this debate.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament from metropolitan Toronto I can 
assure members that many people in my riding of 
Parkdale-High Park do not feel safe in their neighbourhoods 
any more. Seniors are afraid. Women live in fear. They are afraid 
to come out to town hall meetings in the evenings. Even some of 
the schoolyards appear to be dangerous places for the children. 
Parents complain that they are finding syringes in the sandboxes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4898"> 4898 </A></B>
<P>
and are afraid their children could get pricked with those and get 
AIDS, et cetera.
<P>
	That is why I welcome tougher legislation to make the Young 
Offenders Act more effective. Acting on a promise from the 
Liberal election platform of October 26, 1993 the Liberal 
government is cracking down on serious youth crime and 
making the protection of society our first priority.
<P>
	In the chapter entitled ``Safe Homes and Safe Streets'', the 
Liberals promised to double the maximum sentence from five 
years to 10 years for first degree murder. Bill C-37 makes good 
on our election promise and our commitment to Canadians.
<P>
	Let us look at parole for young offenders convicted of murder. 
No longer will they be automatically eligible for parole after 
serving only five years of their sentence. This is a firm measure 
to ensure that the protection of society comes first.
<P>
	Of course there are many critics of this legislation as we have 
heard in this debate already today. Some say the government has 
not gone far enough, that we should simply lock up the young 
people who commit serious crimes and throw away the key. If 
the solution were that simple, we would have legislated crime 
out of existence long ago.
<P>
	Let us look at the United States, the country with the highest 
incarceration rate of all the developed nations, yet longer 
sentences and stricter penalties are not enough to prevent 
crimes. Canada follows the United States with the second 
highest incarceration rate. It is higher than Japan, higher than 
France, Italy, the United Kingdom and even Turkey, but still we 
have not eliminated crime.
<P>
	It is quite clear that deterrence is not enough. Government 
recognizes that the justice system can only deal with young 
offenders after a crime has been committed, but once a young 
offender commits a crime, it is too late. The real solution lies in 
crime prevention.
<P>
	In my own riding of Parkdale-High Park, residents in 
Parkdale have banded together to form the Parkdale focus 
community watch. This highly innovative group works closely 
with police and public authorities to have an impact on critical 
decisions which affect the community. They liaise with the 
liquor licensing board, the police, business associations, 
ratepayer groups, anyone who is interested in the community to 
network with this group.
<P>
	Community watch will do things such as safety audits in the 
community. A subcommittee will do a safety audit. They might 
see that a telephone booth is in a dark area where the drug trade 
is going on. There might be a lot of prostitution in that corner, a 
lot of fights break out, et cetera. They report back to the full 
committee. A phone call goes to Bell and negotiations start. 
That phone booth is either removed or lighting is intensified. 
The city is co-operating; the lighting along Queen Street has 
been intensified again to help prevent crime.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Justice paid a visit to Parkdale and 
met with this community watch. Its members were very 
impressed with the way the minister is communicating and 
dialoguing with the local communities. They were impressed 
that the minister offered to come back to see how they were 
doing with this community model of crime prevention. This was 
a unique opportunity for concerned residents to have a voice and 
affect justice reform. The Parkdale focus community watch 
could easily serve as a model for other communities, a shining 
example that we all have a stake in crime prevention.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Crime prevention has to begin at home. As a former teacher, 
principal and co-ordinator working with disadvantaged 
children, I believe that is where we should place a lot of our 
resources: helping parents to give them parenting techniques so 
that children from day one are not led down the road to crime.
<P>
	In the school system, I grew up in a school system and I 
administered schools with 1,500 students and schools with 300 
students. We used corporal punishment. I had no discipline 
problems. The schools ran very well, but we resorted to corporal 
punishment. I doubt whether in 1994 we should have to resort to 
that kind of corporal punishment. I think we do have to make a 
school policy of zero crime tolerance, as many schools are doing 
today.
<P>
	I congratulate the minister and I support the bill 100 per cent. 
However I am very concerned with what is happening in our 
Parliament. I received a letter just the other day which states: 
``Dear Mr. Flis: Every member of Parliament is being provided 
with a secret PIN number and asked to call 1-900-451-4020 to 
vote in referendum 94 on the Young Offenders Act. If the 
majority position in the referendum indicates a need to change 
the Young Offenders Act, Ted White will draft a private 
member's bill for introduction to Parliament''. Then it states to 
call that same number but $1 will be charged for the first minute 
and 95 cents for each additional minute will be billed if you stay 
on the line after the beep. It states that you need your parents' 
consent to incur these charges if you are not over 18. I want to 
assure him I am over 18 and I do not need my parents' consent to 
call him.
<P>
	I do not have time to quote further from the letter. However it 
shocks me that a member of the Reform Party who was elected 
freely in a democratic election would resort to the use of secret 
PIN numbers to give us direction on what should be in the Young 
Offenders Act. Who gave that member the right to give me a 
secret PIN number? It is not secret; I will give it to the public: 
669746562211. That is my secret PIN number. You, Mr. 
Speaker, have a secret PIN number too and you are probably on 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4899"> 4899 </A></B>
<P>
1-900 number which is used for getting sex into the homes and 
all other advertising over the phone lines.
<P>
	It shocks me. We are having a serious debate on the young 
offenders bill which most people have asked for and the 
government has brought in and the Reform Party resorts to this 
kind of trash. I hope the Reform Party will learn that we do not 
do things secretly. And you have to have a touch tone phone. 
What about all those Canadians who cannot afford that service? 
Are they denied the right to have input to their member of 
Parliament?
<P>
	The Liberal Party is very open and transparent. When we want 
to put something into legislation, we put it in and debate it 
openly in this House.
<P>
	I hope the Reform Party will not resort to those kinds of 
tactics. They have been used in many countries, but I hope they 
will not be used in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to enlighten the hon. member who just spoke, in an 
electronic vote to ensure there is one vote per caller, it is 
necessary to give a number which identifies that vote. Once the 
vote has been cast that number can no longer be used, just in case 
the hon. member was misinformed about the purpose of the PIN 
number. It is not an infringement on privacy. It is so the votes 
cannot be stacked or that multiple voting by one person cannot 
take place.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	The member opposite is under no obligation certainly to cast 
his vote or take part in this type of a constituency poll. Perhaps 
that may be more suitable to the member's wishes because this 
government has for so long simply closed the doors, kept the 
public out and made decisions behind closed doors. I would like 
to ask the member if that is his preference, of making decisions 
in government that would affect the people behind closed doors 
without input from the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that 
question. We are not doing anything behind closed doors. We are 
bringing it here to the Parliament of Canada. Why do we have to 
hold secret votes through PIN numbers? Is this not where we are 
going to vote? Is this not where the member is going to represent 
his constituents? Does he not keep in touch with his 
constituents?
<P>
	What about the poor people, what about the people who still 
have dial phones? They cannot phone their local member of 
Parliament. What is wrong with talking with them face to face, 
with holding town hall meetings, telephoning them, et cetera?
<P>
	I am glad the hon. member raised this concern but this is 
where we vote, not through 1-900 numbers.
<P>
	What about the poor people? Do they not have rights to input 
to their MPs? It looks like in the Reform territory it is only for 
the rich, it is only who can afford the push button numbers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the hon. member could make clear what his objection is. 
If I understand him correctly he is objecting to the idea that 
members of Parliament should be asked to express themselves 
in this way because obviously we have the opportunity that other 
Canadians do not. We can vote here, not with a PIN number, but 
with our vote as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	That is certainly what I intend to do. I was confused when I 
received a letter inviting me to cast a vote in this way because it 
seems to me that I have that right to do so as a member of 
Parliament. I will do it when it comes up.
<P>
	It would be interesting to know whether this is a referendum 
among members of Parliament that is sort of a substitute 
mechanism for the votes that we take here, or whether we were 
simply being included in a larger referendum. I thought that is 
what a certain Reform Party member was up to. I received the 
thing today and now I am not sure exactly what is going on. 
Perhaps the member would want to comment on that.
<P>
	Perhaps he could also say whether he objects to the whole 
concept. Let us assume for a minute that everyone has the kind 
of phone that is needed. I take it the member would still have 
some reservations about this kind of process. Would he? Is it 
simply a matter of everyone not having the right kind of phone?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member sits so close 
to the Reform members and I wish they would turn around 
sometimes and seek his advice because he has been here for a 
long time and knows what the democratic process is all about.
<P>
	Initially I paid very little attention to it because I thought it 
was just surveying the members of Parliament. When I saw the 
line ``you need your parents' consent to incur these charges if 
you are younger than 18'', I was a little offended because I only 
have one parent left. My mother is 86 and I do not know whether 
she would give her consent to vote this way.
<P>
	I suspect that this letter was sent to the public and it was 
concerned that someone under 18 would not pay the Reform for 
that one dollar call, and 95 cents thereafter. That was my 
concern.
<P>
	That anyone should charge to glean people's opinion, people 
who voted for us, my goodness, is the hon. member not getting a 
high enough salary? Is that why he is putting a charge on this? Is 
he waiting for his pension or is he afraid he is not going to get a 
pension because he will not be here very long?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4900"> 4900 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a concern that this letter went not only to the members 
of Parliament, but I suspect that this letter probably went to the 
public at large.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-37, amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act, amendments that Canadians have been 
requesting, amendments that are long overdue.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago I received in my office a package of 
information from the justice department about the Young 
Offenders Act. The information was all about the perception and 
reality of the Young Offenders Act. The information appeared to 
be a justification of the Young Offenders Act as it now stands 
with statistics and convincing bureaucrats telling us that the 
perceptions that Canadians have of the act are wrong.
<P>
	It was therefore no great surprise to learn that the amendments 
to the Young Offenders Act that the minister is proposing are 
quite minor.
<P>
	I am pleased that some changes are being made to the 
legislation and while I would not like to see young people locked 
up and the key thrown away, I would like to have seen stronger 
amendments being proposed.
<P>
	Canadians have reached the point at which they are 
demanding safety for women, children and ordinary people on 
the streets and in their own homes. One of the fastest growing 
categories of crime is that committed by young offenders. It is 
not uncommon to hear of the door of a home being kicked down 
and the family terrorized, beaten and robbed.
<P>
	Throughout the country people are being beaten, stabbed, 
kicked and murdered by juveniles. We hear the authorities 
saying to people things like do not take matters into your own 
hands, leave it to the police.
<P>
	Instead of people being more secure the wave of youth crime 
continues to rise, with sentences young people receive from the 
courts being a poor reflection of the severity of the crime.
<P>
	How have we ever allowed such ugly violence to become an 
every day occurrence in Canada, this country that treasures 
peace and beauty? We have had human behaviour experts tell us 
on and on why violence is a growing phenomenon. Violence in 
the home breeds violence. The structure of the schools stifles 
imagination. Serial killer cards, violent cartoons, Dungeons and 
Dragons games blur the line between fantasy and reality. There 
is the old favourite: ``Dad was drunk and mom couldn't get up in 
the morning so how can anyone expect better from their kids?''.
<P>
	Unfortunate as a child may be to be born to such parents this 
really is nothing new. Fewer children than we would like to 
believe have ideal parents. For a long time before this present 
day crescendo of modern violence children with less than ideal 
parents grew up  knowing right from wrong and being able to 
restrain themselves from causing vandalism and mayhem.
<P>
	For those who did commit an offence authorities did not 
tolerate this behaviour and the offender was usually dealt with 
swiftly and properly.
<P>
	I always find it refreshing to go home to the 
Cariboo-Chilcotin where great intelligence is not as important 
as good common sense. There people remember that once they 
were children too and they remember what it was like to be a 
child. Childhood is not something new. People who live in 
Horsefly or Tatlayoko, British Columbia, for example, offer 
some other reasons for the difficulties our communities are 
having with youth criminals.
<P>
	What are they saying about young people and crime? In a 
letter from Quesnel signed by 20 constituents they say: ``If we 
are to avoid the increase in crime which is currently plaguing 
Canada we must have disciplinary measures which are strong 
enough to discourage criminal intent. Young people today are 
more criminally aggressive because they are very aware no 
action can be taken against them''.
<P>
	Among some of our youth this attitude is reinforced by peer 
pressure that whatever crime they commit will go unpunished. 
Even if caught by the police and then moved to the family 
courtroom and then passed on to the unending counselling, the 
community service, the probation officer, and even perhaps the 
incarceration, these only become subjects of ridicule, more 
material for building the macho image, the badge of acceptance 
for those who really count within the gang. However, there is 
nothing to change the attitude or cause them to search for 
different friends.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	It was not always this way. I once had an elderly man come 
into my pastor's study. In the course of our conversation he told 
me that he had once done something that caused him to be 
sentenced for a long time in the former B.C. penitentiary. After 
serving a good portion of his sentence he was called into the 
warden's office where he was informed that by taking a number 
of strokes of the paddle the remainder of his sentence would be 
reduced by half. Without any hesitation he agreed to take the 
paddle.
<P>
	However, after having been securely bound with leather 
straps and receiving those strokes he said to me: ``I didn't 
realize what I was asking for. Afterwards I knew I would do 
anything to avoid that kind of punishment again''.
<P>
	After his release he received an education, became an 
accountant, married, raised a family and contributed much to his 
community. If violence breeds violence, as we are told ad 
nauseam, it certainly did not in this case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4901"> 4901 </A></B>
<P>
	What the experts so frequently fail to mention is that violence 
is part of everyone's make-up. Its seeds are in all of us. Any 
child psychologist knows that to develop normally a child must 
have limits. How often do we hear the expression `the terrible 
twos', the age when a child first realizes that he or she can try 
mom or dad's patience to the limit?
<P>
	One of the responsibilities of parents is to establish 
appropriate limits within which their children may discover 
reality. As a parent I know that these limits are seriously tested 
by a growing child with expanding horizons. Whether it is the 
terrible twos or a teenager who is continually coming in after 
curfew, sometimes force is required to maintain even the most 
appropriate limits when negotiations break down.
<P>
	Such an event was reported in the B.C. media some months 
ago. A mother who happened to be a medical doctor took her 
little child to the supermarket to get some groceries. Things 
were not going so well between mother and child and a couple of 
roll around the floor, kicking the feet tantrums had to be dealt 
with quietly but firmly. It was not easy to get the groceries 
through the checkout and into the car with a yelling child but it 
got done. While driving out of the parking lot the child had 
another tantrum, almost causing a car accident. At this point the 
mother pulled over to the curb, stopped the car and administered 
the flat of her hand three or four times to the child's bottom. 
Then with the situation finally under control she prepared to 
drive home.
<P>
	What this mother did not realize was that a government social 
worker had witnessed the whole episode from the beginning in 
the store to the end in the car. With the authority given by the 
B.C. government she removed the child from the mother's care.
<P>
	If we are concerned about violence in our society we need to 
recall that there was less violence before corporal punishment 
was outlawed. Children need protection from beatings and abuse 
at the hands of abusive adults with uncontrollable tempers, but 
we cannot compare a considered, well controlled spanking of a 
child or a well measured, state administered paddling with the 
uncontrolled violence that is being committed by youthful 
criminals. There are limits beyond which behaviour is no longer 
acceptable.
<P>
	I am not advocating that violence is the answer to righting the 
wrongs of our young people. I am all for programs in which 
troubled young people have the opportunity to take stock of 
themselves and with proper guidance are able to realize that a 
life of crime is not the way to go. I do realize the amendments 
the minister is proposing contain suggestions for rehabilitation 
instead of the offender being held in custody. In some cases this 
is the right way to treat an individual.
<P>
	However, my main concern with the proposed amendments is 
twofold. First, the age of responsibility should have been 
lowered to 10. While violent crime tends to be committed by 
youthful offenders, we are  hearing more and more in the 
communities about children who cannot be charged because 
they are under the age of responsibility. They have been stealing 
cars and other personal possessions. These children should be 
held accountable. Their problems should be addressed before 
they continue down the road to a full blown life of crime.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Being held responsible brings me to my second area of 
concern: the rights of the victim. All too often there is little 
consideration for the victim or the victim's family. Young 
offenders go to court, the sentence is passed, and the general 
public rarely gets to know what is going on. All young offenders 
who are charged and appear before a court should have their 
names and the details of the offences published.
<P>
	Canadians have a right, particularly neighbours, to know what 
is happening in their neighbourhoods. While the proposed 
amendments could allow release of information about young 
offenders to affected members of the public, it is my opinion 
that all Canadians should be aware of the offences that young 
people commit.
<P>
	The amendments would allow for victims, if they so desire, to 
make a statement about how a young offender's crime has 
affected them. I applaud this aspect of the amendments and hope 
that all victims of crime will allow their account of the ordeal to 
be read out in court.
<P>
	Not only should the public be told about young offenders. 
There should be accountability for young offenders' actions. I 
note the minister is recommending that youth who commit 
property crimes or less serious offences could be made to do 
community service or pay restitution to the victim. That is a 
good start, but how about holding the parents of the children 
jointly responsible for their sons' or daughters' activities?
<P>
	Canadians have long been calling for a better justice system. 
The current Young Offenders Act, a small part of the justice 
system, is simply not working. Canadians want to see sentences 
reflect the severity of the crime. They want to feel safer in their 
homes, on their streets and in their communities.
<P>
	The minor amendments to the Young Offenders Act being 
proposed are simply addressing the promises made in the 
Liberal's red book election propaganda. They are not addressing 
the needs of Canadians from coast to coast. Canadians are 
concerned about teenage murders, the increasing number of 
teenage gangs and young people going to school armed with 
weapons. Canadians have a right to receive some assurance and 
to know that parliamentarians are working with them in mind.
<P>
	An in depth review of the Young Offenders Act will be made 
by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. The 
public will be involved to the greatest extent possible. We are 
told the committee will make consultations. Canadians are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4902"> 4902 </A></B>
<P>
going to tell the government just what they want to see changed. 
I applaud this, but some changes cannot be legislated.
<P>
	In much of the correspondence I receive is an underlying 
theme that children are growing up in a society devoid of hard 
work ethics and moral values. We have to teach our children the 
values with which many Canadians grew up, values that enabled 
them to build the country to be what it is, values that somehow in 
the materialistic and morally bankrupt society seem to have 
been lost. If the government listens and if it includes the public's 
ideas for reforming the Young Offenders Act maybe we will see 
the real changes that are being called for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the comments of my hon. 
colleague. I compliment him for obviously spending a lot of 
time going through all clauses of the bill. Unfortunately or 
fortunately, depending on how one looks at it, I do not agree with 
many of his conclusions. I want to compliment him because he 
has obviously put a lot of care, time and effort into preparing for 
what he has done today.
<P>
	I disagree with him on a number of areas. The bill is a 
compromise for what is asked by some who I do not believe 
represent the majority of Canadians. It addresses those issues 
that need to be addressed in the immediate future. The bill is 
going to be up for review in its entirety as the minister 
requested.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	Knowing how thoughtful the member has been in his remarks, 
in spite of the fact that I disagree with a number of them, I want 
to get back to the issue of polling as started by one of his 
colleagues. I have great difficulty with legislating that way on 
all kinds of grounds: on moral grounds to start with because 
when we are legislating for a small group of people we can as 
legislators be easily swayed, particularly when a system is 
designed so that one actually pays for the call.
<P>
	I submit, although I am not a sociologist, that system would 
automatically lead one to pay when one is against rather than to 
pay to express one's opinion. That is the way people normally 
think. One would not likely pay to phone someone to say one 
agrees with the status quo. One is more likely to pay to protest. 
That is human nature.
<P>
	Does the member think this kind of polling is proper? After 
all, one has to pay a private enterprise to be issued with House of 
Commons letterhead, with the coat of arms of our country on the 
top. It was signed at the bottom by a person purporting to be 
chief returning officer. I believe that to be impersonating an 
officer of Parliament.
<P>
	Chief Returning Officer Victor Bennington signed the letter 
with the coat of arms of Canada on it. It asks MPs to make a 
telephone call which results in an expenditure to some 
enterprise, the telephone company or whatever, of $1 plus 95 
cents and so on. We could easily argue that this is a fund raising 
letter on House of Commons  letterhead, signed by someone 
pretending to be an officer of Parliament.
<P>
	Is this in the name of justice? Will this make Canada a more 
just society? After listening to what that member said and as 
profoundly as he believes what he said, I cannot help but ask him 
whether he agrees with the nonsense that all members were 
distributed earlier today or whenever it was.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin did not refer to the survey in his remarks, I 
am sure he is aware from question period that he does not need to 
reply to the question. However, he has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, whether the questions and 
comments are about what another member did or whether they 
are on what I put forward to the House, I would be happy to 
respond only to the extent of conversations I have had with my 
Reform colleague.
<P>
	Polling is something that every party does. I am sure the 
Liberal Party does it. The member is attempting to poll a broad 
cross-section of Canadians to find out their views. I do not see 
anything wrong with that. I guess we disagree on that point too.
<P>
	With regard to payment, the payment is simply for the costs of 
the poll. Usually polls are done and the government ends up 
paying for them from the public purse. The member has said that 
this would be a poll paid by those who wish to participate in it. It 
has been set up so that a person with a PIN can only vote once. 
They can only vote with the knowledge that if they do so they are 
going to be paying for the costs of the calls and the running the 
poll. That is all it is.
<P>
	The alternative to that is to hire a company, charge it to 
government expense, and not let the results be known, keep 
them secret. That is not the Reform way of doing it. We are 
doing it transparently. We are doing it openly. The results will be 
announced for the Canadian public to know. That is the Reform 
way of doing it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was rather surprised to hear the hon. member say 
these are minor amendments. I do not think we are looking at the 
same bill. If we look carefully at the highlights of the bill, 
according to the minister there will be an increase in sentencing 
from 5 to 10 years and from 3 to 7 years for certain types of 
offences. I would not call that minor, Mr. Speaker, when we say 
that a young person will spend four or five years more in prison 
for a crime.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, your time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I think the hon. member should simply 
read the bill, and he will realize that these are not minor 
amendments, and that on the contrary, the amendments this bill 
contains are very serious.

	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> We disagree all over the place, do we not? It 
seems to me that a victim who has lost health and lost family 
members has lost a major and significant part of their life as 
well.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCOPACKAGING">TOBACCO PACKAGING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to pursue a question that I asked of the government a couple of 
weeks ago. It was actually answered by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It had to do with the testimony in committee of someone 
representing the tobacco industry who threatened to use the 
North American free trade agreement and the protection of 
trademark and the property rights entrenched therein to get in 
the way of the government's apparent intention to bring in plain 
packaging of cigarettes as a way of discouraging the use of 
tobacco and I presume particularly by way of discouraging 
young people who may be attracted by elegant and attractive 
packaging, although presumably this is something that not just 
young people are vulnerable to.
<P>
	I say apparent intention of the government because I am not 
absolutely sure that the government and the Minister of Health 
are really intent on doing this. I hope they are because I think it 
is a worthwhile experiment and I hope that they will not be 
intimidated by these kinds of threats.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister answered my question he said he 
had a different view of the free trade agreement. We have seen a 
few times when the Prime Minister thinks that if he has a 
different view of the free trade agreement this is enough. The 
fact is that the free trade agreement has a text that can be 
adjudicated in a dispute settlement process and in a variety of 
other ways. It may not matter what the Prime Minister's view is 
if it is the view of certain multinational corporations that regard 
what the government plans to do as objectionable.
<P>
	If they take the view that the agreement prohibits this, they 
have a great deal of ability to enforce that. It would not be out of 
sync with what the agreement actually seeks to do, as I 
understand it, and that is to limit the power of government to get 
in the way of transnational business.
<P>
	This is not the sort of idea that comes out of left field, so to 
speak. This is the purpose of these agreements, to limit the 
power of democratically elected governments to get in the way 
of the profit strategies of transnational corporations.
<P>
	We have seen other elements of this where the same kind of 
property right has been entrenched in these free trade 
agreements or in the GATT or even more shamefully in this 
House before these agreements were even signed. I am thinking 
now of the legislation which in two different stages brought 
about the abandonment of the generic drug legislation that we 
had in this country. Again, it was one of the ways in which this 
new free trading regime we have as a result of the FTA and 
NAFTA and now as a result of the GATT has given new freedom 
to the corporate agenda.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	I hope the government will go ahead with this experiment and 
not draw back. If it draws back we will never know whether the 
threat that was made that day, even though it was publicly 
sloughed off by the Prime Minister, is in fact the real reason. I 
would certainly encourage the government to test the agreement 
on this and in other ways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the Prime 
Minister answered the question very well when he said to the 
hon. member in reply: ``I do not think NAFTA has a lot to say 
about the way we should control that type of problem in 
Canada''. He went on to say: ``Sometimes we hear things in 
committee we do not agree with. Evidently the hon. member did 
not share that view, and I do not either''.
<P>
	The member should have been satisfied by the Prime 
Minister's answer. However, I will try and elaborate on it.
<P>
	First I would state that possible proposals for plain packaging 
requirements for cigarettes are still under review by the 
committee. The government awaits the report of the committee 
with great interest. The committee recommendations would be 
studied by the government with careful attention to Canada's 
obligation under NAFTA and under other treaties such as the 
GATT.
<P>
	However NAFTA contains provisions allowing exceptions to 
trade mark rights. NAFTA also includes provisions that 
recognizes Canada's right to adopt or maintain sanitary 
measures and standard related measures for the protection of 
human health. As well, the government will ensure that any 
measure it chooses to adopt will not only achieve our goal of 
protecting the health of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4904"> 4904 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians but will also be consistent with our international 
obligations.
<P>
	I hope this additional information will be satisfactory to the 
member.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UREAFORMALDEHYDEFOAM">UREA FORMALDEHYDE FOAM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 1 I put a 
question regarding urea formaldehyde foam and I would like to 
put on record a little bit of the investigation that I have 
undertaken in this regard.
<P>
	I am interested in this because a constituent has been having 
some trouble selling a home with urea formaldehyde foam in it.
<P>
	I contacted Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and 
was assured that whether a house had UFFI foam, as it is known, 
in it or not made no difference to their loaning money or insuring 
such a mortgage. I was told that the banks take a similar view. 
However, apparently some real estate boards in their agreement 
to sell a home require that it be stated if the home has urea 
formaldehyde foam in it. This has caused my constituent and 
others some concern.
<P>
	I might just review very quickly that this insulation was 
approved in Canada for use in exterior wood frame walls. It has a 
good ``R'' value and in fact under the Canadian Home Insulation 
Program in 1975 to 1978 the government paid $500 to home 
owners who would install this insulation.
<P>
	Apparently during the curing process, some formaldehyde 
comes off the cure. Formaldehyde is colourless, with a strong 
odour and can generally be detected at parts above one part per 
million. Unfortunately, formaldehyde is found in dry cleaning 
chemicals, paper products, no iron fabrics, diapers, pillow 
cases, the glue in particle board and plywood, cosmetics, paints, 
cigarette smoke, exhaust from automobiles, gas appliances, 
fireplaces and wood stoves. It may well be that some of the 
crimes attributed to urea formaldehyde foam arise from other 
household products.
<P>
	The irony of the situation is that the federal government 
banned this insulation in 1980 and then spent $272 million in the 
ensuing seven years to assist home owners in replacing urea 
formaldehyde foam at a cost of $8,500 per home.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	A further irony is that the longest civil suit in Canadian 
history ended on December 13, 1991, when Mr. Justice Rene 
Hurtubise from the Quebec Superior Court handed down a 
decision saying that the owners of the homes who brought the 
case had failed to prove that UFFI had made them sick, offered 
no proof that UFFI should be removed and did not prove that 
leaving UFFI in place reduced the value of their homes. This 
finding has been echoed by pathologists and many others who 
have tested these homes.
<P>
	I will conclude with the conclusion from a report by Carson 
Dunlap and Associates Limited, consulting engineers, that says: 
``We believe that those who have urea formaldehyde foam 
insulation in their homes should enjoy their houses and sleep 
well at night. It is the sincere hope of the authors that the 
marketplace will respond appropriately. The owners of 
properties with this type of insulation should not be penalized 
financially and no stigma should be attached to these homes. We 
would further urge real estate associations and boards across 
Canada to consider dropping the UFFI clause from purchase 
contracts. Similarly, we would ask mortgage lenders not to 
penalize those who have UFFI in their homes. UFFI is simply 
not the problem it was once feared to be''.
<P>
	I would hope that the minister would be able when the current 
appeal which I believe is in process happens that we could get 
this matter sent to rest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in 
the House and address the issue of urea formaldehyde foam 
insulation and in particular its effect on market value of homes 
insulated with UFFI.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague pointed out, during the 1970s many 
homes were insulated with UFFI. Let me assure everyone that no 
Canadian whose home has been insulated with UFFI has been 
denied mortgage insurance from Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. In fact during the past few years homes insulated 
with UFFI have been trading on a regular basis.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that for the past year a UFFI 
declaration has not been required for the purpose of obtaining 
mortgage insurance under the National Housing Act. Through 
mortgage insurance CMHC provides Canadians with equal 
access to mortgage financing anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	I would further like to add that the fact that CMHC is 
providing mortgage insurance on homes that have contained 
UFFI even though remedial action has been taken has helped to 
minimize any negative perceptions.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague may know, the six UFFI cases 
determined by all of the parties involved to be representative of 
all the issues at stake are still before the Court of Appeal of 
Quebec. An appeal date of September 11, 1995 has tentatively 
been scheduled. I would further point out that in their factum the 
plaintiffs have removed all their claims related to health.
<P>
	My apologies for my voice, Mr. Speaker. I had my tonsils out.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MAGAZINEINDUSTRY">MAGAZINE INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to raise again the question I had raised some months ago 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4905"> 4905 </A></B>
<P>
concerning the government's response to the task force report on 
the Canadian magazine industry. The task force report, I 
believe, was made public in March though I understand the 
government was aware of the major recommendations in 
January.
<P>
	It has now been approximately five months since the 
government was aware of the task force report 
recommendations and some decisions are needed.
<P>
	The task force made some very excellent recommendations 
but there was one recommendation that concerned me and I 
think concerns all those Canadians who would like to maintain 
our cultural identity.
<P>
	The task force recommended that magazines that otherwise 
would be subject to the proposed tax as of the date of this report 
should be exempt at the number of issues per annum that were 
distributed in Canada in the year preceding this report. In other 
words, this means the task force was recommending that <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> which had started a split run be allowed to continue 
to print a Canadian edition. There is quite a bit of opposition to 
this and it is about time the government made some decision on 
this.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Split runs are American magazines which incur all of their 
costs in terms of writing, editorial content and so forth in the 
United States and then, in essence, dump their product on the 
Canadian market. The law now prohibits Canadian advertisers 
from deducting their advertising costs in those magazines. 
Therefore, it is an effective barrier in attempting to maintain the 
viability of the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	So far we have had no commitments from the government 
regarding split runs and the postal subsidy which was also part 
of the recommendation of the task force. To consider allowing 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> to continue what I would call its illegal 
practices, even when it initiated the split run it claimed it got 
around Canadian law by not physically shipping its contents 
across the border but rather electronically sending its contents 
to a Canadian printing house. For all intents and purposes, I still 
cannot see how this is legal and has been allowed under the law.
<P>
	It is about time that the government stood up to this type of 
pressure particularly from Time-Warner and its magazines. 
Already <I>Reader's Digest</I> is deemed Canadian for the postal 
subsidy. I understand for example that the revenue from <I>Time</I> 
magazine, the Canadian edition, is greater than the entire profits 
of the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	As well there is an urgency in this matter. As things stand now 
we have no law in place to prevent more split run editions. If a 
number of American magazines, let us say <I>Newsweek</I>, wants to 
set up a split run and do exactly the same as <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
has done, there is really no law in effect now to prevent 
<I>Newsweek</I> or any other American magazine company from 
carrying out and establishing another split run.
<P>
	As well, why would we allow <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, having 
broken the law, to be rewarded as opposed to any others which 
attempt to do a split run and which will be forced to cease and 
desist? It makes no sense at all.
<P>
	It is time the government stood up for Canadian cultural 
industries and institutions. It is time it tested the cultural 
exemption under the free trade agreement. It is time the 
government accepted the report that rejected the one 
recommendation that would exempt <I>Sports Illustrated</I>.
<P>
	It is time the government acted because the magazine industry 
in this country is in a terrible financial situation. The 
uncertainty the lack of action and determination by the 
government is creating is hurting the industry even more.
<P>
	I hope the government in its response today will be able to 
announce to the House and to Canadians that indeed the 
government has made a decision, it will accept the 
recommendations of the report with the one exception that it 
will not allow <I>Sports Illustrated</I> to continue as a split run 
edition.
<P>
	I look forward to the reply.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, the task force 
on the Canadian magazine industry released its report on March 
24. The task force recommended that a new excise tax be applied 
to split run magazines distributed in Canada. The task force also 
recommended that split run that would have been subject to the 
tax as of the date of the report should be exempt for the number 
of issues published in the year preceding the report.
<P>
	We welcome the report of the task force. This is a priority for 
the government and we intend to respond in a way which will 
safeguard the economic foundations of the Canadian magazine 
industry.
<P>
	As the Minister of Canadian Heritage stated in this House on 
the day the report was released, it will be important to consult 
with interested parties before the government presents any new 
policy before this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government confirms its commitment to a 
long-established strategic objective aimed at protecting the 
financial basis of the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	To reach this objective, the government uses instruments that 
promote channelling advertising revenue to Canadian 
magazines, since to be viable, a Canadian magazine industry 
must have a sound financial basis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The establishment of split-run Canadian regional editions of 
foreign titles which contain advertising aimed at Canadian 
markets is thus not consistent with the policy because revenues 
from advertising directed at Canadians flow to these editions of 
foreign titles.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4906"> 4906 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is thus committed to ensuring that Canadians 
have access to Canadian ideas and information through 
genuinely Canadian periodicals, while not restricting the sale of 
foreign periodicals in Canada. It will be in light of these policy 
objectives that the government is studying the task force report 
to determine its response.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under our standing orders the motion 
to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Also 
under our standing orders we adjourn until 10 o'clock tomorrow 
morning.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
