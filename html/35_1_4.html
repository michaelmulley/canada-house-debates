	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to join in this 
debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne at 
the beginning of a brand new Parliament and the beginning of 
the mandate of our new government.
<P>
	In that government I am very grateful to have the opportunity 
to represent the people of Regina-Wascana. I want to thank 
them for the trust they vested in me in the election of October 25.
<P>
	Regina-Wascana includes the southern half of the city of 
Regina and a rural area running south and east from the city. I am 
proud to represent Saskatchewan's provincial capital, together 
with several thousand rural residents. I would note that most of 
the rural voters now in Regina-Wascana were previously in a 
Saskatchewan constituency known in earlier Parliaments as 
Assiniboia which I had the honour to represent in this House in 
the 1970s. I am pleased that a respected friend and colleague 
from that earlier Parliament has been chosen by this House as its 
chief presiding officer. I also want to congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, upon your election to this high responsibility.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to the two distinguished members who 
moved and seconded the Address in Reply to the Speech from 
the Throne. They are representative of the diversity, strength 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="73"> 73 </A></B>
<P>
and depth of the government caucus, of which I am very pleased 
to be a part. That caucus has worked hard to get to this House and 
to get to the  government side of this House and I know they are 
determined to play a strong and positive role. They have already 
done so in working with me in my responsibilities as Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. They have been vigilant, 
mature and highly effective in advancing the interests and 
concerns of their constituents on agricultural issues.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	As Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, I am responsible 
for a very important component of Canada's economy and a 
major source of economic growth. This sector employs more 
than 1.8 million Canadians and generates 8 per cent of Canada's 
gross domestic product. Food production and processing are 
important activities in all parts of Canada, east, west and 
central, rural and urban. Our agri-food policy was spelled out 
very clearly in the famous red book during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	The two broad thrusts of that policy are to provide the 
agricultural sector with stability and certainty for the future and 
to ensure that it contributes to economic growth and jobs. We 
ran on that platform, we were elected on that platform and we 
plan to implement that platform. We will work hard with 
industry and with the provinces to ensure that the job gets done.
<P>
	A secure agricultural sector means safe, reasonably priced 
food for Canadians, financial stability for farmers and others in 
the sector, stewardship of our resource base, and a predictable 
trade environment.
<P>
	Economic growth requires that we take advantage of export 
opportunities, that we promote innovation, that we support 
market development and reform policies that might tend to 
impede growth.
<P>
	In that overall process international trade must be central to 
any attempt to rebuild the Canadian economy and to broaden our 
opportunities in agriculture and agri-food. One and a half 
million Canadian workers-that is one in five-depend directly 
on exports for their livelihoods. Total two-way trade in goods 
and services accounts for almost half of our GDP. Only Germany 
among the Group of Seven countries is more dependent on trade 
than is Canada.
<P>
	Given those facts, reaching a new GATT agreement was 
essential for Canada's future. It is one step on the road to 
achieving the goals of job creation and economic development.
<P>
	This government came into the GATT negotiating process as 
the clock was very close to nearing midnight. There were barely 
six weeks between the time the cabinet was sworn into office 
and the GATT deadline date on December 15. But once at the 
table in Geneva we battled hard to reach the best possible 
agreement for Canada. My colleague, the Minister for 
International Trade, and I made a number of visits to Geneva and 
Brussels to deliver Canada's message personally to trade 
negotiators and ministers from other countries. We fought hard 
and I believe we have a good agreement.
<P>
	It is true that we did not get everything we wanted in the 
bargaining process, but we gained much more than we may have 
given up.
<P>
	Although much of the focus in this round of the GATT has 
been on agriculture per se, the agreement over all will benefit all 
Canadians. It should stimulate the world economy and help 
create badly needed jobs in our country. The OECD has 
estimated that the agreement will give the Canadian economy an 
$8 billion boost by the year 2002. It is in my opinion a good deal 
for Canada.
<P>
	Agriculture, of course, was a major part of this Uruguay round 
at the GATT. For the first time in the history of GATT we now 
have an agreement that brings agriculture under effective 
trading rules. The agreement will reduce the risk of damaging 
trade actions because rules will apply equally to all countries 
and countries' specific exemptions will be eliminated. A 
framework of rules will help to prevent the misuse of things like 
sanitary and phytosanitary measures as disguised trade barriers.
<P>
	A strong new international body, the World Trade 
Organization, will help to resolve trade disputes. Canadian 
farmers and processors will be less subject to unfair competition 
resulting from foreign export subsidies. Improved market 
access in Japan, Korea, Europe and the newly industrialized 
countries will bring exciting new trade opportunities for 
Canadian exporters. While the timing of export subsidy cuts is 
certainly slower in the GATT than we would have wanted, the 
cuts that were in fact achieved will result in significant subsidy 
reductions by the end of the six-year period of this new GATT. 
That should help to stabilize and improve prices in the grains 
and oilseeds sector of our economy.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	While in the bargaining process we found virtually no support 
in other countries for our strengthened and clarified article XI, 
our preferred method for safeguarding supply management, we 
are confident that our supply management systems in Canada 
can continue to do well under the new concept of comprehensive 
tariffications.
<P>
	The livestock and red meat sector will be winners under the 
GATT because of greater security of access to markets. 
Replacing import restrictions, import levies and other trade 
distorting measures with tariffs will result in additional export 
opportunities for beef and pork products to Europe, Japan and 
Korea and over time this will create a more equitable trading 
environment for Canadian exporters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="74"> 74 </A></B>
<P>
	The new trade regime, while by no means perfect, should 
provide the stability and the predictability that we need to plan 
and invest for the future. We must now work together as 
Canadians to ensure that we reap the maximum benefits for all 
sectors of the agri-food industry in all parts of this country.
<P>
	We have 18 months to prepare ourselves for the 
implementation of the GATT. If we do our homework well in 
that period there are abundant opportunities for us to capitalize 
upon and the future for agriculture and agri-food can be and I 
believe will be bright indeed.
<P>
	To deal with the special needs of the supply managed sectors 
of agriculture I have asked my parliamentary secretary to head a 
small consultative task force involving producers and 
processors and government officials on the broad question of 
supply management renewal. This process has been endorsed by 
all of my provincial colleagues across the country. The purpose 
of the task force is to identify for governments all of the issues 
that we will have to address and to recommend processes by 
which those issues can be addressed in this 18-month period 
before the GATT comes into effect because we all as 
governments, federal and provincial, want to be fully ready for 
July 1995.
<P>
	Changes in the world economy will profoundly affect the way 
that we trade. We are witnessing the increasing globalization of 
markets. It is no longer unusual to see fresh produce from New 
Zealand or southeast Asia in our local grocery stores. In 
addition, commodity prices are experiencing a long-term 
decline in real terms.
<P>
	Canada can no longer depend on primary product exports to 
the extent we have in the past for improvements in our standard 
of living. We will have to rely more and more on value added 
exports to new and changing markets.
<P>
	I think there is tremendous potential in value added. 
Three-quarters of all agri-food jobs are found beyond the farm 
gates. My Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food is now 
positioned and ready to help farmers and businesses take 
advantage of the kinds of opportunities that new markets 
represent.
<P>
	The department has a new branch, Market and Industry 
Services, with offices right across this country in all provinces 
specifically designated to work with the industry on enhancing 
its global competitiveness and increasing its share of domestic 
and international markets.
<P>
	The federal government also has 50 full-time employees 
working on agri-food trade development in more than 150 
foreign markets. The team includes 13 specialists dedicated to 
agricultural issues in priority export markets including Japan 
and Taiwan. Their job is to help improve market access and 
provide up-to-date market information and intelligence to 
Canadian exporters. Agri-food specialists in other key 
international locations may well be appointed in the future.
<P>
	One of the Prime Minister's first major initiatives after taking 
office was to travel to Seattle to meet leaders of the 17 nation 
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group. These APEC 
countries represent the most dynamic and fastest growing 
economic region in the world.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	While western industrialized economies have stagnated in 
recent years, annual growth among APEC countries has been 
between 6 per cent and 9 per cent and they account for 40 per 
cent of world trade. World Bank figures indicate that half the 
increase in the world's wealth between now and the year 2000, 
as well as half the increase in world trade, will come from Asian 
countries. There are huge opportunities for Canada in this 
burgeoning market, particularly in products like pork and other 
value added products.
<P>
	Speaking to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture last 
November, Dennis Avery of the Hudson Institute described the 
Asian marketplace as the greatest opportunity in farming 
history. As Asian countries become more affluent their demand 
for high protein products will rise. It is a demand that they may 
be hard pressed to meet and that is where we come in. Canada 
has a well earned reputation for producing the highest quality 
food products in the world, and it is a reputation we can 
capitalize on to penetrate new markets.
<P>
	Next to Asia, Latin America is the fastest growing trading 
area in the world. For Canadian agri-food exporters it has 
trailed only the United States as the second fastest growing 
market for our products. In recognition of the importance of 
trade and the need to develop these markets for Canadian 
products, the Prime Minister has appointed two secretaries of 
state within foreign affairs with responsibility for trade with 
Asia and Latin America as well as with Africa.
<P>
	With the GATT and the NAFTA in hand the government has 
been turning its attention to other outstanding trade issues, in 
particular our ongoing bilateral disputes with the United States. 
While in Geneva in December, I had the opportunity to discuss 
some of these issues with my American counterpart, the U.S. 
Secretary of Agriculture, the hon. Mike Espy. I met with Mr. 
Espy again earlier this month in Toronto and we have had a 
number of conversations by telephone since.
<P>
	I remain reasonably optimistic that the various areas of 
disagreement between Canada and the United States at the 
present time from wheat to peanut butter, to sugar, to some dairy 
matters can be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries, but 
we may rest assured that the Canadian government will be 
vigorous and vigilant in advancing the Canadian interest in 
respect to these products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="75"> 75 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue of outstanding wheat and barley rights with respect 
to the European Community is also a top priority. My officials 
and I will continue to work with the Europeans, as will 
representatives of international trade, to seek adequate 
compensation for our historic GATT rights with respect to high 
quality wheat and barley in Europe.
<P>
	Another key priority will be to develop new whole farm safety 
net programs for the future. In two weeks time I will be meeting 
with provincial and industry representatives in Winnipeg to start 
work on the future of safety nets in agriculture in Canada. In my 
view we need a safety net system that meets the basic needs of 
all agricultural sectors and does not distort market signals, one 
that lets farmers make sound decisions based on comparative 
advantage and not based on government programs. Money is 
tight. We cannot afford a patchwork of ineffective programs. 
However I believe we can afford a safety net system that works, 
and that is what we will all be working toward.
<P>
	Even as we strive to reduce expenditures I intend to place 
increased emphasis on agricultural research. Good research is 
not a frill to be cast aside in tough times. It is fundamental to 
make Canada a world agricultural and agri-food leader. In our 
platform, the famous red book, we talked about the importance 
of research and the need to increase joint venture funding. Since 
we do not have a lot of money I will be looking for ways within 
my own department of reallocating priorities so that we can 
continue to move forward on research despite the necessities of 
budgetary restraint.
<P>
	I believe the federal government can play a leading role in 
innovative research and development, for example in 
biotechnology which has a very strong reputation in my 
province and other exciting new areas like ethanol.
<P>
	However R and D spending cannot just be turned on and off 
like a tap. Inadequate and inconsistent support for research has 
already resulted, in my judgment, in some missed opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We must effectively bring together the drive and dynamism of 
individuals and entrepreneurship with the brain power and 
strength of our universities and research labs. If we do that 
effectively the combination can be very powerful for Canada 
and very powerful in the field of agriculture.
<P>
	As I conclude I recall that 90 years ago this week Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier declared that Canada would fill the 20th century. It has 
become fashionable to compare today's reality with Sir 
Wilfrid's sentiment and to say that he was wrong.
<P>
	However when we consider carefully what Canadians have 
achieved in this century, a country with one of the highest 
standards of living in the world, a country with a peaceful 
democratic society, a country that is the envy of people 
everywhere, maybe Sir Wilfrid was not so far off the mark after 
all.
<P>
	Over the next four years we will have the opportunity to show 
that the 20th century did indeed belong to Canada. We will have 
the opportunity to make history, to restore the faith of Canadians 
in themselves and in their country, and to prepare Canadians for 
the next century with the same confidence they had at the start of 
this one.
<P>
	This government is looking forward to meeting that 
challenge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, first I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Regina-Wascana for 
the speech he made in this House. He stressed the importance of 
his department and, as the Official Opposition's deputy critic for 
agriculture and agri-food, I would like to voice the concerns of 
my constituents in the riding of Shefford. There are many 
farmers in my riding, and today they are very worried.
<P>
	Last December, I attended the UPA convention in Quebec, and 
I must say farmers in Quebec and Ontario are extremely 
concerned about what is happening as a result of GATT and 
NAFTA. Chicken, dairy and egg producers are very worried, as 
their future seems very uncertain.
<P>
	I think the minister made it clear in this House that he 
intended to expand the role of the Department of Agriculture. 
Madam Speaker, you know as well as I do that agriculture has 
never been an important department when the Liberals are in 
power. However, we hope that this time, after the minister's 
eloquent speech, agriculture will receive more emphasis, since 
in Quebec more than 350,000 people depend on agriculture and 
the agri-food sector. As the minister said so eloquently, this is 
an area where we can develop markets and an area in which we 
can compete internationally thanks to the quality of our 
products. I would therefore urge the minister to stay his course.
<P>
	We in the opposition intend to monitor very carefully the 
decisions that will be made by this government. If it does it 
right, it can be sure that on behalf of all farmers in Shefford, 
Quebec and Canada, we will support those decisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate the Minister of Agriculture on his first speech in 
this session of the Commons.
<P>
	During his speech he was discussing GATT and the 
marvellous solution that we have signed in that accord. He 
mentioned the new rules and that ``rules will apply equally to all 
countries''. Yet in the GATT we appear to have signed away our 
rights under article XI which protected our supply managed 
industries. The Americans appear to have maintained their 
waiver under article XXII which retains their ability to keep out 
dairy products, peanuts, cotton, sugar, et cetera. In spite of the 
rules allegedly applying equally to all countries, we still have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="76"> 76 </A></B>
<P>
situation which has not changed whereby the  constitution of the 
United States still permits the Congress to overrule, at virtually 
any moment, any international agreement that its president and 
administration has signed.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Given that the constitution has not changed and their waivers 
continue, how can he say that we have in fact received an 
improvement? If we did, why are we now negotiating rather than 
insisting upon our rights for barley and wheat sales into the 
United States, one of the highest priced markets for those 
products, largely because the U.S. insists on sucking its own 
market dry with its export enhancement program which has 
created a marvellous opportunity for our product to rush in at a 
good price?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate both the 
comment made by the previous member and the question just 
asked by the member from my home province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	With respect to the situation prevailing at this present moment 
the short answer to the member's question is that the new regime 
under GATT has not yet come into effect. The implementation 
date is July 1995, so the benefits we hope to achieve and that I 
mentioned in my speech will be forthcoming after 
implementation. I would dearly love to see those benefits come 
in advance but unfortunately we cannot get them until the 
process actually gets into place.
<P>
	On the question of whether we have given up our ability to 
have import controls under article XI where other countries have 
not given up corresponding things, the facts are that all 
countries have surrendered their rights to have those kinds of 
border restrictions. In Canada those restrictions related to our 
supply managed sectors under the auspices of article XI.
<P>
	In the United States it is the section 22 waiver under the U.S. 
agricultural adjustment act. In Europe it is the system of 
variable levies. In Japan and Korea it is the limitation system 
they had with respect to rice. All those methods previously used 
as non-tariff barriers will no longer be permissible in future 
under the new GATT once it is implemented in 1995. All of us 
have surrendered something in that regard, getting instead this 
system of comprehensive tariffication.
<P>
	Will there be aberrations along the way? Undoubtedly so. We 
will have to be vigilant, to watch out, to make sure that this 
playing field is as level as it possibly can be. One thing we do 
have to assist us in that regard now, or when the GATT is 
implemented, is a new world trade organization which should be 
a substantial improvement over the ad hoc and undisciplined 
system that used to exist in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
year many barley growers in and around my riding enjoyed the 
freedom of an open continental barley market. For the first time 
in many years this free enterprise was working and they were 
very pleased with it. Although this lasted only for a short time, 
farmers were able to increase their sales by a huge margin.
<P>
	I would like to know if the Minister of Agriculture could 
explain to us why this opportunity no longer exists and if it will 
be open again in the near future, as the barley growers are 
anxiously waiting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Madam Speaker, I am fully aware that opinion 
in some parts of western Canada is very sharply divided upon the 
method of marketing barley.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	The short answer to the member's question as to why the 
system is no longer in place as it was temporarily in place in the 
latter part of 1993 is simply that the previous government 
proceeded by a method which the courts ruled to be beyond the 
government's jurisdiction. The courts ruled that the process 
undertaken by the previous government was in fact contrary to 
law.
<P>
	In terms of whether the system ought to be revisited or 
reviewed in the future, some in western Canada are proposing 
the idea of a plebiscite on the issue. The matter of a producer 
plebiscite can be considered in due course. However, I would 
caution members against rushing too quickly toward that 
conclusion. That is because plebiscites sometimes are not quite 
as simple and clean solutions as one might otherwise think.
<P>
	In this case, for example, I think there would need to be a 
legislative framework to ensure that the plebiscite was 
conducted properly. One would need to have some definition of 
a trigger mechanism to start the process of a plebiscite. One 
would have to give careful attention to the wording of the 
question. As the hon. member knows, whether the question is 
phrased positively or negatively can have a profound impact on 
the outcome. Then there are the thorny questions like who gets 
on the voters list, who is entitled to vote on the issue, and 
whether it is restricted in some way.
<P>
	There are a good many complexities relating to the question 
of a plebiscite. I think all of us would want to think it through 
very carefully before rushing into that as necessarily the right 
way to go in these circumstances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech the Minister of 
Agriculture just gave. As member for Beauharnois-Salaberry, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="77"> 77 </A></B>
<P>
a mainly agricultural riding where grain production has been 
increasing over the past few years, and given the recent 
developments regarding GATT and NAFTA, I would like the 
minister to tell me what is to become of farm income 
stabilization, crop insurance, and the Crow rates as they apply to 
western grain transportation.
<P>
	Will these benefits be considered as some form of subsidy? 
Will they be allowed under the terms of these agreements? There 
does not seem to be too much of a problem for the time being. 
However, should this type of insurance be regarded as subsidy 
and should farmers be deprived of such assistance, what are you 
planning to do for grain producers who are presently covered?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. 
Unfortunately the time allotted for questions and comments has 
expired. Will the House allow the minister a short answer?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> I am pleased to have the opportunity to briefly 
respond to the question. I am sure we will have other 
opportunities to consider the questions raised by the hon. 
member in greater detail. The member certainly has touched 
upon some vital questions in terms of the future of Canadian 
agriculture.
<P>
	I mentioned in my remarks that we would be reviewing the 
whole system of farm safety net programs and hopefully moving 
toward the concept of whole farm income safety nets for the 
future. They have a number of advantages from our domestic 
point of view. The whole farm income concept also has the great 
advantage of being largely production and market neutral. 
Therefore it is less likely to be subject to any violation of the 
new GATT. That is one of the reasons we are very interested in 
this concept of whole farm income safety nets. That would touch 
upon many of the support programs the hon. member has 
referred to, including crop insurance and so forth.
<P>
	The area is under review. We have a conference coming up in 
February to begin the process of that review. Working with the 
provinces, the farmers and farm organizations, I think we can 
arrive perhaps at the end of 1994 at a much clearer 
understanding about how we need to adjust our programs to 
ensure they are doing the job properly for Canadian farmers.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The answer on the Western Grain Transportation Act would 
necessarily be long. I assure the hon. member it is a subject 
which is very likely to be affected at least in some way by the 
implications of the GATT. It is a subject matter that we will 
undoubtedly revisit in this House on many occasions as I 
consult, as I ought to do, before any changes are made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
is my first opportunity to address the House at length. I am sure 
you are getting tired of hearing that but two-thirds of us are new 
members. Many of us who have been here in the past are in new 
roles, as are you. I congratulate you on your appointment to that 
role.
<P>
	At the beginning of these new roles or the beginning of our 
careers we have the opportunity to think longer term about the 
problems of our country than perhaps parliamentarians have 
done in the past.
<P>
	Many people in my constituency have built successful 
careers, homes and families by thinking longer term in their 
affairs. Now they have taken a brave step this time in electing a 
new MP from a new political party to represent them for the next 
four or five years.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to say I am greatly honoured by that 
election. It is an overwhelming honour and I plan to do my best 
to fulfil their expectations. We certainly know what happens 
when you forget who sent you here. The Prime Minister alluded 
to that yesterday. I hope that I and this Parliament do not let the 
people of Canada down, as I feel the last Parliament did.
<P>
	In my particular case I was elected from an urban riding, a 
riding entirely within the city of Calgary that has 100,000 
people. It is in the western suburbs of Calgary. We have a large 
military base. We have two post-secondary institutions.
<P>
	In spite of that, my riding and our city reflect largely a private 
sector character. We do not have a federal or provincial 
government. We are one of the larger cities that does not.
<P>
	Of course we have experienced the ups and downs that Alberta 
has had in the past decade largely through and because of our 
dependence on the oil industry. In spite of that there is a 
broadening of our industry in Calgary historically from 
agriculture to energy, now to services. This broadening reflects 
our entrepreneurial spirit in the west, in Alberta and in Calgary 
in particular.
<P>
	This growth in the view of most Calgarians, I think I am safe 
to say, has been not so much with the help of government as in 
spite of it and in spite of the federal government in particular.
<P>
	I was a newcomer to Alberta when a distant government 
imposed policies that brought an end to the boom times that 
brought me to Alberta to begin with. Of course I am referring to 
the national energy program. No Canadian can live through an 
experience like that without it influencing greatly his or her 
thinking about government and about our country. In spite of 
that thinking and in spite of the drain the federal government has 
often imposed on Albertans, Albertans have never wavered in 
their patriotism or in their optimism about the future.
<P>
	Today the federal government presents not hopes but 
obstacles to economic recovery. The obstacles are most clearly 
represented by the national debt and the deficits adding to it 
which we are experiencing and have experienced in the past 
number of years. I am not going to recount the statistics. I am an 
economist and that would be economics and that is a dangerous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="78"> 78 </A></B>
<P>
combination. Let me talk instead about what these numbers 
mean.
<P>
	In the election campaign my colleagues and I in the Reform 
Party argued strongly about the need to understand the 
long-term link between fiscal mismanagement and economic 
recession and decline. We argued against the view that we 
should create jobs rather than fix the financial problem, not 
because we oppose creating jobs but because these are not 
conflicting objectives. They are the same objective.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Countries like companies or households that mismanage their 
financial affairs do not create jobs. They destroy them. 
Households, businesses, families and governments that 
mismanage their affairs do not fulfil dreams. Those who 
mismanage their affairs watch their dreams slowly slip away.
<P>
	Many of my generation, young professionals, the backbone of 
the future of Canada, have left Canada, are leaving Canada or 
are thinking of leaving Canada because they fear the high taxes 
and the declining services that this mismanagement has brought 
about and may worsen in the future.
<P>
	Let me not preach from the Reform Party policy manual. Let 
me quote the government itself. For members who have not read 
it, Canada's Economic Challenges contains a very good 
summary of our economic and financial situation. It lays out 
better than I could all the relevant numbers on the deficit and 
debt and the impact on our economy, such as the fact that it 
absorbs our domestic savings, increases our foreign 
indebtedness, worsening our current account, lowering national 
income, our potential growth, reducing our fiscal flexibility, 
threatening our social programs, increasing our tax burden, 
raising real interest costs and decreasing our competitiveness. It 
is all there.
<P>
	Those are not short-term problems. They are not caused by 
the recession. A short spurt in growth or activity will not resolve 
them. The chapter is illustrated with dozens of statistics.
<P>
	Why then would the same government that released this book 
also release the throne speech this week and turn its attention 
instead to spending priorities and in particular to the much 
ballyhooed infrastructure program. That is a $6 billion 
commitment, $2 billion sought from this Parliament to kick start 
the Canadian economy, as if it is possible to do such a thing as 
kick-start an economy.
<P>
	On reading the briefing notes for the program it will be 
noticed there are no fewer than four program objectives and nine 
related criteria. There are in fact lots of objectives. There are no 
clear priorities. None of these objectives is new to the program 
spending that parliaments have passed before. We are therefore 
led to ask why the government believes that another $2 billion 
would kick start an economy in a way the first $160 billion of 
spending this year has been unable to do.
<P>
	Let us be clear about the magnitudes involved. In the case of 
Alberta we are talking about $88 million against an economy of 
$70 billion and an infrastructure investment of at least $1 billion 
a year. These are hardly kick start kinds of numbers. That is the 
magnitude and context of the program.
<P>
	I do not want to quarrel with infrastructure as a priority or 
even a higher priority than it has been in the past. What I want to 
do is simply suggest that it will not fulfil the objectives stated by 
the government and the raised expectations of consumers, 
taxpayers and investors. It is short-term thinking about jobs and 
activities that has long-term consequences in terms of 
employment and output and that has been the past generation as 
we have seen it.
<P>
	I ask members, especially government members, to give 
strong consideration to this before they cast their votes on this 
matter and on the legislative program that will flow from the 
throne speech. Members opposite will be held responsible by the 
public for the performance of the Canadian economy in the next 
four years.
<P>
	Possibly the infrastructure program will deliver some 
short-term benefits and some short-term visibility. But in the 
long term, by the next election-that at least we will talk about 
as our long term-the infrastructure program will long be 
passed and we will be stuck with the bills for it.
<P>
	I suggest that until the government has contemplated a way to 
credibly finance these things and to fit these within the $153 
billion spending cap that we suggest it should re-examine these 
priorities.
<P>
	I ask government members to give strong consideration to this 
aspect of fiscal discipline, the subamendment we propose, to 
support and vote for it and to include it in the speech from the 
throne. On that basis we would be building a more successful 
government program, not just from our standpoint but also for 
the potential of their own re-election in four years.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the member for Calgary West on his maiden 
speech in the House of Commons. I know it will be a 
constructive experience over the next four or five years.
<P>
	I would like to get right to my question because I know this 
member by reputation and I know he cares about small and 
medium sized businesses in this country, especially in his own 
community and in his own province. I noted that he did not seem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="79"> 79 </A></B>
<P>
to spend a lot of time in his opening remarks commenting on the 
difficulty that small business is having getting access to capital.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said repeatedly during the campaign, in 
the red book and in the speech from the throne, that small and 
medium sized businesses would really be the engine for putting 
people back to work. The greatest hope for putting people back 
to work rests with the entrepreneurial spirit in that small 
business area. We all know that the banks are really not 
co-operating with that sector.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could explain to this House if the 
Reform Party shares the view of our party that the financial 
institutions of this country really have to deal with putting the 
economy back on track. I wonder if the member would stand and 
say that the Reform Party will join with us in making sure that 
the banks do their job for small businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question and for his congratulations. I have 
known the hon. member for some time and it is a delight to be 
able to sit with him in this Chamber.
<P>
	Of course there was not time in my speech to address all of the 
concerns that the hon. member would like me to address. If in 
future the rules of the House are altered so that I can speak at 
greater length, I would be delighted to do so.
<P>
	The member raises the question of small and medium sized 
business and their access to capital. My supporters, particularly 
my association, are predominantly people who work in small 
and medium sized business and they voted for our party I 
suspect precisely because they share our concerns.
<P>
	I would suggest to the government that certainly there are 
problems with access to capital in the banking sector. However, 
I would suggest that what the government should do before it 
starts figuring out how to run the banks and how to run small and 
medium sized businesses and all kinds of other institutions that 
it run itself so that small and medium sized businesses have 
access to capital.
<P>
	According to the projections of the Minister of Finance, in 
this financial year we will be borrowing up to $45 billion in the 
financial markets. Certainly some of this money, if not a large 
part of it, would be available to small and medium sized 
businesses if the government would undertake the credible 
program of deficit reduction that is being advanced through our 
subamendment. If we do not do that, it would be ridiculous to try 
to alter the rules of the banking system if the capital itself is 
being tied up by the Government of Canada which is more than 
absorbing our domestic savings. That is all in the book his own 
government has put out.
<P>
	I would suggest that the way to deal with the problem of 
capital access for small and medium sized businesses-and the 
message from the people in my constituency-is to deal first 
with releasing those funds through deficit reduction and only 
then should we deal with the problems in other institutional 
arrangements.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order. Is not the question and answer period 10 minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is five minutes on a 
ten-minute debate. They are splitting their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I have listened 
very carefully to the very thoughtful comments of my colleague. 
Considering the importance and the nature of the tax system and 
the funding for small business, would the House permit two or 
three other questions in response to the hon. member's 
comments? Can we have unanimous consent to allow a few more 
questions to be put to the member?
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the will of the 
House to allow a few more questions?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought there was a 
consensus and that the Speaker had been informed that we would 
split the time allotted, that is ten minutes for a speech, followed 
by a five-minute question period. I would like us to stick with 
this formula to give more people a chance to speak to this 
debate, otherwise each member could considerably exceed the 
time limit and I do want as many hon. members as possible to 
have the opportunity to speak.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Unfortunately consent 
is denied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I appreciate the 
point made by my hon. friend. If the concern is to allow as many 
members to speak to this important debate as possible, we can 
always extend the hours for people to do that.
<P>
	My point was that the past speaker was a very important 
spokesperson for the Reform Party and an obvious person of 
whom to ask a number of questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There will be another 
chance for questions unless the next speaker is willing to cede 
his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to start by congratulating you on your election to the Chair 
of this honourable House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="80"> 80 </A></B>
<P>
	I presume that while you waited with bated breath, while your 
colleagues took a second look before firmly ensconcing you in 
the Chair, but I have no doubt whatsoever in your ability to lead 
us in our deliberations with decorum and respect.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the Prime Minister and his 
colleagues. Who would have predicted that the red book which 
was so long on rhetoric and so short on substance could have 
lead to such a stunning and upset victory?
<P>
	I would also like to thank the citizens of the St. Albert 
constituency for the confidence they expressed in me. I spoke to 
them during the election campaign about fiscal prudence and 
sound management of the public purse. I believe it was their 
desire that I stand in this House and carry that message to the 
government.
<P>
	Hon. members can be assured that I will persistently advocate 
the principle of fiscal responsibility during my tenure in this 
House.
<P>
	To the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, my 
congratulations. Of all the particular challenges that he could 
have chosen, he selected a riding that was perceived to be the 
most daunting. Yet he triumphed in the most outstanding 
manner. I look forward to working with him and the rest of my 
Reform colleagues as we explain to all Canadians our vision of a 
new Canada which was so eloquently articulated by the member 
for Calgary Southwest ``as a balanced democratic federation of 
provinces, distinguished by the conservation of its magnificent 
environment, the viability of its economy, acceptance of its 
social responsibilities and recognition of the equality and 
uniqueness of all its provinces and citizens''.
<P>
	I would also like to recognize the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean and his colleagues. Their agenda differs from 
ours but I hope that before the end of this Parliament the issues 
that currently pull this country apart will eventually pull us 
together to realize our hope of a new Canada.
<P>
	His Excellency the Governor General spoke of his 
government's desire to create jobs for the hundreds of thousands 
of Canadians who are losing hope and faith in the economic 
miracle that has been Canada's until the last number of years. 
We have seen feeble attempts to maintain a robust economy on a 
philosophy of borrowing and spending our way to prosperity. 
That false god of prosperity without effort has taken this country 
into the long dark tunnel leading to economic ruin. We now have 
double digit unemployment, mushrooming welfare rolls, 
regions dependent on government handouts; in essence, 
breadwinners without bread. That story is repeated a million 
times across this land. Canadians are crying out for leadership, 
vision, hope, but most of all for jobs and careers. But where do 
they turn when their hope diminishes with each passing day? 
There is no plan in place for them to realize their hopes and 
aspirations.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Over 30 per cent of every tax dollar collected by this 
government is now paid to bankers and investors as interest on 
the money that we have already spent. As the debt continues to 
mushroom, so too does the cost of servicing that debt. On our 
current economic path Canadians can only look forward to a 
future of higher taxes and declining services while they work to 
fill the pockets of lenders and investors.
<P>
	The Auditor General said in his report tabled in this House 
yesterday: ``Looking at where we have been is not enough; it is 
also necessary to see where we are going''. We are going down 
the road to economic ruin. He also said: ``Hard choices lie 
ahead''.
<P>
	This government must choose the road to a balanced budget. 
That is the hard choice. That road is not paved with more social 
programs that destroy the initiative of Canadians to work. It is 
not paved with simple quick fix band-aids such as the $6 billion 
infrastructure program. A balanced budget means that we as 
Canadians accept the consequences of the follies of previous 
governments. The hard choice is that only 70 per cent of tax 
dollars collected can be returned to Canadians by way of 
services delivered. If we do not accept that consequence today, 
tomorrow we will have to live with only 60 per cent, or even 
less, being returned in services to Canadians.
<P>
	That is the hard choice. Do we bite the bullet now or do we 
wait until it is too late?
<P>
	During the election campaign we, as Reformers, spelled out a 
complete program to balance the budget. Two and a half million 
Canadians voted for that program. They are prepared to make 
that hard choice now, yet there is little evidence in the speech 
from the throne that the government has even heard the message. 
How long before the government does the right thing and makes 
that hard choice?
<P>
	We want jobs in this country. The myth that deficit financing 
creates jobs was debunked long ago. If that theory worked there 
would not be a single unemployed Canadian today.
<P>
	Where do we go from here? I ask this government to make a 
commitment now to balance the budget by the end of this 
Parliament. Business is looking for a signal that the upward 
spiral of government spending will come to an end. With that 
signal we will know that tax increases will no longer be the order 
of the day. Declining services will not be the way of the future. If 
business can believe that this government has the resolve to 
make these hard choices then investment will follow. That is the 
creator of real jobs. The private sector will pick up where the 
public sector leaves off.
<P>
	Canada was forged by people who want to build a future for 
themselves and their children. I came to this country to 
participate in a young and vibrant nation but I have watched as 
socialism has wrung this vitality dry. Our economy is feeble and 
we must rebuild it for our children. Our heritage is free 
enterprise. It created our  prosperity. It developed products and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="81"> 81 </A></B>
<P>
innovations that raised our standard of living. It was not social 
programs that gave us wealth but the opportunity to work hard 
and keep what we had made. That was the driving force that built 
this country.
<P>
	The hard choice has a great future. If we balance the budget 
lower taxation will come. Jobs will be created. Horizons will be 
opened up. We will have the money to educate our children, look 
after our old, the sick and the poor and still be able to compete 
with any nation in the world. Jobs come from trade not from 
infrastructure programs.
<P>
	To sum up, we must turn this country around and start anew. I 
look for leadership and vision from my honourable colleagues 
across the floor. Hard choices must be made. History has always 
glorified leaders who have reached beyond themselves and led 
their nation through the dark tunnel to the light, which in our 
case is renewed prosperity without debt.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I issue this challenge: will this government commit itself now 
to balancing the budget by the end of this Parliament? The first 
step down the hard road is to approve the subamendment by the 
member for Calgary Southwest to cap federal spending at $153 
billion. I urge all members of this House to vote in favour of the 
subamendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate my hon. friend on his maiden speech in the House. 
One of the main points he raised referred to the fact that we have 
to get our deficit under control.
<P>
	One of the causes of our deficit problem is the amount of 
money the federal government fails to collect. It is an issue that 
more of us should get very serious about when we consider that a 
major preoccupation of many Canadians has now become 
purchasing contraband cigarettes and illegal liquor.
<P>
	We found from the Auditor General's report yesterday that 
tens of thousands of businesses appear to be collecting the GST 
and not remitting it to the federal government. This obviously 
indicates a clear loss of faith in our tax system, to say nothing of 
the underground economy that probably includes almost 
everybody in one form or another through cash transactions or a 
barter system designed to avoid paying tax.
<P>
	Does my friend share the view that one of the major steps to be 
taken in terms of reducing the deficit would be to close off some 
of the more obviously unfair tax exemptions that exist in our tax 
system to begin restoring faith in the system so that people will 
again be prepared to participate in the revenue collection of the 
country, knowing that our system is fair and more just?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the question of 
the hon. member for Kamloops, I mentioned in my speech that 
we have a feeble economy. Taxes are too high. This is why we 
find today that businesses are struggling to pay the taxes to keep 
the government afloat. Even then the government still needs 
another $40 billion or more to pay its bills.
<P>
	If we are going to look for a vibrant and strong economy we 
must look forward to the day when investment overtakes 
spending by the government. We must also look forward to the 
day when taxes start to come down and affordability of taxes 
comes within the realm of everybody to pay their fair share.
<P>
	We always agree with the need for equality but I think the 
focus of the government has to be toward a balanced budget. It 
can collect the taxes due in order to do so but we must look 
forward to the day when we see taxes coming down and a greater 
willingness by Canadian people to participate in paying for the 
government of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member's words. I was surprised to hear his 
stand on social programs, because I understood him to say that 
social programs destroyed the initiative of Canadians and 
should therefore be eliminated.
<P>
	This particular position is disappointing to me because what I 
heard from the voters of Jonquière during the election campaign 
was that Canada and Quebec have always been concerned about 
the weakest and the most disadvantaged. My constituents said 
clearly to me that they do not believe people who get rich by 
profiting from private enterprise will be generous enough to 
take care of the disadvantaged, the sick and the poor.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member and I hope he will have 
the time to respond. I will be brief. Does he know of many cases 
where people who became wealthy through their work or their 
business were successful in setting up programs or providing 
health care and social services, or services to the unemployed 
and the disadvantaged on a scale equal to what we now have in 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the hon. 
member's question, I think we have to recognize that this 
country was born and developed out of initiative. We very much 
recognize our social obligations to Canadians who are old, those 
who are sick and those in unfortunate circumstances who are 
unable to look after themselves. Recognizing its responsibilities 
in these areas shows the maturity of any society. I would be the 
last to suggest that we shun that responsibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="82"> 82 </A></B>
<P>
	We also have a responsibility to those who are prepared to 
lead the country in its economic growth. We have to give 
recognition to them that prosperity comes from that direction. 
As I said, we do not want the government to destroy the 
opportunities and initiatives of people to develop the country 
and continue to provide the growth and the jobs we so badly 
need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie):</B> Madam Speaker, my first words in 
this House must be those of appreciation for the privilege and 
honour of representing the riding of Erie. I would like to thank 
its voters for their trust and confidence without which I would 
not be here. I am aware of my responsibility to my constituents 
and indeed to all citizens of this country and I hope I will be 
equal to this task. I will not forget where I came from or who put 
me there. I will advance their position from the highest 
government in the land. I cannot deliver perfection but I can 
deliver accessibility, honesty and integrity.
<P>
	On a personal note I would also like to thank my wife, Sherrie, 
and my children, Megan, Patrick, Alanna, Andrew and Sarah, 
for allowing me this privilege. I will endeavour to keep their 
personal sacrifices as minimal as possible.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate you, Madam Speaker, on your 
appointment to this esteemed office of which you are most 
worthy.
<P>
	I would further like to take this opportunity to congratulate 
the hon. member for Welland-St. Catharines-Thorold on his 
election as Speaker to this 35th Parliament, a position of honour 
and responsibility unequalled in this House. I have enjoyed his 
sage advice over the years and regret the non-partisan aspect of 
his office now denies me the privilege of his counsel.
<P>
	I further wish to congratulate the mover of the Address in 
Reply to the Speech from the Throne, the hon. member for 
Bruce-Grey, and the seconder, the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria, on their addresses.
<P>
	It is indeed a great honour for me to be in this Parliament, 
especially under such an honourable leader as the Prime 
Minister. It is a pleasure for me in my maiden address to 
introduce the riding of Erie to my fellow members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Having been born and raised in Erie it seemed only fitting that 
on finishing my formal education I would return to Erie. For 
many years I served on a great number of local committees and 
boards. This exposure to local issues and people made my 
decision to enter federal politics a little easier. I believe that Erie 
deserves the best representation possible in Ottawa and I hope I 
am worthy of that responsibility.
<P>
	As some may gather from the name, Erie riding follows the 
north shore of Lake Erie, one of the fine Great Lakes. It extends 
from the border town of Fort Erie in the east to the western 
boundary of the regional municipality of Niagara. It is a 
rural-urban riding encompassing the city of Port Colborne, the 
southern  portion of the city of Welland, as well as the towns of 
Fort Erie, Pelham, West Lincoln, and the township of Wainfleet.
<P>
	This is only geography and does no justice to describing the 
heart of this riding. Erie riding was blessed with many Canadian 
riches. Our history, agricultural climate, economic potential and 
traditions in my humble opinion are unparalleled in any other 
part of Canada.
<P>
	Many historical battles of the War of 1812 were fought on Erie 
soil. Erie also saw the likes of William Lyon Mackenzie during 
the Upper Canada rebellion of 1837 and the Fenian raids of the 
1860s.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The early settlers of Erie were joined by the United Empire 
Loyalists, a group of people dedicated to what would later 
become the Dominion of Canada. Over the years our riding was 
further blessed with healthy immigration from all European 
countries and most recently from the Pacific Rim. There has also 
been lateral migration from other areas of Canada: from the 
west, from the maritimes and from <I>la belle province de Québec</I>, 
all attracted by the lushness and opportunity that Erie offered. 
The riding indeed reflects the multicultural heritage that makes 
our country so strong. I hope I may embody some of their 
independent, industrious and enthusiastic spirit as I work for my 
constituents and dedicate myself to community and country.
<P>
	On the very eastern boundary of Erie riding is the Niagara 
River which divides Canada from our neighbour, the United 
States. Our proximity to the American border offers us 
opportunities for trade and industrial development that will help 
enhance and diversify our economy well into the 21st century.
<P>
	Apart from the historical significance, development potential 
and beauty of the riding, the moderate climate and fertile soil 
have made Erie famous for its fresh produce, bountiful orchards 
and vineyards. The Niagara region is one of the best grape 
growing regions in the world and forms the basis of Canada's 
wine industry. Poultry and dairy farming represent a solid 
mainstay in Erie's economy as well as that of our nation.
<P>
	The climate and charm of Erie attracts a great number of 
tourists who come to enjoy the water and beaches of Lake Erie, 
to browse through our heritage museums and historic sites, to 
marvel at the ships plying the Welland Canal, an integral part of 
the St. Lawrence seaway system, or just to enjoy the pleasant 
surroundings and chat with our friendly residents.
<P>
	Due to the rural nature of my riding many Erie residents 
embrace a traditional way of life. This lifestyle is rooted in their 
heritage and must be preserved. This preservation is a goal of 
mine during my first term in office. I support the maintenance of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="83"> 83 </A></B>
<P>
rail and postal services to these people. I am happy to be a 
member of a party that also encourages the rural way of life.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not commend the Canadian public 
for taking the opportunity of electing a majority Liberal 
government. They knew that the Liberal Party was a party with a 
plan, as we heard in His Excellency's throne speech. It is 
obvious it is the priority of this government to put unemployed 
Canadians back to work, to give them back their pride in 
employment. Erie riding is struggling with an unemployment 
figure of approximately 15 per cent of the work force, an 
unacceptable level.
<P>
	The throne speech outlines several initiatives that are 
fundamental to this new Parliament, a new Parliament I may add 
that is in a position to make a real difference to Canadians. 
These major proposals impact on every community regardless 
of a member's political affiliation and follow the themes of 
integrity, economy and society.
<P>
	Integrity in government is an issue that must be dealt with 
before we begin debating our significant reforms. The conduct 
and ethics of Parliament will determine how such debates are 
carried out. We will achieve little unless members are permitted 
the courtesy to voice their concerns.
<P>
	In his address to this House on Monday the Speaker stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yet perhaps never in our history have we enjoyed a less favourable opinion 
on the part of. . .Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Before anything meaningful can be done in this House we 
have a duty as representatives to earn the confidence and trust of 
our fellow Canadians as we conduct our business.
<P>
	Our government, as promised, is committed to integrity and 
honesty. We have proposed cuts to members' services and 
allowances, reduced political staff, the elimination of perks and 
the reform of MPs' pension plans. The recommendation of the 
appointment of an ethics counsellor, legislation to bring 
lobbying out in the open and reform measures to give members 
of Parliament and House of Commons a greater role in 
Parliament are very refreshing and very necessary changes.
<P>
	As a newly elected member of Parliament I am quickly 
learning how complex many constituents' requests are, but I 
would suggest that when circumstances are beyond our control 
we deal forthrightly with the constituents in question.
<P>
	We are all individuals representing distinct ridings. Therefore 
it is unlikely that we will agree with every proposal and 
perspective in this House. Nevertheless we must respect other 
views and accept the outcome as decided by the greatest number 
of members.
<P>
	On Tuesday this government announced its plans to create a 
more active economy. This goal is desired by all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned before, the Erie riding embraces the creation 
of jobs through such programs as the renewal and expansion of 
infrastructure. I am pleased to say I have already corresponded 
with Erie riding mayors regarding the steps already taken by this 
government to initiate renewal at the local level.
<P>
	I applaud this government for its swift action on launching 
and obtaining agreements on the infrastructure program.
<P>
	Another change announced yesterday was the replacement of 
the goods and services tax or the GST as it is commonly known. 
It is one of the most reprehensible taxes ever imposed and 
Canadians have demanded its discontinuation. We cannot 
impose upon Canadians something that is so vehemently 
objected to when we have been chosen by them to communicate 
and reflect their views. This is an arrogance the government 
does not need.
<P>
	The youth of our country are our greatest asset. However, as 
the father of five children I am well aware of the growing 
despondency of our youth with respect to their futures. I 
welcome the creation of a youth service corps and a national 
apprenticeship program which will give more direction and 
employment to our children and youth.
<P>
	I was also particularly pleased to see so many initiatives 
designed to strengthen the fabric of this nation which will 
continue to make our fine Canadian society the envy of the 
world.
<P>
	The environmental assessment act will be well received by all 
Canadians and the benefits of this act will be appreciated for 
generations. Representing a riding that is affected by the Great 
Lakes I hope to see measures within that act to continue to clean 
up our waters and to prevent further pollution.
<P>
	In the short period of time I have held this office I have heard 
from my own constituents as well as many others across the 
country who are deeply concerned about crime, justice and 
personal safety.
<P>
	This government announced its intention on Tuesday to foster 
safer communities for all Canadians, especially for women and 
children. I do not believe that any Canadian, male or female, 
should be apprehensive about his or her safety. However, I know 
that this fear exists and is real for many. I am pleased to be part 
of a team that believes the problems of criminal justice and the 
penal system are deserving of attention and action.
<P>
	In the area of aboriginal affairs I welcome the announcement 
that the implementation of inherent aboriginal self-government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="84"> 84 </A></B>
<P>
will begin. Erie riding has a substantial urban aboriginal 
population and I look  forward to learning how self-government 
will impact on this community.
<P>
	As I sit in this Chamber among my colleagues I realize that 
despite political affiliation we also have the same goals of doing 
the best job possible for the constituency. Many great members 
have come and gone before us with similar ambitions. I salute 
all of those who have come to this place to represent Canadians. 
As we all know, it is not an easy task.
<P>
	A great man once stood in this House and in his maiden 
address said: ``I suggest that the time has come for action. We 
have a tremendous opportunity-the people of Canada look to 
us; the people of Canada trust in us; the people of Canada are 
counting on us; in heaven's name, let us not fail them''. That 
man, a predecessor to the free spirits who now sit in this House, 
was Mr. Tommy Douglas. Mr. Douglas had a vision of a new 
Canada. I hope that within ourselves each of us also has a vision.
<P>
	It is fitting to begin this Parliament at the start of a new year 
for this is the time when resolutions are made. In a recent letter 
received from Rural Dignity of Canada there was a quote from a 
4-H publication. It reads: ``May the thoughts in our heads blend 
with the compassion in our hearts, to guide our hands as they 
safeguard the health of those things we care most for: our loved 
ones, our communities and our world, throughout the coming 
year''.
<P>
	I encourage members to keep these thoughts in mind and in 
action in the months and years to come as we work for Canadians 
everywhere, as we work for a strong and united Canada. And 
when at some unknown future time we leave this Chamber for 
the final time we can proudly hold our heads high and each of us 
will be able to say: ``I made a difference''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to see that some of our friends 
opposite do care about what is going on in their ridings and are 
committed to standing up for their constituents.
<P>
	They can join us in so doing, as we are here to look after the 
interests of Quebecers. Welcome, sir. Join the club.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to tell the hon. 
member that our regions as well are faced with major problems, 
which we certainly intend to bring up over and over again. In my 
riding for example, the previous government shut down the CBC 
station which provided a vital link within the community. So, I 
will take every opportunity to remind this House of what a 
vicious deed this was, as regions can no longer make themselves 
heard from government because of the lack of communication. I 
will make this point every time I rise in this House until the CBC 
and the new government get  the message that regions must be 
given the means to communicate again, first among themselves, 
and then with the rest of the country, from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Madam Speaker, dear 
colleagues, I am pleasantly surprised to see the strong interest 
shown by the hon. member for his riding, since I represent the 
constituency of Abitibi, which may not be as beautiful as the 
hon. member's riding, but which, for me, is nevertheless the 
nicest one.
<P>
	The people in the riding of Abitibi, possibly the largest one in 
Canada after the Northwest Territories, managed from the very 
beginning, early in the twentieth century, to clear the land and 
develop agriculture. It is through their daily efforts that these 
people were able to develop this region which is not as old as 
that of the hon. member, but of which I am very proud.
<P>
	I am also pleasantly surprised to see that some members of 
this House have large families. I personally have seven children. 
Therefore, I believe that the future of our children must be the 
top priority for Canada as well as for Quebec.
<P>
	I want to emphasize the problems which I experienced during 
the election campaign in my riding of Abitibi, where regional 
development is so important. I am not referring to problems 
linked to facing an opponent but, rather, to the difficulty of 
meeting people and listening to their concerns, which have to do 
with finding work, for example in the case of workers who have 
to rely on social assistance and who, at fifty years of age, are 
losing hope of finding a new job.
<P>
	I am honoured to rise for the first time in the House and I want 
to take this opportunity to discuss the problems which exist in 
my riding and to ask you, the government members, the Liberal 
government, to listen to people in all those ridings who expect 
you to succeed in your endeavours. It is a fact that we, on this 
side of the House, will take a close look at your legislation. If 
you table good bills we will certainly support them, and the 
Reform Party members have also said they will: if it is good 
legislation, we will not purposely criticize it. On the contrary, 
we will support it.
<P>
	But you can be sure that people in my riding, who elected me 
to represent them in this House, want Canada to do better, 
regardless of the decision they will have to make in the next few 
years.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member for Erie that goods and services 
in this country are traded between provinces. In our family 
business we would routinely, as wholesalers, buy products from 
your region, whether it was fruits or vegetables. We have to 
learn to accept each other's choices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Yesterday, I listened to the speech made by the hon. member 
for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, who is the dean in this 
House and who spoke about communication. I hope that 
throughout this session both sides of the House will 
communicate more and more and learn to better understand each 
other's interests.
<P>
	I conclude by stating my keen interest in the role of this 
House, and in the future I intend to give even more substance to 
my questions.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Erie on his 
maiden speech. I too am proud to say that I have been elected to 
represent one of the nicest areas in southwestern Ontario, the 
riding of Lambton-Middlesex. It has a huge agriculture base.
<P>
	I agree with the contents of his maiden speech. I stress that we 
all work together to maintain a strong support for agriculture 
and small business in Canada to ensure growth for Canada and 
Canadians. I congratulate the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to have this opportunity to reply to the 
speech from the throne. The constituents of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the men and women living in 
the regional municipalities of Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup 
and Basques ridings as well as the municipality of 
Pohénégamook, gave me the mandate to express to the federal 
government the will of the population of Quebec which wants 
fundamental changes in the relationship between Quebecers and 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Since 1980, I have chosen to live in Eastern Quebec, more 
specifically in La Pocatière. Everywhere I went, I noticed that 
the needs of rural Quebecers are not quite understood. 
Government members do not seem to recognize the urgency 
here, since no regional development strategy is mentioned in the 
throne speech.
<P>
	On behalf of the neglected rural and urban populations, I 
would like to say how disappointed I am about this omission.
<P>
	Given the insensitivity of the government to our specific 
development concerns, whether it is in Rivière-du-Loup, 
Amos, or Lotbinière, we have lost all hope of seeing the 
government respond quickly to the situation. Hence the need for 
Quebecers to get back all necessary political and financial 
powers to make sure measures are being taken right away.
<P>
	Even if it is not included in the Constitution, regional 
economic development is a jurisdiction on which the federal 
government has impinged without taking into account the will 
of the Quebec government to take full responsibility in this area.
<P>
	For over 30 years, Quebec regions have been used as 
laboratories for tests which only proved that the present federal 
system does not work.
<P>
	At first, the federal government opted for economic 
centralization, as shown in the Higgins-Raynauld-Martin 
Report. This devastating approach was reinforced by the 
creation of the Department of Regional Industrial Expansion, 
whose decision-making process focused on sectoral concerns, 
instead of regional characteristics.
<P>
	In 1987, even the Standing Committee on Regional Industrial 
Expansion of this House of Commons recognized the fact that 
the federal programs did not meet the needs of the people, 
because the criteria being used were not suited to the needs of 
the regions. Because of a lack of participation from the regions, 
the money was given to useless projects, instead of some local 
and worthwhile initiatives. Take for example the magnificent $7 
million drill hall which was built in my riding. Fascinating, but 
if the people in the area had had a word in the matter, I can assure 
you they would have found other much more interesting projects 
to subsidize with that $7 million.
<P>
	The federal government made some adjustments by 
developing a new strategy based on framework agreements. 
That does not work either, as shown by the unemployment rates. 
Regions can and must do more to supply domestic and foreign 
markets with raw materials. To create jobs, we must develop 
processing industries and make use of local resources. The 
government's role in putting GATT in place will also be judged 
by what happens here. Its defence of GATT was not very 
convincing, I must say. The government accentuates regional 
dependence.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The federal government might as well admit that its actions in 
the area of regional development are inappropriate. The 
economic base is crumbling, the social fabric is falling apart, the 
exodus from rural areas continues, with young people among the 
first to leave.
<P>
	The number of municipalities whose population is shrinking 
has increased at an alarming rate in the past 25 years, so that 
today, their numbers exceed the number of communities where 
the population is growing. Nevertheless, the people in the 
regions are doing something about it. A first step was taken by 
the <I>Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec</I> and 25 groups 
that signed the <I>déclaration des États généraux du monde rural</I> at 
their meeting in 1991.
<P>
	Perhaps I may recall some of the main highlights of this 
declaration: rights of the individual; the community's control 
over its future; promoting and respecting regional and local 
values; co-operation between local and regional partners; 
diversification of the regional economic base; protecting and 
regen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="86"> 86 </A></B>
<P>
erating resources; fine tuning lines of political authority; and 
promoting alternative measures for sustainable development. 
The  Bloc agrees with these principles and supports this 
consensus.
<P>
	Regional development means more than just building roads. 
Quebecers know that that is not enough. Progress depends on the 
active participation and creativity of local resources. The 
government should provide financial support as needed. In this 
respect, research and development are the way of the future for 
the regions. Remote locations are no longer an obstacle to 
attracting high-tech companies.
<P>
	Haphazard action by the federal government has created 
bizarre situations, as in the case of its policy of closing rural 
post offices, which meant that communities were deprived of 
essential services, while at the same time community futures 
committees were being set up to provide local communities with 
the appropriate development tools. When we consider that 83 
per cent of the employees in these post offices are women, an 
excuse for speeches on employment equity, this is a clear case of 
the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development fails to take the 
comprehensive view of local development. What it does is often 
more like window dressing. Boosting regional economies means 
knowing how to use local human resources. Forestry workers 
who lost their jobs to a machine should be able to go back with 
dignity and help develop that same forest for the benefit of 
future generations. When companies increase productivity, the 
proceeds should be used to create jobs.
<P>
	Actually, the inefficiency of manpower training programs is 
most apparent in the regions, where it is harder to get a training 
program for a group of workers than to relocate them. I had this 
experience myself on an adjustment committee, when 20 
employees from Bombardier had been laid off and it took at least 
two major political manoeuvres to get these people a training 
program for welding, although the Bombardier plant, 
well-known internationally, was only a few kilometres from the 
training location.
<P>
	What is there in the Throne Speech that will make life easier 
for a young entrepreneur from Saint-Hubert or 
Rivière-du-Loup who wants to launch a new product? Who can 
help him? The Business Development Centre, the Community 
Futures Committee, the Youth Enterprise Centre, the 
<I>Corporation de développement économique</I>, the tourism 
corporation, the Federal Office of Regional Development, the 
Industrial Development Corporation, plus two members' 
offices. The development agencies mean well, but it is a real 
nightmare for our young entrepreneur to find his way through 
this administrative labyrinth. Often, after knocking in vain on 
all these doors, our young entrepreneur has to go back to 
dreaming about his future. Meanwhile, and this is even worse, 
agencies in the region compete with each other in a way that is 
unproductive.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Regional development must also be based on comprehensive 
projects like the high-speed train in the Quebec-Windsor 
corridor-that cannot be overemphasized. This project would 
create jobs in greater Montreal, at the Bombardier plant in La 
Pocatière and for our Canadian neighbours. This project would 
have a major impact. It would use the potential of our young 
people who are skilled in high-tech fields and would develop an 
expertise which could be exported throughout the world. It 
would also be a major contribution to the conversion of military 
industry.
<P>
	Geographical isolation is trivial compared to isolation from 
the main decision-making centres. The future of regional 
development in Quebec depends on respecting Quebec's 
jurisdiction in that field and recognizing the regions' right to 
control their own development, as the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission said.
<P>
	Federal intervention in regional development is very costly. 
Overlapping jurisdictions require such an expenditure of energy 
that not enough is left to deal with the real problems. By creating 
intermediate structures, too much time is spent administering 
the programs in order to co-ordinate decision making among 
various agencies. Meanwhile, money does not go to the 
community; it stays in the bureaucratic system.
<P>
	The share of income collected directly by government 
through taxes should diminish as local authorities obtain access 
to revenue sources from these same citizens. The infrastructure 
program is an eloquent example. What a fine effort the 
governments seem to be making without putting too much 
money into development!
<P>
	But do you not think that ideally, the municipalities 
themselves should have the ability to collect taxes and raise the 
funds needed for their development, without asking themselves 
whether the federal Parliament in Ottawa must be involved in 
the decision about a garage or a roadway in the 
Rivière-du-Loup region?
<P>
	I think it would be much better to decentralize the budgets and 
available funds significantly so that our local elected officials 
can decide on these matters.
<P>
	In the present federal system, a way to do this would be to give 
Quebec the tax points for the federal investment in this area, 
over $200 million, and to recognize Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction in this field.
<P>
	We are in a paradoxical situation, where the federal 
government which has the right to raise taxes never developed 
the proper tools to meet the regions' needs in support of their 
development.
<P>
	We gather from the 1993 election campaign that people yearn 
for a way to the future, where only one government will decide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="87"> 87 </A></B>
<P>
and will have all the power to tax and to eliminate duplication, 
overlap and inconsistencies among departments. People want to 
call on the values that already exist in their communities.
<P>
	This way of the future is Quebec sovereignty, a unique 
opportunity for a massive transfer to the regions of the $28 
billion in taxes which Quebecers pay to Ottawa. We will vote 
against the subamendment moved by the member for Calgary 
Southwest because it is out of the question to give the 
government a blank cheque for deciding on cuts without first 
setting up a committee to thoroughly study the proposed cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Madam 
Speaker, may I first of all congratulate you on your appointment 
to this distinguished office and through you the Speaker who we 
elected several days ago.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a significant fact that in a changing Parliament and in a 
changing Canada we are in the process of changing the House 
constitution, the rules. It indicates the basic fact of common law 
from which the law of Parliament is passed, that it is not a frozen 
cake of doctrine that gelled once and for all in some bygone age, 
but a continuing process of creative adjustment of old rules to 
new social circumstances.
<P>
	We have seen changes that were not expected. The House has 
elected a Speaker for the second time, but in this particular 
election there were extensive meetings between candidates and 
the political parties: the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party and 
as a special suggestion of the Prime Minister, with the Liberal 
Party. Perhaps no votes were changed, but I think there was a 
profound educational process.
<P>
	We are all better informed of the options of choice for the 
future development of parliamentary rules and procedures 
available to us. In the process of give and take there is a 
cumulative advance in our thinking because parliamentary 
constitutional law, as I said before, is not fixed in time. It is not 
graven on stone tablets. It evolves and it must evolve.
<P>
	The precedents we received in the 19th century must be 
balanced against precedents from other ages, the 17th and 18th 
centuries, for example. In some ways these are much more 
dynamic and creative in terms of the evolution of English 
parliamentary constitutionalism. They also affected the 
American constitution.
<P>
	What comes out of this is that this House will continue to 
build on parliamentary procedures, will continue to create new 
rules incrementally on the old. One looks forward to the 
co-operation of opposition parties in building a new and 
strengthened role for backbenchers and for committees. It is 
good to have the full co-operation promised by the Prime 
Minister and the House leader not merely in the election 
campaign but since so that we represent law in the making.
<P>
	That is a signal event for us because of course the speech from 
the throne has two main thesis in it. One is the concept of change 
that we live in a period of transition, in a sense a world 
revolution of our times, of which the collapse of the Soviet 
empire and the fall of the Berlin wall were merely symbolic 
indications. Large changes are occurring and they affect Canada 
as much as anybody else. Our institutions must respond to those 
changes.
<P>
	The speech from the throne picked up the thesis advanced in 
the <I>Livre rouge</I> of the Liberal Party that change must come, that 
it is inherent in our society. It should not be resisted. One should 
guide and direct it constructively.
<P>
	The second main theme in the speech from the throne is also 
the notion that one cannot isolate social problems. The social 
scientists speak of the polycentricity of problems and problem 
solving. It simply means that individual problems are not 
islands to themselves. One cannot separate social problems 
from economic problems nor can one today separate internal 
problems from larger problems of foreign policy.
<P>
	We live in a global village and what happens in far-flung 
areas of the world impacts upon Canada and upon our 
development. It is in that perspective that I approach my 
intervention in this debate.
<P>
	I represent the constituency of Vancouver Quadra which has 
had the honour of having as its members a Prime Minister, my 
predecessor John Turner, but also a very distinguished 
Conservative foreign minister, Howard Green who lived to a 
very ripe old age after his retirement from Parliament. He is 
remembered for reinforcing a principle developed first by Prime 
Minister Pearson and Paul Martin Senior, the notion that 
Canada's commitment in foreign policy includes a concern for 
people outside Canada and a concern for human rights. Howard 
Green, if you will remember, took the initiative as foreign 
minister within the Commonwealth to raise the issue of race 
relations with a member of the Commonwealth, South Africa, 
and to say that a policy of openness and open society is and 
should be a precondition to membership in the Commonwealth.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	And so I continue in that tradition. I must say one of the 
striking things in my constituency is that it mirrors the changes 
in process occurring in Canada as a whole. We have suddenly 
become a global community by the very happy fact of 
immigration and the integration of our new communities into 
Canadian society.
<P>
	My constituency encompasses Greek Canadians. It also has 
Polish Canadians. Some came as war veterans after World War 
II. Some came to escape the dying days of an inefficient, 
incompetent communist regime. The boat people came 10 or 15 
years ago and now have their children at college. There is a 
success story for you because they came with nothing. Our 
Indo-Canadian community and the Sikh community have con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="88"> 88 </A></B>
<P>
tributed so  much to our cultural richness. Our Chinese Canadian 
communities have come from mainland China, Taiwan and 
Hong Kong and are united in maintaining a new plural Canadian 
tradition.
<P>
	This in some way signals the growth and change occurring in 
British Columbia which was once traditionally preoccupied 
with forestry and industries with natural resources. They are 
still there. They are at the basis of our richness and the new 
dynamic and I would say, forward looking policies of 
management, a part of their present development.
<P>
	However, it may have escaped the notice of people in other 
parts of Canada that we lead in scientific development, 
particularly in the area of the relationship of science, scientific 
research, advanced technology and industrial application which 
the Japanese perfected but which we are doing now.
<P>
	The TRIUMF/KAON project is a monument to the new 
dynamism in British Columbia education and science and 
research. It groups together the great physicists of Canada and 
the world. It has attached to it as ancillary projects, geneticists 
like the Nobel laureate, Michael Smith. It has built a massive 
export industry which converts a company like Ebco of 
Richmond that once was a minor tool manufacturer into a 
multimillion dollar export industry for Canada with new jobs 
and new wealth contributing to the national well being.
<P>
	Therefore British Columbia represents at once this meeting of 
the new communities in a larger community of communities. By 
the way that term, sometimes attributed to Canadian political 
figures, is that of Martin Buber. He was speaking from his 
viewpoint as a central European scholar who later went to Israel 
and saw the need for communities to work together. The new 
pluralism means every community is enriched in the process.
<P>
	There is no longer, if there ever was, a problem of languages 
in British Columbia. It is the objective of parents whose children 
have mastered the <I>cours d'immersion</I> in the French language to 
move over to a third language. I think that may be the Canadian 
dream reflecting the new Canada and reflecting the new 
orientation to which British Columbia has contributed so much. 
The centre of gravity in the world community is moving from 
Europe to the Pacific and the Pacific rim and we are there.
<P>
	Therefore we will be speaking out in caucus and in Parliament 
on the necessary recognition of the new role of British 
Columbia. We sometimes feel that bureaucrats and maybe even 
political leaders in central or eastern Canada are insensitive to 
these dramatic changes in the balance of power in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	The important thing to remember here is that we have a view 
of federalism which corresponds to the view I expressed of the 
common law. Federalism did not gel once and for all in 1867 in a 
series of static relationships between institutions or a glorifying 
of old processes simply because they were there.
<P>
	We accept Mr. Justice Holmes' view that it is revolting to 
have no better justification for a rule than that it was laid down 
in the time of Henry II. Henry II has been dead for so many 
centuries. Therefore we believe in the continual updating of 
federal institutions.
<P>
	Federalism, as Prime Minister Trudeau said, is pragmatism. It 
is a process of constant readjustment of old institutions and 
rules to meet new problems. And so we have faith in federalism 
and the fact that our distinctness as part of the larger Canadian 
society can be reflected and translated into institutional and 
other changes within the Canadian Constitution and by a process 
of evolutionary growth that does not necessarily require formal 
changes to the constitution. The dynamic of constitutional 
growth in an existing society is that it comes through 
incremental change and adjustment in response to contemporary 
problems.
<P>
	In this period of change in which we all live I have spoken of 
the movement of the world community, the shift in the centre of 
gravity from Europe to the Pacific rim. It is a fact of life. It 
means there will have to be new emphasis on trade and 
co-operation with Pacific rim countries.
<P>
	However it also reflects one of the great dilemmas of the 
world community in a period of transition. We sometimes have 
the coexistence of the old with the new. It is sometimes a painful 
coexistence, even a collision.
<P>
	We expect that the 21st century will see the ideal of a viable 
world government. It is not with us now. Therefore, one of the 
realities is the commitment that Canadians have made in foreign 
policy from the golden period of St. Laurent, Pearson and Paul 
Martin, Sr. to the United Nations has to be balanced against the 
recognition of the regionalism that exists within the world 
community as a whole.
<P>
	It is good that the GATT discussions led to the suggestion for a 
world trade organization, but this is not for the first time. It was 
one of the hopes of the founding fathers of the United Nations in 
1946 that there would be a world trade organization. It was the 
failure, in some ways the unexpected failure, of this project that 
led to the not very satisfactory compromise of GATT. But like 
many not satisfactory compromises it performed a necessary 
function and deserves credit for those measures that have 
existed since 1946 to prevent an autarchic system of 
international trade.
<P>
	I come back to the basic point that to put all one's faith in a 
world trade organization and in GATT is not a sufficient remedy 
for the economic problems of our time.  I have no doubt, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="89"> 89 </A></B>
<P>
historical terms, that the government has been right to put its 
faith in NAFTA.
<P>
	The regional organizations, the trends of history, the 
movement of the European Community through the ideal of the 
single act into, in many respects, a closed regional community 
compels us to look for external markets wherever we can find 
them. I compliment both the red book, the livre rouge, and the 
government for the commitment to NAFTA. To be sure, there 
were international problems to consider, a thicket of problems 
that perhaps could have been considered more fully in the last 
several years. However, they are not insuperable. Treaties once 
made are not graven in stone. There are processes under 
international law for changing them to new circumstances.
<P>
	I had occasion as a private citizen in another capacity to 
examine the issue of freshwater export in bulk, whether it was to 
be covered by NAFTA or not. My conclusion was clearly it was 
not covered by NAFTA but I appreciate the concerns of those 
Canadian citizens who thought it was.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	On this particular point it seems to me that the solution 
adopted by the Canadian government, the exchange of 
statements, is adequate in international law to achieve that point 
of making assurance doubly sure on the water issue. Further 
possibilities for change exist on a similar basis. If we worry 
about what the United States would say, I would simply say that 
the United States government more than anyone perfected these 
methods of change in treaties, creative change after the treaty 
has been signed, sealed and delivered.
<P>
	We move to this situation of a coexistence of mondialist, one 
world tendencies through the new world trade organization, 
through the development of GATT and through our creative 
membership in new regional organizations like NAFTA.
<P>
	We should all commend the initiative taken by the trade 
minister to put out feelers to Chile, to new countries for 
membership in NAFTA to expand our trade opportunities. 
However we should also look carefully at associate membership 
for our Pacific rim trading partners, or trading partners to be.
<P>
	One of the great advantages of the new Canada, the new 
pluralistic Canada, is that we have an enormous natural resource 
in our citizens who have come here from other countries. They 
have the language and know the customs in terms of trade and 
commercial relationships and these things should be used to the 
fullest. I expect in the expansion of the trade initiatives this will 
be acted upon by the government to the fullest.
<P>
	In the general area of foreign policy the problems of living in 
an era of transition are obvious enough as they are in other areas. 
We would have to recognize that western foreign policy as a 
whole, after the period of creative growth, post war with the 
Marshall plan and those brilliant imaginative conceptions of a 
new world  order have been somewhat lacking in imagination 
and forward looking thinking in recent years.
<P>
	It is noticeable that there were no strategic plans in place to 
take account of the collapse of the Soviet empire and even 
Europe. There was a real failure to anticipate that collapse, yet it 
had been amply warned by all of the specialists.
<P>
	There was also a failure to anticipate in the absence of a plan 
for state succession the would-be renaissance of national 
conflicts, of ethnic conflict of the sort which existed in 
southeast Europe before 1914 and was reflected in the two 
Balkan wars and in World War I.
<P>
	One of our problems for Canadian foreign policy is that the 
golden era when we did lead the free world in new ideas, the 
golden era of the 1950s and 1960s, the St. 
Laurent-Pearson-Martin era, cannot be replicated any more. 
We were there because the colonization had not yet occurred. 
However, we anticipated it and we led the way to its peaceful 
application and peaceful development.
<P>
	Our economic position was stronger in relative terms in the 
world community than it is now. Of course we could say this 
even more for the United States which is also in a more 
imaginative period of thinking in foreign policy than in recent 
years.
<P>
	Some of the problems with which a new government and new 
Parliament is beset reflect from a failure to recognize the 
contradictions and to act on them in timely fashion. That is one 
of the challenges for a new government and a new Parliament.
<P>
	In relation to peacekeeping which Canada invented-it was 
Mr. Pearson's achievement and he was a Nobel laureate on 
account of that-we have to recognize today too many disparate 
tasks in too many disparate areas. In some senses in the defence 
forces there is too much preoccupation with military hardware 
and not enough attention to the new and highly political role that 
peacekeeping involves today. I think there was a second failure 
to recognize the distinction between peacekeeping which we, 
Mr. Pearson and Canada, devised and peacemaking which 
involves the overt use of armed force.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	These are some of the issues that we face now: the tragedy of 
Somalia, the tragedy of Bosnia-Hercegovina. These are 
problems that could have been anticipated and not really met-

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of all my colleagues, I would like to commend the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his excellent 
speech on regional economic development.
<P>
	Having worked for the Quebec government in the area of 
regional economic development for 25 years myself, I fully 
agree with him on three points. The first point he made 
concerning regional development, or non-development rather, 
was the laisser-faire policy we have in this country at this time.
<P>
	The second point that I endorse at once is that Quebec should 
get this jurisdiction back along with all the related tax 
considerations as soon as possible, so that there can a be a 
semblance of economic planning in that new country to be.
<P>
	The third point I obviously endorse and the last one he made is 
that the people of Quebec should make as soon as possible the 
only rational choice open to them in terms of comprehensive and 
global development, and that is the road of sovereignty, national 
sovereignty for Quebec as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> For the hon. member's 
information, usually, as a rule, questions and comments must 
deal with what the previous speaker has said, not another 
speaker who had the floor before the hon. member. Any other 
question or comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
this is the first time I rise in this House, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the people of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans for electing me on October 
25, last year, to represent them in this place.
<P>
	My question or comment for my hon. colleague from 
Vancouver Quadra is this: I want to tell him that I really 
appreciated his speech and that I would have liked him to stress 
the importance of rail transportation for regional development. 
My hon. colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, who 
is very devoted to regionalism, strongly emphasized the fact that 
the regions were getting poorer and poorer and I believe that his 
province and region are among those which owe their 
development to a railway stretching <I>A mari usque ad mare, d'un 
océan à l'autre</I>, from coast to coast.
<P>
	In their speeches, the Prime Minister and the hon. Minister for 
External Affairs have indicated how committed they are to this 
country. It reminded me of a slogan I heard as a fourteen year old 
during the Centennial campaign in 1967, which said: ``Canada 
Stand Together, Understand Together''. At any rate, I hope that 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra will ensure that rail 
transportation is maintained in the years to come.
<P>
	I also support the comment the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup made about the need for a 
high-speed train for the Quebec-Windsor corridor.

	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
somewhat surprised. We have now had two members of the Bloc 
up asking questions of my colleague and he has not yet been able 
to respond to them. I am wondering what rule you have been 
using to cut off the response to my colleague?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I thank the hon. 
member. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra was not on his 
feet. I assumed he did not wish to make a comment and therefore 
I went on to debate.
<P>
	Would the hon. member like to make a comment? We have 
five minutes left. You must rise so I can recognize you.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his remarks. I am very much aware of the 
flexibility of the Canadian federal system as I myself am a 
regionalist. I know we can make some important changes to our 
Canadian system.
<P>
	I would not want to speculate on the initiatives being 
developed by our hon. colleague, but I know that there will be 
good opportunities for the growth of regionalism in Canada in 
the near future.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
join the previous members in congratulating you and the hon. 
member for Welland-St. Catharines-Thorold for his election 
to Speaker of the House.
<P>
	In the words of the Hon. J. J. Greene, a former Liberal 
minister from my home town of Arnprior, Ontario: ``I am sure 
that you will fill with distinction the office that has in the past 
been occupied by so many distinguished men and women''.
<P>
	I also congratulate the mover and the seconder of the Address 
in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I wish both of them 
success in their careers in public service and here in the House.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the 
constituents of Calgary Centre for electing me as their member 
and representative of this 35th Parliament. It is truly an honour 
and a privilege to represent such a diverse group of people from 
a city that is so rich in western character and traditions.
<P>
	My constituents come from all walks of life and the majority 
are highly motivated and educated people who no longer believe 
in the concept of executive federalism. They are tired of secret 
policy formulations and abusive use of government patronage, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="91"> 91 </A></B>
<P>
perks and pensions at a time when they are asked to pay more 
and more in taxes.
<P>
	My constituents want fiscal and social reforms and more 
direct control over politicians and they want them sooner than 
later. As their member of Parliament I plan to listen to them and 
more importantly be held accountable to them during the time I 
am here, not just at election time.
<P>
	We have changed the faces of over 200 members in this House 
but if we only change the faces and not the system we will have 
accomplished nothing.
<P>
	Superficial or cosmetic attempts to correct the injustices in 
fiscal and political accountability will no longer be tolerated by 
voters of this great country.
<P>
	Time is of the essence in this Parliament. The time has come 
to satisfy the majority interests in this country and not just that 
of the special interest groups and elite Canadians. Today I will 
be analysing the government's legislative program from the 
perspective of fiscal responsibility and tax reform.
<P>
	As the national debt continues to increase, we know it 
threatens the future economic health of our nation.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Continued deficit spending will force future generations of 
Canadians, our children and grandchildren, to accept 
responsibility for this debt. It is a handicap that will be reflected 
in our ability to compete globally and to grow and prosper 
domestically. The average Canadian taxpayer cannot be asked to 
pay more in taxes in any form.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne there is no mention of deficit or 
debt or how the GST will be replaced. This is a concern. The 
Prime Minister has stated that the current system of taxation 
does not work.
<P>
	The need for tax reform is obvious. First, it is too 
complicated. Most cannot fill out their own forms. They need to 
hire professional assistance. Second, it is inequitable. The 
progressive system with its many tax loopholes favours the rich. 
Third, there is no real effective mechanism to prevent open 
ended spending on ineffective and unnecessary programs. 
Fourth, our high rates of taxation and the GST have contributed 
greatly to the underground economy of $60 billion to $80 billion 
which is not taxed. We must introduce measures to eliminate the 
need for taxpayers to avoid paying taxes. As witnessed 
yesterday by the Auditor General's report there is over $900 
million in GST unremitted. Fifth, it is unfair to finance current 
programs at the expense of future generations who have no vote 
in the political process.
<P>
	Our children and grandchildren may never forgive us if we do 
not acknowledge that it is their money that we are spending and 
committing.
<P>
	As members know, our chartered banks are reluctant to lend 
money these days because of the economic uncertainty. Why not 
give some direction and leadership and commit this 35th 
Parliament to solutions which send the right signals to the 
investment community, the lenders and the taxpayers? 
Increased taxation and a reliance on infrastructure spending 
alone will not significantly reduce the deficit or encourage an 
economic recovery.
<P>
	The federal government could demonstrate fiscal 
responsibility and restraint however by considering the 
following alternative to the taxation system which would help us 
solve some of our problems. It is essential to broaden the tax 
base in order to lower the average rate of taxation with a new 
system that treats all individuals and corporations equally. This 
will surely appeal to the common sense of all Canadians.
<P>
	I would propose a simple, flat tax on income or, as my leader 
likes to call it, a ``proportional tax'' with a generous, fully 
indexed exemption for lower income wage earners.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you may have already heard of this idea under 
the name of the single tax as it was called by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. His book, entitled simply <I>The Single 
Tax</I>, gives a lucid and compelling exposition of how this 
approach could be applied to Canada. Regrettably the proposal 
has found no favour in his own party whose leaders 
unfortunately are in love with the complex and manipulative 
character of the old system. I challenge and encourage them to 
reconsider.
<P>
	In conclusion, we should commit ourselves to balancing the 
budget, target funding to the truly needy and limit expenditures 
to $153 billion in the 1994-95 fiscal year. These changes would 
have tremendous advantages. First, they would stimulate higher 
tax revenue for the government. Second, they would remove the 
incentives for the underground economy. Third, they would 
stimulate more economic growth and create jobs which after all 
is the number one priority of the Prime Minister's red book.
<P>
	I would like to close by changing somewhat the slogan of the 
late Senator Stan Waters from ``Keep on marching'' to ``Let us 
start marching''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member just talked about having constituents 
from all walks of life and how changing just the faces will not 
work if we just change the faces and not the intent of the 
government.
<P>
	The hon. member is well aware, because he looks this way, of 
the very different faces that are on the government side, whether 
it is my colleague or others. I think that members should be 
aware that changing the  faces or the colours of the faces has

very much changed the dynamics of how the government will be 
operating in the years to come.

<P>
	The member said: ``all walks of life''. I just want to ask the 
member whether he has any groups of aboriginal people in his 
riding and where his party stands on the issue of the inherent 
right of self-government because in the throne speech mention 
was made of the recognition of the inherent right of 
self-government for aboriginal people.
<P>
	I just want to ask the hon. member this. I realize he may not be 
the person dealing with aboriginal issues but he may well know 
the policy of his own party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member and 
going back to only changing the faces and not the system, I 
perhaps may not have explained myself very well. If all we do is 
change the faces and not the way we do business in this House, 
not the way we look at how we spend money, not the way we look 
at how we evaluate programs and not the way we decide what is 
in the best interests of Canadians then we will have 
accomplished nothing. Whether we have aboriginals, 
Hungarians or different colours, it does not matter. We must 
have systemic change in this House. That is what is important.
<P>
	Canadian voters wanted change and expressed it by sending 
so many new people to this House. They have changed the 
people so it just follows logically that we have to change the 
system.
<P>
	In response to the second part of his question with respect to 
aboriginal rights, my party and I are very much in favour of 
working with aboriginals towards self-government and for the 
fulfilment of their dreams.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member noting that the government must 
balance the budget. However, the approach taken will be the 
critical factor. We are confident that the hon. member and his 
party, the Reform Party, will agree that spending must not be 
reduced at the expense of the least fortunate. A parliamentary 
committee should be convened to review each separate 
budgetary expenditure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would concur with the hon. member 
that balancing the budget is a priority. I would also concur that a 
review of the spending estimates, program by program and then 
line by line, is very important and one that would provide great 
benefit to this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I was elected to this House I was a professor of 
economics. How I wished I could use the threat of failing grades 
to get the attention of this audience. Unfortunately I have to use 
other means.
<P>
	My position here has cost me dearly. Upon learning about my 
election my former colleague and friend, Milton Friedman, 
noted that now I had become an unreliable economist. You can 
imagine my dismay when the hon. member for LaSalle-Émard 
the other day said to me in front a large audience that I could 
expect to be at the bottom of the totem pole as a member of the 
House who is also an economist.
<P>
	Before I present my comments on the throne speech, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to tell you and the 
hon. members of this House where I come from in a number of 
senses.
<P>
	I arrived in North America in 1956 at the age of 22 with only a 
light suitcase full of clothing and the heavy baggage of a really 
thick German accent.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Through hard work, lots of luck and a long odyssey of 
academic positions in the United States, in 1971 I saw the light 
and accepted a position as professor of economics at Simon 
Fraser University, which, as you may know, was identified by 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine as the best Canadian university in its class 
last year.
<P>
	I love my adopted country of Canada. Its system of 
democracy, liberty and opportunity has made it possible for me 
to be in this distinguished Chamber today. Its economic system 
has produced the highest standard of living for the largest 
proportion of the population of a country in the history of 
mankind. I have dedicated myself to the defence of this system 
against the onslaught of excessive government in the lives of 
Canadians and against the massive deficits that threaten its very 
existence.
<P>
	There is no perfect economic and social system in this world. 
But I think that the efforts to perfect ours have gone too far. 
Some of our country's most serious economic and social 
problems have been caused by well-intentioned but flawed 
government programs. That is why I believe that the solution to 
these problems is less, not more, government.
<P>
	Geographically I come from the riding of Capilano-Howe 
Sound which is scenically one of the most spectacularly 
beautiful ridings in all of Canada. It consists of the Vancouver 
bedroom communities of West Vancouver and North Vancouver 
which enjoy one of the highest per capita incomes in all of 
Canada. The riding also includes the industrial town and port of 
Squamish, the farming community of Pemberton and last but not 
least the resort community of Whistler which has been for some 
years identified as the best ski area in North America. In a recent 
survey it was called the best in the entire world. I am proud and 
deeply honoured to be able to represent the residents of 
Capilano-Howe Sound in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="93"> 93 </A></B>
<P>
	The throne speech and many other pronouncements by the 
government have promised the restructuring of Canada's social 
programs as one of its major legislated programs for this 
Parliament. In the few minutes remaining to me here I would 
like to share with members of the House some insights I have 
gained from a study of these programs.
<P>
	Before I do, I want to get out of the way one other fundamental 
and very important matter. From long experience I know that the 
discussion of social programs often leaves antagonists 
questioning each other's motives. Please, in our deliberations in 
this House let us not do so. Neither the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South Centre nor the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway have a monopoly on compassion. It is 
because of my strong concerns about the ability of the 
government to deliver support to those in need in the future that 
I make the following remarks.
<P>
	The issue for me and Reform is not whether the unfortunate in 
our society should be cared for but how best to care for them 
today and tomorrow. Canada's social programs are beset by 
three major problems.
<P>
	First, too much of the spending benefits families with high 
incomes. For example, families with incomes of over $100,000 
a year in 1992 received $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion in UIC and 
OAS benefits respectively. Such transfers clearly are not 
consistent with the objective of providing a security net for 
Canadians beset by financial calamity. They are a subsidy to 
higher income earners that the country can no longer afford. 
They are the unwanted consequence of the noble desire to 
provide benefits universally without a means test.
<P>
	Second, the current system has created incentives to which 
rational Canadians are responding in ways that greatly dismay 
socialists in Canada and the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Most of the hon. members here remember the choice faced by 
the single mother in Toronto who took her case to the media last 
summer. The media missed the main point by concentrating on 
whether or not she lost income by giving up her $42,000 a year 
job and going on welfare. Even if she had suffered a loss of 
$6,000, what the system does is that under these conditions she 
is asked to work for $500 a month. She and many Canadians 
have been deciding that it is not worth their while to work for 
that amount of income. I do not blame her or anyone else on 
welfare or UIC for making such choices and neither does 
society. That is the reason why, in spite of record outlays for 
social programs, the problems today are alleged to be worse than 
they were even 20 years ago.
<P>
	Third, the framers of our large and universal social insurance 
programs knew that, except in the case of seriously handicapped 
people, government support should be temporary. It knew that 
lengthy assistance would create dependency and ultimately hurt 
recipients  more than it helped them on their life voyage. 
Experience with Canada's programs has now shown that 
dependency has become a serious problem for a dismaying large 
number.
<P>
	The preceding diagnosis of the ills of Canada's social 
programs cries out for a prescription for a cure. I must confess to 
you, Mr. Speaker, and the other members of this House that I do 
not have such a prescription because basically I believe there are 
none.
<P>
	What I do have are some ideas on how to alleviate the ills that 
I have identified. However, the discussion of these ideas must 
wait. In the meantime, I wish the hon. member for Winnipeg 
South Centre and the government the best of luck in their own 
search for possible cures, band-aids and palliatives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment briefly on the speech by the 
hon. member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	In my opinion, he touched on two critical points. The first is 
the high cost of social assistance for the less fortunate and the 
poor in our society. The second is the concern over the cost of 
administering the government. As of yesterday, the deficit 
topped the $500 billion mark. This is absurd, frightening and, I 
would even say, dangerous.
<P>
	Obviously there is reason for concern about Canada's 
ballooning debt. The daily interest alone on the debt is 
astronomical. Why is it that the first reflex we have when it 
comes to putting our finances in order is to target those who are 
the least fortunate?
<P>
	There are many other things that we should consider before 
turning our attention to the disadvantaged, the poor, the sick, 
welfare recipients and so forth. This morning's edition of <I>Forum</I> 
tells the story. There are at least five to six pages of examples of 
government mismanagement.
<P>
	Mention is made of the $25 million spent on travel by 
ministers. Twenty-five million and perhaps ever more, 
according to the Auditor General. There is a reference to 
administrative oversights regarding tax breaks for resource 
companies. I cannot remember the exact amount quoted, but the 
figure was enormous. I think it was $900 million. Then there is 
the enormous cost of running our embassies.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to review each administrative item 
separately and clean house. I am certain there is a considerable 
amount of money to be recovered. Then, if further cuts were 
needed, perhaps then we could look at the most disadvantaged. 
However, we should not start with them. We must start by 
trimming the fat.
<P>

<P>
	Mention was made of a kitchenette and bathroom installed for 
the head of Investment Canada at a cost of $125,000, according 
to what was said this morning. That is enormous. You may say 
that these are mere drops in the bucket as far as the overall 
budget goes. However, these are the kinds of expenses we have 
to tally and eliminate before-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I see the member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound on his feet. I was waiting for the member for 
Beauharnois-Salaberry to conclude his remarks. I know the 
member will be left with a rather brief period of time to answer.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	If the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry could finish 
up quickly, the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound could 
then respond. Are you nearly finished?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I want to give the 
hon. member time to respond, if he wishes, so that will be all, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I deplore the idea that we discuss 
this important issue on how to save Canada from bankruptcy by 
hammering away at non-existent facts.
<P>
	On the matter of our deficit the fact is that 60 per cent of all 
our spending is going to transfers to persons. We have to do 
something about it. This is where the money is. We cannot save 
this country with line by line spending examinations and cutting 
out the sorts of things the hon. member is talking about. Even if 
we abandoned all the government we could not get our house in 
order.
<P>
	Sooner or later, and I believe as quickly as possible, we will 
have to get at the core of the cause of our financial problems: 
overspending through the mechanism of transfers to 
individuals, so-called social programs. Contrary to what the 
member has said I have identified that we must not attack 
benefits for the poor. It is because the Reform and I are 
concerned about maintaining benefits for the poor that I believe 
we must look at the shortcomings in our current system that I 
have identified.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in entering 
the debate today I would like to seek the permission of the House 
to be allowed to conclude in 20 minutes even if it oversteps the 
one o'clock limit.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House has heard the member's request. Is 
there unanimous consent not to see the clock at one o'clock?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate is about Canada, its 
economy and its future. As has been noted from the speeches 
given yesterday the Liberal view of the economic condition is 
quite clear. We need to create jobs and to put Canadians in the 
position to spend and to pay taxes to get the economy going. We 
need to stop the downward spiral of cuts.
<P>
	I submit that lack of revenue is the problem. It is not a 
problem of spending as has been outlined in several 
interventions so far by representatives of the Reform Party. By 
contrast, I heard yesterday the leader of the Reform Party 
recommend to reduce here, to stop spending there: reduce and 
stop, reduce and stop, cut here, cut there, cut everywhere and 
inevitably create further unemployment, stagnate the economy 
and, as an added technique proposed yesterday by the member 
for Calgary South, put a cap here and there and as long as those 
who are employed are doing all right everybody else will be 
fine.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday the leader of the Reform Party, the member for 
Calgary South, trotted out an old idea advanced some years ago 
by two American senators, Gramm and Rudman. He urged 
spending caps as his remedy for economic ills. Then, to give his 
imported policy a Canadian touch, he produced another old 
chestnut. He urged the elimination of old age pensions for 
Canadians who make more than a certain sum, thus advocating 
something we reject on this side of the House, two classes of 
citizens; thus introducing means tests; and thus weakening the 
cohesion of our social fabric.
<P>
	I submit that the idea of eliminating old age pensions is 
actually not new in the ranks of the Reform Party. We will recall 
that during the election in early October, as reported in one of 
our national newspapers, a Reform Party candidate in British 
Columbia was quoted as saying that old age pensions were a 
form of welfare. That is what he said and that is what must be 
remembered. It is the agenda of the Reform Party. It is on record. 
Let us not be deluded today or enchanted by statements made on 
the part of its representatives as to what was in its program and 
in its campaign statements.
<P>
	We cannot accuse the Reform Party of not being consistent. 
The member for Calgary South is well known for his admiration 
of the American health system which also divides society into 
the haves and the have nots: those who have access to social 
programs and those who do not. There is consistency there no 
doubt.
<P>
	Let us go back to the economy. One is forced to conclude that 
the Reform vision of the economic ills of Canada and their 
remedies is a rather constipated vision. It badly needs to be put 
in touch with reality. I invite the leader of the Reform Party to 
enter, if not the 21st, at least the 20th century. I invite him to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="95"> 95 </A></B>
<P>
make that effort. In so doing he may discover that government is 
not an evil force, that unemployment is the disease that needs to 
be cured in order to get the economy going.
<P>
	In other words, the leader of the Reform Party is off the mark 
in his diagnosis of Canada's ills. I submit the problem is not one 
of expenditures. Canada's problem is one of revenue. Instead of 
cuts the first recommendation on the road to recovery would be 
to stimulate and create jobs directly or indirectly. That cannot be 
achieved, as the member from Calgary who spoke the morning 
indicated, by balancing the budget. It cannot be done. He should 
read his economics 101 text to refresh his memory.
<P>
	Second would be to reduce the underground economy by 
restoring the confidence of Canadians in our tax system.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	A third would be to eliminate as much as possible the tax 
privileges better known under the name of tax expenditures 
amounting to billions of dollars in lost revenue to the Canadian 
public purse.
<P>
	A fourth would be to repeal the ill conceived legislation 
passed in 1991, a bill entitled Bill C-19, an act respecting banks 
and banking, which gave chartered banks a great incentive to 
invest in bonds at the expense of investing in business.
<P>
	If there is one point that I would like to leave as being the 
main thrust of this intervention on my part today, it is that the 
last thing that Canada needs are cuts in social programs, unlike 
the theology put forward by Reform Party spokesmen and 
spokeswomen. A good social security network leads to a healthy 
and strong economy as the thriving economies outside North 
America have already proven.
<P>
	Our illness is not expenditures. The finance department 
produced last week a most interesting report for November on 
the condition of Canada's deficit. It was even reproduced 
nonetheless in the business section of one of our national 
newspapers, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, of all places. From that we 
learned that the deficit in November is down from a year earlier, 
revenue is down, expenditures are down, program spending is 
down and debt charges are down. Yes, that is what the Dow Jones 
article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on page B3 of last Saturday reports 
as a result of a report produced by the finance department.
<P>
	We can see that the symptoms are that expenditures and 
revenues are down. One must conclude that the cure is not to 
reduce further expenditures even more but to increase revenues. 
That is what we need to do.
<P>
	One way to increase revenues is to remove the privilege in our 
tax system which is costing large sums every year to Canadians 
as a whole. Let me give some examples.
<P>
	We have the non-taxation of lottery and gambling winnings. 
Do members know that cost in revenue to the Canadian people 
every year? For 1991, the latest year for which we have figures, 
it was a loss of revenue of $860 million.
<P>
	Then we have the $100,000 exemption of capital gains which 
meant in the same year a loss in revenue of $665 million. This is 
not a member of Parliament speaking, it is the finance 
department speaking in its report issued last week and 
reproduced partially in the business section of the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> as I mentioned a moment ago.
<P>
	Then we have the dividend, the gross up and credit which 
account for a loss in revenue of $700 million. Then we have the 
partial inclusion of capital gains which is a loss in revenue of 
$665 million. Then we have the investment tax credit of $49 
million.
<P>
	Moving from personal to corporate income tax we find, again 
according to finance department figures just published last 
week, items like subsidies for business meals and 
entertainment. For instance, there is the box at the Skydome in 
Toronto if one takes it for $100,000 or whatever the fee is, or 
escort services or no matter what. That total loss of revenue is 
$357 million.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Then there are subsidies for multinationals investing 
overseas, such as exemptions in foreign currency deposits. The 
amount is $505 million a year. Then there is the partial inclusion 
of capital gains, some $417 million in 1991.
<P>
	There are more items: subsidies for business lobbying, 
business advertising, real estate developers and professionals. 
For all these items, strangely enough, the finance department is 
incapable of providing a figure despite the urging-note 
this-of the Auditor General over the last five or six years to do 
so, if my memory does not fail me. We still do not know the 
extent of these tax expenditures. I submit that these are tax 
privileges which in times of economic hardship are 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Let me bring up another facet in the jungle of revenue losses. 
In Canada there is no minimum corporate tax at the present time. 
Some would think that we must be competitive with the giants 
south of the border and we cannot have a tax that they do not 
have. It turns out that in the United States there is a minimum 
corporate tax of 20 per cent.
<P>
	We do not know the revenue loss in relation to this tax nor the 
losses incurred through a Canadian tax exemption called the 
21-year trust rule. Has one ever heard about the 21-year trust 
rule which the Tories renewed in the dying days of the last 
Parliament? Yes, there is, Maryanna, a tax called the 21-year 
trust rule. The estimated loss is in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars. However the finance department is not capable of 
telling us the precise amount. It cannot. Is that not strange?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="96"> 96 </A></B>
<P>
	All in all, to sum it up because my time is coming to an end, it 
would be fair to estimate that if the major tax concessions 
presently existing in the Canadian tax system were to be 
eliminated the federal public revenue would go up by several 
billions every year. It is a matter of political will.
<P>
	If we are to reduce the deficit, I submit in conclusion, then 
eliminating tax expenditures is a good way of doing it. It could 
be done without penalizing ordinary Canadians who presently 
bear the brunt of a taxation system which has, over the last 10 
years, been allowed to become regressive, unfair and a burden in 
order to help the privileged.
<P>
	Our taxation system cries to heaven. It is in desperate, urgent 
need to be modernized, made fair and progressive and to be one 
in which Canadians can have faith. If we do that then the 
underground economy will gradually reduce and eventually 
disappear. In doing that also we will not see the need for cutting 
the social programs which are the product and the result of the 
architecture of successive Liberal governments over the past 50 
years beginning with Mackenzie King in 1939 when 
unemployment insurance was introduced and moving on to St. 
Laurent, Pearson and Trudeau.
<P>
	The Canadian social security system is the result of a Liberal 
ideology. It is a good one. It needs to be strengthened, not 
weakened. It is one which will make our economy better and 
stronger. I submit that we should be proud of it and reinforce it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being one o'clock p.m., 
I do now leave the chair until two o'clock p.m., pursuant to

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we on this side of the House find it disturbing to note 
the lack of specifics in the throne speech on a number of vital 
national issues. However, we did not expect the government to 
neglect so completely a subject of utmost importance to rural 
Canada, and that is agriculture. In fact, its absence is 
conspicuous. We can only hope that this is not an indication of 
the government's intention to put agriculture on the back burner.
<P>
	Farmers like myself are anxiously waiting on that back 
burner. We are the ones who stand to get burned. This while 
government chefs cook up higher deficits and more bureaucracy 
using a recipe they dug out of an old Keynesian cookbook.
<P>
	The government of today cannot afford to ignore vast regions 
of our great country. Rural and urban Canadians all deserve 
equal treatment. All opposition members will require it of this

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, over time 
forests have been reduced from 34 per cent to 12 per cent of the 
world's land mass. In much of the world deforestation continues 
causing soil loss, land slides, shortages of water, damage to fish 
and wildlife. Forests provide habitat for biodiversity and absorb 
carbon dioxide. Life on the planet is threatened when forests are 
threatened.
<P>
	However, the world community increasingly recognizes the 
value of forests. Forests must be given high priority on the 
international agenda, both politically and scientifically. The 
proposed royal commission on forests and sustainable 
development patterned on the Brundtland commission would be 
a good first step. Unfortunately, in Rio in 1992 the United 
Nations Conference on Environment and Development issued a 
weak statement.
<P>
	Therefore I urge this government to lead like-minded nations 
toward the establishment of an international forest commission. 
Such a commission would report on how to sustain forest 
biodiversity, ensure environmentally sustainable forest 
management and protect social-ecological systems.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
municipal pier of Grondines, in the riding of Portneuf, is 
deteriorating. The municipality proposed to the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans to award a contract for the laying of rocks 
to protect the jetty, which would solve the problem for several 
decades to come. As well, Hydro-Québec has agreed to provide 
the rocks free of charge. Those rocks will be available following 
the dismantling of a structure used to cross over the waters. The 
municipality hopes to acquire the pier and use it for recreational 
purposes.
<P>
	This project would allow the department to give a new life to 
the facility and save about one half of the amount it would 
otherwise have to spend, while at the same time freeing itself of 
recurrent costs.
<P>
	Since Hydro-Québec intends to deliver the rocks no later than 
next summer, I want to co-operate with the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans so that his department and the municipalityof Grondines can immediately benefit from this uniqueopportunity.

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, the film 
``Schindler's List'' depicts what can occur when racism is 
permitted to go unchallenged or, even worse, ignored.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The increased incidence of racism and hate propaganda in 
Canada, as well as the tragic events in Eastern Europe, 
demonstrate that the atrocities of the Second World War related 
in the movie cannot be viewed as an isolated event or a historical 
aberration.
<P>
	The horrors of the past could be repeated-in fact they have 
already been repeated-if we do not fight racism. MCA 
Universal gave me the authorization to show, for the benefit of 
all parlementarians, the movie ``Schindler's List'' this evening. 
We, the legislators representing the various regions of our 
country, have the obligation, towards our voters and towards all

	There are even more important reasons yet why we want to

the underworld and other undesirables. Those moneys are used 
to fund more crime, more violence, gun running and so on.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCARE">HEALTH CARE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, in answer to one of my questions, the Prime 
Minister quite frankly admitted he was prepared to reduce 
health care expenditures, and I quote: ``If we are able, working 
in co-operation with the provinces, to reduce the health care 
expenditures of all  levels of government, then both the 
provinces and the federal government will save money.''
<P>
	We also know that the Minister of Finance is in Montreal, on 
the first day of a two-day federal-provincial conference with 
his provincial counterparts.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister if, considering his 
position on reducing health care expenditures, he has instructed 
his Minister of Finance to convince or indeed oblige his 
provincial colleagues to reduce health care levels in the 
provinces by agreeing to a reduction in provincial transfer 
payments.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I have said before, it is in the interests of all levels of 
government to try to reduce spending in all sectors, including 
health care. If governments were able to reduce spending in this 
area, both the provincial governments and the federal 
government would improve their financial situation. If they do 
not succeed, expenditures will remain at the same level.
<P>
	However, I want to try. In fact, this House wants the entire 
public sector in Canada to reduce spending levels, and all 
sectors should be examined, including health care.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how is it possible for anyone to take seriously the 
commitment made by the government in the speech from the 
throne to the sacred principles of the universality of the health 
care plan when we heard the Prime Minister say, as he said 
yesterday, that he had made a decision to reduce the level of 
resources devoted to health care?
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are some universal health care services existing, for 
example, in Europe where they spend less than Canada in 
relation to their GNP. In the United States they do not have 
universal medicare and they spend 14 per cent of their GNP. In 
Canada we spend 9 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="100"> 100 </A></B>
<P>
	I know of some countries in Europe that have universal 
medicare which applies to all their citizens and they spend 7 per 
cent to 8 per cent of GNP. If we could be as good as them 
everybody would be saving money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I notice the Prime Minister is more interested in 
monetary matters than in the level of health care to be offered to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that the situation is already 
very disturbing for health care recipients-in Quebec, for 
instance, and I am sure it must be about the same anywhere else 
in Canada, there is a five-month wait for heart surgery and three 
months for radiation therapy -and that by using his proposed 
transfer payments to the provinces to improve spending cuts, he 
will further extend delays that are already unacceptable?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Canada's 
health care services are administered by the provincial 
governments, and we contribute to the financing of these 
programs. The provincial government's own administration 
may decide what its priorities in this area will be, and that is 
each government's responsibility. Federal transfer payments are 
for us a way to ensure that health care services are available and 
universal across Canada. However, each provincial 
administration is responsible for its own budget priorities. The 
Constitution, in fact, gives the provinces jurisdiction over this 
area.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this is the first 
time I speak in this House, I would like to congratulate you on 
your appointment.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Mr. 
Speaker, regardless of the successive federal governments, 
fisheries management has been short-term, short-sighted and 
chaotic-so much so that the Auditor General told us yesterday 
that Ottawa gave grants to fishermen who had died or did not 
qualify. Not only is the department unable to manage marine 
resources but it also seems to be unable to manage financial 
resources.
<P>
	My question therefore is this: What specific short-term 
measures does the minister intend to take to put the management 
of his department's programs back in order, as the Auditor 
General asks, since, let me add, his 6,000 officials no longer 
have any cod to manage?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question and I congratulate 
him on his new responsibilities.
<P>
	Let me first of all make clear that the member asks what 
action this government will take to put order in POWA 
programs. The Auditor General's report is an assessment of the 
previous administration's program, and  the Auditor General 
himself has noted that most of the concerns that have been raised 
have been dealt with.
<P>
	Furthermore, the notion that funds were paid to people who 
were deceased in my reading of the Auditor General's report is 
nowhere to be found, although I understand an official said at 
some point perhaps that was possible.
<P>
	Let me advise the member that notices have been sent to 1,300 
individuals asking for complete and full repayment. That 
process is under way. This government, when it delivers its 
program post May 15, will do so in a professional, competent 
and first class manner that I know the member himself will be 
happy to applaud.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, my second question 
is when? When can fishermen in Quebec and Canada, who are 
now living in total uncertainty, have an idea of what the minister 
will do after May 15, when the Fisheries Adjustment and 
Recovery Program ends? Will we have the traditional 
improvisation from the Department of Fisheries, that is, a 
presentation on May 14? Let me repeat: When will the minister 
lift the veil of uncertainty? When?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to assure the member opposite that we will not 
have an improvised approach. We will have an approach that is 
very much the result of wide and complete consultation with all 
provincial governments affected, including the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I had a meeting with fisheries ministers from all the Atlantic 
region in Quebec City a few weeks ago. My colleague, the 
minister responsible for employment programming in Canada, 
human resources, met last week with representatives of all 
harvesters in Canada, including the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The purpose of these meetings is consultation: to listen, to 
reflect upon the advice that is being given, and to ensure that 
when a program is delivered in this country it is the result of 
broad based public consultation at the community level.

of his government is jobs and economic growth. Yet yesterday 
he and other Liberal members were repeatedly drawn into

future of Quebec.
<P>
	There are millions of Canadians including Quebecers who 
want Parliament to focus on deficit reduction, jobs and 
preserving social services.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister abandoning his commitment to stay out 
of the constitutional swamp or is it still his resolve to stick to 
economic, fiscal and social priorities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my answer is yes to the second part of the member's statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister have any strategies, mechanisms or 
suggestions for this House to enable the constitutional concerns 
of the Bloc members to be addressed without allowing them to 
consume a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of 
this House?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer to that is very simple. I cannot stop them from talking 
about separation. They have the freedom to do that.
<P>
	I know very well that if members of the official opposition 
keep talking about separation and constitutional problems they 
are not living up to why they are here. The people in every riding 
of Quebec want all members of this House to work together to 
make sure that we have economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one further supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister envision some special role for the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in this area? Is its focus 
going to be primarily on Canada-Quebec relations or on 
relations with all provincial governments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister is charged to deal with all the provinces and to work 
to try to eliminate a lot of the duplication that exists between the 
two levels of government. He will deal with all the provinces 
because it is a concern right across Canada. That type of 
problem is not only in relation to the province of Quebec. It is 
with all the provinces. We would like to eliminate a lot of 
duplication.
<P>
	When I met with the first ministers in December we went 
through a list of possible elimination of duplication. The 
minister is working very actively to make some progress in that 
field.

yesterday the premier of Quebec, a true  federalist as you well 
know, made an urgent call to his federal counterpart-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member will ask his 
questions through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. You can blame it on my lack 
of experience.
<P>
	So I ask my question through you to the prime minister. I 
remind him that yesterday the premier of Quebec, who is a true 
federalist and whom the prime minister knows well, made an 
urgent call to his federal counterpart to solve the issue of 
overlapping responsibilities in the manpower area. It was an 
urgent call.
<P>
	Meanwhile, last Tuesday, his minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs associated this agreement with the reform of all 
Canadian social programs.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my question is as follows: How does the Prime 
Minister reconcile the urgency to act and the Quebec Premier's 
request and the gradual strategy of his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we already discussed this problem with the Premier of Quebec. 
We would like to find a solution to this problem but it is a very 
complicated issue. Equalization is also involved, in that it 
depends on the needs of each part of Canada. Unfortunately, 
since the Atlantic provinces and Quebec have proportionately 
more unemployment than the rest of the country, they receive 
more money.
<P>
	A way must be found to use federal funds to help unemployed 
people whom they want to train and to allocate these funds on 
the basis of regional needs. For this regional distribution, 
federal authority must be maintained; otherwise, if we simply 
transfer jurisdiction, the transfers will be made per capita and 
the province of Quebec will lose a lot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the Prime Minister. Is he willing to 
pledge right now that he will do his utmost to ensure that this 
issue is settled without delay, as the Quebec Premier has been 
requesting, in order to dispel the doubts cast by his Minister for 
Intergovernmental Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what matters is not to respond quickly but to take proper action, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="102"> 102 </A></B>
<P>
and we are going to take all the time necessary to find the 
solution that will ensure that Quebec is not penalized. If we go

of this federal program.

<P>
	Is today the day that the Prime Minister is to rise in his place 
and free the members of this Parliament to represent their 
constituents by declaring that the government will not consider 
the defeat of a government motion, including a spending

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this House has had long standing rules of procedure which we 
follow. I think that it would be very easy, with the majority we 
have, to embark upon a process that would render the 
government not accountable for its decisions, but we also have 
to consider the consequences if, in a distant future, a minority 
government were to be elected to Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to keep in mind what would be the long term effect of 
such a proposition on this Parliament.
<P>
	Some time ago we came a long way from that. I remember 
when we lost a vote in the House on the budget when Mitchell 
Sharp was the minister. Mr. Caouette who was a social creditist, 
the grandparents of the Reformers of today, made a proposition. 
He had managed to defeat a budgetary proposition and he said 
that it was not a defeat of the government. Through that good 
decision of Mr. Caouette's we remained in power and won the 
election a few months later.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his answer. 
I do bow to his expertise.

	However I would wonder if the Prime Minister might explain 
to the Canadian people why he refuses to allow their MPs to 
represent them faithfully in Parliament.

Minister of National Revenue has announced that he has  
withdrawn the action he had brought against the government. 
Upon verification however, the Federal Court-Appeal Division 
docket seems to indicate that part of the case is still pending and 
will have to be heard on appeal.
<P>
	Does the Minister agree that he is still in a conflict of interest 
position because of this action pending with regard to his travel 
expenses since his Cabinet colleague, the Minister of Justice, 
has to plead against him?

	<B>The Speaker:</B> It would seem that the question might be out of 
order. I would rule it out of order. It should be directed to the 
minister in charge of conflict of interest since it is a matter of 
law. Perhaps the member could rephrase it.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a question for the Prime Minister to answer. I have been 
informed by the Minister of National Revenue that the minister 
has withdrawn his action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those are the instructions he has given his lawyer. Now, did 
the lawyer follow these instructions? I do not know. We will 
look into this. The minister clearly stated that he had instructed 
his lawyer to withdraw the action. Was the lawyer remiss or did 
he do his job? What I was told is that the minister had 
specifically requested that the case be discontinued.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the discontinuance order right here and it applies only to the 
cross-appeal. This means that there is still an appeal pending 
before the Federal Court.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to tell me: under his new code 
of ethics, is it appropriate that his Minister of National Revenue 
be in a position of conflict of interest, based on the facts I have 
just stated, which were verified no later than this morning by the 
Federal Court, or should he not choose between resigning his 
Cabinet seat and withdrawing his appeal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not believe that the hon. minister was in a conflict of interest 
situation at any time. As a citizen, the minister had rights

	Any of us who risked sustaining damage or injury on federal 
property due to the negligence of a government employee would 
be entitled to sue the crown. Anybody, including me, any 
minister and the leader of the Opposition. But, to avoid 
controversy, the minister has decided to withdraw his appeal. If 
his counsel did not carry out these instructions-and if he is

care system?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no question that governments have lost a considerable 
amount of money. That is why we have decided to consult with 
the provinces and work together with them to address the 
smuggling problem. If both levels of government cannot 
co-operate, if one acts and the other does not, then we will not

<P>
	As the hon. member for Verdun-Saint-Paul pointed out

Newfoundland and Labrador.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, before we proceed with other 
business of the House, we have been asked to pay tribute to one 
of our former members of Parliament and one of the officers of 
the chair, Mr. Steve Paproski.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that many hon. members will want to take a few 
moments to remember a long serving and much loved 
representative of the city of Edmonton who passed away 
suddenly late last autumn.
<P>
	The Hon. Steve Paproski came from Poland to Edmonton as a 
child. As a young man he was a popular hometown player for our 
champion football team, the Eskimos, while building a 
successful career in business.
<P>
	He was elected to the House of Commons in 1968 and retired 
at the last election undefeated in seven elections. In a quarter 
century in this House he served as his party's chief whip, as 
Minister of Fitness and Amateur Sport and as one of the 
assistant Speakers of the House.
<P>
	He had friends not just in his own party but in every corner of 
this House. Although he was as capable as anyone and better 
than many, in the cut and thrust of political debate he refrained 
from insult and personal attack. He truly believed that all 
members were entitled to express their points of view and that 
all were here to serve their country.
<P>
	As proud as he was of his Polish birthright it is an illustration 
of his approach to life that he became famous here for his St. 
Patrick's Day receptions.
<P>
	Steve Paproski was a big man in every sense of the word. In 
Edmonton and here in the House of Commons his generosity of 
spirit and of deed was unsurpassed. He was a proud family man, 
a pillar of the church and a committed servant of the people.
<P>
	It is sad that he could not live to enjoy the retirement to which 
he had looked forward. We all join his wife Betty, his children 
and his grandchildren in missing his warm and happy 
personality and his very wise counsel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, would like to pay tribute to our 
friend Steve. I had the honour of knowing him and of being with 
him and especially of appreciating him from 1984 to 1993.
<P>
	In 1984, for the new Conservative members, he was a valuable 
advisor, an exceptional motivator, and he helped us a great deal 
in learning the rules of the House and the British parliamentary 
system.
<P>
	As Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole House, he 
immediately gained the respect of all parliamentarians. Patient, 
impartial, a gentleman, knowledgeable of the rules of the House, 
he always found the words, the friendly approach and the right 
argument to have his decisions accepted.
<P>
	In my first steps as House leader of the Bloc Quebecois-the 
party was not even recognized then-every time I asked him for 
a meeting to claim our rights, he always received me in a 
friendly, affable way. It  was then that I learned to appreciate 
him. A sincere, democratic, humane, honest man, he always put 
the interests of the House and its members first.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying a word to his family. We 
understand your sorrow and the great pain you feel. How many 
questions must have gone through your mind in trying to 
understand and accept the death of someone so close to you!
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Is there an acceptable answer when such a tragedy befalls us? 
I do not believe so. There is only the courage and determination 
to go on with one's life, with the assurance that the deceased 
person is still proud of us.
<P>
	The great French author Alexandre Dumas said one day that 
those whom we have loved and lost are no longer where they 
were, but they are still everywhere we are.
<P>
	I extend our sincerest condolences and a word of 
encouragement to Steve's whole family. Thank you, Steve, for 
your invaluable contribution to Canadian democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise to pay tribute and also with sadness that I rise 
on behalf of my party to make mention of the Hon. Steve 
Paproski and the contribution that he made to this House.
<P>
	Steve was born in September 1928. We lost him as a friend in 
this Chamber as well as to people right across Canada on 
December 3, 1993.
<P>
	Mention has been made previously of his wife, Betty, and 
their five children, Patrick, Peter, Anna Marie, Alexandra and 
Elizabeth. Although many weeks have intervened since Steve's 
death we need to realize that that pain, although it does dull 
somewhat, is still very sharp in their memory after the 
incredible loss of their husband and father.
<P>
	Looking at the professional career of Steve Paproski, those of 
us who are proud of our Edmonton Eskimos certainly know that 
he became a household word when he was a lineman for the 
Eskimos from 1949 until 1954. What a thrill it must have been 
for Steve.
<P>
	I can hear him on the couch on Grey Cup day screaming as 
loudly as any one of us who were cheering for the Eskimos: ``Go 
Esks, go''. They did not let him down. What a wonderful way for 
him to witness his last Grey Cup.
<P>
	He was the general sales manager for Alberta Concrete 
Products and elected to this House, as has been mentioned 
earlier, in 1968. He celebrated 25 years in this House of 
Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="109"> 109 </A></B>
<P>
	As everyone knows, he chose not to run in the last election. I 
am sure that it did his heart proud that he chose to go into 
retirement rather than going into retirement from this place 
without choosing it.
<P>
	I have many memories of the Hon. Steve Paproski, all of them 
good. I say that unequivocally. His smile was what he was 
probably most known for. I appreciated that smile as I sat in my 
place during the last term. How good it was to see someone still 
with a twinkle in his eye being able to just smile so readily at all 
the things that go on in this place.
<P>
	One memory that I have so strongly of Steve Paproski was 
when he sat in the chair and hollered for the yeas and nays. Then 
he said: ``In my opinion the nays have it''. That tone of voice and 
relaxation that he brought was so good that I will never forget 
those words ringing in my ear: ``In my opinion the nays have it''.
<P>
	Last year Steve Paproski called me from my place to the chair. 
I thought: ``He is going to recognize me''. Of course it was a 
thrill in those days to be recognized by the Chair. He said: 
``Deborah, is such-and-such a place in your constituency''. He 
named a little place. I said: ``Yes, it is, Steve. It is so many miles 
from my house and has a small area of residences''.
<P>
	He said: ``Guess what. I just bought a lot there and you are 
going to be my new MP. How am I ever going to explain this?'' 
We had a good laugh together about that.
<P>
	Most recently this fall I received a personal phone call out 
west from Steve just after the election and he congratulated me 
on my marriage and my re-election. It was wonderful just to 
have a few minutes with him. I had no idea it would be my last 
visit with Steve. Those memories are precious and I appreciate 
them.
<P>
	My final memory of Steve was picking up the newspaper after 
church in Edmonton on Sunday, December 5. I picked it up and 
before I even grabbed it out of the machine I saw the headline 
stating that Steve Paproski had died of a heart attack.
<P>
	It was almost as if my heart just gripped as well. Something 
had gone dreadfully wrong. Something was happening over 
which of course not I, his family nor anyone else had any 
control. He was dead. He is dead but his memory will continue to 
live on in this place.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	On behalf of my caucus and all members here, I would like to 
pay my respects to his wife Betty and their family and say once 
again, as any tribute I have given in this House, thank you so 
much to the Paproski family for sharing Steve with us.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak 
today on behalf of colleagues who have had an opportunity to sit 
with Steve Paproski in the same House. I also speak on behalf of 
a political party that quite frankly was privileged to have had the 
opportunity to have Steve Paproski as a candidate and as a 
member of  Parliament representing us and also at one point in 
time a cabinet minister.
<P>
	In the end, Mr. Speaker, as you will know, he reached the 
highest office of all. It is the one that in this place is recognized 
as a tribute to any of us. It is the privilege to sit in the chair you 
are sitting in today as one of the Deputy Speakers.
<P>
	Steve Paproski, as a Canadian, had a great opportunity not 
only to sit here and make a contribution in the political field, but 
also, as was mentioned, as an athlete. There are few things that 
are not as well known about his career. One is that he studied at 
the University of Arizona on a scholarship.
<P>
	I should also say something which I found out while listening 
to a eulogy delivered by His Excellency the Governor General. 
What he shared with us at the time is that during those days of 
his scholarship, given the fact that he had very little means, he 
supplemented his revenue by acting from time to time as an 
amateur wrestler. He was known because of his amateur status. 
He became known as the Masked Marvel. He would from time to 
time wrestle against a gentleman named Gene Kiniski. Of 
course Gene would win on one day and Steve, if you can believe 
the coincidence, would always win the next day and so on it 
would go. In some matches they in fact became a tag team. I 
should say that it sounds like quite an appropriate preparation 
for life in this place as I recognize my tag team member here 
today.
<P>
	What was also remarkable about Steve Paproski was the love 
and understanding that he had for this place. I remember 
arriving here in 1984 and having the privilege of being one of the 
Deputy Speakers. Because we had other work to do and 
accomplish and because I was the youngest of the group I was 
often asked to sit on Fridays and often went to Steve to ask him 
whether he would or would not replace me. In his way he would 
sit in the chair and say: ``What is it again, kid? What is it that 
you want?'' to each and every one of us who had the privilege of 
knowing him. He would grumble but would always say yes. In 
that way I was more often than not one of the great beneficiaries 
of his great generosity.
<P>
	I think we would all want to remember Steve for his joie de 
vivre and the fact that he always recognized that this country 
was a country of privilege. A small anecdote about Steve's life is 
that he would, as often as he could, bring people by the store that 
his father had opened in Edmonton. He had been born in Poland. 
I read the first speech he gave in the House of Commons and the 
references he made to his experience as a young Canadian born 
in another country where freedom was not what we experience 
here and what we take for granted. He had come to Canada, grew 
up here and took his place not only in this House but as a 
minister of the Crown. That says volumes about our country and 
about Steve Paproski.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="110"> 110 </A></B>
<P>
	In concluding I also want to offer our condolences to Betty 
and to his children and also a word and a smile because Steve 
Paproski had a million dollar smile. He will leave with us great, 
great memories.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to join 
with the others to say how shocked and saddened we all were 
when we heard on the news in December of Steve's passing.
<P>
	Steve was a very different member of Parliament. One thing I 
remember about Steve was that whenever he was in the chair 
there always seemed to be a group of people around him 
chatting, coming and going and passing little stories back and 
forth. As my hon. friend here has indicated he was always filled 
with innocent little tidbits about his life.
<P>
	I remember him telling me after seven elections how he was 
so successful with his campaign strategy. He said: ``You have to 
spend a lot of time at home, Nelson. You have to get to know 
people. As an example, when I campaign I simply put a sign up 
on the highway that says `Steve's ahead'. I just stand on the road 
and everybody knows who Steve is''. He just waved to his 
constituents as they went to work in the morning or returned at 
the end of the day.
<P>
	That is the kind of person he was. Everybody knew who Steve 
Paproski was when he went into his constituency. In here we all 
felt very close to Steve Paproski. That was not a function of the 
fact that he was here for so many years. It was from the kind of 
person he was. It was his personality.
<P>
	He loved his family. He loved his wife and his children and 
they loved him. He had a zest for life. Someone referred to his 
smile. He always seemed to be a very happy person. He always 
had a cheery comment to make and he was always willing to 
greet anyone in a very positive way. I think he was a great 
motivator for us even during those tense times in the House. 
When he was in the Chair he always had that comment that 
would calm everybody down with a little laugh.
<P>
	We will miss Steve Paproski. Not only will those of us who 
knew him miss him, but Canada will miss him. He made a great 
contribution in so many ways. He was a new Canadian, elected 
seven times, served his country as we have heard in so many 
different capacities and he served this House and Canada so 
well.
<P>
	Our hearts and our prayers go out today to his wife Betty and 
to his children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too remember Steve Paproski very well. I remember 
his smile. I remember the twinkle in his eye that people have 
referred to here today. I remember his service in the chair and 
the way he was very cordial and respectful of every single 
member in this House of Commons. He was always there to offer 
a word of encouragement.
<P>
	I, as well as Steve, had some background in football. He was a 
player. I had some involvement in management. I often talked to 
Steve about football. In these days of turbulence in Canadian 
football I think perhaps it is worth mentioning that Steve 
dreamed of the day when Canadian football would return to 
Montreal.
<P>
	He often said to me: ``Why do we not put a team back in 
Montreal and we will go and manage it?'' I think if there is 
anything he would rather have done than be in this place it would 
have been to manage a football team.
<P>
	Reference has been made to his belief in this country. If I 
remember correctly, when he was a cabinet minister he was 
responsible for turning over Lotto Canada to the provinces and I 
believe he always regretted it. I think he understood that we 
needed national institutions to bind Canadians together and to 
provide a bit of cement to keep this country together.
<P>
	I would like to join all other members in this House in 
expressing my condolences and in paying my respects to the 
members of his family
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
join with the other members of this House to convey to the 
family of the late Hon. Steve Paproski not only my personal 
condolences but also those of the constituents of Edmonton 
North which is the riding he served faithfully during his long 
term of office.
<P>
	I can think of no more fitting tribute to Steve Paproski than 
the number of friends who have paid their respects at his 
passing. They are not only those who were at the church service 
but also the people of Edmonton North who have mourned his 
loss.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I would also add that Steve Paproski was respected and loved 
by the staff of the House of Commons. To his family and friends 
I would say that we are honoured to have known him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, much 
has already been said about Steve and I am not here to repeat the 
things that have been said.
<P>
	I believe it would be useful at a time when we are opening a 
new Parliament, we are just into the second or third day, to use 
this occasion of Steve's passing to remind new members and the 
Canadian public of the underlying collegiality that has existed 
in this place for a long time and does not just begin today with a 
new Parliament. There was an underlying collegiality of which 
Steve Paproski was one of the best symbols and incarnations 
thereof. This is a place where friendships across party lines are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="111"> 111 </A></B>
<P>
formed, where much co-operation has gone on and where the 
kinds of relationships that have been spoken of here today 
between other members and Steve Paproski have existed. It was 
not just in that case but in many cases.
<P>
	One of the unfortunate things about public life and 
parliamentary life in this country is that those kinds of things do 
not get reported and focused on. The best thing we can do to 
honour the memory of Steve Paproski would be to remind 
ourselves of this fact and try and build on that kind of spirit 
which he brought to Parliament.
<P>
	Everyone talked about the twinkle in his eye. It was visible, 
but it was a mischievous twinkle. Many times we were the 
victims of that mischievous twinkle from the Chair. He had a 
way of doing things that left even those who felt they got the 
short end of the stick smiling.
<P>
	I will certainly miss him. I will not have the opportunity to do 
to you, Mr. Speaker, what I used to do to Steve unless you also 
understand Ukrainian. Coming from Winnipeg I speak a little bit 
of Ukrainian and Steve knew a lot of Ukrainian and sometimes I 
could tell him things that Hansard never picked up. I am going 
to miss that ability to speak to the Speaker in this personal code 
we had. For this he often called me Rasputin, which was his 
favourite name for me. So from Rasputin and as the member for 
Winnipeg Transcona I say to his family that we will miss him. 
Parliament was a much better place for his having been here all 
those years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I simply want to agree with everything that has 
been said about Steve today. I knew him since the day he came 
into the House. He was a great friend, a jovial type, a very 
amiable character and, yes, a character. He was very proud of the 
fact that he came from Poland. He was very proud of his 
background.
<P>
	If my memory serves me correctly he once came into my 
riding to the little hamlet of Wilno, which is the oldest Polish 
community in Canada and they thought the world of him.
<P>
	He did far more behind the scenes around Parliament Hill than 
any of us realized to bring people together and he made good 
friendships all over the place.
<P>
	To his wife Betty, five children and grandchildren I extend our 
sincere thanks for sharing him with us. On behalf of the Polish 
community throughout my riding that he talked to me so much 
about, I extend their sympathy to his wife and family.
<P>
	We who knew Steve well can say today that we are thinking of 
him and of his wife and family. He might have been a linesman 
for the Edmonton Eskimos and a good one, but I will say that he 
was a great linesman around Parliament Hill too. He must have 
been a great linesman in his constituency. We all thought the 
world of him. I think anyone who can leave this place leaving 
that thought in the minds of the people with whom he or she 
worked, makes us indeed very fortunate.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic  
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to 
catch up on some correspondence. In the fall I was opening a 
series of letters and I came across a handwritten note from our 
friend Steve who said to me, as we had known each other going 
back to 1968: ``Glad to see you back there. Give you all the help 
when I'm in town next. I'll come around to give you some 
pointers now that you're on the other side of the House''.
<P>
	I put it in my briefcase to take home that night to show my 
wife whom he knew well. Then I started to read through the 
newspapers and found at exactly the same time there was notice 
of Steve's passing. I never got a chance to write him a thank you.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity, because I know Steve is 
probably tuned into this debate somewhere, to say thank you 
very much for all the good years you gave this House and all the 
good advice you gave all members. The spirit of people like 
Steve Paproski will always live on in this House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to add a couple of very brief comments. We as 
members of Parliament have the privilege of being able to 
express on the floor of the House our affection, our respect and 
our sense of loss of our friend Steve Paproski.
<P>
	I know a number of members have spoken of the respect that 
Steve treated everyone with. I wanted to take a moment to 
remind the House of the fact that Steve Paproski as a deputy 
speaker and as a member of this House for many years had 
tremendous respect and love from the people who worked on the 
Hill: the messengers, the people in the cafeteria and all those 
people who cannot speak here today.
<P>
	I was on the Hill shortly after Steve died. I was struck by the 
number of people working here who in a very emotional and 
very strong way talked about the sense of loss they felt for their 
friend Steve. I know that they would want us on the floor of this 
House to acknowledge and recognize the kind of respect that 
Steve showed everyone on the Hill as a person and as a deputy 
speaker.
<P>
	He was a big man. He was a strong man. He was also a very 
gentle man. Reference has been made to his smile. I learned long 
ago that when Steve was smiling the widest you had to look out. 
He had a big smile but behind that smile was a very shrewd and 
calculating mind. You knew that if he was going to stick it to 
you, he was smiling just a little bit wider. He treated everyone 
with respect. He loved his family.
<P>
	I might say personally that I deeply appreciated the support he 
gave to me. In the spring of 1988 I made a fairly difficult 
decision to come out publicly as a gay man. It was not easy. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="112"> 112 </A></B>
<P>
Some of my colleagues were a little uncomfortable with that. I 
will never forget in this House shortly thereafter Steve putting 
his arm around me and saying: ``You know, Svend, I don't really 
understand this stuff but you're my friend and you're the same 
person to me today that you were yesterday''.
<P>
	I will miss Steve tremendously. I know he loved his family 
very much. To Betty and to the children I extend my sincere 
condolences. We loved him too and we will miss him very, very 
much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add a few words of deep sympathy and condolence 
to the family of Steve Paproski.
<P>
	I first met him before I entered politics, in fact away back in 
the early eighties when there was a travelling parliamentary 
committee on the participation of visible minorities in Canada. 
Somehow he struck me as a person of collegiality and a fatherly 
person.
<P>
	When I first came here in 1988 I approached him and he said: 
``Son, how are you?'' I thought, being a rookie, that was the 
proper word to use, but until the last moment before the 34th 
Parliament ended he called me son. That depicted for me the 
type of caring person he was to everybody in the House.
<P>
	I also recall he would tell us that members on the opposite side 
were not enemies but only adversaries and that this Chamber 
was all about active debate on issues of national dimension.
<P>
	I would like to convey to his family my deepest sympathy and 
my condolences in the realization that in the great beyond Steve 
Paproski has earned his rightful place.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like to say a few words, if I might, on 
behalf of a dear friend and colleague of many years, Steve 
Paproski.
<P>
	You will forgive an admission from your Speaker that from 
time to time I indulge in small wagers. Steve Paproski and I had 
a running bet. It was always a bet on the Grey Cup. It was not a 
big bet. It was something we could all well afford. He always 
took Edmonton and if Edmonton was not in the Grey Cup he 
always took the west. Of course I took the east. This small wager 
started in the fall of 1974 and it continued through all the years 
up until this past year.
<P>
	Even when I was defeated in 1984 and I was not here from that 
time until 1988, the bet was still on. He would send me a cheque 
for $5 if the east won and I would send him a cheque for $5 if the 
west won. The funny part of it is that I cannot recall him ever 
cashing any of my cheques.
<P>
	He was the kind of man who befriended all of us in this House. 
Yes, he was warm. Yes, he was an honest man. Yes, he did sit in 
this chair and preside over our debates. We are honourable 
members. This is an honourable House and Steve Paproski, it 
should be noted, among honourable members and in this 
honourable House was one of the most honourable and one of the 
most loved.
<P>
	We in this House have much to learn from a man with his 
character. We have much to learn about serving our country 
from Steve Paproski. I do not use the words  lightly when I say 
that he is one of our great Canadians because he loved this 
country. He loved it with all his heart.
<P>
	To his wife and to his family, surely in your name and in the 
name of all hon. members we will remember Steve in our 
prayers, and we say God bless you and thank you for sharing him 
with us for so many years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have not consulted with anyone 
but given the eulogies and the kind words for our friend, Steve 
Paproski, could I suggest to the Speaker that with unanimous 
consent of the House we include in our proceedings today the 
remarks made by His Excellency the Governor General at the 
funeral service for our friend Steve Paproski.
<P>
	They were very close friends and I think it would be 
appropriate that Canadians have the opportunity of reading his 
words as he spoke of a person who was not only a friend but at 
one point in time a colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous agreement to append the

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, as is the 
custom and tradition of this House, at this point in the 
proceedings, I would ask my colleague, the Leader of the 
Government in the House, to shed some light on what lies in 
store for us this week and next week.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will continue with the address debate today, tomorrow and 
Monday, with a vote on the amendment to the amendment of the 
hon. member for Calgary Southwest this evening and a vote on 
the amendment of the hon. leader of the Official Opposition on 
Monday evening.
<P>
	On Tuesday there will be a debate on peacekeeping and on 
Wednesday the House will debate the matter of cruise missile 
testing.
<P>
	If there are changes in that order of business I will inform 
House leaders of the other parties as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, considering that 
next week we are going to be having these important debates on 
peacekeeping and cruise missile testing, I would like to ask the 
government House leader whether he would consult with his 
colleagues to see if there would be an opportunity to have a 
debate that would enable all members of Parliament to 
participate, which would mean not seeing the clock or extending 
the debate into the evening.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said today that there would be a full 
debate where all members would have an opportunity to express 
their views if they so wish. I wonder if my hon. friend would 
discuss it with his colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already informally mentioned 
to the House leaders of the Reform and Bloc that the government 
would be happy to give consent to continuing beyond the normal 
hour of adjournment on Tuesday and Wednesday.
<P>
	I had originally suggested that we might agree on a later time 
of adjournment, say ten o'clock. I would be very happy to 
consider letting the debate continue until all members who wish 
to express their views on the subjects of both the special debates 
I have mentioned have had a chance to express them and place 
them on the record of the House.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion for an 
address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his 
Speech at the opening of the session; and of the amendment; and 
the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> At the suspension of the 
House the hon. member for Davenport had concluded his 
intervention and a 10-minute question and comment period is 
now available.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
start by congratulating the hon. member for Davenport on his 
re-election. I would also like to tell this House how much I 
appreciated his comments this morning.
<P>
	The hon. member for Davenport stressed how important it 
was to preserve Canada's social safety net. What I appreciated 
the most was the answer he gave to a Reform Party member who 
claimed that seniors pensions were nothing more than social 
welfare. I appreciated the hon. member telling us that this was 
not the case.
<P>
	Receiving a cheque does not mean that a person is wealthy. 
Given the serious crisis we are now experiencing, I 
believe-and it cannot be said often enough-that we must not 
cut social services and programs. Instead, the government must 
target tax shelters which benefit the wealthier members of 
society. The government must trim the fat in government and 
review its budget item by item. It must target unemployment, 
not the unemployed.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have a question for my hon. colleague who 
worked in the field of education for more than 22 years. My 
question is this: What does the government intend to do to 
restore hope for our young people who are finishing school and 
have no job prospects?
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his remarks and his question. I am confident that the answer to 
his question will be known when the minister of Finance tables 
his budget, and also that Canada's economic policy will give 
hope to young Canadians looking for work. As many of you are 
aware, we have launched a municipal infrastructure program 
which, I hope, will give young people as well as all unemployed 
workers, regardless of their age, an opportunity to find jobs.
<P>
	As was mentioned in the Throne Speech, the Secretary of 
State responsible for Training and Youth is in the process of 
creating a Youth Service Corps, patterned on the former pro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="114"> 114 </A></B>
<P>
gram set up and supported by senator Hébert, which was well 
received by Canadians across the  country. I am referring to the 
Katimavik program. I hope that this global initiative will give 
young Canadians an opportunity to find work.
<P>
	Obviously, we hope that the policy of our government and our 
party will adequately meet the social and economic aspirations 
of all the members in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
speech, the hon. member for Davenport alluded to the 
unemployment crisis and the government's will to find a 
solution to that problem. May I say that I have my doubts 
regarding the will and the determination of the government to 
create long-term employment for the vast majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Throne Speech read on Tuesday is a good illustration of 
the government's lack of initiative regarding job creation. 
Indeed, except for the infrastructure program, no concrete 
measures were announced.
<P>
	The hon. member for Davenport also mentioned the lack of 
revenue of Canadians. I fully agree with him on that but I want to 
go back to the issue of pay equity. This is a major obstacle to the 
financial independence of women. The President of the Treasury 
Board stated that he would enforce the Canadian Human Rights 
Act, especially the provisions dealing with pay equity.
<P>
	Therefore, my question is: How does the President of the 
Treasury Board intend to implement the Canadian Human 
Rights Act and, more importantly, how quickly will he act? Does 
the present government intend to correct the abuses of the 
Conservative government regarding pay equity in the federal 
public service?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is very interesting but 
also very complex. It should be asked to the responsible minister 
during Oral Question Period. I urge the hon. member to do just 
that in order to get an answer which I cannot provide in the time 
allotted to me. Generally speaking, my answer is the same as the 
one I already gave to the member for Québec-Est. The Minister 
of Finance's budget will provide a more detailed answer to that 
question.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to congratulate the hon. member for Davenport on his 
re-election. He was an accomplished opposition member in the 
old Parliament. Now he obviously plays a different role on the 
government side. In that position I would like him to clarify his 
remarks on a couple of items.
<P>
	He spoke about the need to preserve programs for seniors and 
also his opposition to tax breaks. Would he support his 
government's musings about possibly cutting seniors programs 
by cutting the RRSP? This is one seniors program that is well 
funded and secure in this country. Does he support that 
examination?
<P>
	Also on the old age security, now that he is a government 
member does he support the previous Parliament's actions 
introducing a clawback to old age security? Does he expect his 
government to bring a repeal of that in the upcoming budget? If 
the government does not, would he be prepared to vote against 
that budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the measure introduced by the 
Conservative Party in the latter part of the 34th Parliament, the 
RRSP program has been distorted to such an extent that it 
provides a considerable tax advantage to high income Canadians 
and provides no advantage at all to Canadians in the lower 
income brackets. I therefore urge that this distortion be removed 
and that the loss in tax revenue be restored to the advantage of 
the overall revenue of the federal exchequer.
<P>
	As to old age security, I believe that society is best served by a 
system in which we all contribute and where on reaching 
retirement age we all share in receiving the pension we have 
contributed to. In the case of the old age security to which we do 
not contribute directly, it is my belief that it should be 
redistributed to all Canadians equally regardless of income.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to talk to the people of the riding of Mercier who gave 
me and the Bloc Quebecois such a huge majority and such a clear 
mandate to defend their interests and those of the whole 
province of Quebec in this House. I want to thank them for the 
confidence they have shown in me and I will try at all times to be 
worthy of their trust.
<P>
	The riding of Mercier is located in the easternmost part of 
Montreal and it has suffered a great deal as a result of all the 
changes in the world economy. This riding is currently 
undergoing major changes and is in desperate need of a good 
employment policy, and that is what I want to talk about this 
afternoon.
<P>
	I cannot help expressing the emotion I feel as I begin my first 
speech in this House, thinking about the forced union of 1840 
when the patriots, companions of Louis-Joseph Papineau, 
ceased to be Canadians to become French Canadians just as the 
English became English Canadians.
<P>
	The patriots who became French Canadians-and we know 
that Lafontaine was one of them and so was Laurier-had no 
other choice but to accept colonial government and to try to 
make alliances with members representing Upper Canada. And 
that is exactly what they did.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="115"> 115 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	As a person with an active and abiding interest in history, I 
can testify that French Canadians have done everything to try to 
take their place in Canada. Individually they were successful, in 
some cases, although assimilation was sometimes the price they 
had to pay. As Quebecers they were not.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, let me explain, as others before me have done, 
why so many Quebecers see sovereignty as the only future for 
Quebec. I think the members of this House would find it 
worthwhile to listen to what I have to say and I think they should 
understand what is going on in a part of Canada's territory that 
has 25 per cent of its population.
<P>
	The success of the Bloc Quebecois has made it abundantly 
clear that although placed in a minority positions, the 
Canadiens, later French Canadians and then Quebecers-in 
Quebec-were able to maintain their collective identity in the 
face of series of constitutional set-backs.
<P>
	Today, members of the Bloc Quebecois form the Official 
Opposition because they represent a founding people that was 
never recognized as such. Members of the Bloc Quebecois can 
neither come to power nor govern Canada but they can testify to 
a truth that has long been denied and is nevertheless one that all 
Canadians must face: there are two countries in Canada. 
Quebec, like it or not, is that other country.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it was not revenge for what happened in the past 
that led Quebecers, for the first time in their history, to elect as 
their representatives in the House of Commons a strong 
contingent of sovereignist members who campaigned as such. It 
was to prepare for the future in a Quebec with sufficient powers 
to use its resources to meet its own tremendous needs.
<P>
	Today, standing before my peers and constituents, the people 
of Mercier and all of Canada, I want to start by discussing 
poverty and unemployment in Quebec. As I describe the extent 
of these conditions, I think you will understand why so many 
Quebecers became sovereignists in order to deal effectively and 
quickly with this catastrophe. This is an emergency, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	Quebec's pervasive unemployment, structurally higher than 
in Ontario, does not even give the whole picture of the 
devastating impact of federal policies. To really understand the 
difference between Ontario and Quebec, we should talk about 
the employment rate, the number of people in the labour force 
and the number of people who have jobs, and then we see the 
difference in wealth and development that separates the two 
so-called central provinces which have been indiscriminately 
attacked by the other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, high unemployment, a low job rate and an 
unusually high percentage of Canada's poor: that is the picture, 
and it shows us how economic conditions have affected social 
development. Without the economic picture, Quebec's 
participation in the federation might  be seen only in terms of 
social expenditures. We must conclude that preventing 
economic development in Quebec has created a condition of 
apparent under-development which has had a profound impact 
on society itself.
<P>
	And now for some history. You will recall that poverty levels 
in Quebec were measured and compared, probably for the first 
time, and in any case it was the first time they were compared 
with the rest of Canada, by the Boucher Commission. Some of 
you may remember this. In 1963, the commission concluded that 
Quebec, with, at the time, 28 per cent of the population of 
Canada, received a little over 36 per cent of the benefits paid in 
Canada under the new Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	This week, Mr. Speaker, the Montreal Island School Board 
published a report containing figures that are absolutely 
devastating for Quebec. I read the whole report last night.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	For the first time since Statistics Canada has been gathering 
data, Quebec has the dubious privilege of being the poorest in 
Canada. Quebec has the largest number and the largest 
proportion of families living below the poverty line. In fact, the 
situation is worse than Newfoundland and New Brunswick 
which used to compete for this dreadful ranking. There is, in 
Quebec, a little over 25 per cent of the Canadian population, but 
almost a third of low income families.
<P>
	The data from the 1991 census show that the Montreal area, 
among 25 areas considered, has the largest proportion of low 
income families. I might add that when we talk about the 
Montreal area, we include not only the island, but also the 
surrounding suburbs which have been remarkably richer for a 
long time. This gives you an idea of the standard of living in the 
city of Montreal and especially in some or its neighbourhoods. 
The situation is untenable. We can conclude that the years of the 
quiet revolution, which we are so proud of, although they did 
produce development, did not alter the distribution of wealth 
between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Poverty and relative 
under-development have a great deal of impact on social 
development.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources will understand the social 
significance of the Canadian Assistance Plan, which pays 50 per 
cent of all welfare payments, and other cost-sharing programs 
of which Canada is so proud. We should add that this program 
has also contributed to maintain poverty rather than reduce it. 
Generally speaking it has increased Quebec's dependency on the 
rest of Canada and the dependency of individuals on society.
<P>
	The Boucher report highlighted three main reasons why 
Quebec is poorer: its economic development, its share of the 
GDP, a poor state of health and mentalities in general. In its 
conclusion, it called mainly for what we would describe today as 
a full employment policy. To recognize as fundamental the right 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="116"> 116 </A></B>
<P>
to last recourse  assistance could, in no way, contribute to the 
fight against unacceptable poverty levels.
<P>
	It remains true; last recourse assistance can only be that. 
Having stated this truism, I feel compelled to state that the 
Canada Assistance Plan is partly to be blamed for this 
dependency. For example, because of the CAP, in the 1980's, 
Quebec was unable to claim 50 per cent of the assistance it 
wanted to give low income workers to help them stay in the work 
force. Under this plan, assistance could not be given to people 
who did not pass the needs test. In other words, Canada only 
supports helping the poor as long as they do not try to escape the 
poverty cycle, lose hope and give up their minimum wage job, 
and make the smart decision, moneywise, to go on welfare.
<P>
	The way the federal government has managed unemployment 
insurance has led to the misuse of social programs, with the 
blessing of the federal government, since the 1970's; it has set 
up and financed short-term employment programs with no other 
way out than unemployment insurance. Lise Poulin-Simon and 
Diane Bellemare, two writers well known in Quebec for their 
work on full employment, stated in their first book entitled Le 
plein emploi, pourquoi? that neither government has any 
interest financially in investing in job creation since the other 
level stands to reap more benefits from the spin-off. Quite an 
important finding!
<P>
	Beyond the totally negative impact of federal policies on the 
Quebec economy, redistribution policies have had perverse 
effects which, far from rectifying disparities, have had a 
tendency to maintain them and to keep people in a state of 
dependency and poverty.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I hope the House now has a better understanding of why 
Quebec has always wanted to repatriate all powers in the area of 
income security, including management of the unemployment 
insurance program. Using accountability as an excuse, the 
federal government has always insisted on keeping complete 
control over the funds it received and redistributed for social 
programs; in doing so, it maintained and even increased the gaps 
instead of decreasing them.
<P>
	As critic for human resources, as a human being interested in 
the fate of ordinary people and the poor, wherever they are, I will 
not fight only against poverty and unemployment in Quebec. To 
be effective, though, we must first determine how to proceed. 
The fight against unemployment and poverty is a matter of 
collective will. Whether we like it or not, we must rely on the 
authorities in place and count on community participation. The 
solutions recommended for Quebec will not necessarily be valid 
for the rest of Canada, but already some broad lines are 
emerging.
<P>
	In a recent proposal the Economic Recovery Commission of 
Newfoundland said, and the premier of that province concurred, 
that the unemployment insurance program and the various 
social programs should be managed jointly. In spite of the 
interest on the part of the Minister for Human Resources 
Development, I am not sure this reform will be possible without 
modifying the Constitution and renegotiating the plan in depth.
<P>
	Even now we can imagine that the Newfoundland proposal 
would require a joint management headed by regional 
authorities who would take into account the specifics of each 
area. Premier Clyde Wells, the gravedigger of the Meech Lake 
Accord, could find himself asking for more than what he thought 
then could not be given to Quebec.
<P>
	A secondary issue, which is nevertheless at the heart of the 
debate on social policies, concerns the accountability of the 
federal government for the amounts redistributed under their 
spending power. I take this occasion to mention that Premier 
Jean Lesage's negotiation for tax point repatriation in 1964 
ultimately led to the establishment of the famous national 
standards, which caused the aberrations mentioned earlier.
<P>
	In fact, if the federal government cannot redistribute the 
wealth without monitoring the application of national standards, 
it appears that Canada will be forced to choose between two 
equally serious evils, namely inefficiency which would be 
costly in economic, fiscal and social terms, or a basic inequality 
between regions and people in Canada. All the rest is simply 
talk.
<P>
	Let us take, for instance, what we call the full employment 
policy in Quebec, and which could be called a labour-market 
active policy, a policy supported and promoted by many groups 
in Quebec and by the Parti Quebecois. Such a policy could not be 
applied in Quebec within the Canadian framework because the 
inherent overlapping, duplication and the consequent incapacity 
to take the right decision at the right moment are an obstacle to 
the maximization of social and economic efforts focused on 
employment. Could the other provinces that accept 
centralization hope for a Canadian policy of full employment 
that would be efficient? Of course, that is our hope.
<P>
	It must be said that the prosperity enjoyed by Ontario and, at 
times, by Alberta, on which the Canadian redistribution system 
is based, is due only to the fact that all government policies 
converged to create this industrial complex and the many jobs 
associated with it that make Ontario by far the richest province, 
in spite of the tough recession it went through.
<P>
	For cultural and linguistic reasons, this Canadian strategy 
does not work in Quebec. These last few years, Quebec has 
based its development on the creation of many consultation 
mechanisms. Unions, businesses, regional organizations and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="117"> 117 </A></B>
<P>
governments have learned to consult with each other. These 
mechanisms, however,  have not yet yielded their full results, far 
from it, because they are deprived of the decision-making 
powers which are in Ottawa, whose policies even sometimes 
work at cross-purposes.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Remember the sad story of occupational training? Many 
people in Quebec are becoming sick and tired of waiting for 
projects to materialize, of the waste of time and effort caused by 
duplication, the incredibly slow decision-making process and 
this federal-provincial morass that stifles every initiative. 
Quebec has one project that must be implemented soon.
<P>
	As the Premier of Quebec said only yesterday, it is absolutely 
essential for the federal government to transfer quickly to 
Quebec responsibility for manpower development, including 
responsibility for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The Bloc intends to put up a strong defence of social 
programs, but bearing in mind that if there are no jobs at the end 
of the tunnel, all these people who want to stand on their own 
two feet at last will never be able to do so. We believe our social 
programs can be improved, but when the Department of Finance 
discusses social programs in terms of what can be cut and how to 
reduce the deficit, improvement is hardly the word.
<P>
	Let us get this straight: if we want to get rid of the disincentive 
aspect of certain programs without exposing people in need to 
greater insecurity, we are not saving money, but increasing 
costs, at least temporarily. When we want to help people get 
training and create their own jobs and become employable, we 
have to invest the required money. If we want them to be 
productive during the time they are unemployed, we have to 
invest in counselling and training and financial support. And 
above all, if we want to boost employment, our regulatory 
framework and our monetary, economic and trade and 
regulatory policies should be such that they do not undermine 
the process.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will also 
have to take a clear stand. Either the reforms he has in mind are 
aimed at reducing costs, as the Department of Finance says quite 
firmly in its document, or he really wants to help the 
unemployed find jobs, and in that case, he will not be able to 
save money on social programs.
<P>
	There is a dramatic gap, emphasized by a harsh recession, 
between those who want to cut social programs and, being rich, 
have never experienced insecurity or lacked money, and those 
who want to improve the effectiveness of these programs and 
who may, at any time, be obliged to use them for a certain period 
of time. The first group only thinks about the deficit. The second 
group considers the need to survive in a country going through 
tremendous economic changes, where there are no guarantees 
that the loss of many lucrative jobs would be compensated by 
promises of fantastic jobs in various technology sectors.
<P>
	Canada must decide whether it wants to be like countries in 
Western Europe or like the United States, where wealthy 
neighbourhoods are surrounded by high walls and protected by 
armed guards, or like European countries where capitalism has 
realized it is in its interests to have an effective security net.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you can tell the Minister of Human Resources 
and Development that he can count on my unqualified support 
whenever he wants to help people in need, but I will make every 
effort to be as fierce a parliamentarian as he was in the 
Opposition, whenever he deviates from this path. The people of 
the riding of Mercier, Quebecers and Canadians can count on my 
support in this respect.
<P>
	Our party will vote against the sub-amendment moved by the 
hon. member for Calgary South West, because we cannot accept 
conditional limits on government spending, and in any case 
these spending proposals would first have to be submitted for 
scrutiny by a parliamentary committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member of the Bloc Quebec for her rather 
interesting speech. I was intrigued by a number of points she 
raised, in particular the question of the administration of 
different provincial programs as compared to federal programs. 
In point of fact, several of these programs come under joint 
federal-provincial jurisdiction. Manpower training programs 
are just one example. The hon. member said that everywhere in 
the world, people are talking about the need for free trade and 
worker mobility.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Would it not be important to have a national manpower 
training standard which would allow federal and provincial 
governments to work together, instead of at cross-purposes?
<P>
	As far as economic development is concerned, I would simply 
like to mention to my hon. colleague that study after study has 
shown that in every country of the world, economic 
development is truly a function of the education system. For 
instance, Japan's economic development is a function of its 
education system. The same holds true for Germany. As far as 
Canada is concerned, I say that in order to have strong, confident 
and sufficient economic development, we have to make 
education our number one priority.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my hon. colleague that under the 
Canadian Constitution, education is the responsibility of the 
provinces. There is nothing to stop any province or territory in 
Canada from making education its top priority and from initiat-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="118"> 118 </A></B>
<P>
ing a dialogue on this subject to ensure that its education system 
meet the needs of the private sector and of the public.
<P>
	I can assure my hon. colleague that if this kind of action is 
taken, one of the troublesome economic issues in the province of 
Quebec will be addressed. The same thing is true for all of the 
other provinces. Therefore, we must start by focusing our 
attention and our energies on the education system.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of manpower training, I would 
like to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Minister 
responsible. I believe this government will initiate an 
extraordinary, and even historic, dialogue on, among other 
things, training and unemployment insurance administration.
<P>
	I believe that all members of this House have an extraordinary 
opportunity to work together to draft an action plan for the next 
ten, twenty and even fifty years. Canada will continue to be not 
only the best country in the world, but also the strongest from an 
economic standpoint.
<P>
	Could my hon. colleague tell me how she sees the issue of 
worker mobility in relation to her proposal for administering 
unemployment insurance and manpower training?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I have to say that we 
have given a lot of thought to the questions you have raised. If 
Mr. Bouchard was able to speak so forcibly yesterday, it was 
because it seems to us that the economic situation is evolving in 
such a way-with culture being more and more closely 
associated with the major issues-that the solution we are 
proposing is increasingly called for.
<P>
	You said yourself about education that the OECD keeps 
saying that what is important now above all is education and that 
performance-oriented countries invest in education. That is 
right, education is under the jurisdiction of Quebec. The federal 
government however is the only level of government to have the 
spending power, even if it has been using it to put us all deeper 
and deeper into debt, to force provinces into arrangements.
<P>
	It is therefore obvious that the federal government will want 
to have its say in the area of education, while we, in Quebec, we 
will want them to interfere as little as possible because our very 
survival depends on it. In fact, we want to get away from 
survival and start to live. That is what we want. We have had it 
with survival. We have had it with overlapping responsibilities 
and the fights surrounding the issue. We cannot wait to get 
projects under way.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We are in a real mess right now. I am only expressing a wide- 
spread opinion. There are people literally fidgeting with 
impatience. We are frustrated because things are not moving. 
The SQDM is getting nowhere these days for lack of funds and 
agreements. The Deputy Minister assured me last week that all 
was well-read nothing is happening. Education is indeed a 
major issue. What do they do about it? They cut.
<P>
	Of course, the issue of mobility is important too. But you have 
to understand that what we want in Quebec is development. 
Francophones account for 2 per cent of the population in North 
America, most of them concentrated in one area. So, to be able 
to live as francophones, we need to develop the labour pool to its 
fullest. We have developed plenty of means, projects I would 
call them. What we need now to implement them are funds. It is 
not that funds are not available, but they are often earmarked for 
other things, and we want to be able to spend them as we see fit.
<P>
	I just want to say that this debate is useful to promote 
understanding between Canadian political parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will perhaps have an opportunity to participate in this 
debate in the coming weeks.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the member's speech, but I think 
that in it she ignored globalization. Her economic analysis is 
quite simplistic; of course, she blames poverty on our federal 
system without considering the economic changes throughout 
the world which Quebec and Canada as a whole cannot help but 
feel.
<P>
	I must say that I also find it rather funny to see how she as a 
federal member of Parliament wants to pass off responsibilities 
given to her by her constituents. Why not make 
recommendations to improve the unemployment insurance 
program instead? The minister is here and he would probably 
listen with interest to her suggestions or those of her colleagues. 
But no, her solution as a newly elected federal member is to 
transfer all responsibilities to the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Does she not recognize that the federal government has an 
important role to play in economic interdependence and 
mobility, as my colleague said a few minutes ago, and the 
distribution of wealth? Does she not recognize, as the Prime 
Minister said today, that giving Quebec full power to manage 
unemployment insurance would deprive Quebecers of important 
resources that could come from the total wealth of Canada?
<P>
	Those are some questions that come to mind, Mr. Speaker. I 
will have a chance to ask some more in the coming days.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I would say that on the contrary, globalization 
shows that we need to go ahead with this plan in Quebec. 
Wherever we look, the way to react to these new requirements is 
to decide locally, on the basis of the local advantages which we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="119"> 119 </A></B>
<P>
must put to good use. As History has shown, this globalization 
of the economy will be matched by regional specialization.
<P>
	We are not at all going against the current. I would say that on 
the contrary, look at what is happening now where they are 
organizing to compete. European countries are still sovereign. 
They have kept their sovereignty but are working together. As a 
sovereign power, we would be delighted to agree with you on 
standards that we would consider necessary.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say a word if I may about the management of 
the unemployment insurance program. Mr. Speaker, you know 
that there is a consensus in Quebec to get this jurisdiction, 
although not all of it in the present context. We know Quebec 
needs to go on developing its economy and make the necessary 
investments to that end. It is certainly going to do it.
<P>
	There is one point I would like to respond to. I will not 
abdicate my prerogatives and I will not back down one single 
inch in the defence of the rights of my fellow citizens in Quebec 
and of the Canadian citizens for whom I have accepted to be the 
official critic, but, in my maiden speech, it is important to 
explain to members of this House why things change the way 
they do in Quebec. Just pretending they do not change does not 
mean they do not.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, let the Minister of Human 
Resources Development know that we will keep a watchful eye 
on him and demand the reforms that are needed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, first my congratulations to you 
on your new and most honourable and difficult task. We 
welcome your presence in the chair today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Also, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Mercier. In her first speech in the House, I appreciated the 
strength of her convictions, but I am also prepared to co-operate 
with her in a spirit of collaboration in the process of reforming 
social security programs. I look forward to that, in fact.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recognize that this is not my first speech 
in the House nor my first throne speech. I still treat each 
opportunity with a certain frisson. There is an element of 
excitement.
<P>
	I want to begin by expressing my thanks to my family who are 
the great source of my ability to participate in public life. They 
are a source of great encouragement when I most need it.
<P>
	This is the International Year of the Family. I hope somewhere 
along the way the United Nations will reserve a special little 
spot in its declaration for the political family that provides a 
service that only those who are involved can fully understand 
and acknowledge.
<P>
	Once again I want to thank my electors from the city of 
Winnipeg who have supported me going into my third decade of 
public service. It is a great honour to represent them and to speak 
for them.
<P>
	As we have talked about in this House, many members are 
discovering for the first time that they have a telephone with 
which they can respond to constituents' wishes. For those of us 
who have been doing it for well over 20 years we recognize that 
that still is a fundamental task.
<P>
	I would also like to express a great deal of appreciation for the 
chance once again of being a member of a government under the 
present Prime Minister. I have gratitude for the opportunity that 
he has given me to serve in this post.
<P>
	I came into politics 22 years ago because I was disturbed by 
what I saw around me in my neighbourhood, the condition of the 
children and of the city itself, the poverty that existed.
<P>
	It is a great tribute to the way our democracy works that 
eventually one is given the responsibility and mandate for 
however short a time to fulfil those great hopes that one had 
many years ago to do something for the people one represents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In accepting the position of Minister of Human Resources 
Development, I accepted the mandate of helping all Canadians, 
Mr. Speaker, be they Atlantic fishermen, poor children in 
eastern Ontario, unemployed Ontarians, native people on the 
Prairies or school dropouts in British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	At that time, all Canadians, not only Quebecers and 
Westerners, stressed the need for a new social security system 
that would provide employment and hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I speak today not just for those who elected me, not just for the 
region of Canada which I welcome to represent, but I have the 
rare opportunity to speak for all Canadians. I ask every member 
of this House to remember that obligation which brought them 
here.
<P>
	I was interested in the comments of the hon. member for 
Mercier who spoke with great feeling about the problems she 
sees in her home city and her home province. I say to the hon. 
member that those problems are shared by Canadians from coast 
to coast. They are not unique to Quebec. They are not unique to 
any one region of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="120"> 120 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, in this time and in this place the problems of 
unemployment, the lack of security, the feeling of 
disillusionment, the lack of economic opportunity, are too 
common. If there is one thing that unifies this country it is that in 
the last 10 years Canadians have not been given much 
opportunity to feel they had a place in society. That is why we 
have an obligation in representing all Canadians to restore that 
sense of hope and opportunity that still exists.
<P>
	We talk about the issue of social security. It is interesting that 
one of the great changes which has taken place in this generation 
is how people do have a feeling that what used to be a firm base 
of their existence no longer is there-their jobs. For better or for 
worse that has been the touchstone of much of what has given 
people the sense of belonging, of having a sense of dignity.
<P>
	A survey I read recently showed that close to 50 per cent of 
Canadians no longer have that sense of security. They do not 
have it because, in a sense, the future no longer appears to them 
as one where choices can be made. It appears to them also that 
the rules of the game in Canada are no longer fair.
<P>
	My philosophy as a Liberal is that fairness is the principle and 
justice is at the centre of our society. Each one of us must be 
given the chance to shape our own life and those of our families 
in our own way as long as we allow other individuals in society 
the right to do the same. To make that happen we have to have 
rules that make sure there is equal opportunity, a sense of fair 
play and a sense of fairness for everybody.
<P>
	In the last 10 years that sense of fairness has been lost. Too 
often there are high paying, stable, good jobs for a minority of 
Canadians, and insecure, part-time, no jobs for a large portion 
of Canadians.
<P>
	We have had growing gaps in income. We have had a 
shrinking middle class. We have had over a million children 
facing the situation of poverty. I recall with sadness reading a 
column in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> which I thought was a very good 
piece of journalism. It spoke of 40 per cent of Canadian children 
who go to school today without proper nourishment or 
nurturing. There is a lot of love being lost in this world because 
there is nobody there to give it.
<P>
	When I hear people say to me that we must defend what exists, 
I ask them to talk to those children who do not have enough to 
eat, who do not get enough parental care. Talk to the young men 
and women of this country, a lost generation, who have done 
everything we have asked them to do. They have gone to school, 
got a good certificate, a good degree, and have come out into the 
working world and there is no work for them.
<P>
	I ask them to talk to the displaced workers in our fishery 
industries who have seen an entire industry disappear before 
them. They say: ``We do not want to simply collect a cheque 
every week. We want to put our shoes on every morning and go 
somewhere where we can  make a contribution to society, to our 
families and to our community, but we are not given the 
chance''. Simply collecting a UI cheque is not good enough. 
They must be given the hope that UI cheque will lead to decent, 
hard, serious work in this society. That is why we must make a 
change.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We hear a great deal of talk about fiscal deficits in Canada. 
There is a human deficit as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is a lack of resources to invest in Canadians. There is a 
lack of effective programs that are essential for training, for the 
unemployed and for welfare.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It would be a serious mistake to wipe the whole slate clean. I 
do not have a lot of patience for those in the three piece suits who 
say: ``Cut the social programs'' when they themselves are not 
prepared to make any sacrifices. It is not a matter of cutting 
social programs; it is a matter of going to the root causes of what 
is wrong in our society and redesigning the programs to meet 
those causes. That is what the effort of our government will be.
<P>
	I invite all members to participate. As our friends from the 
Reform Party say, forget for a moment the ideology or the 
platform that brought us here. What we are saying is that all of 
us, every single one of us, have a job to do in this Parliament to 
help reform the system for Canadians, to once again restore their 
sense of security, their sense of fairness and their sense of hope. 
We understand as a government that we have a special 
responsibility because that was the mandate we were given.
<P>
	The red book struck a chord when we said that we want a 
country whose people live in hope, not fear. We want a country 
where all see themselves as contributors and participants, not 
liabilities and dependants. We want a country whose adults can 
find good jobs and whose children can realize their potential. 
When our Prime Minister speaks about the red book that is the 
core, that is the spirit. Everyone has a fair chance.
<P>
	I ask members to refrain from raising alarms of fear. We must 
go on a basis of trust and confidence. I ask members, in 
particular because there are many eyes upon this House these 
days, to treat this subject with the seriousness it deserves. I 
believe strongly that this is a time when there is a willingness to 
make serious changes.
<P>
	I spoke about the red book. We want to clearly signal our 
intentions to Canadians right at the start. We have proposed a 
youth service corps. The Secretary of State for Youth and 
Training has now completed a round of consultations with a 
variety of users. We will be making announcements within the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="121"> 121 </A></B>
<P>
next month about a series of projects based upon existing 
organizations that are prepared to collaborate and help-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-throughout the country-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-in every single part and region.
<P>
	Our red book also put forward a very clear proposal for a 
program of apprenticeship. We believe one of the real failures of 
our present system is that it does not address people during the 
most vulnerable periods: children before they go to school, 
young people when they leave school and go into the workplace. 
That is why the internship program, as I prefer to call it, is 
designed to make that possible.
<P>
	Again we have been meeting constantly with a wide variety of 
private sector groups throughout this country to see if we can 
bring them in as part of a broad-based program for young people 
to acquire on the job skills with the co-operation of the 
employers, government and the educational systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I said that to my colleagues on the other side of this House. 
That is why we must have a national program, because we are 
sharing the responsibility among all groups, regions and sectors 
in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	That is not a problem only for them, but for all Canadians, and 
we need the co-operation of all sectors, all regions, and 
everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I simply want to signal that in these efforts to target our young 
people particularly it is the beginning of a much broader 
approach. That is because we see that we must provide our 
young people with a virtual guarantee of work, training or 
education. The world of work has changed so dramatically and 
so radically that we can no longer expect that a formal education 
for the first 16 years is enough. We must become a learning 
society that enables young people and adults alike to constantly 
recycle their skills and recycle their aptitudes so they can meet 
the new world of work with competence and vigour.
<P>
	When we talk about reform of the social security net that is 
why it also must include serious discussions of training and 
education as supplied at the federal level. It must be linked with 
unemployment insurance and it must be linked up with social 
assistance plans. These are not separate programs. These are not 
stove pipes that spew smoke into the air. They are all linked 
together so that we can provide a total fabric of opportunity, of 
basic standards at which people exist.
<P>
	That is why one of the first principles of our reform is that it 
must be comprehensive. We cannot cherry pick any more. We 
cannot tinker away at one little program after another. That was 
the problem during the last 10 years. The government was 
constantly bringing in amendments and changes to 
unemployment insurance or the Canada Assistance Plan.
<P>
	Who knows this better than the leader of the opposition who 
was a member of the government that was always changing 
social programs when he was a member of that government. He 
would recognize now that it was a mistake to do it that way. We 
must do it in a broad comprehensive way.
<P>
	We must also do it in a way that is transparent and public. The 
time has come that we can no longer have private agendas. That 
is why it is the commitment of this government to ensure that in 
the reform of our social security system, our programs on 
training and employment, social assistance and the 
unemployment insurance and student aid, the place for decision 
and discussion will be here in Parliament.
<P>
	This will be the place where the decisions and dialogue take 
place. This will be the place where Canadians have the 
opportunity to express their views and be heard. I hear members 
opposite say that we must make Parliament important and that 
they have all kinds of mechanical solutions. The real way to 
make Parliament important is to discuss important things in 
Parliament and make sure that Canadians see that this is the 
place where the vital interests of their lives will be discussed, 
debated and decided. That is why the fundamental right of social 
security will be a primary issue of this House over the next year. 
You have our commitment on that.
<P>
	We also must make sure that the proposals, solutions and 
ideas that we have are Canadian-made. We have taken great 
pride in this country over the years. We have made real progress.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Contrary to the comments made by the hon. member for 
Mercier, we have made much progress for the elderly. We have 
increased old age security and the progress made in our country 
results from the efforts made by the federal government and the 
provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
That is a real accomplishment.
<P>
	We have also been able to say to our young people in large part 
that we provided good opportunities for education. We have 
provided a real fundamental security foundation during times of 
recession.
<P>
	Now the times have changed and we must change with them. 
We must change our programs. We must begin to look at 
Canadian-made solutions. One constant irritation I had sitting 
on the opposite side over the last nine or ten years was when 
ministers of the crown at that time would bring in solutions to 
economic problems that they had borrowed from somebody 
else. They were always using somebody else's model, somebody 
else's idea and somebody else's ideology. It is time once again 
that Canadians were responsible for designing a social security 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="122"> 122 </A></B>
<P>
system that gives them a sense of their own identity and their 
own importance.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I see your signal, Mr. Speaker, and I respect that, but I want to 
make this final case. I believe that if we do our work well, bring 
the different voices of Canada together to sing in a single chorus 
and if we give and restore a sense of hope to a lot of Canadians 
then nothing will be a stronger unifier. Nothing will bring us 
together more and nothing will give Canadians a greater sense of 
hope and opportunity than if their members of Parliament from 
all regions and everywhere in Canada are working together to 
build a system that will be distinctly Canadian. That will give 
Canadians a sense of who we are and what we can do and bring 
that special touch that we have brought to the world so often: 
compassion, understanding and humanity.
<P>
	That will say to all Canadians that this is why we are different. 
We are not different because we take different stands from other 
countries but because we are able to design for Canadians the 
way we want to live and give people once again, in this great 
tumult that we face around the world, a feeling that this is a 
place that belongs to them and that everybody has a fair chance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the minister. I heard the speech of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and, listening to 
him, you would think that everything is just fine in our country. 
Workers' productivity seems adequate as well as the 
competitive edge of our businesses; in fact, the need to 
fundamentally improve our competitiveness in light of the 
globalization of markets and, consequently, the productivity of 
Canadian workers, seems to have been overlooked by the 
minister.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that it is time to fundamentally 
change the Canadian approach regarding the training and 
development of human resources? Indeed, with two levels of 
government, the Canadian system is one of duplication and 
overlapping in the field of human resources, occupational 
training, business training and revenue security, which includes 
unemployment insurance where there are two employment 
offices and some 40 standards for 12 or 14 programs.
<P>
	I ask the minister if he would be prepared, given that action is 
required urgently regarding job creation and the development of 
the productivity of workers in Quebec as well as everywhere in 
Canada, to consider offering to each province that the federal 
level withdraw from every field dealing directly or indirectly 
with the implementation of a genuine labour-market policy by 
the provinces? In so doing, the federal government would 
satisfy Quebec's claim for a single window which would be 
managed by the Quebec government, offering at the same time a 
new opportunity to all Canadian provinces. Quebec would thus 
be satisfied but would also be in a position to respond to the 
emergency in unemployment  and could hope to develop its 
labour market, at least in the short term, until its sovereignty 
becomes a fait accompli through the democratic process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, when I spoke earlier, I did not say that everything was 
fine. Quite the contrary. I expressed my concern about poverty 
in Canada and about the lack of job training for young people. 
Perhaps the hon. member was otherwise occupied, but I did 
indeed stress in my speech that this was a serious problem for 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The solution to this problem, however, is not to divide, but to 
unite Canada and to work together to find a solution. Of course 
there should be good discussions with the provinces as they are 
after all our partners in this great process of reform. At the same 
time, the problem of duplication is a good point to consider 
within the broad framework of social reform. Training 
initiatives cannot be considered separately from unemployment 
insurance or social assistance measures.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister stated during question period, if funds 
for training were transferred right away, Quebec would lose 
considerably in terms of <I>per capita</I> allocations. I do not think 
Quebecers want to receive less support from the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	I would like to have a productive meeting with the new 
Quebec ministers of Labour and Manpower, just as I would like 
to have the same discussion with the other ministers. In fact, I 
am thinking about meeting with all of the ministers some time in 
February and this would be the time for discussions between the 
two levels of government. Then we would have a good idea of 
the duplication problems that exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the minister for his speech and congratulate him on 
his perennial re-election in his constituency of Winnipeg South 
Centre along with his appointment to cabinet in an important 
post which reflects a great deal of confidence in him on the part 
of his party and leader.
<P>
	We welcome the attempts that the government will be making 
to create a comprehensive social security system and to 
encourage open discussion of this in Parliament.
<P>
	Recently the Ministry of Finance released a document that 
showed our unemployment insurance program to be one of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="123"> 123 </A></B>
<P>
most generous in the world. This can create serious 
disincentives to upgrade skills, to work and to move to find 
work.
<P>
	I would like the minister to comment on whether he agrees 
with that assessment of the unemployment insurance system. 
Assuming he does, would he share with Parliament his view on 
what features a new comprehensive social security program 
would have to combat those problems in the unemployment 
insurance system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate very much the hon. member's good wishes. We will 
certainly be in need of those as time progresses.
<P>
	I look forward to the full co-operation of his caucus in this 
period of very substantial reform we wish to undertake.
<P>
	There is the question of unemployment insurance. Over the 
years the evolution of that program has gone from one that 
provided temporary assistance to workers who were in between 
jobs to one that has provided a great deal of income security. 
This is especially so in industries where there are a lot of 
seasonal variations and where we have had to deal with very 
serious disruptions.
<P>
	We are facing this now in the fishing industry. There have 
been times in his own province in the resource industry, in 
forestry and in the oil and gas industry where the unemployment 
insurance system has been an extraordinarily important base of 
support. It has also been a very important element in making the 
labour market work.
<P>
	If I may be allowed one small digression. One of the false 
divisions we have in our country is that there is a thing called 
social policy and a thing called economic policy. That is not so. 
Good social policy leads to good economic policy and vice 
versa. If there are workers who feel that they have some security 
and some ability to move and change jobs then that helps the 
labour market work.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I would say to the hon. member that there are some 
problems with unemployment insurance. There is no question 
that over time the program no longer meets many of the 
requirements. One of the things our Prime Minister has talked 
about and we feel strongly about is how to begin to make some 
transformations to have a system of employment insurance 
where the form of income security is designed to allow people to 
move back into the labour market, to create new work and to get 
new employment opportunities.
<P>
	However, that must be linked up with the social assistance 
programs and the training programs. One cannot divorce them. 
That is really why I ask members opposite once again to agree 
with us. If we are going to make these reforms we must do them 
together. There are linkages in all the programs. Stop thinking 
for a moment about unemployment insurance or the Canada 
assistance plan or student aid. Think for a moment about the 
problems I outlined of displaced workers, changes in industry, 
new demographics and the problems of young people. If we start 
identifying the real root causes of  those problems then we can 
begin to design the programs to meet them. That will be the 
intent of this Parliament.
<P>
	I can say to the hon. member that he should get his shoes on 
because he is going to be running fast very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
honour for me to participate in this debate on the speech from 
the throne.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
Speaker on his being elected as Speaker of the 35th Parliament. 
Indeed, I would like to pass on my congratulations to the Deputy 
Speaker. I want to assure the Speaker that we will endeavour to 
make your job easier and you can always count on us.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, with your permission since this is my maiden 
speech in this Chamber, I would like to dedicate my remarks 
today to the memory of my late father, Glen Johnston, who 
served from 1952 until 1967 in the Alberta legislature, in fact in 
the party that the Prime Minister this morning referred to as the 
grandfather of the Reform Party. In those years he served as the 
member of the legislature for Ponoka-Rimby.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to carry on the legacy of hard work and 
caring support of his constituents, many of whom I represent 
today. To those people of the federal constituency of Wetaskiwin 
I thank them for their overwhelming support and their vote of 
confidence in me. I would like to assure them that I am dedicated 
to serving them and their interests in this House.
<P>
	Let me say a little bit about the constituency of Wetaskiwin. It 
is located in central Alberta just north of the constituency of Red 
Deer and south of the Edmonton ridings. We are bounded on the 
north and northwest by the North Saskatchewan River and the 
terrain varies from heavily treed areas to the west to the 
prairie-like grain fields on the east. I am proud to say that we are 
a resource rich area. Agriculture, gas and oil are the engines that 
drive our economy. Our rich farmland is ideal for raising prime 
Alberta beef.
<P>
	The Ponoka Stampede is an annual event. It is the second 
largest stampede in the west. I would like to invite the Speaker 
of the House and all members to join us on the Canada Day 
weekend for an exceptional stampede and rodeo.
<P>
	Over the last year I have travelled extensively throughout the 
constituency speaking with many people and the message was 
loud and clear. People are concerned about the economic future 
of Canada and what kind of Canada their children and 
grandchildren are going to inherit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Two days ago His Excellency the Governor General delivered 
the government's plan for the next four years to anxiously 
waiting Canadians. The election results from across Canada 
indicated a desire to depart from the status quo and it would 
appear the government MPs received the same message. I would 
like to congratulate this government for embarking on a path of 
dialogue and consensus.
<P>
	We commend the initiative to cut $5 million from the House 
of Commons budget. I am pleased that the government acted on 
a few of the suggestions contained in the Reform Party's paper 
on pensions and perks. We encourage the Minister of Finance to 
incorporate our other recommendations in his budget.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian public have lost faith in their politicians. It is 
time for the elected people to win back that trust. Being elected 
does not mean that we are automatically respected. We have to 
earn back that trust.
<P>
	Canadians have the right to expect their representatives to act 
with dignity and decorum of office. An end to double dipping 
and a limit of age 55 before MPs can collect their pensions 
would be steps in the right direction.
<P>
	The whole issue of MPs' pensions, however, must be 
addressed. The voters told us that they would no longer settle for 
a plan that gives members of Parliament substantially more than 
average Canadians. The Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act must be overhauled, not just tinkered with. It 
must be brought into line with the private sector.
<P>
	The MPs' pension plan is not self-supporting. How can we in 
good conscience ask the overburdened Canadian taxpayer to pay 
for this generous retirement plan? I cannot, Mr. Speaker, and I 
am sure you feel the same way.
<P>
	Canadians are looking to this government to restore their hope 
and to restore their jobs. The widely acclaimed $6 billion 
infrastructure program must be recognized for what it really is, a 
joint project equally funded by the federal government, the 
provinces and the municipalities. This short term project will 
cost the taxpayer threefold. There may be three levels of 
government participating in this scheme but there is still only 
one taxpayer.
<P>
	The talk of creating jobs and restoring confidence are only 
small steps in encouraging economic growth. We can no longer 
tell small business people that they can be the impetus to get the 
economy moving while they remain overburdened with heavy 
taxes.
<P>
	The government plans to replace the goods and services tax, 
but what with? The GST, the most despised tax in Canadian 
history, does provide almost $15 billion in net revenue. This is 
an issue that the Reform members on the finance committee are 
looking forward to tackling. Earlier today my colleague from 
Calgary Centre  suggested that this caucus supports and 
proposes to replace the goods and services tax with a flat tax 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> A single tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Sounds good to me.
<P>
	My concept of Canada is a Canada economically strong and 
self-reliant. If we are ever to achieve self-reliance we must 
eliminate the federal deficit. This year alone the deficit could 
reach $46 billion. The national debt has topped the $500 billion 
mark and it increases by $85,600 a minute. The time has come to 
take serious steps to control spending. Federal departments are 
still spending on frivolous, unnecessary schemes.
<P>
	Here is an example. Just the other day there was a news report 
stating that federal government departments had commissioned 
videos that had cost the taxpayers of Canada $18 million. 
Couple this and other examples of irresponsible spending 
highlighted in the Auditor General's report and one comes up 
with a soap opera that stumps the average Canadian. This has to 
stop.
<P>
	The government must put a halt to this type of luxury 
spending. The Canadian taxpayer cannot afford it, Mr. Speaker, 
and your constituents and mine deserve better.
<P>
	I want to ask this government how it plans to control 
departmental spending. The new initiatives announced in the 
throne speech are commendable and worthwhile, but can we 
afford them? Who is going to pay for them? Will we have to 
borrow more money and increase the debt load in order to pay 
for these programs?
<P>
	All parties in this House acknowledge that we must reduce the 
deficit but we differ in the method. In my view, we will never 
accomplish this task unless we face up to the reality that we 
simply cannot continue to live beyond our means. Canadians do 
not want to rely on the government for their retirement so it 
worries me when I hear that this government is considering the 
elimination of the capital gains tax exemptions. Does this also 
mean that the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption for farmers 
and small businesses will be axed?
<P>
	People who work for large corporations and governments 
often have access to a pension plan, but the farmer and the small 
business person does not. Most often, he or she counts on the 
sale of assets accumulated over a lifetime to finance retirement 
and maintain their financial independence.
<P>
	We must undertake a joint effort to deliver the best possible 
representation to the people of Canada. It is important to ensure 
that we are productive and co-operative in order not only to 
make this Parliament function better but also appear to function 
better, in a less offensive manner.

<P>
	The constituents of Wetaskiwin can expect availability, 
accountability and austerity from me. What I plan to deliver is 
the same kind of representation they may have received from my 
dad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Wetaskiwin on his introductory 
speech to the House.
<P>
	Because we are only an hour away from having to make a 
decision on his party's amendment to the speech from the throne 
I wonder if he would be so kind as to respond to some questions I 
have concerning the proposal to put a cap on expenditures.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that this House in the last Parliament 
passed such a law introduced by the then Minister of Finance, 
Don Mazankowski, member for Vegreville, we had the largest 
deficit overrun that has ever occurred in this country. I am 
wondering why he or his party think that a repeat of that 
absolutely useless kind of legal requirement from this House, 
that absolutely ineffective law and direction, is going to work 
this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Certainly there is no chance of it ever working 
unless we place a spending cap on the budget, live by it and plan 
to honour it.
<P>
	To ignore the problem certainly is not going to be the answer 
either so let us all recognize that this is a problem, but not a 
revenue problem. My party believes very strongly that we do not 
have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. That is 
the way you would run your business. That is the way I would 
run my business. If I find that the income does not balance the 
expenditures the first thing I have to do is look at my 
expenditure side of the ledger.
<P>

two and a half minutes. Does the hon. member wish to ask a 
question or make a comment?<B></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment. This being the first time I have the 
floor, I would like to congratulate you on your election.
<P>
	As for expenditures-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems that you are not interested in 
asking the member for Wetaskiwin a question, but rather that 
you would like to resume debate. Is that right?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay: </B>I have no question but rather a comment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Then I think that according to the 
understanding between the parties, the member for Fraser 
Valley West has the floor now.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Fine.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If there is no question, then, I will give 
the floor to the hon. member for Fraser Valley West.<B></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
take this opportunity to offer my sincere congratulations to you 
and to all members of the House of Commons on their election to 
this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to all the 
people in Langley, Aldergrove and Matsqui, British Columbia 
for expressing their confidence in me by sending me here to 
represent them.
<P>
	This is the time when the eyes of Canada are on the new 
government so I think it only fitting that I speak today about 
vision.
<P>
	Historians I am sure will look back on October 25, 1993 as a 
landmark in Canadian elections. Canadians as never before 
spoke out in a loud clear voice for the need to change. The old 
way of doing things is just not good enough any more.
<P>
	Some would diminish the importance of the result by 
labelling it merely a protest vote. What, I ask, is insignificant 
about a protest vote. The people of this country were protesting 
the way government conducts business and it is up to us to show 
there is a better way.
<P>
	We have for two decades witnessed federal governments 
living beyond their means and it is time to stop and hold all 
politicians accountable. But rather than look back in anger we 
prefer to look forward with hope.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The throne speech yesterday provided a glimpse of optimism, 
something rare in these uncertain economic times. We have 
heard talk of a new spirit of openness and co-operation between 
political parties, an idea I would like to applaud. However we 
heard the same message in the speech from the throne in 1984. It 
lasted about two weeks. Let us hope it lasts longer this time.
<P>
	What I wish to emphasize in the strongest possible terms is 
that if there is no true commitment to open the books of 
government to the intense scrutiny they need, then all of this talk 
of co-operation and a new way of running government will be 
just another echo bouncing down these historic halls.
<P>
	All MPs should be involved in the detailed, critical analysis of 
government spending. If the government makes good on the 
pledge to give more power to MPs in its committees this could 
be a positive change.
<P>
	I am also encouraged to see the government has adopted 
some, though not enough, of our recommendations with respect 
to perks for members of Parliament. However, since the 
government has already made its decision I am at a loss as to 
why a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="126"> 126 </A></B>
<P>
$200,000 study is currently underway to assess parliamentary 
compensation and perks.
<P>
	I am pleased to see the government's commitment to reform 
the MPs' pension plan. Ending double-dipping however does 
not go nearly far enough.
<P>
	Our party has made significant recommendations to reform 
the pension plan. We would be glad to share the results with the 
House, certainly at no charge.
<P>
	Other ideas, like the appointment of an ethics counsellor, 
sound good on the surface, though I cannot help but wonder at 
the necessity of adding yet another patronage position. If all 
MPs simply act as Canadians expect them to, with the integrity 
the throne speech referred to, there would be no need for a watch 
dog.
<P>
	True reform comes from the individual. We cannot legislate 
integrity. We also cannot hope to create real lasting jobs by 
throwing billions of dollars at a program called infrastructure. 
Infrastructure means roads, bridges and sewers. Yet one of the 
first examples of this spending has gone toward the construction 
of a civic centre. The government has admitted the 
announcement was politically motivated. Will this 
infrastructure program create good, long term jobs? We will see. 
Be assured we will be watching.
<P>
	We cannot solve joblessness in this country with more 
government spending. Anyone who thinks we can is living in a 
dream world, a dream world we can no longer afford.
<P>
	As I look around, as one of the more than 200 first-time 
parliamentarians, I cannot help but be awe-struck not only by 
the sense of history in these halls but by the responsibility that 
comes with this chair. I see all around me representatives with 
many different perspectives on the future of Canada. Though 
there may be distinct ways of looking at things, no matter how 
you alter your angle of sight one thing never changes, the bottom 
line still looks like the bottom line.
<P>
	If we continue on the path we are on we will no longer be 
discussing whether the glass is half empty or half full. It will 
simply be empty. All of the money this government spends will 
be accounted for and the members of Parliament must be 
accountable to their constituents.
<P>
	The Reform Party's constitution states: ``The duty of elected 
representatives to their constituents must supersede obligations 
to their political parties''. To ensure I make good on this pledge 
we have initiated advisory groups in Fraser Valley West made up 
of constituents from a variety of backgrounds and political 
persuasions. Although these groups are just in the formative 
stage, early indications are that I will be taken to task if I stray 
from the course they chose.
<P>
	If we are willing to give members of Parliament more power 
in the House of Commons let us take it a step further and get the 
Canadian people involved in the process.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The people I represent from British Columbia are no longer 
satisfied with the status quo. The federal government has 
consistently failed to live within its means and my constituents 
want a direct say in how their tax dollars are spent. These people 
want guarantees that budgets will be balanced, long term debt 
will be substantially reduced and expenditures will be necessary 
and legitimate. It is no longer good enough simply to spend 
money. We must know where it is coming from, where it is 
going, why it is going there and why we are not paying our bills 
first.
<P>
	Most social programs have merit but that is not enough. In our 
critical financial state merit is no longer the overriding 
criterion. Federal spending must be cut to the point where we 
can once again live within our means. By capping expenditures 
we will take that first step.
<P>
	The emphasis on controlling spending is not just for the sake 
of getting Canadian business going again. On the contrary, every 
young Canadian should get involved in these decisions. For the 
first time in our history young people are being told to accept a 
lower standard of living than that of their parents. This system is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	A high standard includes more than financial considerations. 
It includes our social programs that have come to set us apart as 
a caring nation. The only way we can preserve the things that 
make us proud to be Canadian is by ensuring that we can afford 
them today and will be able to afford them in the future.
<P>
	Canadian businesses have to live within their means. 
Canadian families have to live within their means. We must 
insist that the government live within its means as well. What is 
prudent for every family in Canada is also prudent for the 
Government of Canada. There simply is no choice.
<P>
	In closing I would like to mention an attitude I have observed 
lately with respect to how Canadians view themselves. Talking 
to people who have just returned from a trip abroad seems to be 
one of the few times we hear about what a fantastic country this 
is. Why is it that Canada looks like such a land of opportunity 
when viewed from afar but at home we seem to lose sight of the 
fact?
<P>
	The Liberals' red book is called <I>Creating Opportunity</I>. I hope 
the creation of opportunity includes a planned program of 
deficit and debt reduction as the number one priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating you on your new appointment. I would also like 
to congratulate the member for Fraser Valley West on his 
maiden speech.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="127"> 127 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to suggest something to the member with which we in 
the House will have to concern ourselves. The hon. member 
mentioned in his speech on a couple of occasions that the bottom 
line was the same bottom line. Having come from a business 
background I realize the bottom line in business is earnings per 
share. It is how much money we made and how much we have to 
invest or reinvest. However in this boardroom the bottom line is 
different. The bottom line for us as members of Parliament is 
people. It is a totally different bottom line.
<P>
	When we talk about the concerns of our constituents-and I 
have to concern myself with my constituents-we think of the 
number of people who are unemployed and the number of people 
who are on welfare. They are looking to us to try to create some 
confidence and try to stimulate the economy which has lacked 
confidence for the last four or five years.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The member talked about the convention centre in Quebec 
City being a forum for bringing business together, creating 
markets and opportunities for business exchange and exports. It 
will create not only short term construction jobs. It will create a 
convention environment where things can happen, where sales, 
marketing and everything else can take place that will put 
people back to work so that we can ultimately reduce the $30 
billion disbursement on unemployment insurance and welfare 
last year.
<P>
	Can he not see that as a possible way of reducing and meeting 
the objective?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Fraser Valley West 
has about a minute and a half.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you 
for leaving me enough time to answer the question. I appreciate 
that we only have ten minutes and that he has five.
<P>
	There is no question that people are a great resource. One has 
to wonder why people lack confidence today in our government 
and in our system. The overriding feature of losing confidence 
in my riding-and I am sure it is so in many other ridings-is the 
fact that the government continually overspends and lives far 
beyond its means.
<P>
	My speech addressed a major concern of the people I 
represent. Unless we get this under control there will be many 
more people out of work. Just creating and spending more 
money in government does not provide the impetus to get 
confidence back in the country.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his question. I would like to send 
him back a message that unless we get this funding under 
control, this debt, this deficit, the government will have a more 
serious problem with more people out of work, not less people 
out of work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on this my first opportunity to address the House let me 
congratulate you on your appointment and your colleagues on 
theirs as well.
<P>
	It is an honour to be here today in the House representing the 
great riding of Parry South-Muskoka and the thousands of 
people who call the communities in my riding home. I would 
also like to thank all those constituents for the trust they have 
shown in me by electing me their member of Parliament.
<P>
	My area includes the Muskoka Lakes, Georgian Bay, and is 
the gateway to Algonquin Park. It is where north meets south in 
Ontario and where people from all over come to enjoy nature at 
and life at their very best.
<P>
	It is also the riding which, until October 25 of this past year, 
was represented by the grand old man of the House, Stan 
Darling. Although we are from different parties I wish to thank 
Stan publicly and on behalf of the constituents of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka for his 21 years of service to the House and 50 
years of public life. Stan was the true constituency member, 
home every weekend attending every event and always willing 
to help a constituent no matter how small or how large the 
problem was.
<P>
	Those who sat in the House prior to 1993 know of Stan's 
tireless work on the acid rain treaty which will allow my 
generation and my children's generation the opportunity to 
continue to enjoy the beauty Parry Sound-Muskoka. Between 
Stan and his predecessor, Gordon Aiken, the Conservatives 
represented my riding since Bucko MacDonald, a former 
Toronto Maple Leaf and a good Liberal, who won it 40 years ago 
in 1953.
<P>
	If Bucko, who unfortunately passed away three years ago, was 
able to intervene from above to end the 40-year drought for the 
Liberal team in Parry Sound-Muskoka, he will use his 
influence to end the slightly shorter drought for his other team 
and 1994 will be the year that the Toronto Maple Leafs win the 
Stanley Cup.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I cannot let this moment pass without taking the opportunity 
to thank my wife, Danielle, and my children, Christopher, Peter 
and Lisa, for the support they have shown me during the past 
campaign and the personal sacrifices they are making to allow 
me to serve my constituents as a member of Parliament. In this 
vein it is appropriate to recognize the sacrifices being made by 
the families of all members of the House. I salute each of them.
<P>
	We are here today to debate the government's throne speech, 
to review and analyse the path my government intends to pursue 
during the first session of the 35th Parliament. Our program can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="128"> 128 </A></B>
<P>
be best summed up by one very simple phrase: a belief in the 
individual Canadian.
<P>
	Our government intends to invest in young people through an 
apprenticeship program and the Canadian Youth Services Corps.
<P>
	Our government intends to invest in small business people by 
providing them with the capital they need to grow and by lifting 
the burden of unnecessary regulations and unfair taxation.
<P>
	Our government intends to invest in the unemployed by 
giving them an opportunity to work today through the 
infrastructure program and by creating an environment that will 
ensure job creation for the long term.
<P>
	Our government intends to invest in the less fortunate in our 
society by reforming our social safety net so that it gives people 
a hand up instead of a hand out and provides for them the 
training necessary to become productive members of our 
society.
<P>
	The government intends to invest in women and young 
children by passing new legislation that will strengthen the ban 
on pornography and stop violence against women and children 
and by reforming the Young Offenders Act to establish a 
connection between inappropriate behaviour and inevitable 
consequences.
<P>
	More than just an investment in people, the Liberal 
government intends to pursue a balanced approach to 
government. We are not the slaves of any particular ideology. 
We are not wed to the doctrine of social control by the left or 
unfettered capitalism by the right.
<P>
	We do not seek to end this country by tearing from it the 
province of Quebec. We will not push that province and its 
people form this country through indifference or 
misunderstanding of the legitimate aspirations of the French 
Canadian culture. We intend as a government to pursue this 
balanced approach as we deal with the economic challenges 
facing Canada.
<P>
	We understand as does every business person in this country 
that any income statement has two sides: expenses and revenue. 
If we were to concentrate on simply cutting expenses without 
attempting to enhance revenue through job creation, we would 
surely fail in our attempt to balance the budget.
<P>
	We will cut costs and start to relieve the Canadian middle 
class of its enormous tax burden with a clear understanding the 
more taxpayers that exist and the more people who are working 
the less burden each one of us will have to bear.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased that our throne speech has promised 
to bring integrity back to government. We have committed 
ourselves to several measures that will see this happen. We will 
proceed quickly with rule changes that allow individual 
members of Parliament a greater role in the drafting of 
legislation.
<P>
	We will provide more power to House of Commons 
committees and actively and continuously debate important 
issues of the day in the House. We will appoint an ethics 
counsellor to control the lobbyists and others who seek to wield 
unjust and undue power.
<P>
	The program that my government has detailed is not only of 
national concern. It is of great importance in my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. I represent an area in which unemployment 
exceeds 15 per cent, and that does not account for the people 
working part time who would prefer full-time work or simply 
the people who have given up altogether.
<P>
	In some communities in my riding we face upwards of one in 
four people who want to work but who are unable to work. It was 
the demand to have this situation reversed, to put the people of 
Parry Sound-Muskoka back to work, that led my electors to 
choose a Liberal to represent them in the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	The backbone of the local economy of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka is tourism. One in every two existing jobs 
relates either directly or indirectly to that industry. Every 1 per 
cent increase in tourism translates into $1.9 million of direct 
economic benefit and 39 person years of employment. The 
thousands of people who travel every year to enjoy our lakes and 
waterways, to be dazzled by the fall colours, or to try the 
snowmobile trails in winter are the mainstay and economic 
lifeblood of my riding.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Our government pledge to put Canadians back to work and to 
reform our tax system will add new vigour to tourism. I am 
committed to work with all people within my riding to formulate 
appropriate initiatives which will concentrate on creating a four 
season tourism economy.
<P>
	We will work toward the development of an appropriate 
marketing strategy which not only will reach out to attract 
visitors from across Canada, but which will work within 
initiatives of the federal government to bring back to our area 
the American tourists and to reach out to new markets in Europe 
and the Far East. I will work hard to provide financial assistance 
to our tourist operators and to supplement our natural attractions 
with new tourism infrastructure.
<P>
	If tourism is the engine that drives our economy, it is the small 
business person who is the backbone of it. Over 90 per cent of all 
jobs in Parry Sound-Muskoka are provided by the small 
business sector. Men and women every day risk their family 
fortune, their financial security and in many cases all they have 
are the foundations upon which our economic renewal will be 
built.
<P>
	I have spent my professional career working with and helping 
the small business sector. I have seen the person who has played 
by the rules, worked hard every day, pushed themselves to the 
limit and has lost it all through no fault of their own. I have seen 
the pain and the devastation that record business bankruptcies 
have caused. Our government's policies and programs will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="129"> 129 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that this is no longer the case and that that terrible trend 
will be reversed.
<P>
	The small business sector of Canada needs and deserves our 
support. This government is committed to finding new ways to 
provide capital to our beleaguered business people. As a former 
banker I am doubly determined to work hard to find ways for 
government and the banking industry to work together and 
ensure that loans are available to small business people, to 
ensure that deserving Canadians are not denied credit solely 
because they operate in a rural area and are not denied credit 
because they work in an industry not looked upon favourably by 
the gnomes of Bay Street.
<P>
	I will work with my constituents and with my government to 
reduce the bureaucracy which surrounds and strangles the small 
business person. I do not want to see good job creation projects 
die on the altar of bureaucratic red tape.
<P>
	As part of a Liberal government I will work for the reform of 
our tax structure and work to stop the practice of using the small 
business sector as little more than tax collectors. We need to 
collect revenue in a manner which does not discourage 
consumption and drive to the United States the tourism dollars 
which are desperately needed in Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	As important as tourism is to my area, as important as the 
retail trade which supports it is, and as important as the private 
service sector which maintains it is, we need more. We will 
always depend on tourism as our major industry. However we 
must work in Parry Sound-Muskoka for an economically 
balanced economy.
<P>
	I have worked for many years actively pursuing economic 
development both as a business representative in my role with 
the chamber of commerce and as a member and active 
participant in the municipal economic development process.
<P>
	I have pledged to work with the small business sector and 
individuals to bring them together with government to build a 
diversified economic base. We will create a climate within 
which new small business will be created in this country and, 
most important for me, in Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	We will use our quality of life, our proximity to major 
markets, our superior transportation infrastructure and the 
innovativeness and hard-working nature of our people to attract 
new industry and new manufacturers on which economic 
renewal can be based.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has just 
pledged in this House to introduce and pursue innovative labour 
adjustment activities. We will work to create an environment 
within which those who have been excluded from the work force 
can learn new skills and be prepared to fill the jobs that 
economic development and diversification will create.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The residents of my riding and indeed the people of Canada 
find themselves at a crossroads. We have great challenges ahead 
of us which will demand our collective  energy, knowledge and 
determination if we are to overcome them.
<P>
	As Canadians we have a choice. On the one hand, we can take 
the easy road. We can believe that the problems we face are 
beyond our abilities to solve. We can look for simple solutions 
and feel disappointed when they do not work. We can ask for 
sacrifices from others and reject that we too must make 
sacrifices. We can blame our difficulties on the actions of others 
and accept no responsibility for what we may have done to 
contribute to our condition. On the other hand, we can take the 
other route, one which recognizes that we can do better, that we 
can have an effect on problems, that we are responsible for our 
actions and that sacrifices will come from each of us, not simply 
from some other group.
<P>
	Our government has clearly demonstrated by its speech from 
the throne that it chooses the second option. We will not shirk 
our responsibilities. We will provide leadership to Canadians. 
We will be innovative, learning from the past but not fearing the 
future. We will be generous and most of all, we will care about 
the individual Canadian first and foremost.
<P>
	Canada is a great country. Canadians are great people. We can 
and will do better than we have in the past. With the help of all 
Canadians and all of the members of this House, we will build a 
future of hope and prosperity for ourselves and for our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate the member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. It 
is indeed one of the most beautiful and picturesque areas of the 
country. I appreciate his comments, as do other members of the 
House I am sure, concerning the sacrifice that all of our families 
endure with our being here. It was very kind of him to mention 
that and make that consideration.
<P>
	As a small businessman it was interesting to hear the extent of 
his concern with small business. From his background as a 
banker he would certainly have an interesting perspective, one 
that would be quite different to many people who were actual 
doers. It is similar to the person who knows how to drive but 
cannot get a driver's licence.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member from Parry Sound is the 
following. In the Liberal red book there is a statement to the 
effect that the Liberal government would adjust personal 
guarantees to 25 per cent. I believe it reads that it would 
guarantee the first 25 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="130"> 130 </A></B>
<P>
	Has the member considered, particularly with his experience 
as a banker, if the government were to assume the guarantee on 
the first 25 per cent, what impact would that have on the 
operation of that business? Would it not be advisable, if the 
government were going to guarantee anything, which of course 
is debatable, to guarantee the last 25 per cent and not the first 25 
per cent? If it is my money and my constituents' money that is 
being used as a guarantee I would like to have the small 
businessman laying awake at nights trying to figure out how to 
pay back that money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Small Businesses Loans Act 
which is presently in force does mandate that the banks are only 
going to take a 20 per cent guarantee. However, it does not work 
quite in the way the member has pointed out.
<P>
	If there should be a default on the loan, the way the act works 
is that the bank will attempt to collect all security in advance of 
the government guarantee. In other words, all security must be 
exhausted before the government will honour its portion of the 
guarantee. Therefore, in reality the government comes to the 
table last and the small businessman loses first.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the first 
time that I address this House. I am new, but I too will learn 
during my mandate, my four years. I wish to congratulate you on 
your new position.
<P>
	My question for the member is what exactly will you do to 
restore permanent jobs and not part-time jobs such as those that 
come from your program and to restore the confidence of 
Quebecers and Canadians? Look at aid for small business. They 
need money, and funds are being cut, so I would like to have an 
answer, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important when looking at 
the government's job creation program that we remember there 
are two components to it. I always hear from members opposite 
in this House the complaint that it is an infrastructure program, 
it is short term and that it will be gone in a year or in two years, 
but that is not the reality of it.
<P>
	When one invests in infrastructure one creates an 
environment where long term jobs can be created. In my riding 
if we put infrastructure into an industrial park and we put sewers 
there and we bring water to that park and as a result of that we 
are able to attract new industry to my riding then the 
infrastructure program has not just created short term jobs 
during the construction but it has created long term jobs as new 
business is able to move in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to take this opportunity, both as a friend and as a colleague, 
to congratulate you on your election as the Deputy Speaker. As 
you know, we go back many years.  My wife and I had the 
privilege of working on your first campaign when we were both 
members of another party, but that is another story.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka for his first speech in the House. I had the 
privilege of doing that this morning.
<P>
	As I said this morning, the Liberal red book was rather long on 
rhetoric and rather short on specifics. While we have heard him 
speak about the needs of his particular riding, the needs of this 
country are even greater.
<P>
	That is why I think that in the throne speech the question to the 
honourable member is this: What is he, as a member of the 
government, and his government going to do to ensure that not 
only his riding but this whole country comes to terms with job 
creation from coast to coast? We all know that the $6 billion 
infrastructures will not do the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning the last question, as I 
mentioned, it is inappropriate to look at our job creation 
program and just take one aspect of it, the infrastructure 
program. That is the stimulus, that is the start, but it contains 
many more things.
<P>
	If we are able to, and we will as a government, get more 
capital into the hands of small business people, we will in fact 
create long term jobs. When we reform the tax system in this 
country we will be creating long term jobs. When we are able to 
cut through the red tape that small businessmen and women have 
to face every day then we will be creating long term jobs. When 
we work with leading edge technological companies we will 
create long term jobs. The red book is filled from one end to the 
other with specific details on how we will create long term jobs.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are going to try to use up the clock 
till a quarter to six. The two of you will have roughly three 
minutes left. The member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested to hear the member's description of his riding. I think 
everyone in the House so far has described their riding as the 
most beautiful riding in all of Canada. Maybe I will do that next 
week.
<P>
	Congratulations to the member on his maiden speech. I was 
also interested in his comments about 90 per cent of businesses 
being created by small business, which of course is not a 
government intervention but a small business initiative.
<P>
	I am also interested in his comments about the sacrifices that 
he is calling on all facets of the economy to make. I was just 
wondering what sacrifices exactly he is expecting from small 
businesses to finance this program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="131"> 131 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the small business person in my 
riding does in fact create 90 per cent of the new jobs. They had to 
make many sacrifices as they worked to create those jobs. Each 
one of us in this House, each Canadian in this country, each 
constituents' group, each special interest group is going to have 
to come together. They are going to have to realize that if we are 
going to be successful in reinvigorating the Canadian economy, 
if we are going to create jobs in this country, if we are going to 
fix the major problems that we face in this country, we are going 
to have to do it together.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Each one of us, as each issue comes up in this House, and each 
person out there in the country, as each issue comes out, is going 
to ask themselves not just what will it do to hurt them but ask 
themselves: ``What can I do to help the country deal with these 
problems''. When we can have that kind of attitude in this House 
and in the country, we will be successful with the economic 
renewal that we need. We will be successful in creating new jobs 
and Canadians will go back to the prosperity that they rightfully 
deserve.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.45 p.m., it is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 55 to interrupt the proceedings and 
put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment 
to the amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung.</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know we are 
going to vote now on a motion to put a cap on government 
spending. I recall that on June 18, 1992 we gave royal assent to 
Bill C-56 which placed a cap on government spending to the 
tune of $107 billion for this upcoming year.
<P>
	My question is, having a statute that already limits 
government spending to $107 billion, why are we now-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I think the hon. member is making a 
very good point of debate but I am not sure it is a point of order. 
Of course I would invite the hon. member to include statements 
such as he was just making in his speech when he gets a chance.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment to the amendment.

<P>
	We are here to bid farewell to the Honourable Steven Eugene 
Paproski. A loving and loved husband to Betty. A proud and 
cherished father to Patrick, Peter, Anna, Alexandra and 
Elizabeth. Adored Grandfather to Steven, Colin, and Kathleen.
<P>
	Let me begin by paying tribute to Steve as a distinguished 
parliamentarian, whose devotion to that institution made him 
admired and, yes, loved on all sides of the House.
<P>
	For it was in the House of Commons that Steve and I became 
close friends, literally, as seat mates. At that time, he was the 
Chief Whip and I was involved in the House Leader's business. 
Our responsibilities meant that we were sitting together in the 
Commons from morning until night. We got to know each other 
very well.
<P>
	One of the stories he and I enjoyed was about the new Member 
of Parliament, thrilled to be elected, who took his seat in the 
House for the first time. He exclaimed, ``What an honour it is to 
be able to sit just two swords-lengths across the aisle from my 
political enemies and to deal with them face to face''. A veteran 
parliamentarian was quick to set him straight. ``Son'', he said, 
``those M.P.s sitting across from you aren't your enemies. They 
are your political adversaries. Your enemies are sitting all 
around you''.
<P>
	But while Steve used to enjoy that story, it was a story that did 
not apply to him. He was one of the few parliamentarians, one of 
the few people I know, devoid of enemies. His infectious 
enthusiasm, his innate kindness, the total lack of envy in his 
character, were all irresistible.
<P>
	Steve was what I like to think of as a true millionaire. He had a 
million dollar smile, a million dollar voice. Who here cannot 
picture in their mind's eye, and hear, Steve singing Hello Dolly? 
He also had a million friends and certainly performed a million 
good deeds.
<P>
	There are very few people who knew Steve who weren't the 
beneficiaries of his kindness and generosity. I know I have 
witnessed countless examples, towards his family, friends, and 
even total strangers.
<P>
	I remember a trip Gerda and I shared with Steve and Betty, to 
Bulgaria, during the dark days of communism. The giving on 
that trip began with the sharing of food with the hotel staff and 
kept on until Steve had given away his shirts and clothes, 
everything except the clothes he needed to travel home in.
<P>
	I do not have enough time to tell you of the countless personal 
examples of his generosity and kindness to me. What I 
especially remember is the coldest day of February 1989. I was 
lying in bed in St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon. In walked Steve, 
with two of his pals, Jim Hole and Justice Howard Irving. He had 
talked them into flying a small private plane from Edmonton in 
icy cold minus 40 degree freezing temperatures. Steve thought I 
might need cheering up. That's the kind of guy Steve was.
<P>
	And that's the kind of guy Steve has always been. He has 
always contributed, enormously, throughout his life. He was 
proud of his father and used to show visitors his father's 
shoemaker's shop on Jasper Avenue in Edmonton. Steve's dad 
died when he was sixteen. Steve helped enormously with the 
raising of his three younger brothers, and their schooling.
<P>
	Steve's famed football career took off when he won an athletic 
scholarship to the University of Arizona. Many Canadians 
remember the five years he played with the Edmonton Eskimos. 
What they might not know about is his wrestling career. Steve 
needed to augment his meagre university income but he couldn't 
jeopardize his amateur athletic status and his scholarship. 
Picture, if you will, Steve donning a mask to wrestle 
professionally, incognito or so he believed. His opponent was 
his pal Killer Gene Kiniski. One day Steve would win and, if you 
can believe the coincidence, the next day Gene Kiniski would 
win. Together, for tag team matches, they were the Masked 
Marvels. What a great start for a political career!
<P>
	Steve often measured, with pride, the distance he had 
travelled from his birth in Poland to his role as a member of 
Parliament, a Minister of the Crown and as Deputy Speaker of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	As a Member of Parliament, he was unswerving in his 
commitment to the concerns of his constituents. Not 
surprisingly, the people of his Edmonton riding were as 
unswerving in their support of him, a support that lasted a 
remarkable twenty-five years.
<P>
	In Cabinet he served all Canadians. His deep love of and pride 
in his country came from his appreciation of the opportunities it 
had held out to him, and to the family he and Betty created.
<P>
	And, of course, it was his family which sustained him. He 
adored Betty, his five children, and his grandchildren and gained 
energy from their shared love. As much as he was the bright light 
in Betty's life, she was the star in his.  Together, they were warm, 
generous, loving and giving people, and it was clear from the 
moment you saw them why they had chosen to spend their lives 
together.
<P>
	Gerda and I remember well a trip we shared with Steve and 
Betty to Mexico. That year Betty was celebrating her 50th 
birthday. That trip became Betty's birthday party, the whole ten 
days. Steve had arranged a birthday party, with gifts, every day 
of that trip for her.
<P>
	Many of you may know that Steve was a deeply religious man. 
He and Betty have been faithful church-goers and faithful 
believers. His faith was part of his life, and sometimes became 
part of mine. I am sure that Steve knew, on a first name basis, 
every bishop and cardinal in the church.
<P>
	I remember one occasion during an annual meeting of the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops in Ottawa. A hot, 
humid summer day sitting around Steve's pool, Lincoln 
Alexander, a Baptist, and me, a Greek Orthodox, seated between 
Emmett Cardinal Carter and Cardinal Flahiff, and in the 
company of about twenty other bishops in shirtsleeves, debating 
moral and political issues over martinis. Steve, of course, was at 
the bar-b-que broiling up steaks.
<P>

<P>
	If connections in the Church have any influence on where 
Steve is right now, there's no question he's right at the top.
<P>
	Steve died in the midst of life. We all assumed that he would 
have been with us for many years to come. But now, even as we 
mourn his passing, we give thanks for him, and for the happiness 
he brought into all our lives.
<P>
	To Betty, and to all of you: His children. His grandchildren. 
His brothers and in-laws. And to his many friends-among 
whom Gerda and I have always been proud to count ourselves-I 
speak from the heart, and on behalf of all Canadians, when I 
extend our deepest sympathies to you.
<P>
	May this holy season, with its message of renewed hope and 
love, prove a comfort to you in this time of loss.
<P>
