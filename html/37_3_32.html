	Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present to the House, in both official languages, the report of the Canadian delegation of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association regarding attendance at the conference on the global partnership against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and materials of mass destruction, held in France in November. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to express the hope that we can modify our rules to permit a late show debate when events of this kind take place abroad so as to give Canadians the benefit of the content of these discussions and debates.</p>

	I apologize, Mr. Speaker. The next report deals with the participation of the Canadian delegation at the meeting of the committee on economic affairs and development at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This event took place in London in January of this year. Also, at the same time there was attendance at the ordinary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which took place in Strasbourg, France, in the last week of January.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget plan of 2003 the finance minister increased the maximum pension accrual rate for firefighters from 2% to 2.33%.  Historically, police officers, corrections officers, air traffic controllers and commercial airline pilots have been provided the same consideration under the income tax regulations as firefighters.  My private member's bill seeks to provide equal benefit for all individuals who work in public safety occupations.  It would allow police officers, corrections officers, air traffic controllers and commercial airline pilots to receive the same pension benefits as firefighters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals who work in these important public safety professions endure long hours and stressful working conditions to give us the freedom to live our lives with minimal concern. It is because of this important contribution made by these workers that I believe they should be treated equally under the law.</p>

The House resumed from March 29, consideration of the motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-867207"></A><a HREF="#Int-867313"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-867202"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Edmonton—Strathcona.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a lot to talk about today with regard to the budget.  My definition would simply be that it is an apologetic budget.  The government has been  in charge for 10 years and  has yet to get it right.  As evidence of that, government program spending has gone from $100 billion when the government took office to $150 billion now, an increase of 50%.  That is not sustainable spending by anyone's definition, but it does not stop there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have examples of overspending and the budget was somewhat apologetic for all  those mistakes  the government made in the past.  It is not just mistakes.  Some of them are criminal in nature and charges in some cases will  be laid in terms of what happened to taxpayer dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of example I will give some interesting observations around this place in the last couple of weeks.  Obviously these are spending scandals   that we brought to the floor of the House as the official opposition.  One of the scandals is the disappearance of $160 million or so from the Department of National Defence.  How did $150 million to $160 million walk out the back door?  Nobody knows on that side of the House and they are not sure   what the figure is.  Is it $150 million or $160 million or is it more? However it shows   that the government is clearly out of control when it comes to spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unravelling of the government and its strong position in the polls that it had following the coronation of the present Prime Minister  seemed to   come  very quickly.  It all comes down to a question of trust.  Who do Canadians believe and trust in terms of some of the boondoggles perpetrated on the Canadian taxpayers?   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it is pretty clear in the eyes of the average Canadian that  they do not trust the Prime Minister in terms of some of the excuses that he is using for the mismanagement of Canadian taxpayer  money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could be wrong on this but,  in terms of understanding   who the new Prime Minister is and what he is all about, I think it started on the night of  the CBC townhall meeting that was broadcast across the country. The Prime Minister went into a little public meeting, took questions and responded to questions put to him by the audience. Some of his responses just were not believable.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one woman, I believe from Calgary, asked the Prime Minister a question concerning CSL, Canada Steamship Lines.  She wanted to know why he only pays 2% taxes when the average Canadian corporation pays somewhere in the vicinity, all things being equal,  of about 29% taxes. The Prime Minister responded by saying that he had always been a tax haven buster and  that he had eliminated tax havens.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, that  is probably true with the exception of his own company.  He, as finance minister, preserved the tax haven in the Barbados to protect his own interests. We will admit that he closed down some of them,  but  the one that gave his company the kind of break that any corporation would love to have, is still there and is still being enjoyed by his family if we  believe  he turned over the assets totally and irreparably to his sons.  However the fact  is that it is still the Prime Minister's   company.  It is a company that was built by the present Prime Minister and he has played unfairly by tax rules that he could have  changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he pretended that he was a tax haven buster, no one believed him because he could have done something but  chose not to do something.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member  next to me wanted information regarding the Prime Minister's company, CSL, the Prime Minister responded by  asking how much money his company, CSL, received from government contracts. The answer, which was in response to a question on the Order Paper,    was about $73,000 worth, which was clearly wrong.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  member for Edmonton Southwest, of course, persisted, which  is  one of the beauties of digging, persisting and not letting the government  off the hook. Finally, the Prime Minister and the government had to confess that   the figure was not $73,000 but  somewhere between $150 million to $160 million in contracts  to the Prime Minister's company. Coupled with the fact that  he was only paying 2% tax because of the offshore registry that  he enjoys, which  he should have shut down but did not, there is something fundamentally wrong with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member then asked the Prime Minister when he knew about  that  amount of money.   It being his company, the Prime Minister  would have known that his  company  did more than $73,000 worth of business with the Government of Canada.  How did he respond to that? His response was that he was   busy with the leadership race.  He was busy with the leadership race for 15 years. For   the 10 years that the Liberals have been in power he was   simply undermining his leader every single day so   I can understand why he was busy.  However no one believed his story.  No one who runs a corporation ignores $161 million in income.  It just does not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister was successful in his leadership bid, he stood in the House and said that he would run the Government of Canada like a business.  A few days ago our finance critic, the member for Medicine Hat, said that it was unfortunate that the Prime Minister did not tell us   that the business was Enron.  If people  ran their  business like that they  would be out of business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we in this House are trying to do is put those people out of business. The truth is that the Liberals have lost   trust. Their trust with the Canadian people has been broken.  They have stepped over the line.  They have had 10 years to get it right and the numbers  just do not add up.  They have gone on a spending spree, wasting taxpayer dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these, Mr. Speaker, which I know, since you  come from a rural area, drives you crazy but you are very limited in what you can say about it  because of your position in the House, is the gun registry.  We could have taken the $2 billion that has been wasted on that registry and put it in the budget.  The Prime Minister of Canada could have had his finance minister stand up and say that he was ending the program simply because it was not working.  All the Prime Minister of Canada had to say was that it was a failed policy and that    $2 billion in taxpayer money has been gobbled up only to find out that it has not worked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the Liberals will  hold on to that and   try to carry it  through the next election, despite the internal bickering and fighting  within the party, which is  another problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give a couple of examples of what $2 billion could do for my home province of New Brunswick. It could   pay for eight years of salary for 4,444 police officers. Given the annual income of New Brunswickers, 93,765 New Brunswickers could be paid for a year. Two billion dollars could buy  66,000 police cruisers.  Members can imagine how we could have had a real impact on crime  and the protection of average citizens.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am out of time, but  I will turn the floor over to my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona.   I have a feeling he will continue on these themes of spending, overspending and lack of direction by the government. It had a chance to get it right after 10 years, and it has not.   It is time we replaced the government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I must commend my hon. colleague for his most eloquent speech on the budget.  He highlighted very well the problems of the current government and its lack of attention to so many different areas in the budget.  He said it quite clearly that the government tried to pretend it was prudent, especially in the budget, and that it tried to pretend that it respected the tax dollars of Canadians.  However, we have seen over and over again a history and track record of abuse when it comes to taxpayer dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my hon. colleague give a perspective from some of the people in his riding?  How do they feel, given this budget and the government's half efforts in dealing with some of the real priorities like health care, education and even defence?  It has band-aided the problems, without coming up serious solutions.  What is the reaction of people in his riding on their disappointment with the government?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-867318"></A><a HREF="#Int-867361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-867313"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Greg Thompson: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, one of the obvious examples is the $2 billion gun registry.  We have had other scandalous spending such as  ad scam and the $100 million which was floated away.  There is the $160 million that disappeared out of the back door of DND, where every dollar counts and where our soldiers are using outdated equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have our Sea King helicopters. We could talk about those alone. Those helicopters are older than the pilots. For every 20 minutes a helicopter is in the air, it requires  36 hours to get them back up again.  This is one example of  outmoded equipment being used around the world by our brave men and women who are out there keeping peace in this very troubled world of ours.  As a government, we are obligated to give them the best equipment in the world.  What did the government do with $100 million that could have gone to some of their equipment? Even basic things like boots and uniforms would be a help.  It spent $100 million on corporate jets to fly the Prime Minister around.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is in Toronto this morning for a pre-election announcement.  What did he fly in?  Did he fly in  a Sea King helicopter?  No, he flew in a brand new jet, one that the government did not need.  Its own officials said that it did not need these, that it had enough.  He has logged about $500,000 worth of airtime on those jets since becoming Prime Minister, basically in a pre-campaign period.  It is just an example.  Our brave young men and women in the forces are using, driving and flying equipment that is truly not safe.  It is outmoded and outdated, yet the Prime Minister of Canada is flying around in a $100 million corporate jet, which its own officials said  that it did not need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is symptomatic of how the Government of Canada has browbeat officials in every  department where officials did not dare say out loud what was on their minds. They did not whistleblow to declare and bring forward some of the wrongdoings in government on the threat that they would be fired or replaced.  We saw a lot of that in the public service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to one bill that I introduced in this place three or four years ago. It was  a whistleblower bill that would have provided public servants in every government department and crown agency around the country protection so if they did see wrongdoing, they could come forward and  the government would have to do something about it or the public would  determine that it had to be fixed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the government attempted to do, and it did it very successfully, was to silence these people.  It could have brought in a whistleblower bill or it could have supported my bill.  However, it chose not to because it did not want the truth to be known.  It wanted to continue to run the government with a heavy hand.  We truly paid a heavy price for that heavy hand of government  to do exactly what it wanted in the last 10 years. It has finally caught up with the it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this election we will have a united Conservative Party on this side of the House.  Canadians will truly have a choice and they can determine whether it will be this group or that group that will be the government.  I am absolutely convinced that now we are a government in waiting.  We have the talent on this side of the House to replace that group, and believe me, after the next election, it will be replaced.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy taking part in debates in the House and sharing the thoughts and views of people in Edmonton--Strathcona.  I know a lot of people back home are very disappointed in the government, especially in light of the fact that we had opportunities with the current budget,  and I will address a few of these issues, given the fact that we had a larger surplus in the budget than we probably saw,  especially a larger surplus than the finance minister let on about  in the fall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a host of things that could have been done for the priorities of Canadians.  The government talked about debt relief.  More effort could have been made on that. We feel this is important and we are glad the government has finally followed the advice of our party on reducing the debt. However, there is absolutely no mention of tax relief, and I will come back to that.  We would have liked to have seen the government balance a few issues when it came to the priorities this time around, but it failed Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find one thing really ironic, and I want to take this from my colleague from New Brunswick.  He spoke specifically about the abuse  by the government of taxpayer dollars and how things had gone awry over there because of a lack of accountability and transparency and proper procedures for  oversight. It is incredible that in this day and age we have these sorts of problems  in a government that seems to be so out of touch with how it should operate the finances of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find most ironic in the budget is the way the government has tried to position itself in light of all these problems.  It has tried to position itself as a government that is prudent, that is respectful of taxpayer dollars and that now is trying to deal with the debt. It is really tough to take the government seriously when we evaluate its track record over the course of the last 10 to 11 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from New Brunswick mentioned some of the things we have seen. I remember the big problems. We saw the HRDC boondoggle with over $1 billion being wasted. As well we saw a surplus in EI.   The government could return some of the money to the workers and employers. We estimate that surplus is now over $43 billion, which the government refuses to recognize. It could have moved on that. Quite frankly, that is another theft from the taxpayers.  Finally, as my colleague mentioned, we have the gun registry, which is now approaching  $2 billion, and still there is no real value from any of these programs and  no real results for Canadians to see whether they are getting value for money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes down to the fact that the government has no respect for those programs or the deliverance of services to Canadians. That is why I find it so ironic.  In light of the Liberals trying to position themselves as being prudent, how can they even claim that, especially with their track record  under the leadership over there?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the straight numbers, the government claims this theme of trying to be prudent, but obviously it is far from it. Let us just look at the budget and the amount of growth in spending over the course of its term. Since the 1996-97 budget, budgets have gone up by over $41 billion, or over 40% in the last eight years, which is just an incredible growth of government. There is no prudence in that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget alone, I think the program spending jumps over 7% to close to $10 billion.  Over the next two years we will see program spending increase by over $13 billion. The government talked about prudence, but more could have been done instead of  increasing spending. In some  programs the government still has not tightened its belt, areas such as corporate welfare.  The government should not be in the business of dealing with handouts to these groups, but it continues to do so, and it has refused to tighten its budget in the areas where it could.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned areas where money could be given back. There is still a host of other areas where we could have seen reductions or at least a return of some of that money back to the stakeholders, Canadians, who deserve that money, who are hard-working and hate to see their money squandered by the government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A host of issues is important to people in Edmonton—Strathcona and important to Canadians.  I want to focus in on three issues which I know are very important, and  I hear about them on a regular basis in Edmonton—Strathcona.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is education.  We have a number of post-secondary institutions in Edmonton, and the University of Alberta is located in my riding. Obviously, health care is the top issue for many Canadians. Finally, I want to chat about  a missed opportunity, and that is the issue of tax relief.    We have seen absolutely nothing, especially in light of the surplus. The government could have done a lot more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, there are some good measures, and  we are not opposed to saying that. When the government does something that is on the right track, we will admit it.      While the government increases money available for students under the Canada student loan program, it does not address their debt. That is one of the biggest problems students face in this day and age.   Tuition costs are rising across the country.  Rather than continuing  to add to that debt, the government should be trying to reduce it. Raising the loan limits is a good thing so students can access money, but if it cannot counter that by ensuring they have either opportunities or some flexibility in the loan program once they graduate, they will be stuck paying a huge amount of interest. Many students are forced to default on their loans. That is not acceptable. The government could have done a lot more when it came to addressing the issue of flexibility, not just the issue of debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One solution we have put forward, one on which I am open to feedback and debate, is the idea of the income contingent loan program.  We would take the money in the current millennium scholarship fund, which unfortunately only helps about 6% of students. Obviously it has done some good for the students it has helped, but consider how many students are in need of money.   When a program that large is only helping 6%, that money could be taken and applied to interest relief  for more students. This would allow some flexibility in the student loan program, which would help a larger number of students. That is one proposal we have for education, one  that would speak specifically to that debt issue, which has not been addressed in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue we spoke about was the idea of how to co-ordinate. I know there is a difference of opinion in our party on this, and I have been encouraging the government to take some leadership on it. The government still does not have anyone in charge of education. Think about the differences in education and approaches to it across the country.  I will continue to debate this in our party, but we need to address it.  We need to have someone in charge to deal with the provinces in a proactive way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand there is the issue of differences of power and that education is a provincial responsibility.  However, there is no reason why we could not have someone co-ordinating efforts from the federal government, working with the provincial education ministers, to address issues on differential tuition and how to get some standardization across the country.  Students should be allowed to move from one side of the country to get an education, plus it would give them the  experience of living in a different part of the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are important and the federal government should demonstrate some leadership on this. Yet we have not seen any form of leadership when it comes to education. Because of that, funding, especially the transfers for  education, has suffered under the government. We have seen health and education budgets slashed over the last 10 years by the Liberals.  Even with the increases in each budget since then, we still are  not up to the levels of what is acceptable for many post-secondary institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of health, I know Canadians expected a lot more. Once again, when I talk about the issue of surplus, maybe I will tie in the issue of tax relief, because I know my time is limited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last budget the government allocated a one time spending shot of just over $5 billion. In this budget it hid that.  It did not take it out of the mix.  We had a surplus in the area of about $7 billion, and it obviously was not reported properly.   Imagine the increase we could have had in the area of spending for  health care? Even the provincial premiers have been saying that they are very disappointed there is no new money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen some effort on debt relief, but Canadians deserve to keep more of their money in their pockets. We have seen how that side of the House has treated treat taxpayer money.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust Canadians to keep their money and do better good with it than the government will ever do.  That is something I wish the government had addressed in the budget, but of course it failed Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I found the member's comments to be quite strange.  On the one hand he complained about increases in government expenditure, and on the other hand he called for increases in government expenditure.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member did not acknowledge the $100 billion in tax cuts, the largest tax cuts in the history of this country, which are still being implemented.  He did not acknowledge the $37 billion increase to health funding right across this country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dismissed out of hand the fact that education is constitutionally a provincial responsibility.The federal government's role in support of education has been quite significant through R and D support and scholarship and access support for students at the post-secondary level. One of the most significant things  the government has done has been  to provide some $13 billion in support for  post-secondary institutions through funding for their R and D programs and scholarship and loan support for students.  The member opposite simply dismissed that fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent some time in opposition. I would ask the member if he would at least give the facts to all Canadians rather than simply give another opposition speech which was negative and unfair and which was not factual in giving Canadians the real goods about the record of the government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am surprised  that the  member is so interested in facts having heard her comments from time to time.  I remember in the last election the things she said that were just outrageous when it came to facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the member's remarks about finding my comments strange.   Common sense is strange to members sitting on that side of the House, especially when we have talked so clearly about policy.  They do not seem to understand common sense so it does not surprise me that she found my comments strange.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the one issue she spoke about with regard to tax relief.  She does not seem to understand--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</b> $100 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte:</b>  It is not $100 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</b> Mr. Speaker, the numbers coming from members on that side of the House have always been skewed. The government said that the package it introduced was $100 billion, but in the end the amount was about less than half of that when we consider where the other increases came from.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen hidden increases when it comes to service fees and other things such as the fuel tax and  the air tax.  The government has tried to reduce them in this budget.  There should not be a security tax when we look at the way the government manages money.  We can look at the CPP increase.  The government has reduced EI by a marginal amount but when we consider the increases in CPP, they clearly offset any meaningful tax reduction that the government has attempted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to challenge the hon. member on her figures when it comes to the actual tax reduction the government has given Canadians.  It has been half of the number the Liberals   talked about. They are never honest with Canadians with regard to their numbers.  We would like to see some honesty and transparency in those numbers so Canadians could at least debate them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague on his speech.  I know the importance he places on education.  I am glad he is educating the member opposite about the difference between government expenditure and government waste because there is a big difference  which  the Liberals do not seem to understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget puts $20 million into Canada's universities and research hospitals for the indirect costs of research. We on the industry committee having been calling for this for  two years. The fact is that this is simply not enough.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a Canada research chair is put in place, money is taken out of the operational budget of the university.  The government is putting these things in place but it is not putting the necessary indirect costs in place and therefore is causing students to lose money overall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member think that  $20 million is enough to address that problem?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-867438"></A><a HREF="#Int-867445"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-867431"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the question of resources is always a significant issue for post-secondary education.  We are trying to stimulate research and development.  We have done some things right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consider the whole package of the tax structure that many people face, especially when we look at the R and D tax credits that are in place and  we look    at the atmosphere on the other side when it comes to taxes, there are still a lot of challenges to be faced. People are not taking advantage of the tax credits just on the R and D.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the investment that my hon. colleague mentioned, this is something  we have to address and something on which  we have to be more vigilant.   I was surprised that the hon. member opposite did not understand when I said that even though education is a provincial responsibility, there should be some leadership on  that side of the House. I guess that is something she is not familiar with.</p>

Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Minister of State (Children and Youth), Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to speak today in the House to express my support for the budget presented at the beginning of last week by the Minister of Finance.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is evidence of the Government of Canada's commitment to strengthen our nation's social foundation and to help  ensure that all our citizens can participate fully in our economy and society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget's investments will help our children get the best possible start in life and enhance young people's access to the post-secondary education they need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is also investing in ways to enhance the skills and learning opportunities for aboriginal people in our cities and in aboriginal communities throughout the country.  At the same time it provides funding to ensure that we protect the north's fragile environment and ecosystems in keeping with the strongly held values of northerners and aboriginal people whose ancestors have lived on these lands for  millennia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aboriginal human resources development strategy is one of the major pieces in the budget. The AHRDS, as it is known, is a key initiative on which we can build and further help aboriginal people to participate in the labour market. In partnership with the aboriginal organizations and others, this strategy has made a real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of aboriginal people since its startup in 1999.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy's  forerunners  were the regional bilateral agreements and pathways which were established initially by the Conservative Party and developed and made more inclusive and  built on by ourselves over the last 11 years. As a direct result of the strategy over its five year lifespan, 70,000 aboriginal people have found sustainable employment opportunities in the long established and new  emerging trades and professions in every sector of our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted that the budget confirms the five year funding for the AHRDS and restores $125 million over five years that was scheduled to sunset on March 31, 2004. With this $125 million restoration, the AHRDS will continue as a $1.6 billion program for the next five years to help aboriginal people develop their life skills and find and keep jobs with the help and support of a network of aboriginal organizations across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended 10 years.  We have met the first five years and we have now recommitted to another five years.  That will give us the full commitment  the royal commission was looking for.  We have actually met that goal.  It is one which  has been worked on and fought for very hard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the $125 million restoration, the AHRDS will continue, as I indicated, as a $1.6 billion program for the next five years to help aboriginal people develop their skills and find jobs and keep jobs with the help and support of aboriginal organizations across Canada. It will also give first nations and Inuit clients access to quality child care while they pursue training or employment opportunities. These 70,000 sustainable jobs will be in the emerging trades and professions  in every sector across society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the renewed strategy the government will also work to forge a more cohesive approach with the provinces and territories.  There will be an attempt to work closer.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal people have so much to contribute to Canada's economic and social well-being now and in the decades to come.  Aboriginal youth and working age adults are the fastest growing segment of Canada's labour force.  They represent a pool of extraordinary talent, energy and potential that can meet Canada's skill and labour shortages.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AHRDS plays a big part in making sure all this marvellous potential is actualized.  It builds on the whole aspect of how we integrate young people in the future.  In years to come there will be a huge outmigration of  baby boomers.  The young people will have to take their rightful places in those professions and trades.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably one of the only pan-aboriginal programs that includes all aboriginal people, including those in the  urban centres,  people who live on reserves, the Inuit, the Métis, the first nations, as well as native women and some great service providers such as the friendship centres.  There is a huge aboriginal component to this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that the government has committed, in addition to this one program, $85 million over five years to the new aboriginal skills and employment partnerships to enable aboriginal workers to access training and employment opportunities for areas that are steeped in resource development.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slightly different program because it is geared to resource development initiatives.  There are  some very important resource development projects happening.  If we look across Canada, there is a huge play on diamonds.  There is the  project in Fort-à-la-Corne,  Saskatchewan and  the Victor project in Attawapiskat, Ontario,  which I believe, Mr. Speaker, is in your riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  potential in the north.  We have two diamond mines.  We have some in  Nunavut and  De Beers is in its final stages of consideration on another one. These are all positive activities.  Much work and consultation is underway to ensure that all of Canada is set to benefit from this  program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, Canada's large  and growing young urban aboriginal population also has abundant talents and energy to help make our cities more vibrant and prosperous.  I am  very pleased that  budget 2004 is also providing $25 million over three years to double our investment in the urban aboriginal strategy to $50 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am speaking quickly because I have so much to say and so much information to give and it is all good. I know the opposition members will truly appreciate the work that has gone into this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working together through partnerships with  governments, local aboriginal organizations, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, we have a proven record of developing innovative solutions that address local aboriginal priorities.  The  aboriginal skills employment partnership, known as ASEP,    is one program that is going to heavily contribute to the betterment of life. It is   closing the life gap and the economic disparity that is out there and ridding those communities of that disparity.  It is going  to contribute greatly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will  now turn to the wise and far-seeing  measures that budget 2004 includes for Canada's north.  I am quite proud that the budget plan includes a number of pages that are dedicated specifically to the north.  The whole of page 187 of the budget plan  talks about supporting northern communities.  It talks about territorial financing of $150 million; health support for the territories of $60 million, and making it part of the A-base ongoing funding for all three territories; $90 million for northern economic development for all three territories; and $75 million over three years for northern oil and gas development. This will ensure that the Government of Canada and regional authorities can respond in a timely, responsible and effective manner to the tremendous opportunity of pipeline and oil and gas development in the north.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this is not going to be enough money.  There is a signal already that  more  will be needed to undertake that project.  It is a fairly major project and much work has already been contributed to that end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been $3.5 billion provided toward the cleanup of federal contaminated sites, over 60% of which is expected to occur in the north. This will  contribute to an improved environment and some economic development and employment opportunities. Of course, it is not predicated on that.  Those are the results of what has to be undertaken. They speak very specifically to some contaminated sites: the dew  line sites; uranium contamination on Great Bear Lake, which resulted from the discovery of uranium; and also the whole issue of 270,000 tonnes of arsenic peroxide that are buried under Yellowknife in 17 silos.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much more to discuss, such as  the new horizons project, the fact that the Northwest Territories has had a successive positive GDP growth rate for a number of years.  It also has the second highest employment growth rate.  Alberta is at 69% and the Northwest Territories is  at 68%.  It is a success story that needs the investment it is getting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much more to share with the rest of Canada about what is happening in the north, but that is all I have time for right now.  The economic development agreement is one that has been fought for long and hard. It is something we really believe we need to do.  The devolution and resource revenue sharing studies and work that are being undertaken by negotiators are  needed.  We need the money.  We are putting millions of dollars into the federal fiscal budget and we need some of that money back by having a resource revenue sharing mechanism.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I regret that I cannot speak louder today, but I hope I can be heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member spoke to  a number of different topics, but one twigged my interest.  She talked about the cleanup of the toxic sites. I do not think the Liberals will ever clean up the Sydney tar ponds because if they did, they would have nothing to put into their annual budgets. It has been there every year for the last five or six years.  Every time there is a budget, they put in money to clean up the Sydney tar ponds.  Yet, as far as I know, nothing has been done on that at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to comment on her concern as a member of the governing party that the government keeps promising but it never delivers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it must be understood that it is very easy to pollute. It is very easy to contaminate and to abandon. What is difficult is the cleanup of those contaminated sites. I share that view with the hon. member and so does any reasonable person, but the commitment that we have made to Sydney tar ponds is expansive. We have put in millions of dollars and we will continue to do that until the public can rest that we have decontaminated that site. I believe that we have made an enormous commitment in the throne speech and in the budget toward that end. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members from that community are very happy with that commitment. I think the community awaits the rest of the work to be undertaken. I agree that it is a major challenge but it is not the only one. As I indicated for the DEW line sites  and the arsenic contamination, there are not even the technology or acceptable standard practices of how to render arsenic trioxide that are accepted internationally. It is expensive, but we need to do the science and the research. There is no standard way of doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, uranium contamination is expansive and we recognize that, not just in my territory but also in Saskatchewan in Uranium City, whose very name is a telling sign of that whole situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that it is a challenge. We are working on it. We have made a tremendous commitment of $3.6 billion.  That is not considered small. It is a major commitment to that end.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have two questions for my hon. colleague. One relates to something that she and the member opposite said earlier about the $100 billion tax cut. People in my riding certainly have not felt a tax cut of this size. I wonder if she could just inform my constituents and Canadians of where she gets the $100 billion figure. What makes up that $100 billion figure which the government uses consistently?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to know how people in her riding feel about the firearms registry, particularly since, according to the estimates released this spring, it has surpassed $1 billion. It is going onward and upward and we do not know what it will cost to complete or to maintain this registry. How do the people in her riding feel about the fact this registry has gone above $1 billion with no end in sight?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would be telling an untruth if I said that those tax cuts were anything other than $100 billion, because that is what I understand them to be. I am not one to question the people who do the detailed work on those tax cuts, but I believe that for a number of years now this is the terminology we have been using.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days I have not heard a question in the House from the member on this particular issue. Not only that, it is a balancing act. We can do all tax cuts, but where do most of those tax cuts end up? With the people who do not need them. Where do we draw that money from? We draw it from social programs. We have to make a choice between tax cuts and medicare and health care. How do we balance that out? Where are we going to get the money from, from a money tree or manna that is going to fall from the sky? I do not think so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have to understand that  when we talk about tax cuts we have to talk about other things as well. Where are we going to get the revenue to support the needs that we have in health care? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about the registry, I am not afraid to talk about this. I have been through two elections with the gun registry. There were changes that needed to be made and we made them. It is true that there are issues with gun control and that is why the minister responsible for that particular review is coming to my riding this coming week when we have time off from the House. She is to meet with the northern leaders on this very issue. There are concerns about resources and we will be dealing with them. There is a review under way and the member knows that. It would be rather intellectually mischievous of him to ignore the fact that it is under way right now.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise and contribute to this debate on the budget.  The budget does have its critics.  When we have critics on the left saying we have not spent enough and critics on the right saying  we have spent too much, it indicates to me that we have hit the sweet spot.  We have hit the balance that Canadians have come to expect between fiscal prudence and responsibility in fiscal management and our commitment to people, our commitment to health care, education and to communities. I think that when it comes to this debate, the Canadian people are far beyond where the opposition parties are on this one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties believe that there is a magic wand that can come in and address all the fiscal challenges we face as a country.  I think the Canadian people know that it is a steady and committed progression we take, a commitment to debt retirement, to continue to pay down the debt that has been such a burden to the operation of the government, one that has been accrued over a number of years.  We have kept our eye on that ball and will continue to keep working toward that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak about a number of things. I will get to as many as I can.  First, my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona made some comments about coming up somewhat short on the learning agenda. I think there are some significant components to the budget that we have to celebrate.  I think the learning bond is one that is going to pay dividends to young learners for years to come.  The increase for low income families in the Canada education savings grant is significant, from 20% to 40%. As well, there are the new grants of up to  $3,000 for first year tuition for members of low income families.  I think that  is to be commended.  That is a significant commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also made a comment on the millennium grants.  I think that we here in the House have to respect the fact that aspects of education are the jurisdiction of the provinces. We did enter into  the millennium program with the provinces and some provinces were more successful than others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in my home province of Nova Scotia we did not get the traction that we wanted with the students in Nova Scotia because the provincial government deemed that its key responsibility was capital investment in its post-secondary institutions, so that is where the millennium moneys ended up going, and not into the hands of the students. We have addressed that problem with the province's education department and we think that going forward it will be best served.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, what  I want to identify is what was talked about in the House earlier today and that is this government's commitment to environmental remediation at contaminated sites.  The amount of money that has been invested in this last budget is significant.   It is $3.5 billion over 10 years to clean up contaminated sites.  That is the single largest parcel of money that has ever been identified for environmental investments in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak first hand to this because my constituency borders on the riding of Sydney—Victoria.  Every Canadian, I am sure, is aware of remediation of the Sydney tar ponds. My colleague from Elk Island posed the question of when we are going to get at the Sydney tar ponds.  It is a question that my colleague from Sydney—Victoria and I have worked on continuously since we arrived here in Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year it was identified in the budget.  This year it was identified in the throne speech and in the budget and that money is being peeled out.  Yes, there has to be an agreement struck with the province of Nova Scotia, the lead agency on the remediation, but we are working toward that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should know that I live in a constituency where  it is like having two Cape Bretons, one of which we know was just recently identified as the second most popular tourist destination in the world. Anyone who has driven along Highway 19 up the west coast of Cape Breton or toured the Cabot Trail or the Bras d'Or lakes knows the beauty of our island and our culture.  It is a great destination for tourists. The other Cape Breton is what we have to deal with as elected officials and as a community, that is, the remnants of centuries.  We have to deal with the remediation of what was left behind by our resource based industries, the coal and steel industries. The Sydney tar ponds problem is one of those remnants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been work done.  We have had successes.  I think we have a great grasp of the extent of the damage and the remediation  that has to be done.  This has been studied, and some say studied to death. Technologies have been identified that can do the job and clean the site.  We have them short-listed and are ready to select them now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the projects have been done. The capping of the landfill site has been completed.  We are seeing evidence of that now in some of the testing of the surface water and groundwater. It is making a difference and it is a significant difference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully understand this challenge. We are so pleased with the success we have achieved and the support we have received from our caucus colleagues, the members on the government side, in getting us over the goal line.   We know that  before we can grow economically and socially as a community the problem with the tar ponds has to be addressed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Nova Scotia is in the midst of its budget deliberations. It is ready to present a budget.  There is some jockeying going on with the final agreement, but let us be realistic.  The province operated the site for 30 years and was the regulator over the site for years beyond that, so it is time that the province buckled down and got the job done.  The money is there from the federal government. We recognize that the Province of Nova Scotia cannot do the heavy lifting by itself.  We are there for the province, but let us sit down and get it done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of other things I want to touch on that come right back to our community. We now are seeing the benefits within our community of some of the investments that have been made through the universities in knowledge and commercialization of knowledge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some great research going on right now at the University College of Cape Breton in conjunction with the National Research Council. The Government of Canada, through its  three federal granting councils, will invest $90 million this year. As well, $20 million per year will help cover indirect costs of university research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak to the presidents of the universities from Atlantic Canada, they come to us with the following. They say yes, they want to engage in the research.  They see the benefit of engaging in the research and they see the potential it holds for our economy, but they also see the costs of engaging in that research. We think this money is going to pay dividends and encourage those institutions to partner with private sector companies to allow that research to come forward through commercialization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the research being done at UCCB and with the National Research Council is in wireless communications. The specific project is the remote and wireless application of that communication on oil rigs and how switch boxes can be handled through wireless communication as opposed to a hard ground feed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are another couple of aspects of the budget that I think are worth noting.  One is the acceleration of the infrastructure program.  We have seen some great  green projects since the Government of Canada has invested in infrastructure:  the Glace Bay water treatment plant, the Port Hawkesbury and Port Hastings  water and sewer project, sewage treatment in St. Peter, and the water project at Arichat.  They are typical of the programs on which we have been able to partner with the province and the municipalities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that by accelerating this program the benefit will be to the municipal units.  It is an investment in economic development.  There are a lot of dollars changing hands.  We are very pleased with that aspect of the budget as well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the member has given this speech.  He has indicated that the Sydney tar ponds are close to where he lives, I presume.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him a very pointed question.  The fact is, the Sydney tar ponds have been mentioned specifically in a number of previous budgets.  Could he please tell the House and the Canadian people whether or not there has actually been any physical work done in cleaning it up?  In other words, have there been backhoes in there to clean it up and so on, and to what extent has that work progressed?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-867648"></A><a HREF="#Int-867667"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-867637"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rodger Cuzner: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Elk Island.   I think that is a fair question.  It is probably one that is on the minds of a number of people across the country because most Canadians recognize the significance of  the Sydney tar ponds.  It is a problem that is the result of over 100 years of steel making.  It is a complex problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been attempts to clean it up before and those attempts have been unsuccessful.  Recently, through the joint action group, there was a tremendous amount of community consultation and involvement.  One thing it has done is to identify the toxic brew and the potential technologies that can resolve it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming into the tar ponds, there are other factors that impact it as well.  There was a municipal landfill site, for example, that allowed water to go into the tar ponds.  We have capped that site.  It has been totally contained with backhoes and trucking.  That is sealed now.  We are monitoring the water at the outsource of the Muggah Creek. That water is being tested.  Even better, we can see the improvements in that water from the leaching in the landfill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structures have been removed from the coke oven sites.  The whole perimeter is fenced and contained.  Now we are moving to where the actual brew is, where the toxic material is, to see how we can best deal with it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, to my colleague, we are a funding player. We are at the table.  We have three government departments at the table, but we have to appreciate the fact that the provincial government is the lead on it.  That complicates things.  It is the lead and we are there in a supporting role, an advisory role and a funding role.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been work done on it and we are looking forward to a final decision as to how we go forward and complete that job.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a brief question. The hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton has good reason to boast about his region as one of the most beautiful sites for tourism in Nova Scotia, in Canada or even in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, since I am from the greater Quebec City region, I must say that this region is interesting as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are my questions. First, is there not, in effect, a problem regarding seasonal workers in his region, as there is in all tourism-based regions? Second,  would it not be expected that, in this budget, this government which has been accumulating money by the billion in its employment insurance fund would give seasonal workers  a status, as in the regional tourist industries in our areas? Finally, is he prepared to vote in favour, tomorrow, of the Bloc Quebecois motion calling for the  creation of the status of seasonal worker as part of the employment insurance system?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. I guess we have a tendency to not refer to the workers in those industries as seasonal workers. We see them as full time workers in seasonal industries, and our constituencies would probably share a considerable number of similarities in that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have those who work in tourism, in the fishery, and in forestry. We have agriculture on Cape Breton Island and for the most part these are very specific. If one is a deckhand on a crab boat, that is a very specific skill and it is needed each year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the government side we have appointed a panel that will go across the country and hold hearings. We hope to draw more information, speak with those involved, and put together a piece of legislation that will best address  seasonal industries and the workers involved in those seasonal industries.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell you that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Mercier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking to this budget, my first order of business is to express the disappointment of the entire population with the fact that the Prime Minister, who had set out commitments and created expectations in terms of health, has completely failed to deliver the goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that his government has been able to do is to slip the $2 billion promised by Mr. Chrétien over a year ago into the financial statements of the current year. The provinces are saying unanimously, in a well-justified advertising campaign, that the federal government only invests 16% of its expenditures in health. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amount declined dramatically throughout the Chrétien years, when the current Prime Minister was finance minister.  There was a drastic decrease from when he was finance minister to when he left that position to become Prime Minister.  Although everybody expected there would be more money for health in  2004-05, there will be less.  Consequently, people who expected that the current government would adopt an attitude of openness have seen their hopes dashed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the budget was tabled, the Prime Minister went so far as to say, because he paid close attention to the polls, that the budget was having a disastrous effect on public opinion with regard to health.  It is the number one concern of voters and our constituents. They expect a health care system to be adequately funded, and for the federal government to contribute its fair share.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the provinces, with some errors but also some success, are trying to do their best with the money they have.  However, there is a fundamental problem. The federal government is collecting loads of money, billions of dollars, and it is so rich that it squanders it shamelessly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we are told that the Canadian Forces are under-equipped, but $160 million gets wasted, just lost,  in a system somewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, with regard to health, the provinces say that the $2 billion invested last year should be made a recurring amount. Would not the best demonstration of the federal government's good faith have been to say that this money will be invested in 2004-05 and then there will be negotiations on the Prime Minister's current proposal, which is a new way of doing things while respecting the jurisdictions of each level of government?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, the government actually leaves this money out of the budget. A few days later, everyone realizes that this has had a devastating impact and there is an attempt at damage control; the government tries to fix things by saying that the money will be provided at a later date. The Liberal governments  have used the phrase, “we will do it later” to death. No one believes the Liberals any more when they say things like that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the example of seasonal work, of work in seasonal industries. I remember that, during the 1993 election campaign, there was a letter from Mr. Chrétien saying, “When we take office, we will give back to the employment insurance program what will ensure a reasonable value to that program, what will allow it to meet its objective of truly providing adequate income to workers who lose their jobs”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, a letter to that effect was signed by Mr. Chrétien. After the election, he undertook the harshest reform ever of the  employment insurance   program. In 1997, and again in 2000, the same promise was made. Six months later, the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development reviewed the whole issue of employment insurance reform. Seventeen recommendations were made. How many did the government implement: one, two, five? The answer is zero. It did not follow any of the recommendations. Throughout  all these years, the government continued to accumulate surpluses of $3, $4, $5 or $6 billion per year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is totally unacceptable. It is obvious that the current government, which is tired and washed up after years in office, cannot repeat the same old promises again, because no one believes them anymore.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see once again Liberal candidates meeting constituents and telling them that they will look after seasonal workers and settle the issue. No one believes them, because the Liberals have made promises in that respect in the past five election campaigns. No one believes one word of what is said on that side. What we have to do is to send the Liberals in opposition to give them time to reflect and hear concrete messages. There are several reasons why the Liberals should sit on the opposition benches. </p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there is the whole scandal,  the arrogance of managing public funds as if they belonged to the boss's company.   That is somewhat the approach used by the present PM, acting as if he were the chairman of some company rather than prime minister of a country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw that in the budget.  There are very concrete examples in support of that impression.  I have already spoken of employment insurance, seasonal workers and the whole softwood lumber issue.  There is no additional funding to help the regions through the crisis.  The money is carried over from previous years, but there is no new money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis could last another six months to a year.  People were rallied round, the companies asked to cope, and wait until the decisions were known, leading to an eventual return to free trade.  The workers were asked to do likewise, but without any support worth mentioning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this coming winter in my region, thanks to the great EI program we have, the forestry sector employees—those who manage to qualify at all—will have to manage for 10, 12 or 15 weeks with no income whatsoever.  Try to balance a budget with no income for 10, 12 or 15 weeks, or half of it in the form of employment insurance benefits, while at the same time having to meet the usual household expenses, such as mortgage payments, groceries and so on.   It is far from easy.  It is also very frustrating when we know that the government is accumulating a surplus of billions of dollars at the same time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for social housing, there is a very present reality, not only in major centres, but also in areas such as Montmagny or Rivière-du-Loup:  vacancy rates are very low, and low income people have trouble finding housing.  There is nothing new in this budget that would enable us to increase the amount of available housing to meet this need, or to make housing available for other categories of people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked, too,  to see something in the budget with regard to the guaranteed income supplement. We decided to adopt a clause retroactive over a number of years in order to correct the inequities in various sectors. However, for a number of years, the necessary funds were not provided so that seniors and the most vulnerable would have a decent income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people did not receive the guaranteed income supplement for 5, 6, 7 or 8 years. They had to cut back on essentials. When it was realized that these people should have been registered in the system, they were denied a reasonable period of retroactivity.  It would have been appropriate, in my opinion, for the budget to have included this kind of initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the whole issue of old age security pensions. Currently, the system is not fully indexed. A basket of purchases by seniors is used to assess the difference between their cost of living and that of society in general. When people spend more on drugs and have more difficulty getting around, some of their expenses are much higher than those of an ordinary family. So, full indexation of the cost of living for seniors is needed. This is not in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, many things have been overlooked. I would also like to mention an issue that is discussed widely at present. I am happy that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has decided to study the topic—unless an early election is called—of the challenges posed by China, the factory of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a proposal that this issue be considered, but I would have liked it if, in the budget, there had been measures to promote increased research, development and support in the most traditional industrial sectors. There are not enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are facing an enormous challenge from that quarter. All of Quebec's and Canada's manufacturing structure is shaken by this phenomenon. The answer is not to erect barriers around Canada but to give our industries the tools they need to ensure they can survive this new phase of the world markets. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially true because,  in the textile and apparel sector, Canada decided to remove tariff barriers ahead of the rest of the world. Thus, we placed ourselves in a position of weakness and we might have expected that significant changes would be proposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the people, particularly those in my riding and those in Quebec, do not see themselves reflected in this budget. We would like a formal commitment from this government that it will reinvest the $2 billion in health care before the budget vote. We would also like the Prime Minister to recognize that there is an important error in his budget. No one believes him when he promises that it will be fixed later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now is when the networks need money and when we are expecting the government to act. If not, the voters will punish the government severely in the coming election.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to tell us whether this budget includes all the measures he has suggested in the past. I know the Bloc Quebecois has tabled many bills in order to make the employment insurance system as fair as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current situation and the surplus in the employment insurance fund, does he not think it is high time to change the system once and for all so that seasonal workers get their fair share?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be smart to allow groups such as young people and women to be able to benefit from the system now? Often changes made by the government exclude quite a few people. While these people often have  contributed to the employment insurance fund, unfortunately, they are never able to receive their benefits.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-867792"></A><a HREF="#Int-867822"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-867786"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Crête: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a very pertinent question. The problem began when the federal government adopted legislation two years ago exempting the EI contribution rate from the usual rules. Normally, the rate is set based on market needs, unemployment forecasts and factors of that nature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was changed and the government could set the rate by order in council based on its financial needs. This was supposed to last for two years. Now the government has just renewed it for another two years. Basically, the government is not interested in being fair and applying the law as it was meant to be applied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  should be a readjustment in the EI fund surplus, the $45 billion that was accumulated for employment insurance and not returned to the workers and the unemployed. The government should commit to this. The Auditor General did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's problem today is that it has spent this money on so many other things. That is why it cannot follow up on our proposals such as having an independent fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the program were administered by those who finance it, and not a third party that contributes not one cent to it, it would be far better balanced. That was a proposal unanimously supported by the opposition and one the government ought to have followed up on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the students, my colleague has raised that issue.  Yesterday, a student came to my riding office to report that he had accumulated 907 hours of work, and thus was three hours short of eligibility.  As a result, he did not qualify.  There was no way around it.  He was looking for another job, because the first hours he had worked were disappearing from his file.  So, he helped to fund EI from his pay for 907 hours, but was not entitled to insurance.  If he were dealing with a car insurance company, he would have changed carriers right away, as he would have with any other kind of insurance also.  But in this case, he cannot.  This is a student, required to contribute—which is something new—but who cannot get any of that contribution back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of situation is unacceptable.  As for the benefit level of 55% of earnings, hon. members can be sure that seasonal workers are not left with much.  Even if both members of a couple work, they do not receive much to manage on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the present program, situations will arise in a number of regions where people will have no money coming in for 8, 10, 12 or 15 weeks because of the infamous spring gap, while the federal government continues, even this year, to rake in billions in surplus.  Even if contributions are slightly reduced, there will be over $1.5 billion in surplus, and people are still waiting for this situation to be remedied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have expected to see, in this budget, far more fairness and understanding of the situation workers and unemployed workers are going through.   That is what would have been expected from the government, and what is lacking from this budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why people in eastern Quebec are so angry.  They are out in the streets, and so they should be.  I think they have figured out that pressure will have to be brought to bear in the next election on the Liberal candidates, who are under public pressure everywhere because people are sick of being robbed. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to ask him if he thought there were any good measures in the budget. All that interests them is unemployment. Perhaps he would like all of Quebec to be unemployed, for purposes of a referendum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked a lot about the employment insurance fund. But  did he talk about the $31 billion drop in taxes, including $24 billion for middle-income families?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he talk about the lower premiums for workers and employers, which also account for a substantial amount: nearly $4 billion? A somewhat more global vision of the economy is needed.</p>

They do not earn enough money to be entitled to tax cuts. That is serious. They have contributed to the war on the deficit and they are now contributing to paying the debt, but they do not get one damn cent back from this government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be continuing the speech by my colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques because he is expressing anger that all members of the House will encounter wherever they go.  In all the years I have been a member of this House, I have never seen or heard the public so frustrated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget, which followed a throne speech that spoke of vision,  change and renewal, is disturbing and disappointing.  There are only crumbs for people whose needs are great.  In fact, this budget continues the typical budgetary policy of the Liberals, which is to use the surplus to pay down debt.  Their vision is eliminating the debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty, health problems, problems experienced by young people who want to continue their education, problems related to a lack of income due to job loss, the problems of families who want to have children and raise them are  not important. What matters is lowering the debt at a time when Canada is already boasting about having the lowest debt of all the G-7 countries, after recently beating Great Britain. This is truly shameful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress the point my colleague made at the end of his speech about the  employment insurance fund surplus. This $45 billion surplus comes from employment insurance contributions made over the years by low and middle income earners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, workers making over $42,000 or $43,000 do not pay contributions on earnings over and above that amount.  However, workers who earn more than $2,500 must contribute and often—almost always—they are unable to access the benefits they need when they lose their job.  They never see that money again.  Often, they are unable to use tax credits because they do not pay taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is truly scandalous.  Honestly, I think that few countries could have implemented such a policy, except those where people do not have direct contact with their government, as is the case in this federation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we will see what kind of budget the Quebec government will table.  One thing is certain, expectations about equalization were cruelly dashed.  There is a more than $1.4 billion difference between the calculated needs and the amount the federal government included in its so-called equalization reform. This is a needs-based calculation, not pure fantasy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget before us includes nothing, or almost nothing, for low-income families. I say almost, because of the  learning bonds, among others.</p>


	<A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1140)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government bragged about these learning bonds, but we can only imagine. We are told these will be available for children born after January 1, 2004. Over 18 years, they may receive up to $2,000. Is it reasonable to think that a provision like that is going to help the next generation study and that this will ease the plight of people with low to middle incomes? No.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sector that I share with my colleague from Trois-Rivières, I would like to give an example that illustrates the huge distance, the gulf, the ocean between what the Prime Minister says and what he does. I am talking about international assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister wanted to be an example of modernity and sensitivity to the poor—let us call them that, people from developing countries—by saying that he would increase international assistance considerably, advertising this everywhere he went. He even invited singer Bono to come celebrate. However, I believe Bono will be celebrating the fact that Paul Martin does not keep his promises. The only thing— </p>

	Mr. Speaker, thank you for the reminder.  You will understand that it is the result of my strong feelings on this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Prime Minister was delighted to count on Bono's presence, but now Bono will be keeping tabs on him.  The only thing in this budget about international assistance is about continuing the commitment of the previous Prime MInister, whom I can call by his name since he is no longer in this House.  Jean Chrétien committed to an 8% increase in international assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the budget for this is a mere 8% for 2004-05 illustrates that this government is nothing but a continuation of the last, not any kind of renewal or new hope.  Quite simply, the present government is devoid, not only of information, but also of sensitivity toward people's needs.   It is not enough to seem to be attentive to needs; there must be openness as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  this budget and the again predicted but unexpressed surplus, there is no way the government could not have made the effort to share the wealth with those in the greatest need. These are legion, not only in my region, but all over Quebec and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has made the expression “hidden surplus” a popular phrase.  We are not the only ones speaking out about them.  The Conference Board of Canada, a most non-sovereignist body and one with little Quebec connection, has estimated the 2003 to 2006 surplus at $24 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began with a reference to how angry people are.  Throughout this time allocated to speeches on the budget, one colleague after another has spoken about the causes of that anger, and I personally am anxious for an election so people can direct that anger.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the case today that the budget is like a crafted jewel. Unlike the comments of the hon. member--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b>  A crappy jewel?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b>  A crafted jewel. I would like  a few minutes to make this case. We are unlike the coalition of the antis over there.   I have listened to the  speeches and Canadians have to be--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> I am an uncle  not an auntie.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b> That is anti, the coalition of the antis; anti-everything. There is $150 billion worth of program spending here for nearly every sector of the economy. I have been listening to opposition members this morning and they are just anti.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to try to make the case why I think the budget is like a crafted jewel. I want to begin by referring to a book called <i>The  Ingenuity Gap</i> written by Thomas Homer-Dixon. This  book  was written a couple of years ago by  I believe   one of our finest minds in Canada.   He makes the case in his book, <i>The Ingenuity Gap</i>, that the system over the last 20 years of qualifying people to get into university, whether it be business school or law school, has been decided by the SAT exams primarily. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way those SAT exams are designed tends to marginalize people with creative thinking. They tend to favour people who have a high degree of logic in their thinking. As a result, over the last 20 years we have a lot of people who are in influential positions, whether it be in business or in government, who do not   have a lot of creativity. In fact, a lot of them even shun the creative process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, when creative thinking comes to leadership, because they do not feel comfortable with it they tend to put it aside. As a result, we have a lot of people in key positions, in government, in business, in running institutions, who tend to be anti-ingenuity. The reason  that is a problem today is that the world is moving so fast and decisions need to be taken so quickly and the coping mechanisms to react to decisions that need to be made quickly are just not there. We just do not cope. We  do not make good decisions, by and large.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason   I say the budget is like a crafted jewel is because it is a celebration and a recognition that men and women with ingenuity is where we will put the resources of the treasury of this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us  talk about the fiscal prudence that is in the budget, the fiscal prudence that  is celebrated around the world. We are now respected because of the fiscal management. This is just not a debatable point. By being managers over the last 10 years, taking a country that had incredible deficit challenges to a point where the treasury now, because that deficit has been eliminated, is saving Canadians $115 million a day  just in interest savings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do those low interest rates do? Nothing is more important to the one million men and women  who own and operate small businesses. They tend to be the source of creativity and ingenuity. Nothing is more important for a small business man or woman than to have access to cheap capital or low interest loans. Because of the fiscal responsibility that we have been on for the last little while and that we continue to be on with the new Minister of Finance, we are creating an environment where all that ingenuity, which is critical for job creation, which is critical for new products and  new services, can flourish.</p>


	<A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1150)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is fair-minded in their assessment and judgment will realize that, first and foremost, the biggest winners in this budget are the one million small business men and women across Canada.  Ingenuity is critical for these individuals. I am not knocking major, larger, multinational corporations, but most of them do not have an environment where ingenuity can flourish.  This budget states that small business is our cornerstone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and again making the case that this budget is a crafted jewel, I have to look at what it will do  for young families.  In the last little while, it has been an amazing experience for people to enter the housing market and get mortgage rates on a home at 3.5% or 4%.   This is a most amazing period in time.  There is nothing more important than having access to such low mortgage rates.  This is another area in building confidence, especially with younger families right across the country.  This is another factor in this budget equation that causes me to think that this budget is a crafted jewel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move into various sectors of the economy.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commitment in this budget to the automobile sector is almost unprecedented.  There are over 250,000 families in southern Ontario. The government's commitment and respect, and support for the auto sector affects the lives and stability of probably one million people. This budget deals with the automobile sector in a way that cannot be denied.  I have heard from several people in the automobile sector and they are absolutely delighted with the commitment that the Minister of Finance has made toward that sector.  I am blessed here today to have colleagues from Windsor, Brantford, and Thunder Bay,  whose influence was felt by the  Minister of Finance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low interest rates are a stimulus for the automobile sector.  When have we ever seen  the cost of automobiles so low? When have we ever seen interest payments so low?  Some manufacturers have told us that the margins they are making right now are the most disciplined they have ever been during their manufacturing lifetime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourism sector is now on a rebound because of the government's fiscal prudence and because of its stimulus and support to the industry in Canada.   The whole reawakening of the fact that tourism now represents 14% of the total jobs created in this country is another factor in this budget that causes me to believe it is like a crafted jewel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about some of those areas in the budget that deal with people who are in pain and in real need because ultimately they are the reason why we are all in the House of Commons.   We do not come to this House for any other reason than to speak for those who do not have a voice.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1155)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect the people who have lobbyists, that have a voice and do really well in society.  We do not punish achievers on this side of the House unlike my opponents in the NDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those members have this thought process that I have been trying for years to change.  We do not need to punish achievers.  We need all the achievers in the country that we can find because they generate jobs and  their risk taking is very important for stimulating the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Their taxes are very low.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b> The member from the New Democratic Party said that leaders in this country who achieve and who accomplish pay lower taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have no problem.  He has just made the very point that I want to make.  I believe we should reward our achievers.  I have never believed, as the NDP do, that we should punish people because they work hard and they achieve.  I just never bought that philosophy and I have been elected four times over NDPers who tried every election to knock me because I said I wanted to reward achievers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will go at it one more time with Mr. Layton, and I can use his name because he is not in the House. I have watched Jack Layton day in and day out, year after year.  He gets this big thrill in trying to punish achievers.  The country needs all the achievers that we can find.  I will never be caught talking about punishing achievers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make the point that the real essence of why we come to the House, and it is a great trust and honour to be here, is to speak for those people who do not have a voice and those people who are in real pain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget deals with people in pain from nearly every part of the community.  This is what drives me nuts about NDP members, that even though it is written here, and there is $150 billion worth of program spending, they just do not want to admit what goes on in terms of things that are done in the whole area of health. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an amazing thing the other day.  The acting leader of the NDP stood up and asked the minister, how come he did not do anything in the budget for health care?  The Minister of Finance stood up in response and said that, in fact, Mr. Romanow said very fine and positive things about the budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> Not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b> It is absolutely true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of early child care,  we will never forget the former minister of human resources development.  One of her great legacies in the House of Commons is something no one can ever take away from her and that is the work she did in terms of early child care over the years.  I salute her.    It has just been amazing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is again speaking for people who are in pain.  In the end, the real inner joy we get from serving in the House is being able to be a voice and do something for those who do not have a voice, and do not have the resources to speak for their cause, their child or destitute farm.  That is the real thrill and the budget passes all of those tests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind people again of how last Monday, through the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, there was a billion dollar announcement made in western Canada to help that sector. Again, this is speaking for people in pain.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have maintained, in the budget, the trajectory that the former minister for CIDA put us on.  It was a trajectory of ensuring that we do not just speak for those in pain in our country, but that we reach out to countries around the world that are in pain.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b> I believe in and my colleague has reminded me about affordable housing. This is another thing that drives me crazy about my future opponent, Jack Layton. He made the statement that the government has done nothing for affordable housing. In the GTA alone, we have averaged $273 million a year for the last 10 years. That to me is a lot of money.  That is separate and apart from the shelter money that we supply for the homeless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have an unlimited treasury here and I believe that there has to be  a balance. If we ask a young person or a small business man or woman today if they would rather have a business loan at 5% or a mortgage at 3.5%, but to do that would mean that we would not be able to satisfy every need, that we would have to use balance, I bet that 9 out of 10 Canadians are going to say that they like the fiscal direction and the financial plan that the government is on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I say that this budget is like a crafted jewel because it has put most of the opportunity into entrepreneurship across this country. Our job growth, our job capacity, our domestic and international opportunities, and our future communities rest with small business men and women. That is my case.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have question for the member for Toronto--Danforth. I was reading the budget yesterday en route here and noted that 45% of the federal government's revenue comes from personal income tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member for Toronto--Danforth would be able to provide us with the information--because it was not contained in the budget documents, it may be buried somewhere but I could not find it--as to what percentage of the federal budget is made up of corporate income taxes in this country? </p>

	Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater portion of moneys we receive in this country is through personal income taxes. We all know that and we are all constantly trying to refine that area of the personal income tax system; however, the member is referring to the fact that corporations are not paying   as much tax. I believe that is the point that the member is trying to make.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am absolutely dumbfounded at the NDP opposition, and I told this to Jack. I said, “Jack, you are right off track on this”, because tax deductions for the one million small business men and women in this country who create almost 85% of the jobs is a good thing. The top 150 corporations in this country pay very little tax. In fact, they are the ones that we should be reviewing in terms of their tax payable, but to make a blanket statement as Jack Layton has said repeatedly, that we should not be giving tax preferences to small business men and women, is the wrong tack to take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes to my point about rewarding achievers. The greatest achievers in this country are small business men and women, and to deny them a better tax system, which is what Jack Layton is always saying, I philosophically disagree.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I feel that  I have to come to the defence of my Liberal colleague, believe it or not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am shocked that some people in Canada have yet to understand that in order for people to earn personal income,   in many cases they work at those corporations. If the  corporations are taxed too heavily, they will not stay in this country. The investment that is necessary to start those  corporations can flow anywhere in the world. They can go to wherever they can get the best tax treatment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My NDP colleague tries to tar corporations as somehow being bad and therefore they should pay much higher taxes but in the end, that is  self-defeating. If we did that,  the corporations would leave and  tens of thousands of people would be without jobs. They would not have jobs and would not  pay personal income tax.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have tried repeatedly to educate my NDP opponent, Jack Layton, on the whole issue of taxes. On the notion of  punishing  achievers, whether they be  small businesses or even large businesses that are paying Canadians good solid union wages, if all of a sudden we become such a persecutor of those people that are paying good solid union wages, those people are going to  end up in countries where people get ridiculously low wages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Layton has to start cheerleading business. He has to start cheerleading those people that  are creating jobs in this country,  especially the small business men and women  and especially those corporations that  have good environmental standards and that  pay good solid union wages. The day that this country slips into punishing achievers, that is the day when our fiscal framework will  go right into the toilet.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, for the record because it was never read in, 46% of federal income tax now comes through personal income tax  and the amount from corporations is a meagre 12.5%. I am old enough to remember when there was a royal commission on taxation in this country and at that time it was approximately fifty-fifty between corporate and personal income tax. We can see what has happened in the interim. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> Those small business companies that pay those high union wages, yes of course they do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be aware that there are a lot of people working extremely hard in this country who are paying what they feel is too much tax. They   would like some of that tax burden to be shared with the corporations that are doing extremely well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first of all, I agree with the member that the personal income tax system is flawed and it needs reform.  I have been saying that for 15 years. I have talked about my concept of a single tax system until I am blue in the face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way to really get this country going, and the NDP are going to freak out when I say this. We have the GST in place. The member acknowledged it is only $12 billion that we get from all businesses. As well  there is the paper burden and  all the duplication. I would abolish the federal income tax rate. If we abolished the federal income tax rate for the millions of small business men and women,  imagine the paper burden that would vanish. Imagine the efficiencies that we could create. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the international investment that would flow into this country for small businessmen and women. It would be incredible. That would drive interest rates down because the more capital there is in a market to rent, the cheaper it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have an investment climate where we  celebrated men and women of ingenuity, men and women of creativity. I am going to repeat it until I am blue in the face. The one million small business men and women in this country drive our economy. They represent  85% of the jobs. The NDP has to stop talking about punishing the achievers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere on God's green earth have the New Democratic members or the party ever said that there should not be a fair taxation system.  Nowhere have we said that business should have to pay everything.  What we ask for is a fair taxation system.

	Mr. Speaker, we have just witnessed  a very interesting debate in which a Liberal member has actually suggested we eliminate personal income taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dennis Mills:</b>  No, corporate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte:</b> Federal corporate taxes.  I am glad he clarified that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to address the budget today. Mr. Speaker,   I should mention at the outset that I will be splitting my time with the erstwhile member for Portage—Lisgar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Conservative critic for industry, science and technology.  As such, I would like to review mainly the initiatives in this budget that affect industrial policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an industry critic, I have had the opportunity in the last two years to travel across this country and to see many of the industries we have in Canada, whether it is the auto industry, fisheries on the east coast, softwood lumber, the beef industry, the high tech industry across the country, initiatives like the nanotechnology institute at the University of Alberta or the synchrotron institute at the University of Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am amazed at the potential this country has and at some of the good things that we are doing. I have to say that what really saddens me is the fact that we need a national industrial policy that recognizes that potential, that unleashes that potential and grasps it.  We do not have this because what the federal Liberals continue to do is follow down a path of corporate welfare as their industrial policy.  Instead of focusing on genuine research and development through the granting councils, instead of focusing on lowering taxes or putting into place an overall industrial framework that encompasses a big science policy, they insist on following the path of corporate welfare.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that most Canadian companies  are innovative.   They put new products on the market or introduce new processes. The problem is that compared with other G-8 nations, we do not innovate at the same pace.  It is not our fault as Canadians, but   in my view, it is a sense of national policies put in place that have resulted in this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is our productivity has fallen in comparison to other OECD nations,  particularly in relation to that of the United States.  Canada has fallen from sixth place in the world competitiveness ranking in 1997 to ninth place in 2001 and now to 16th place in 2003. Canada in fact ranks 14th in per capita research spending of the top 15 industrialized nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Canadian businesses, productivity and innovation, I would characterize budget 2004, with all due respect to Clint Eastwood, as being comprised of the good, the bad and the ugly. To be fair, I will begin with the good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government financial support for university research and research training is predominantly made available through federal granting councils: NSERC, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; SSHRC, which covers social sciences and humanities; the Canadian Institutes of  Health Research; and the largest one, the National Research Council. These councils collectively provide peer reviewed funding for more than 18,000 researchers across the country in many disciplines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part,  these granting councils, particularly NRC, NSERC and CIHR, have had a good track record in science and research investments. We in the Conservative Party want to applaud their work.  Therefore, we support the $90 million increase in the budgets to these granting councils, including the CIHR, which falls under the health portfolio.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to remind the government in a very constructive way that these science and technology investments cannot stand alone in the effort to improve productivity and innovation in Canada.  We must ensure that these grants are transparent. They must be made in combination with a broader science and technology policy framework and they need to be made in combination with tax cuts in order to create and encourage innovation in the  commercialization of research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me address some of the bad in  budget  2004.  Frankly, I consider the venture capital section of the budget to be bad.  I would also like to raise some concerns I have over the government's new push to commercialize research in universities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pains me to call it bad, but the budget's intention of creating a venture capital fund of $270 million to enhance access to venture capital financing and to be administered by the Business Development Bank of Canada and the Farm Credit Corporation should raise red flags across the country. In my view, the government should not make the BDC the venture capital outlay that it is in this budget and we should in fact rely more on private sources.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party of Canada would like to see more venture capital in Canada.  According to Canada's Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association, investment activity in Canada's venture capital industry declined in 2003 with disbursements totalling $1.5 billion, down 41% from 2002. However  this decline is paralleled in the U.S. which has a much larger venture capital tool than Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has previously employed other tools other than direct subsidization to encourage venture capital growth in Canada and  we urge them to use those tools.  For instance,   budgets 2001 and 2003   included tax measures that removed impediments to pension fund investments and venture capital markets through limited partnerships, a vehicle that pension funds prefer for such investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also restore the  capital gains exemption to what it was or even  beyond that.     Frankly, that would enable middle aged people who have paid off their homes to start using some of these investments.  We need  to invest in people starting up small businesses and who need it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to finish this section with a quote from Larry O'Brien, a well respected chief executive of Calian Technologies.  He says that while it is easy for Ottawa to say it will support early stage development, consequent programs get “...so screwed up in execution that it never works that way and you're better off not doing it”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line, from our point of view, is that taxpayers should not replace shareholders as a main source of capital.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the ugly section, and   I should warn members that it is truly an ugly section.  The fact is that the Liberal government refuses to acknowledge the failure of its own policies to encourage innovation and productivity in Canada.  It has  had 10 years to improve industrial policy and now it is  asking for 10 more years under its so-called innovation agenda.  This was the agenda that was so prominent under the former industry minister and now we hear nary a word about it, except that the Liberals  want 10 more years to do this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that Canada does have the potential, and I have seen it firsthand across the country.  We  have the potential to be a world leader in innovation, entrepreneurship, science and technology.  However  this will require the government to make a fundamental policy shift away from policies of corporate welfare.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into that, I want to quote my friend and a policy expert in Canada, who we  should be listening to much more, Jason Myers, the executive vice-president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters.  He says, “At best this budget was balanced.  Anything else is of marginal, minimal impact on Canadian industry”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, a recent C.D. Howe Institute report stated that Canada's effective 31.5% tax rate on capital is leaving the country unable to compete with U.S. companies which face a substantially lower rate of 20.1%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combination with an increase in program spending, government expenditures on its own programs will jump 7.6% from last year, and will further increase another $12.7 billion over the next two years.  Obviously the government, and the Liberals in particular, have a problem in managing the finances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these record levels of spending, total gross domestic expenditure on research and development has declined.  According to the government's own documents, this drop is largely the result of a decrease in about $729 million in business R and D performance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big gains in productivity and research can only be achieved when capital, money and labour, is free to go where the market offers both profits and new and exciting opportunities to workers.  The government should be freeing up more money through tax cuts and it should revamp the SR&amp;ED tax credit program, something it has been promising to do for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of finishing off this ugly section of the budget, the budget fails to eliminate the terrible policy of corporate welfare.  One example is   the federal government's program,   Technology Partnerships Canada, also known as TPC, which  was created in 1996 to replace DIPP,   the defence industry productivity program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not question the need for a defence procurement strategy, but we do question corporate welfare and  the government's policy of  selecting certain companies within certain industries to favour for what it calls investments, what we call grants, or what it sometimes calls non-repayable contributions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Judi Longfield:</b> Can I have a copy of that for my folks?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte:</b> For the member opposite, let me give her some facts.  Since 1996 TPC has made 591 grants for a total value of $2.4 billion.   How much of that money has been repaid to date?  According to figures we obtained on February 3, 2004, $47 million out of the $2.4 billion has been repaid. What is that?   That is 1.9%. In eight years the cumulative repayment rate is 1.9%. It  is  absolutely shameless that the  government would continue to dole out money to corporations of its choosing and only gets back less than 2%   of taxpayers' money.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view is that we need a new industrial policy.  The Conservative Party favours an industrial policy that lowers taxes, increases spending on research and development and finally ends this terrible policy of corporate welfare.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,   my colleague  understands the industry file very well in speaking about corporate welfare and other issues that we certainly see as   problems.  His last comment  about the amount of money that has been forked out compared to the little bit that has been returned, clearly   is corporate welfare, and there is nothing else to call it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus in on a comment he made earlier about research and universities and the private sector being involved in research in our educational institutions. The research going on in my riding  at the University of Lethbridge   is second to none in the world with people working on spinal cord injuries and brain disorders.  They have done some remarkable things and that needs to continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to explain a little further how he feels about the combination of university research and private sector funds. What kind of mix needs to be there or does  there need  to be any at all?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-868334"></A><a HREF="#Int-868346"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-868329"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte: </b>

	Mr. Speaker,   I know the University of Lethbridge does excellent work.  We should mention as well that it is not just universities but  all post-secondary institutions. Institutions like NAIT and SAIT in Alberta do excellent work as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of combining the private sector with university research, I think   a good format is at the University of Saskatchewan.  The University of Saskatchewan has set up something called Innovation Place where it has all the researchers working but it also has people from companies who can come in, assist and work side by side.  Researchers can approach them for venture capital.  That  gets people working from the early stages of the project. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of protecting intellectual property and commercializing research, the University of Alberta is probably in the top five in the country in doing that.  It needs to be done in a multi-layered way.  If we look at the  National Institute for Nanotechnology  at the University of Alberta, it  needs funding from different sources. It needs it from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, which funds mainly capital projects;  and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, which funds a lot of the salaries.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that level, even if it  had something like Innovation Place, which the University of Saskatchewan has, then it would get the private sector funding right at the beginning.  The people from the various companies or the small business people could see what researchers were doing and then could  get involved in that research at the very early levels.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure   to respond to the federal government's budget, a Seinfeld budget:  much ado about nothing.  However  that is understandable given the circumstances faced by the government, a government that is under attack for its ethical challenges and for the largesse it has dispensed for self-serving motives at the expense of Canadians at large. It means that the government is not in a position to try to buy goodies just prior to election time, as is its custom. That has resulted in a budget that we have not seen from the government before, a budget that plays around the edges of talking about issues but does not  do much about addressing them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key issues that should be addressed and was not addressed by the government, an issue lost in the culture of corruption of the government, is a scandalous issue. It is an issue far bigger and far more important than the $100 million that was given to Liberal friends in the sponsorship scandal. It is far bigger than the $2 billion gun registry fiasco and far bigger  than the hundreds of millions for Challenger jets. It is enormous. That scandalous issue is   the EI overcharge which, as the Auditor General  pointed out in her most recent report, is now at a level of about $44 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to be clear, the present Prime Minister when he was finance minister, Paul Martin Senior's son when he was finance minister, set the EI rate and politicized it. He took it away from an arm's length agency, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, which was a partnership agency that worked in a multilateral manner to set EI rates. He politicized those rates three years ago and he has kept them artificially high. In so doing, he has enlarged the surplus. He has used the EI program as a cash cow. He has taken money from working Canadians  under the auspices that it would be coming off their cheques and going into EI when in fact that is not the case and  has not been the case for 10 years. The EI account has a surplus of  $45 billion and has grown  during this last fiscal year to a level  approaching $50 billion.  This is money the government   has  taken from working Canadians and small business people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the member opposite earlier trying to wrap his arms closely around small business and the small business communities  but it is those small businesses that have been fleeced by the government on the excessive EI premiums that have been taken from them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EI program itself is a subject for much larger debate. The program  has never fulfilled its mandated objective properly, which is to provide temporary benefits to workers who are temporarily laid off. Instead, it has been criticized repeatedly by royal commissions, policy groups, think tanks and in the last five Auditor General's reports for the way in which it mismanages labour force management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact   is that this is a working tax. EI premiums are the most regressive form of tax. They are a payroll tax. When they are unnecessarily high, they punish the engine of growth in our economy, which is small businesses and working people. They punish it unnecessarily and the government has done that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this talk about compassion and caring, and the attempts   to create the impression that this is a government that does  care for Canadians, rings hollow and stands quite false in the graphic evidence that out of each and every Canadian household $6,000 has been taken under false pretences in unnecessary and excessive EI premiums. It has been used by the government for its own priority purposes.  Let us not pretend that it has gone to EI. It has not been used to support the employment insurance program at all. It has been used to subsidize steamship companies. It has been used to hand out money to Liberal friendly advertising firms to do little or no work. It has been used for purposes not germane whatsoever to the employment insurance program. That is wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the finance minister stood  last week and told us and the Canadian people that he had balanced the budget for seven consecutive years, that was not an accurate statement. If truth were an island, it would be an island uninhabited by that finance minister.  The fact remains that the government has not balanced the budget in arguably three of the last seven years because the only way it could create the impression it had actually balanced the budget was through lifting EI premiums   off the  paycheques of working Canadians and throwing it into general revenue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General said that  the government was breaking its own rules and that it should do something about it. The Auditor General is getting red in the face trying to convince the government, after five consecutive reports saying the same thing, that it should do something about it.</p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not. The reason it does not is simple.  For every dime the government gives back to working people on their paycheques in reduced EI premiums, it loses $870 million in general revenue that it can throw toward unnecessary and wasteful expenditures.  The government takes that money and parades around as if it could actually manage when the reality is quite the contrary.  The fact of the matter is that the government cannot and does not manage effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cost of diverting funds from a dedicated program, which the EI program is? What is the real cost?  What analysis has it done?  When the government dishonestly diverts money from a dedicated program to other purposes, who pays for it? It is not just the payer. What is the impact on the payer?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about a working couple?  Let us say that they each make $30,000.  They have lost $6,000 out of their household budget.  That is money they cannot spend.  That is money they cannot save for their child's education.  That is money they cannot use to take a little trip with or to do home improvements with.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the small businessperson who has paid that extra 140% of $6,000?  What about them?  How much have they lost?  They have lost the opportunity to expand, to invest in capital investment, to do research, or to hire other people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development tells us that Canada's unemployment system is structurally unsound and creates artificially high unemployment rates.  The government likes to say that unemployment is lower than it was 10 years ago.  Well, alleluia. Unemployment around the world in most western democracies is lower than it was 10 years ago.  We were in a worldwide recession at that time.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the point.  The point is that our unemployment rate is now 7.5%, which is higher than that of many of our competitors.  Part of the reason is that we pay people to be unemployed.  Part of the reason is that we punish people who pay into EI, so they cannot employ more people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner the government comes clean on this issue the better we will all be, because families suffer as a consequence. Family members work longer hours, take more overtime  and are away from each other more than they should be.  We work for half the year in this country to pay taxes.  We are overtaxed by the government.  Families suffer as a consequence. The money the government has taken out of my riding and out of the constituencies of other members here would be far better left in the hands of the people who earned it than it will ever be managed by this government opposite that is taking it from them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that this budget presents this EI money as revenue, but it is actually money borrowed from working people and small businesspeople across Canada.  It is borrowed from them.  It has been taken under false pretences and borrowed from them.  The fact of the matter is, it should be repaid. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims, when we raise questions concerning his association with Liberal ad companies and his closeness to them, that he is not close to them at all.  He points to rogue bureaucrats or other people.  He says he did not know. He says he was otherwise occupied.  But he cannot point the finger at anyone else on this issue, because the fact is that he was responsible. It was he who set those rates and kept them artificially high.  The fact is that he, as finance minister, removed the arm's length mechanism that was in place to make sure that we had fairer EI premiums established in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I have a lot more faith in the people of my riding to earn money and to manage it well than I do in this government.  The fact remains that when the government takes the money off a working person's paycheque in that little box that says EI, it should have the dignity and decency to use it for employment insurance and not throw that money to its own petty projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other things that I think are missing from the budget.  In particular,  there are issues of concern in terms of crime and public safety that are not addressed.   Aboriginal policies are not addressed.  Many serious concerns face the people of this country. They were looking for leadership.  The fact remains that they did not see it.  They did not get it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the government is fearful.  I understand the likelihood that it is in close proximity to the next election.  I understand also that the Prime Minister has jumped up and down like a little boy in the back of the classroom saying “pick me, pick me” for 10 years, but the fact of the matter is, when we pick him to give us an answer to a  question about an important policy issue, he does not have the answer.  He is full of style but is missing substance.  He has picked the pockets  of taxpayers instead. I do not think the taxpayers of this country are going to be picking this man, based on what we have seen thus far from him.   Making a lot of vague references to high priorities just does not cut it when it comes to providing leadership for the people of this  country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Portage--Lisgar for his comments today. He has been making an issue of the EI surplus for a long time, especially since his time as our party critic in that area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was our critic in this area, he was also involved in aboriginal affairs for our party. He did mention the fact that there were things missing from this budget. He would have liked to see the budget address some of the discrepancies or some of the shortcomings in that department. I would like him to expand a little more on the aspect of the budget dealing with aboriginal affairs.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is an area of particular importance to me and I think to all of us, because the budget allocates close to 10% of the discretionary dollars, the non-debt servicing dollars, to aboriginal-specific programs.  That is 10% for about 1% of the country's population. However, the government has not demonstrated a willingness to pursue any kinds of initiatives that depart from the failed policies of the past. It continues to throw money in the direction of dealing with the symptoms of problems.  It is not addressing the solutions for those problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on property rights, a number of bands in this country have instituted systems whereby their members have the right to own their own homes. This has resulted in better neighbourhoods with far less property crime and better maintained properties. Investment in houses in those areas has paid dividends; the houses last much longer.  These are changes that bands are making on their own, but the federal government has not shown any initiative in advancing those kinds of ideas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the fake barrier that the Indian Act puts around the ability to repossess chattels off reserve? Let us say that we have a retail business that sells appliances or automobiles and sells them onto reserve. If payment is not made, the property cannot be repossessed. What that does is penalize the honest aboriginal person who wants to get credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take down these barriers. They are antiquated barriers that are 130 years old. The government has shown no initiative in these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about matrimonial property rights for aboriginal people? The only place in Canada where there are no matrimonial property rights is on reserve. Aboriginal women get the raw end of the deal and many of them unfortunately stay in damaging, painful and risky relationships because they fear they will lose everything if they leave. That is not right and it is not fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kinds of things that do not cost a ton of money to do, but they certainly can pay major dividends in increasing the freedom and equality of people for aboriginal people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about the Canadian Human Rights Act. Unbelievably in 2004, that act does not apply on Indian reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kinds of changes the government should be making. It strikes me that the government is afraid of the status quo Indian industry in this country, which benefits by the preservation of dependent people, when what we need are ideas and enthusiastic projects, which many bands have embraced on their own.  We need them adopted nationally.  They can bring aboriginal people to a position where they can be not only self-sustaining, as many already are, but in a better position where they can, as equal Canadians, pursue their goals with the rest of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not expensive proposals but they take courage and they take forward thinking in dealing with them. The government missed the boat on these issues, both in its throne speech and in its budget. It continues to throw good money after bad in the same, old, failed approaches of the past. As for this idea, this Victorian era thinking, that we can somehow help people by bestowing money upon them, by largesse, by failed old welfare systems that basically steal the souls of many aboriginal people, it is one of the government's failed approaches. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are failed approaches and they continue. The government continues to insist on following them for no good reason. Welfare reform and many other initiatives are being undertaken around the world, yet here in Canada we still follow the same, old, antiquated, backward view that is too often illustrated by the government, not just in its ideas but in its lack of ideas.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  first, I want to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take pleasure in speaking today to all Canadians, to tell them how we, the Government of Canada, have adopted a budget that demonstrates sound financial management. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes provisions for responsible and prudent financial management. It talks of improving accountability and integrity with respect to public expenditures and of continuing to present balanced budgets or better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of health, the budget promotes effective policies that will preserve and reinforce our health care and public health systems. With respect to learning, it is important to provide young people with the tools for success, while encouraging lifelong learning for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, communities must not be neglected. We must ensure that solid and sustainable foundations are laid to create a new deal for communities. And to that we add knowledge and commercialization, in order to increase productivity through investments in research and development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's relations with the rest of the world are also a high priority and require the creation and strengthening of Canada's international ties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative to economic and fiscal prospects, Canada’s economy was hit by a series of shocks in 2003, ranging from the SARS outbreak, a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the Ontario power blackout to forest fires in British Columbia and Hurricane Juan in Nova Scotia. All this, combined with the rapid increase of more than 20% in the value of the Canadian dollar, pushed Canada’s economic growth down to 1.7% last year, well below the 3.2% forecast by private-sector economists at the time of the last federal budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2004, private sector economists forecast an average growth rate of 2.7% for Canada’s economy, reflecting solid domestic fundamentals, low interest rates and a stronger economy. In 2005, growth is forecast to rise to 3.3%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to responsible and prudent financial management, the Government of Canada is committed to balanced budgets or better in each of the next two years. This commitment to fiscal discipline means the government will maintain its annual $3 billion contingency reserve which, if not needed to deal with unforeseen circumstances, will be used to reduce the federal debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the budget restores $1 billion in economic prudence for 2004-05 and 2005-06. This kind of prudence is what enabled us to address some extraordinary burdens, as I mentioned earlier, and also allowed the government to provide $1 billion in direct assistance to agricultural producers to help offset the severe hardships caused by recent disease outbreaks and sudden drops in farm incomes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget also sets the objective of reducing Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio to 25% within 10 years. I would like to point out that 50 years ago there were eight workers for every one retiree. Today, it is five workers for every one retiree, and in 25 years in Quebec, it will be two workers for every one retiree, which is why it is important to decrease the debt to ensure that our children and grandchildren have a promising future and the health care that they deserve. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investment of $665 million this fiscal year and over the next two years includes $165 million to assist in creating the new Canada public health agency and to fund its main activities, including increasing emergency response capacity, and enhancing surveillance. It also includes some $100 million to be invested in Canada Health Infoway to develop high quality, real-time public health surveillance systems. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need only think of SARS, West Nile virus and other diseases where rapid intervention is essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this budget provides an additional $400 million to the provinces and territories to support a national immunization strategy and to assist in enhancing their public health capacities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in addition, of course, to the $2 billion that the Canadian government is transferring to the provinces this year, building on the 2003-04 agreement for $34.8 billion, for a total of $36.8 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of learning, budget 2004 includes a comprehensive package of measures to make post-secondary education more accessible to all Canadians and promote lifelong learning, including the following.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a new Canada learning bond of up to $2,000 for children born after 2003 in a family entitled to the national child benefit supplement.  An initial $500 bond will be provided, with subsequent $100 annual instalments for children, until age 15, in each year that the family is entitled to the national child benefit supplement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Canada education savings grant matching rate for low-and middle-income families will be significantly enhanced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new upfront grant of up to $3,000 for first year post-secondary dependent students from low-income families is also being introduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget also raises the weekly loan ceiling under the Canada student loans program to $210 from $165.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this budget will be accelerating implementation of the agreement with the provinces and territories to improve access to affordable, quality early learning and child care programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this budget will extend the education tax credit to employees who pursue career-related studies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new deal for communities is announced. Budget 2004 takes the first steps on the government’s commitment to forge a new deal for communities of all sizes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipalities will receive an estimated $7 billion in relief over the next 10 years with respect to the GST and the federal portion of the harmonized sales tax.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, for  the year 2004-05, which is said to have started on February 1, the municipalities of Quebec will receive $129 million.  I can tell hon. members that several mayors have written to us, and others have spoken to us personally to thank us for this measure taken by the Government of Canada to support them in meeting their great need to upgrade their infrastructure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1 billion for infrastructure will be spent over the next five years instead of the previously announced 10-year period, again because we know how many municipalities are in urgent need.  We had a duty to do something, and this is excellent news.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the community-based and non profit sector, Canadians depend on a wide range of organizations to contribute to the well-being of individuals and families.  We are going to improves the tax rules for charities; extend small business programs and help establish capital funds and other sources of lending to benefit social economy enterprises; and provide additional funding over two years to the voluntary sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been very well received by stakeholders in the social economy and by the entire Canadian public as well.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I see that time is moving along quickly, so I will just say in conclusion that we have an excellent budget.  There are things we will still need to do.  There are things that are not included.  For example, in 2000, we adopted a five-year plan to reduce taxes by $100 billion, and this year—that is the one about to begin—2004-05, Canadians will benefit from $31 million in tax reductions.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Beauce what he thinks of our political mores and the integrity of our institutions with respect to the situation today and that which prevailed in 1993, at the time the Liberals took power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we know that, as a result of the sponsorship scandal, the government is trying to change its image and give itself a makeover. As for integrity, the government  has announced certain measures in the latest budget speech in order to establish the Office of the Comptroller General of Canada, for example. It will appoint professionally accredited comptrollers to sign off on all new spending initiatives in every government department. Moreover, it will try to reorganize and strengthen the internal audit function on a government-wide basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it is interesting to see what was said in the red book of 1993, which, it appears, has been tossed out the window by the supposedly new leadership of the Liberal Party and the government. In the introduction to the chapter entitled, “Governing with Integrity”, it says, and I quote: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Yet after nine years of Conservative rule, cynicism about public institutions... is at an all-time high.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are referring to the voters, the Canadian public, the people of Quebec.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—cynicism about public institutions, governments, politicians and the political process, is at an all-time high. If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable. There is evidence today of considerable dissatisfaction with government and a steady erosion of confidence in the people and institutions of the public sector. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how we see it. This was written by the Liberals in 1993. Later, speaking about order-in-council appointments, the Liberals add:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Conservatives made a practice of choosing political friends when making thousand of appointments to commissions and agencies—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I think that the government took its inspiration from that nasty habit of Canadian culture when it named—for example—André Ouellet to Canada Post, David Dingwall to the Royal Mint, Jean Pelletier to VIA Rail, as Paul Tellier's successor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to hear from my colleague, the hon. member for Beauce, what he thinks of the real changes that may have happened between the Conservatives' fiasco—which was about integrity—and the public fiascos we have just been through, to the point where it has become an international embarrassment to see this government acting like the government of a banana republic, as I am sure he will agree with me.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his courageous question. I did not think he would dare ask such a question. However, it is a pleasure to answer him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Parti Quebecois, which, a few years ago, had a major problem with commissions, the Quebec Liberal Party called for an inquiry. All the former thought to do was say, “Listen, we will amend the legislation on lobbyists, and voila, problem solved”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada, on this side, recognizes that there was a problem. A small group of people improperly used taxpayers' funds, and measures were taken—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  Oh, oh.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Claude Drouin:</b> I am sorry, but it seems that the Bloc does not want to listen to the answers. It only wants to listen to the questions. However, we are going to answer anyway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures were taken, which no previous government had ever done. We quickly asked the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to get to the bottom of things. Furthermore, a judge will investigate. He will conduct a full investigation and get to the bottom of this. We introduced legislation so that public servants could speak out against irregularities and systemic fraud. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We allowed cabinet memorandums, normally accessible only 30 years later, to be made available so that people can get to the bottom of this situation and ensure that taxpayers' money is being used properly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the Bloc member is forgetting is that the Canadian government must be judged on its entire record and, on that score, this government has reduced the debt by $52 billion. We are saving $3 billion in interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reduced taxes by $100 billion over five years and increased transfer payments to the provinces, as a responsible government should.  We increased the Canada child tax benefit as a responsible government should.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working together with the provinces—I know that it hurts the Bloc to hear that—to ensure that Canadians have access to the best possible services. That is how a responsible government acts.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a  bit of déjà vu for me today. The first time I rose in the House to speak on a budget was the 1994-95 budget when this government first came in. In 10 years a lot has happened, and it has been very positive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke at that point in time, our country had approximately $580 billion worth of accumulated public debt. We were running a $42.5 billion deficit. Unemployment in the country was over 11%. The interest rates  were over 11%, and everybody was worried about their jobs, their paycheques and their houses, if they could even afford to have one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the 2004-05 budget, it  is like night and day. Unemployment is down around the 7% mark. Interest rates are at  a 40-year low. We are the only country in the G-7 and the G-8 that is consistently running surplus budgets. The people at home now are not worried about their jobs. They are not worried about their paycheques. They probably have a house now because interest rates are so low they can afford one.  That is what has happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is each budget is a building block. We started in 1994-95 on a good direction and we are on that same path now with the 2004-05 budget. I ask any Canadian to make a comparison of where we were and where we are. Of course this budget is set in the direction of  where we want to go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that, we have to take a look back to where we were. Debt is a huge expense within a budget. At that point in time, accumulated public debt versus GDP, that would be one's mortgage versus one's  paycheque, was over 68%. Today it is sitting at 42%. We have made a commitment that in 10 years time it will be at 25%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were first elected to  the House and crafted that first 1994-95 budget, we were also spending almost 37¢ on the tax dollar taken in to service the debt, not pay it off.  We are now down to around 21¢ on the dollar, and still dropping. That means, as we keep lowering the debt and lowering the service costs on that, we automatically have savings. We have had savings on $52 billion paid off in accumulated public debt in the last couple of budgets alone of over $3 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surpluses happen when the economy is good.   However,  if the economy ever turned bad, surpluses very quickly disappear. However, once our debt is under control, savings within the budget on debt reduction  happens every year.  If the economy does slow down, we still have those savings. Those savings can then be put into programs to make Canada more competitive and a better place to live.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was chair of the national rural caucus, one of the things we argued for and received, and it has actually been enhanced in this budget, was money for rural Canada, in rural infrastructure. We must remember that in Canada today approximately 20% of the population lives on 80% of the land and 80% of the population lives on 20% of the land. If we take a look at the infrastructure within cities compared to the infrastructure of rural Canada, it is approximately the same. We just do not have a lot of people on both sides of the road. However, we still have roads to build, repair and maintain, along with bridges and any other infrastructure that goes along with them, such as water, sewers, whatever. Rural Canada needs an injection of cash just the same as urban Canada needs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an injection of cash within this budget amounting to $1 billion, which  was originally to be over 10 years.  That has now been accelerated to $1 billion over five years.   This  is almost like a 100% increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipalities across Canada have been given relief from the GST.  We have given them a rebate.  That, in essence, gives those municipalities that normally would have transferred this money to us, an extra $7 billion to work with over the next 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean to those municipalities?  Smaller municipalities of 250,000 people and under could receive anywhere from  $300,000 to $500,000 a year.  That would build a lot of roads and put in a lot of infrastructure.  Toronto has a lot of problems right now with its public transit system, and it alone will benefit by over $50 million a year from the GST rebate.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a lot happen in that 10 year period.  However, we have to build on our future too.  Our future lies with our upcoming youth, and from that our education system.  The government has allowed $20 million to offset the individual costs of research by universities and research hospitals. If Canada, as an exporting nation, is to be cutting edge, we have to have R and D.  If not, then we definitely will end up with a major problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's relationship to the world is important. As the former parliamentary secretary for international trade, I found it was important for the country to expand its relationship and trade with other countries, such as APEC, the Asian-Pacific Economic Council, and Caricom, the Caribbean countries.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional $250 million has been provided in the budget to cover Canada's costs in peacekeeping initiatives within Afghanistan and to fight terrorism. When I was at APEC, that was one of the things about which countries were talking.  Canada's decision not to go to war with Iraq impressed those countries.  Canada, as a peacekeeping country, has to keep putting a strong position forward on this, on a multilateral basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to trade, $1.9 billion Canadian crosses over the U.S. border each day.  Over the last two years, we watched with a lot of interest the United States in a recession.   Normally, Canada exports  44% of what we produce.  Of that, 85%   goes to the United States.  It used to be if the United States got a sniffle, we had pneumonia.  In the last two years when the United States had a recession, Canada did not.  We have to ask ourselves why?  If this happened in the past, why did it not happen this time?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason is because we have our debt under control and that gives our economy stability. That has helped us out because it has actually stabilized the value of the Canadian dollar, and low interest rates have given Canadians a lot more economic flexibility than what they had in the past.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not mention the environmental aspect within the budget.  When I was chair of the national rural caucus, I pushed very hard for ethanol production in Canada. I now see, with the budget's building blocks, that we are beginning to establish an ethanol industry,  and I think that is excellent.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the budget debate this afternoon.  I want to indicate at the outset that I will be sharing my time with the member for Vancouver East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been amused to listen to members on the government side say that this must be a good budget because the opposition and Canadians do not want to talk about it.  It is kind of like a grey, overcast day.  There is really not very much to be said about it. It is a conservative budget that focuses very much on debt reduction and not on urgent social needs, such as health care.  I want to focus on some of that during the time that I have available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset,  I recognize and applaud the government for stepping in and providing some additional assistance to farmers who have been so badly affected by the BSE crisis.  It has been desperately needed, and it is a good thing the money was provided a week ago Monday, the day before the budget was  introduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who I spoke to in my riding and across the country were looking for changes in issues like health care and reducing wait times for elective surgery.  As members know, wait times  across the country are up to 18 months.  These people will get no comfort from the budget of last week.  There is no reduction because there is no significant additional money to reduce waiting times.  The $2 billion announcement was made yet again, and there was a commitment about first ministers meeting later on this year.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the government of Manitoba expects it will require another $106 million in order to keep abreast of health care issues in that province. The premier of Manitoba, Gary Doer, has said that if the federal government has money, let it spend it now.  He has said that the province needs it now, not in August or September.  There is a crisis now, and I am sure premiers across the country would echo the statement of the premier of Manitoba.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are beginning to wonder whether the Prime Minister is starving the health care system in order to create a crisis, allowing him to bring in the corporate side with the public-private privatization plan.  It is still on the radar screen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a bit more money for infrastructure this year, but again it is tied to the P3 investments, the public-private partnerships in water, transit and highways.  We think that is basically a licence to print money for those private entrepreneurs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there was a GST exemption for the cities, but why was there not one for schools, universities, hospitals and indeed for social services? In the throne speech in February promises were made to patients, parents, students and aboriginal Canadians.  We expected, reasonably, to see some of those details rolled out in the budget.   We know throne speeches are an opportunity to create a good feeling without needing to put a lot of data to it.  However, we saw none of that for those groups in last Tuesday's budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What there is, though, is a fixation on the debt. As many other noted economists have indicated, Canadian debt is already among the lowest of any major economy in the world.  However, the budget of the newly minted finance minister from Saskatchewan, and kudos to him, focuses on reducing the debt from 42% of gross national product to 25% over a 10 year period.  We can remember that there used to be a  commitment by the government to have a fifty-fifty arrangement on any surpluses, that 50% of the additional surpluses would go to social spending and 50% would go to debt reduction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies:</b> What happened to that promise?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> What happened to that promise, indeed?  It is gone and now the focus is very much on driving that debt down as quickly as possible.  That means Canadians will have to wait for spending on some of the social deficit issues that are so important to them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think Canadians were impressed at all with last Tuesday's budget. They wanted to see recognition of the Romanow report.  They wanted money built it into the base for health care.  They wanted to see a national drug agency and national home care.  Instead, we heard the re-announcement of the $2 billion.  There was no increase in the base funding.  We now are in a situation where funding from the federal government for health care, instead of the fifty-fifty funding formula which we used to have for health care, is 16% with the remaining 84% to be found by the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that virtually every province in Canada, with the sole exception of resource-rich Alberta, is really struggling and having problems coming in with any kind of a balanced budget because of the emphasis that has been placed on health care; the need to find additional funds to ensure that health care is available for all. The federal finance minister has said that sustainability must be our focus, but in my opinion the budget has not done a thing to ensure sustainability in the health care field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another area that deserves some focus, and that is employment insurance.  Prior to the budget, Canadians called for investment of full federal fiscal surplus in programs to create a fairer society.  They wanted to see a more productive economy and job creation to offset an economy now struggling with slower growth and rising unemployment.  Instead, a budget appeared that  was obsessively focussed on fiscal prudence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with employment insurance is not that the premiums are too high, as the members of the Conservative Party say.  The problem is very few people are eligible to receive  employment insurance.  This is a universal program where every Canadian who works pays into an EI program.  Yet according to the numbers, less than 40% of people are actually eligible to receive employment benefits.  Some do not work enough hours. It depends where one lives.  In some provinces and territories it takes 910 hours of work and in others 410 hours.  It is a makeshift operation, and it simply is not meeting the needs of Canadians in a changing work life.   People who are adversely affected by being ineligible for employment insurance are woman, younger workers and immigrants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is very askew when only 38% receive employment insurance benefits.  Since 1994, the government changed the rules on employment insurance.  It used to be that more than 75%  of people would apply for EI.  That is now down to 38%, and $50 billion has been taken out of the EI surplus.  It has essentially paid for all the surpluses that the government has been running for the last several years. The leader of the New Democratic Party, Jack Layton, calls it theft, and he is absolutely right.  Employers and employees have paid into that fund, and it has simply been taken over by the government and driven into its bottom line to pay down debt and deficit.  It is leaving part time workers, particularly women, seriously shortchanged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are two of the areas that I wanted to talk about today; the lack of money for health care as well as for employment insurance.  There are a number of other issues, but I am confident that my colleague from Vancouver East will deal with these in the time that is allotted to her.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, this is not a budget that will gladden the hearts of Canadian working men and women or their families, certainly not in the region of the country where I have the privilege of representing constituents.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to what the member was saying.  He talked about EI and the fact that so many people who pay into EI are not eligible for benefits when they need them. This  is a matter of considerable concern to me as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EI should be set up in such a way that for example students who have jobs in the summer or whenever and pay into EI should at least get their premiums back if they go back to school, for which there is no EI eligibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing which is very offensive to all of us, and I am sure to the member opposite as well, is that the government year after year rolls billions of dollars from the EI fund into general revenues for which it was never intended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to  say by way of comment that it is one area where I certainly agree with the member.  We should insist that the government follow the rules that were  intended for EI.</p>

	Before I give  the floor to the hon. member for Palliser,  let me  remind other colleagues in the House that to ask questions, members must be in their own seats before they can be recognized by the Chair.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-868792"></A><a HREF="#Int-868816"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-868788"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciated what the hon. member for Elk Island had to say.  I am glad that he too is interested in the fact that so few Canadians actually qualify for EI, even though we all pay into it  when we are working.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  gives me an opportunity to expand on that.  The member mentioned students and people who go back to school.  There are  900,000 Canadians who are in the low paid economy and  are  trapped there.  They are not getting out of that trap.  They tend to be older women, people who have generally not received a high school diploma. Almost all of them are not working in a place that is organized by a trade union.  They tend to be care workers, nannies and recent immigrants.  It is a very bad situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use the example of Alberta and specifically Calgary which is a booming metropolis as we all know.  The minimum wage in Alberta is $5.90 an hour.  For  a family of four with two adults working it would amount to   a little over $28,000 a year.  It certainly does not meet the low income cut-off.  We do not have a poverty level in this country but we do have low income cut-offs.  The average rent in Calgary is some $804 a month.  We can see how difficult it would be for a family of four in a city like Calgary.  I am not picking on Calgary; it could be any number of cities in this country.  That is the reality.  With a low minimum wage and a booming economy it is very difficult.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need training programs.  The member for Elk Island is absolutely right.  If we could take some of that employment insurance money and drive it into training programs, it would help families like the family I described. It would be to the benefit of this country. It would  certainly be to the benefit of  families like that one.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very interested in the comments that my colleague has made about employment insurance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community of Dartmouth we lose $20 million a year that was coming into our community to pay workers who had lost their jobs.  They lose their jobs and the money is no longer coming into our community. Furthermore they are leaving the community. They are  having to move to other parts of the country. Then our population declines and our equalization amounts then decline.  There is  this vicious circle of  people  leaving the community which  makes  the community weaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member's comments on that.  I believe it might be the same kind of phenomenon that he experiences in Saskatchewan.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Dartmouth is absolutely right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pay tribute to a gentleman by the name of Kevin Hayes who works at the Canadian Labour Congress and  who is focused very much on this whole issue of EI and what has happened with the changes in EI. He has documented what my colleague from Dartmouth is saying about money that has been taken out of local economies as a result of the withdrawal and the ineligibility of so many people for employment insurance.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely the same in Saskatchewan.  Millions of dollars have come out of my riding of Palliser, as in her riding of Dartmouth and everyone else's riding in the country. Money that used to be available  is no longer available.  We need to make that money available  again.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one thing I have come to know in this place is that the hallmark of Liberal budgets is they leave a legacy of broken promises. I will focus my comments on what some of those broken promises are.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Liberals say that it would be a budget that would really support students and would deal with the crisis that is facing students. Only two days before the budget,  I read in the <i>Vancouver Province</i> that tuition fees at the University of British Columbia were going up another 16%.  Arts students will now pay about $4,000 in tuition compared to $2,000 three years ago. That particular increase was on top of previous tuition hikes of 23% and 30%, and in effect doubles the tuition costs for students at that facility.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That university is not alone.  It is happening at every post-secondary educational facility in British Columbia and in many other parts of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening?  Is it the fault of the facilities?  Is it the fault of the students that somehow they are not paying their way?  No.  As was pointed out in the alternative federal budget, it is that the cash transfer from the federal government for post-secondary education is 50% lower than it was 10 years ago.  That is why students are in a crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read another story the day before the budget which said  that according to  a new study, four out of 10 university students are unable to graduate on time because they have to drop courses in favour of paid work to make ends meet.   Actually, this study was commissioned by the millennium fund which was set up by the former prime minister.  This is further evidence of the kind of crisis  students are in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quite astounded me to see the finance minister stand up in the House and hear him crow about all the good things the government was doing for students in this country. In effect what the government  was doing was allowing students to borrow more debt.  That is what the solution has been from the federal government, rather than addressing the systemic serious flaws and  the fact that transfer payments have been cut back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn for a moment to housing.  When the Prime Minister was in Quebec City on February 23, he said in remarks to the media that there would be a five year commitment in new spending, five years of funding in this coming federal election.  He said it would be in the Liberal platform. In  the budget there is zero dollars for housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many members who represent ridings and communities where housing is probably the most serious daily problem facing people. People are unable   to meet their rent payments. They are unable   to secure decent, affordable and safe shelter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister promises  a five year commitment for funding in the election and  a few weeks later in  the budget there is a zero commitment to housing.  Is it any wonder that people have lost faith in  the Liberal government and the political process in general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Shapcott is the spokesperson and co-chair of the National Housing and Homelessness Network. He  pointed out in his analysis of the budget that from 1984 until today we have suffered with cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars in social housing funding in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at that same press conference in Quebec City on February 23, the Prime Minister had the gall to say that he had not cut social housing.  I remember raising the issue in the House a few days later.  Not only did he cut social housing, but he demolished the whole program.  It was when he was finance minister that social housing was cut.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some commitments through the affordable housing framework agreement which  was signed in 2001, and  there was finally some money committed, although it was far short of what was called for across the country. Even after that, when the analysis is  done and we look at what has been spent, only about 8.8% of the promised funds have actually been spent on developing affordable housing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another example of a broken promise by the Liberal government. I would go further. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Palliser has mentioned the situation with the debt. I remember in 1997 and  again in the 2000 election, the Liberal promise was that whatever surpluses there were,  50% would go to debt reduction and tax relief and 50% would go to social programs. In reality, during that period  of time, 44% of the fiscal  dividend has gone to debt reduction, 46% went to tax cuts and only 10% of that so-called dividend has been allocated to genuine enhancements in federal programs. This comes from the very good analysis that has been done by the alternative federal government. Is it any wonder that people lose faith in the  budgetary process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister made a lot of noise about how he would target his budget to ensure that the debt to GDP ratio would go down to 25%. When we examine the impact of that in terms of the  loss of revenue and investment in social spending that has suffered so much, we have to seriously question the logic and the priorities that have been put forward by the present  finance minister,  the one who came before him,  and the one before him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  his analysis of the budget, the executive director of the National Anti-Poverty Organization said:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people out there who watch what is going on. There are people who actually take the time to monitor the long term impacts of budgets and what the impact is on low income people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held a forum in my own riding of East Vancouver. We heard from the Vancouver and District Labour Council. We heard from the Vancouver Aboriginal Council and the B.C. Coalition of People with Disabilities. We heard from people from  End Legislative Poverty and from the Tenants' Rights Action Coalition. They all said the same thing, that the people they were dealing with on a daily basis were suffering the terrible impacts of the broken promises from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget was a great disappointment to people. I look forward to the day, soon I hope, when we can get out there and have a debate in terms of an election and examine what the real record of the Liberal government has been. People will have an opportunity to cast a ballot and to make a decision through a vote about what they want to see in terms of changes.  I think people are really disgusted with what they have seen in terms of not only the corruptness of what goes on such as in the sponsorship scandal, but the broken promises through successive budgets that have hurt the most needy and vulnerable people in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the budget is anything to be proud of. Indeed, it is something  we should examine in light of all the other budgets that have come down  to see how much the gap has widened in this country between wealthy, affluent people and poor people. That is the true measure of  whether or not the federal government has done its job in distributing income, support and wealth in this country.   I would say it gets a failing grade.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am rising for the first time to debate the budget speech.  I would like to identify with Canadians who are viewing the proceedings in terms of trying to understand the process that we go through in capturing the essence of responsible management stewardship and a sensitivity to the issues that are on the minds of Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes those insights that come from people in the low salary categories, those who are on very low fixed incomes; an aging society; and  on the other part of the spectrum, a society that has young people looking for their particular position in the budget and  how their needs have been accommodated.  It includes the needs of small business people, entrepreneurs and those who make the contributions that not only instill a sense of confidence, but a sense of hope that we can generate revenues that will be contributing toward carrying the costs of a society that from time to time needs that government support.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to try to capture the feeling that Canadians have as they watch these proceedings.  All of the documents that I am referring to are available through the ministry of finance website.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make the point, in particular, as it was made very eloquently by the last speaker, in respect to things that are not in this budget speech.  Canadians should be aware that while this is a budget that is on the threshold of 2004-05 in terms of the financial positioning or repositioning of the financial accounts of the country, that it also is part of a context, a larger budgetary context that has been set by previous budgets. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there may not be something mentioned in this budget, that does not mean that those priorities are not high.  What it could mean, and I am going to give housing as an illustration, is that there have been major commitments made in other budgets.  So, while it is not mentioned in the 2004-05 budget, housing is a very high priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to direct the last speaker to the 2003 budget, and in fact 2002,  under the homeless and affordable housing files.  The government's position and record of accomplishment, and record of future opportunity is great.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent budgets indicate that more than $2 billion has been committed over the six year period between 2002 and 2008.  One billion dollars has been committed for the affordable housing initiative, a capital grant program aimed at increasing a number of affordable rental housing units. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost $500 million, committed  for housing renovation programs under the RRAP, had been included in that particular budgetary cycle. The home adaptation for seniors and dependents program, the emergency repair program, and the shelter enhancement program were also committed. These are all programs that are within that budget context.  While they are not mentioned in this budget, they in fact have been allocated, and discussions and negotiations continue with the provinces in terms of the delivery of the programs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not even mention the SCPI program, the supporting communities partnership initiative.  Some $665 million was allocated on the national homelessness initiative, a key element of which was the SCPI program.  As we know, negotiations continue to go on.  In fact, additional announcements are being made with respect to local community groups applying for those funds to offer support of its services and facilities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments are in addition to the $1.9 billion provided annually to support 640,000 households living in existing social housing units. Far from the government being disinterested in the housing initiative, here is an illustration that while housing is not mentioned in this budget, housing is an extremely high priority of the government.  The record illustrates how that is being accomplished within the total budgetary context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When families are looking at their capacity to acquire new capital goods, be they washing machines, dryers, sewing machines, a new car or whatever, they look at what their projected income is going to be and make a calculation based on responsible stewardship of their financial needs. They look at the risks that are associated with making specific decisions. That is not a far cry from what the government has to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks I would like to outline not only some of the risks but some of the records of accomplishment. When we look at Ernst &amp; Young's evaluation of the budget, it said that sound financial management was a cornerstone of the this government's first budget. Canadians want to see their government involved in sound financial management. That involves looking at some of the accomplishments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might remind ourselves that the rate of increase in terms of the GDP was around 1.7%. That was below the economic growth rate that had been projected for a number of reasons. That tells us that sound and prudent financial management means that one should not inflate the expectations of economic growth in the business cycle of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the culmination of sound financial management has resulted in interest rates being at a modern all-time low. Of course, low interest rates are an opportunity for people to enter the housing market and to look at the acquisition of capital goods, and they take that into consideration in terms of their financial management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the additional fact that the economy, through sound and prudent financial management, has since December 2002 created 271,900 new full time jobs.  We should compare that to the growth rates of our American friends. It has been suggested that in addition to international policy, unemployment will be the key point on which the Bush administration will be judged, the creation of new multipliers that create job opportunities for Americans. In Canada, because of sound prudent financial management, minimizing or lowering the risks, we have created confidence in the capacity for the management and stewardship of our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Canadian economy continues to grow by an average of 1.3%, projections are that we must be very careful with respect to our future rate of growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are risks involved. We all know that from time to time, when the dollar is falling, the opposition has asked if this means there is no confidence in the Canadian dollar. Yet, on the other hand when the Canadian dollar strengthens, opposition members will remind us that if we have too strong of a dollar, it means that our exports are going to be less competitive and the American relationship with our economy is going to put us at risk.  They are quite right on that. The corollary we draw from that is that we just have to tune and calibrate our business decisions very carefully.</p>


	<A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that as our dollar bobs and weaves around the 75¢ mark, we are attempting to tack very carefully, according to the winds of international monetary and business change. In a global economy, it is always hard to get that exactly right, but the fact that we are creating jobs, the fact that our economy is relatively buoyant, and the fact that we are, in relation to other G-7 countries, in a relatively competitive position means that prudent financial management, the tools that we are using, are being used in a sensitive and responsible manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the general situation, as has been said before, this is the seventh consecutive balanced budget and the first time since Confederation that we have balanced budgets at that rate.  We have included a $3 billion contingency reserve. Families can understand what that means. We do not go back on our capital to keep our general day to day operating budget in check. We are very careful to ensure that we keep our reserves there in case we have a rainy day. The government is doing that and Canadians can understand and respect that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are adjusting and calibrating our budget toward the day when, in our health care, in our services to seniors in an aging society, we can see that if there was an actuarial requirement to project what the needs of the economy were to be in terms of sustaining that standard of living, that we have  at this point got it right. We are actuarially sound. We are investing in those areas that will create new jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time that we are doing these things--and I know it has been mentioned with respect to the sponsorship programs and so--that whole set on which Canadians will judge the government are not only the financial approaches that are being used in terms of prudent and careful management, but also the checks and balances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the cabinet committee, on an expenditure review, will be examining all accounts in terms of attempting to claw back up to $3 billion in expenditures that can be redirected. There is an order through  the President of the Treasury Board to re-establish the office of the comptroller general. The public expects that will be done, but that should be seen within the total context of how the government has managed prudently and responsibly the concerns of all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to relate in terms of what this budget means to low income Canadians. That is the bottom line. To me, the bottom line is how people accurately see in the budget their position with respect to how important they are in the tax regime to which many members have made reference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the $100 billion five year tax reduction that was introduced in 2000 continues to provide that kind of tax relief. Three-quarters, and this is an important point, of this benefit is flowing to individuals, with most of the tax relief going to low and modest income Canadians. If Canadians want to see where they stand with respect to a 2002-05 perspective, they should go to the website and look at that chart. </p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on personal income tax from 2001, of that $100 billion, 75% goes in terms of personal income tax. That question was asked of the member for Toronto--Danforth. In terms of corporate income tax the amount is 10%  of the $100 billion in tax reductions.   In terms of employment insurance, another point that was raised,  it is 15.2%. So a huge part of that $100 billion in tax incentives in terms of reductions goes to individual Canadians through personal income tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also important to point out what that means with respect to business and entrepreneurs.  The tax system and this budget support the growth of small businesses by encouraging them to retain more of their earnings and by enhancing opportunities and incentives for investors, such as venture capital funds, to invest in small enterprises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures mean, for example,  that in terms of a small business deduction limit, that limit will rise to $250,000 from $225,000 in 2003.   That limit will rise  to $300,000 in 2005. In terms of the federal capital tax threshold for small businesses, the cap on that will be lifted and raised from $10 million to $50 million so that more businesses will qualify for that kind of tax relief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean in terms of a Canadian advantage?  It means that as a result of the actions taken from 2000 to 2003, Canada's average federal and provincial corporate tax rate, including capital taxes, will be 2.3 percentage points lower than that of the United States.  That is the impact it has in terms of low income Canadians and, if we will, low income businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also look very quickly at what the budget means in the priority areas.  I am not going to talk about health because it has been accommodated by other speakers, as has the importance of learning in terms of the Canada learning bond.  That learning bond will provide upfront annual grants of up to $2,000 for low income families who have children with learning disabilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has said, this prudent and financially responsible budget shows some future opportunity for flexibility.   Additional contributions will be made to health, not to mention that on the community based health side over $600 million will flow into various clinic-type approaches that are more preventative in nature and are major contributors to our health care program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent a great deal of my life in political activity at the municipal level.  I think it goes without saying that the announcement the government made in terms of the rebate on the GST will mean several billions of dollars to municipalities right across this country over the next 10 years. It will provide local municipalities with an additional opportunity to invest in transportation systems that are environmentally friendly,  in housing initiatives that they wish to make their portion of the program, and in social programs that they wish to activate at their level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commitment given by the government to discuss its budgetary cycle with municipalities before a budget is announced looks at them as an order of government, as responsible partners in shaping economic policy for the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that I think we have all been  concerned with respect to the international situation and what Canada's role is.   Traditionally it has been in peacekeeping.  This budget allocates funds for major involvement in the international activity in the world to make it a safer place to live.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that I do believe the budget represents a careful and caring agenda for action on the part of the government. I think it is consistent with the commitment the government has made to Canadians from all regions: that the government is sensitive to its responsibility and its accountability. Within the broader context of its stewardship over the last 10 years, over the last decade and into this decade, I believe the government has earned the respect and the right to continue to administer the affairs of the Canadian people, and I believe it will be supported in that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask this esteemed colleague a question with respect to his speech. He indicated that basically the government has done a great job on this budget and everything is so fine and so well. I wonder whether he does not actually have some serious questions about some of the elements of the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one of the things that has come through loud and clear for many months now is the fact that the government is rolling into general revenue a huge windfall from EI.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the NDP on one end saying that this is a crime because people who need to have their benefits are not receiving them, and I would echo that. I think that we buy insurance because if we need it  we want to be able to collect on it. Particularly in his area, that has to be a serious shortcoming. Meanwhile, we have the government rolling this money into general revenue and using it for whatever other reasons. That is specifically not a purpose of the EI fund: to just be a source of general revenue for the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to comment on those two things: the ineligibility of those who should be entitled to benefits and the fact that way too much money is being collected relative to what is being paid out.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-869009"></A><a HREF="#Int-869012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-869001"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the member will be aware that the rolling into general revenues of the EI surpluses has been a question that has been raised by the Auditor General in two or three reports. In reaction and in response to those observations by the Auditor General, it is my understanding that the employment insurance premiums and rates have been reduced consistently over the last two or three years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has given assurances that it is working toward the objective of using  employment insurance for the very reasons that the member has raised, but I would say that part of those general revenues is used for employment creation, for skills development and so on.  It is not a fiscal slight of hand. It is in fact just another financial tool that is used to achieve the objectives of employment and employment opportunities for Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Wheat Board, which represents 85,000 Canadian farmers, says there is potential economic danger in the introduction of genetically modified wheat into Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that European, Asian and other markets are closing their doors to genetically modified wheat sales, the prairie farm economy would suffer even further than after the mad cow crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the biotech industry would not benefit from the introduction of genetically modified wheat in the marketplace if there were no interested buyers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, March is National Epilepsy Awareness month. As the month draws to a close, we can congratulate Epilepsy Canada on its very successful “Lavender. Think Epilepsy” campaign, which included many media and public awareness activities and a new initiative: a lavender ribbon and lavender flower representing the solitude experienced by people with epilepsy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epilepsy is not a disease. It is a symptom of a neurological disorder and is a physical condition.  Epilepsy causes people to feel hopeless, isolated, discriminated against and often ridiculed.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 1%, or about 300,000 Canadians, have epilepsy.  Each day in Canada, an average of 38 people learn that they have epilepsy.  That would be about 14,000 Canadians per year.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all of us in the House congratulate Epilepsy Canada and the many volunteers who made its campaign such a huge success this year.</p>

These volunteers provide hot meals to their fellow citizens who, for one reason or another, are shut in and unable to prepare the major meal of the day themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meals on Wheels volunteers work in all weather through all seasons. With the meals, they bring a friendly contact, a smile and news of the day.  For many shut-ins the visit is worth as much as the meal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to remind all MPs that most Meals on Wheels organizations provide frozen meals.  They are good for MPs who live alone in lonely garrets here in Ottawa. MPs can help their local Meals on Wheels organization by buying these frozen meals.  Last night I had sole florentine. The night before, I had traditional pot roast, and the night before that, fish and chips.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen meals I bring from Meals on Wheels Peterborough really are on wheels.  They travel three and a half hours by car from Peterborough to Ottawa.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that I am so pleased Technology Partnerships Canada has announced a $9.2 million investment to develop  clean water technologies.

In spite of his severe physical challenges, he won friends well beyond the Island with his positive attitude. He always wanted to be involved in the activities around him and he was. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey had a love of horses and horse racing. Beginning in 1994, Jeffrey's story won him the support of standardbred horse owner, Tom MacPherson, whose filly won a long shot race with the winnings going to a fundraiser for Jeffrey. He became an honorary member of the United States Trotting Association and maintained close connections to the P.E.I. Horse Owners Association.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey's life was remarkable for what he achieved. He set an example for all of those who had the chance to share in it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, for three years I have worked on behalf of former JDS Uniphase employees regarding current tax treatment of employee stock purchase plans. These innocent people are caught up in a tax nightmare which has taken a tremendous financial and emotional toll.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written to at least three ministers of finance including the current Prime Minister. Former JDS employees have also been writing to both the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister. I have also personally raised this matter with the Minister of Finance in recent weeks. To date, we have received no response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the government is more concerned with covering up the sponsorship scandal than addressing this matter. It is simply not acceptable that the government refuses to deal with this matter, yet it has no problem cutting special deals to write off Mr. Radwanski's $600,000 income tax owing. Of course, he is a well connected Liberal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking for the government to treat former JDS Uniphase employees fairly. If the Prime Minister expects us to believe that he actually cares about these people, he should show us and deal with this matter before he calls an election.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have increased our intelligence gathering and sharing capabilities.

	Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report highlights the sheer incompetence of the government when it comes to tackling key policing and security challenges.  Only the Liberals would dream up a $39 million system to gather electronic fingerprints and then forget to fund and establish the system needed to analyze them.  The result is  a two and a half month fingerprint backlog.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the Minister of Public Safety.  Why has the RCMP not been given the necessary funds to establish the real time identification system?  Why has it not been given the resources to do its job?</p>

There is a backlog in the RCMP's database of lost and stolen passports.  There is a backlog in the firearms registry.  I could go on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under-funding, under-resourcing  and just plain Liberal neglect has left the RCMP's cupboard bare.  After a decade of mismanagement, why should Canadians believe the Liberal government?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, since September 11, 2001 there has been a substantial infusion of new resources into the enhancement of our safety and security in this country.  In fact, included in that is additional resources for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already indicated for the hon. member, we understand that real time identification is important, which is why the RCMP will be requesting proposals in the very near future in terms of putting that system in place.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost and stolen passports are a major security concern. Under the current process it takes an average of 70 days to exchange information between the passport office and the RCMP.

	Mr. Speaker, we certainly appreciate the Auditor General's report, but let me clarify some of what the hon. member has said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months, we have  in fact put together some programs to  ensure our commitment to enhancing our security system, such as new programs to screen non-passengers and a new agreement between Transport Canada and the RCMP to share sensitive law enforcement information, which responds directly to the Auditor General's report.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that does not respond to my question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving right along, the government has chosen to focus its security efforts on cyber security intelligence and border protection. Meanwhile, ports like Montreal and Halifax see the priorities as completely different. The ports need funds now to establish uniform security coordination with U.S. ports. They need funds now for waterside security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to get value for the money, why does it not listen to the port officials and put the money where it is really needed?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, aside from the rhetoric, the member does actually put out a concern that we in fact have been dealing with in respect to port authorities. They have made their interventions. If the hon. member  looks to the budget and the $605 million envelope that deals with security, he will see marine security as part of that $605 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what we will do is go forward and assist the ports to meet the security challenges in the future, to meet the international standard, which Canada will meet as of July 1.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, four months have passed since the Liberals first introduced Bill C-9, a bill to assist developing countries to get affordable drugs. An estimated 800,000 Africans have died from AIDS and more than 1.5 million have been infected with HIV since that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kofi Annan was here, the Prime Minister told us that the time to act is now, but this month the Liberals have cancelled the committee four times for the meetings on Bill C-9. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Prime Minister, some of the Liberals have told us they want to change the name of the bill to the Jean Chrétien pledge to Africa. Is this why the Prime Minister is stalling the bill? Because of his personal vendetta?</p>

Incredibly, yesterday his response was simply this, and I quote, “it is not Canada's intention to stir up a tempest...”. That summed up the Prime Minister's shot across the bow of the Danish ship of state.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister of Health explain his refusal to act on the unanimous recommendation by the Standing Committee on Health urging the federal government to raise the annual funding for the Canadian strategy on  HIV/AIDS to $100 million?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member knows, the budget included a significant initiative related to helping our cities and communities. Today there was an important announcement with regard to his city.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the  member remind the House and Canadians about the important contribution the government  has made to the cities of Canada?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, during my comments I referred to the new relationship  being developed under the umbrella of a new deal for cities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first announcement through the budget was the full rebate on the GST.  When that washes through to the municipalities, it will allow them to invest in a wide spectrum things, such as  infrastructure,  water and sewers,  housing and transportation initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A continuation of that theme is the announcement  with respect to the city of Toronto of $1 billion that will be a partnership of  the city of Toronto, the province of Ontario and the federal government. Under the initiative we will see an improvement to the transit infrastructure in the city of Toronto. Within the context of the GTA when we add that to  the $50 million initiative for an investment in the York region, we will have a federal presence for the first time in a major way in the area of transportation and other infrastructure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a theme with respect to consultation. For years there has not been the recognition that municipalities have a huge role to play with respect to the quality of air and quality of life that Canadians enjoy. There is a  commitment given through the budget that there will be consultation before each budget.  Cities will be invited in order that there is an understanding of  what their needs are and how  the budget can be used to meet those needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that kind of  consultative approach and the kind of announcement  that was made in the city of Toronto today,  we are on the threshold of a new relationship which  can only   better serve Canadians in the cities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in our intervention earlier, I asked the member specifically whether he thought  it was incorrect of the government to put  large amounts of money into general revenue. He answered my other questions with respect to the EI fund to the best of his ability, even though we may not totally agree.  However, he did not address the question of the money going into general revenue and there was no mention made in the budget that it would be changed.  I would like his comment on that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate a colleague who includes in his preamble the characterization of a member doing it to the best of his ability, which I did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I indicated that the employer and employee contributions to EI had been reduced in  the last two budgets.  I indicated that the Auditor General had said that we should attempt to ensure that instead of transferring that fund  into general revenues, it  should be reinvested in matters relating to employment, such as seasonal employment, employees who find themselves in situations where they are without work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did say also, and I am sorry the member did not hear it, was that while that is the direction of the government, I do not think  the government should be faulted for investing   general revenues in  employee related initiatives, such as skills development.  That is in keeping with the philosophy of reinvesting in job creation, job retraining programs that the employment insurance fund was designed for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with the principle and the spirit of the member's question.  Eventually it would be, I think in accounting terms, more correct to have the fund and out of that fund allocate expenditures that relate specifically to employment creation and employment insurance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that with the full spectrum of needs that exist in the Atlantic region,  shipbuilding obviously is one of those that should be evaluated.  It should be incubated in such a manner that it does create the kind of jobs and economic activity  the member would like to see. I am sure the government would support that.  It should it looked at through the porthole, if members would pardon the nautical analogy, of  the Atlantic regional expansion fund.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise  and represent the constituents of Saanich--Gulf Islands in the budget debate. I will be splitting my time with the member for St. John's West.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we listened to the budget speech,  there were such expectations.  The Prime Minister, when he was  minister of finance, had been plotting for some 10 to 13 years to overthrow the previous prime minister, Jean Chrétien. He was successful last November.  That was his  dream. We  expected to see some type of vision,  his plans  on where he wanted to take the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were absolutely surprised by the budget.  It was so hollow.  There was  very little in it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister  has been completely derailed by the sponsorship program, by the wasteful and abusive government spending. I call it the theft program, not the sponsorship program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  matter  was created by the Liberal Party.  I want to touch on this because this is one of the major points in the budget.  It is ironic. The theft program, otherwise known as the sponsorship program, was created  to promote unity across Canada. When we talk to people  outside  Quebec, they    say,  “Quebec gets all this money. What a crazy program. The $250 million that the Liberals funnelled in there has gone to Liberal friendly firms”. For   anyone who is associated with the party it is really a corrupt program.  There is no question about it. When we talk to people inside Quebec, they  say, “There is nothing but a bunch of crooks in Ottawa.  Look at this $250 million.  Look at the unity program”.  Whether people  are inside Quebec or outside Quebec what they  are seeing in the program is corruption in the highest order. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that this is one of the darkest days in Canadian political history, but let us get into the specifics. The government has been preoccupied with this for two or three months.  Its response has been to  bring back the comptroller general of Canada. This was something that was eliminated in 1994 by the Liberals.  It  was a process that had been started before they took office. The Liberal government  weakened that position  and eventually got rid of it entirely in 1994.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically in 1995 it was the current Prime Minister when he was  minister of finance who promised to bring in program review to ensure that we did not get wasteful spending, to ensure that there was  value for money. That year, 1995,  was the very same year that the minister of finance, who is now the Prime Minister, approved the sponsorship program where we have seen hundreds of millions of dollars go down a big black sink hole never to return.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the talk on the streets in British Columbia everywhere we go.  When we  go into the restaurants, the coffee shops or wherever we end up people are genuinely upset.  Members from all parties, including the Liberals,  have told me that people are angry about this,  and rightfully so.   They should be angry.  They have a right to be angry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia people have said to me, “When Glen Clark spent $450 million on the fast ferries, the people of British Columbia were so outraged that they reduced the government majority down to two seats.  But at least the government spent the  money  on ferries.  It did not work, but they spent the money on ferries”.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sponsorship scandal, the theft program, the money was literally stolen.    It is corruption of the highest order.  Sadly, money went  to   Liberal friendly ad agencies, the ones that have been doing all the contracting. All the stories  have been out there.  It is a  slap in the face to the Canadian taxpayer. This is the time of year when  Canadians are filling out their income tax and    writing  cheques to send to Ottawa and these are the stories they are reading on  how money is spent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will  bring this  a bit closer to home.  How has  this impacted the people of Saanich—Gulf Islands?  A number of employees who worked for JDS Uniphase were innocently caught up in an employee stock purchase plan.  It was an absolute tax nightmare.  I cannot go into all the details  but, in short, people received salaries for one year in the amount of $100,000 and their T4s showed $1.4 million in earnings and $700,000 in tax owing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met with the then minister of finance  who is now the Prime Minister.  He looked at that  and acknowledged that it was  a serious problem and that  something had to be done.   He acknowledged    that these people were caught up in a   tangled web through no fault of their own and he promised to do something.    I   met with his officials and had    e-mails from them saying that they would  “cut the motor” on Revenue Canada from pursuing these people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now been three years   and absolutely nothing  has been done. I wrote the Prime Minister in his capacity as minister of finance and  I have written the current finance minister. I have written three finance ministers and it has fallen on deaf ears.  Do they care about these people? No. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do the Liberals care about?  What have they done?    How about George Radwanski, the former privacy commissioner who  owed the federal government over $600,000 in  taxes?  What did the current Prime Minister,  the  former minister of finance, do in that situation?  He wrote off over $600,000.  Why would he write off the privacy commissioner's tax debt? He was a well connected Liberal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure members can  see where this is going.  If one is a well connected Liberal, one gets special perks, special favours and hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has brought Parliament into the darkest days of political history. A black cloud is hanging over all parliamentarians because of what the present Liberal government has done.  It has of course tried  to portray itself as a new government but  half of the cabinet  are the same Liberal people. We are not seeing anything different.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to comment on  a few of the specifics in the budget, the first one being  health care.  I have always said that health care is one of the  most important issues  for my constituents.    We have  serious problems in health care: waiting lists are getting longer and  access to health care and finding a family doctor are becoming more difficult.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the government's claim that it put all this money back into health care, let us look at the facts.  The lineups are significantly longer today than they were when the Liberal government took power in 1993.  It takes longer and longer to get services. No new money went into health care.  The Liberals announced some old money that they had already put in, but they have not addressed these problems.  They do not look at the systemic problems of the health care system.  They do not bring in energy and new ideas. It is a huge problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to  quickly talk about education.  If a baby was born after 2003    and his or her parents make less than $35,000 a year,  the child will receive a  grant  in 18 years. What is being done for the students of today  with all this talk about education?  The government is telling students to borrow more, to go deeper into debt and  to crawl into that big  black hole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this budget that is helping Canadians.  The government has done nothing to address the sponsorship program.  It is all smoke and mirrors. There will be nothing there to bring accountability back to the government and it wants us to trust it.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next two months, on his campaign trail, we will hear the Prime Minister talk about his  new Liberal government but it is nothing but a facade. It is the same old, tired government that has brought the   darkest black   cloud over this Parliament in Canadian political history. The  Liberals need to be sent a clear message that they need to go. It is time for a new government in this country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague was getting to the nub of the issue, and that is trust. I wonder if he could comment on the matter of trust. Should Canadians trust the current Liberals  to put the financial house in order when they are the ones who basically led us into scandal and mismanagement over these last 10 years?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-869548"></A><a HREF="#Int-869551"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-869545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Lunn: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, when I was asked by a reporter last week what the election would  be about,   I said that it would be about ethics and trust.   Trust is something that is earned. We do not have a right to it. It is something we have to earn from the Canadian people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is not just about the sponsorship program. The sponsorship program  was just the latest culmination of scandal after scandal, of lining their own pockets, getting deeper and deeper with more blatant disregard for the Canadian taxpayer. We had Shawinigate,   HRDC and  the $2 billion gun registry in the Department of Justice. Someone mentioned $750 million   on the cancellation of the helicopter contracts. We have  the office of the Governor General with a budget of $10 million or $11 million and having spent $41 million. This  is a total disregard for the Canadian taxpayer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are now asking us to trust them after we have seen the darkest and  worst political scandal in Canadian political history. The severity of this scandal cannot be underestimated. When money is stolen, although we do not know exactly who stole it,   political masters must be giving  the signals and directions. The Prime Minister said that he did not know and  yet his own  policy advisers were writing him letters. We have had government staff come forward saying that this stuff goes  as far back as 1999 and asking us to do something. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been going on  is criminal.  Silence is consent. By his refusal to act and  his wilful blindness, he is as guilty as the person who stole the money. We teach our children to know who  their friends are and if their friends are criminals and   committing criminal acts our children know that if they  are with them  they are guilty too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same analogy can hold true here for the current cabinet and Prime Minister. Half the cabinet is the same. They were sitting in those cabinet meetings. We know there had to be political direction. It is time  to get rid of this   most scandal ridden government in Canadian political history. Canadian taxpayers deserve better. They deserve an ethical, honest, open government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the current Prime Minister to say that his government is a new government, I would suggest, is dishonest. There is nothing new about this government. We have seen exactly what is going on. He is desperate to go to the polls. In fact, we heard today that he is advising all the government members to get their pictures taken and get ready to go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that he should  bring it on. If this budget is the best vision he has for this country and if the Liberals can ask Canadians to trust them after the  recent scandal, then  we are ready to go on this side. I believe Canadians deserve better. I believe that after  examining the record of the current Prime Minister and the Liberal government for the last 10 years, Canadians will be looking for a new government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party of Canada will rise to the challenge. The current Leader of the Opposition has ethics second to nobody. He is one of the most honest, hardworking parliamentarians in the House and he will make an incredibly awesome prime minister.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to my colleague's comments.   I do  not want to revisit the areas but I do want to make reference  to his last comment about the government members having their pictures taken.    If I were a member of the governing party, the last thing I would want flashing around the country right now would be my picture.  I know  the hon. member over there agrees with me  and, I believe, rightly so.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I will now  concentrate on the budget.  I want to  look at what was not in the budget rather than at what was.  What was not there is having a  negative effect on a number of our provinces.  At least four of our provinces today, as we speak in fact, are bringing down or have just brought down   budgets.  All of them are having major problems trying to balance their budgets.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balancing the budget is something we always talk about. It seems that it is something we must do.   Even though that is a major concern for the government, for the finance minister, there is something much more important in relation to that.  We need to know what we have  do   to our people in order to balance the budget.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about what is happening in  the Atlantic provinces in particular  because I am more familiar with what is happening in those provinces  than I am with what is happening in  Quebec, in Ontario or in some other provinces.  The costs of our social services,   health care and education take up a huge percentage of our budget.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the major expenditure in our budget would be the cost of health care, followed closely by education and followed closely, unfortunately, as is the case in many provinces, with the payment on debt charges.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As health care costs escalate and  our population becomes older, more   demands are being put on the health care system.  That is true right across the country.  A few years ago   the federal government paid  close to 50% of the cost of health care.  Now its share is  down around 16%, which means the burden is on the provinces  to handle this tremendous debt load.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because  of the way the Atlantic provinces  have been treated by the central government, because of the neglect of our resources, because of the mismanagement of the fisheries, because of the lack of consideration in   relation to the development of our offshore resources, our hydro power and our minerals, we see young people leaving  our province in droves.  Over the last 10 years,   50,000 young people, or 10% of our population, have left the province.  These were   people of child bearing age, people who   will produce our future.  They were the wage earners.  What is left is a significantly older population than anywhere else, which means increased health care costs.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have said this a number of times  but I learned a long time ago here that in order for people to help they must understand and in order for them to understand it seems they must  hear it over and over again.   When a province has  fewer people than in the past, and when the money that is handed out  is based on a per capita, that  means   fewer dollars.  When our younger people leave, leaving behind the older people, it means there are greater demands on those fewer dollars.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the geography over which we have to deliver health care, then we can visualize how difficult it is to provide even the essential services to people in a province such as Newfoundland and Labrador.  However, all the provinces across the country are having problems, but specifically because of these reasons my  own province is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we look at education.  This is where the word vision is missing in the budget.  Where is the vision?  We have a reactionary budget throwing a few dollars out for two reasons.   Because of severe problems some money must be thrown at it.  The government was embarrassed, forced, to provide money for farmers in the west, long after they should have done it, putting the farmers and their families through all kinds of hardships because of the government's procrastination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government finally threw $2 billion into health care after three years of promising to do so.  Now the Prime Minister, with no relationship at all to what was presented in the budget, says that there will be more money.  Undoubtedly, that is after the election.  He is sending the message that if he is re-elected, he will ensure the money is there.  This is bribery, which is what we usually see from that side.  We get bribes and reaction but absolutely no vision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk vision, let me speak about education.   The greatest expense across the board is health care.  If we analyze health care costs, we will find many of the costs are because people cannot or do not look after themselves.  They cannot afford to or they do not know how to.  A lot of that has to do with the education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people avail  of health care services, whether it be mental health, physical health, emotional and I can go on, as a result of them not being active in the workforce.  This puts all kinds of different strains on them, again physically, financially, mentally, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at our justice system and we analyze who avails of the justice system in relation to who are the ones causing us to spend money on the justice system, again many of them are people who, because of no fault of their own perhaps are in trouble, or are on drugs, or commit crimes, do not fit into society as they should.  On many occasions we can tie this into a lack of education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the environment and we see those who are not properly caring for it, again we will find it is a lack of education or understanding of how important the environment is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  could go on and on, however I only have two minutes. However, we have the future of the country in front of us.  We have young people, the pages in this House, who over the years will contribute so much to the country.  They are being educated.  I am not sure whether this is an education in here, but hopefully they are learning a lot.  However, they are being educated at universities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then will become contributing members in our society.  They will be young and educated for the rest of their lives.  They will work and pay taxes.  They will feel good about it because they are contributing and helping others.  They will also spend every cent they make buying things which create work for someone else. If they are not educated, they do not contribute.  Instead of contributing to the country, they take out more through social costs, health care costs, welfare costs, housing costs, justice costs, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little vision, a little investment upfront pays dividends down the road.  Many more things have been left out of the budget.  We will have a chance to talk about them at another time.  We must start looking ahead.  We must invest where we get return.  We cannot only react by throwing money at problems.  We will have fewer dollars coming in, more dollars going out, and that puts us exactly where we are today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's remarks.  I particularly appreciated the way he focused on the budget and his views of it, unlike his colleague who spoke previously, where I really did not hear the budget mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he knows that I share his views about education.  I was very pleased about the way he elaborated on how education affects all of our society. For example, the evidence shows that the better educated people are, the more healthy they are. The evidence shows that even if we could set up a perfect health system now, we can only maintain it by educating our people to make it sustainable over a period of time. He knows these things, and he gave some examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I heard him say that the federal government only provides 16% of the funding for health care.  I could not help but notice this.    On page 94 of the budget document, referring to the year 2003-04, it points out that the federal government transfers $14 billion to the provinces for health care. In tax transfers it provides another $10 billion for health care. Through the equalization payments, it is estimated that $3 billion is used by the provinces for health care.  Direct federal spending and tax measures worth $6 billion of support for  first nations health, Inuit and veterans' health, employment insurance health, health protection and public health featured very large in the budget. Therefore, federal expenditures for health are approximately $34 billion, or 40% of the $85 billion spent by governments on publicly funded health care in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my colleague address the difference between his 16% and the 40% which is in the budget.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-869628"></A><a HREF="#Int-869641"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-869614"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first,  let me refer to his earlier comments about investing in our youth, investing in our country, and the dividends that are paid on the far end of something like that.   He is dead-on when he says that an educated population is a healthy one, a contributing one and a productive one.  However, I want to raise one little point, and maybe he will help lobby for this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the people who are not educated, it is not because they do not have the ability; it is because they do not have the money. We can talk about student loans.  In the budget we saw  the government say to young people that they could borrow more. They do not want to borrow more. They have too much of a debt load already. What they want is some adjustment, particularly for those who have extra costs. Tuition is one thing. Board, lodging, food, and travel are all expenses that more than double the cost of education, way more than tuition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we can ensure that children of poor families, scattered throughout the country, in rural areas in particular where they have to travel in to the university towns, can afford to be educated, they never will be. That is a big challenge for all of us, not a difficult one but one that we must meet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the figures, I have the word of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, through the budget, that the government pays 40%, and I have the word of 10 premiers plus the territorial leaders that say it pays 16%. I will let members make the choice as to who is right.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Ahuntsic.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pick up where my colleague left off, on the matter of education.  I use education in a very broad sense, in a sense of lifelong learning.   As he knows, because he has great experience at the provincial level  and I have some, we normally think of education as largely a provincial responsibility, particularly in the early years but right through, and it certainly is.  I would not want the federal government running elementary schools, high schools or even colleges and universities more than it already does.  However, as he knows, the federal government in some ways still does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People do not often realize the extent to which the federal government is involved in education.  While I have been in this place, one of my efforts has been to focus and co-ordinate more the federal government's efforts in education in the broader sense of lifelong earning, without impinging on provincial jurisdiction, so we can work as effectively as we can.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in recent years the government has done a great deal in those areas, Some provinces have responded positively to federal programs  and others have not.  By that I mean sometimes when we have increased funding for a certain area of  higher education, some provinces have responded by helping students from all income levels to engage in that higher education.  However, other provinces have responded by raising tuition fees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast  I would give would be between the province of Quebec and the province of Ontario.  The province of Quebec has moved to two free CEGEP college years while the province of Ontario has moved to eliminate free grade 13 and has raised tuition to the second highest level in the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget document really is a remarkable thing.  Around this time of year I really wish I was an accountant so I could read these tables to get from them the way the government operates and the emphasis that exists in government.  They are all summarized in facts, figures and diagrams in an extraordinary volume.  The federal system is truly remarkable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of learning, training, education or whatever we call it, it is very interesting.  There is a table on page 112, which I find is quite good. I have often tried to say that the federal government does not want to have a department of education and impinge on provincial jurisdiction, but it takes a great interest in lifelong learning.  The table gives examples of federal government programs at different stages of life, for example, childhood, primary and secondary education years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed in recent years a prenatal program, with an early postnatal program and early childhood education.  In those years we provide the Canada child tax benefit and the national child benefit to low and middle income families to help them give their children as good a start as is possible.  Again, sometimes these are responded to well in the provinces, sometimes less so.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those same years, we have the early childhood development and early learning and child care agreements with the provinces.  We provide funds for child care, and a considerable number of spaces for child care.  Again, they are dealt with, and it is the province's entitlement, in   different ways in different provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get to the post-secondary years.  Bear in mind post-secondary education is still traditionally and should be  an area of provincial jurisdiction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget the federal government has introduced a Canada learning bond, which I hope to speak to in a moment.  It has introduced first year grants, which will really fit in with what my colleague opposite was saying.  Also, it has introduced upfront Canada study grants for students with disabilities.  We have had now for many years the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, which will eventually provide scholarships for about a million students, with student loans of around $3,000.  This is straight from the federal government to students in every province and territory.  Also, for a number of years we have provided Canada study grants.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned the Canada student loans program, which is  powerful support for students in the country. He is right, there has been an overdependence on loans in recent years and as provinces have raised tuition fees, students have been required to borrow more. Even if the loan program is generous, which the Canada student loans program is, it still leaves them with a burden of debt. Nevertheless, for many years that has been  very important base funding for post-secondary students in Canada, and it is a federal program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the Canada education study grants, which are added to RESPs. When a family purchases an RESP and takes the benefit of the tax shelter the RESP provides, the federal government provides grants for each child in proportion to the amount that is put into the RESP. A family can build up moneys over the years as the child is growing up  for the post-secondary years. That has been very well received and was strengthened in the budget. Also, we provide tuition and education tax credits. All of those are in the post-secondary years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a student gets to the post-graduate level, which is   early adulthood and early  workplace experience, we provide interest relief that continues through from the year of the Canada student loan. There are  debt reduction provisions for students who encounter financial hardship.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get  to  later adulthood. We support adult learning, for example, training under EI programs and  support for the sector councils, which encourage the trades and things of that type. We support literacy programs, including  literacy programs for seniors. All the way through the lifelong learning cycle, there is federal government involvement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years we have allowed people to  use  RRSP funds to self-fund lifelong learning.  People who are  in middle life and  need to be retrained and  who  have some RRSPs,  can now take the money out of their RRSPs and apply it   to any appropriate training that they care to engage in and retain the tax benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ties in with what my colleague was saying. The federal government in recent years has strengthened its role in lifelong learning and training. I would agree with him that it should be more coordinated and it is an appropriate area for the federal government to work in. I also agree with him that the moves in the budget toward grants instead of loans, toward focusing on low income students, are very important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time remaining, because of some of the criticism I have heard from the other side, I would like to stress the changes that have occurred. I particularly appreciate the Canada learning bond, which provides money from birth for children in low income families. Also, there is  the increase in the Canada education savings grant which I mentioned, which is a grant, not a loan, and which is associated with the RESPs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly delighted that with respect  to the early childhood development, the budget proposes to accelerate the implementation of the framework on early learning and childcare by providing an extra $75 million in 2004 and $75 million in 2005 and 2006. The total federal commitment for learning and child care will be $375 million in the next two years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I truly believe that of all the lifelong learning span that I have described, the most important years are the early years.  I commend the federal government for what it is doing in early childhood education and I urge it to do more.</p>

Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development (Social Economy), Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to speak today about the importance of the social economy, which was recognized in the throne speech and confirmed in the budget of March 23.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development with special emphasis on the social economy, I am pleased that my responsibilities focus on engaging communities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector in community development and  the social economy.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social economy is a concept rooted in the long-standing tradition of community living, a road often taken but rarely celebrated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, there has been recent interest in new forms of social entrepreneurship, particularly with regard to the activities of enterprises with a social agenda. They are managed as companies and produce goods and services for the market economy. However, they manage operations and reinvest all profits in social and community objectives.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the budget speech stated, the social economy is too often overlooked and underappreciated. With the attention social economy has received in the Speech from the Throne and what we plan to achieve through the support provided by the budget, we hope to make the term “social economy” part of the everyday vocabulary.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities are the foundation of economic competition and social well-being in Canada.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is committed to help urban and rural communities find local solutions to local challenges.  A key part of this commitment is supporting the growth of the social economy, that is, community based enterprises that pursue economic activities for the social good. We need to support those engaged in this entrepreneurial social movement by increasing their access to resources and tools.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has extended the scope of programs currently available to small and medium businesses so as to include social enterprises.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, budget 2004  provides new funding to strengthen support in the three priority areas: capacity building, financing, and research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is committed to provide funding of $162 million over five years as follows:  $100 million in support of financing initiatives that will increase lending to social economy enterprises; $17 million for a pilot program for strategic planning and capacity building of community economic development organizations; and $15 million in the next five years to the Social Sciences and Humanity Research Council in support of community based research on the social economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote two of the comments that came from national organizations that have dealt with the social economy a lot longer than this government has dealt with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on behalf of  CCEDNet, executive director Rupert Downing said: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the collaborative, coordinated approach announced in the budget, the Government of Canada will work in partnership with communities, stakeholders and other levels of government to strengthen Canada's social economy.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December 12, 2003, when the Prime Minister assigned me responsibility for the social economy, I have been meeting with companies and groups such as  Chantier de l'économie sociale in Quebec, which I quoted earlier, and CCEDNet in British Columbia, whose executive director, Mr. Downing, I quoted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we will not be starting from scratch. In Canada there is  rich tradition of social economy that includes cooperatives, credit unions, community economic development agencies and not for profit agencies. We also have new types of social enterprises that start up regularly across the country and in every sector of the economy.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often an example is better than a definition.  The Neighbourhood Dollar Store in Halifax, affiliated with the Nova Scotia Hospital, employs and coaches people with disabilities to enter the mainstream labour market, while at the same time selling affordable goods to local residents.  When I was in Halifax I had the honour to visit that store  with the stakeholders. Such initiatives play a vital role by providing a range of benefits to the community.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social enterprises have shown that they can help communities create jobs, particularly for members of vulnerable groups. They can help in skills development by investing in basic skills and employment skills that broaden learning and job perspectives. They offer social support by providing free or subsidized services to members of the community. They foster economic growth and neighbourhood revitalization by making products and services available that would not be otherwise and they stimulate growth and private investment in neglected areas. They help the social cohesion and mobilization of citizens by creating self-sustaining models for community agencies.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may be surprised to learn  that  Cirque du Soleil began as a social enterprise in terms of community development. Today it  is an international organization that uses part of its profits to do community development.  That is one of the best examples I could  use in terms of citizen engagement, social cohesion and putting  profits from social enterprise back into community development and job creation.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has always recognized and supported social economy stakeholders, namely the NGOs and the community sectors, community economic development agencies, cooperatives and the volunteer sector.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provinces and territories  have been actively engaged in supporting the social economy.  Social entrepreneurship is active and growing in all parts of Canada, in all sectors, ranging from health and social services,  to environmental stewardship,  to natural resource based industries, to manufacturing and retail.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enterprises represent billions of dollars in economic activity every year in Canada. I am proud to be able to say that my province, Quebec, has played a leading role in coordinating efforts focussed on the social economy in Canada, thanks to its 10,000 collective businesses and community organizations employing more than 100,000 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example of the social economy in action, this one taken from my own riding of Ahuntsic in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people struggling with personal, professional or social problems, the difference between success and failure is often linked to skills acquisition. The Atelier de meubles recyclés d'Ahuntsic-Cartierville is a registered charity and a social economy business that gives on-the-job experience in a real business to people at risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workshop, which provides training in cabinet making and woodworking to young people at risk and the disadvantaged, specializes  in the manufacture of new furniture and in the  recycling, restoration and refurbishing of used furniture, which it then sells at two retail outlets, one for the general public and one at more affordable prices for the  disadvantaged in the community. The workshop also tries to match its qualified employees with employers seeking workers.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of the social economy abound from coast to coast to coast.  With the support of our latest budget and by working together with all the stakeholders, we can strengthen Canada's civic foundation and help to generate economic and social benefits for all. The result can be a more vibrant and sustainable society for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity to work in an area which I have learned to appreciate. I want to thank  the stakeholders who have given over the last 20 to 25 years in terms of helping the communities. I want to thank my constituents once more for giving me the confidence in order to be able to speak in the House.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the comments of my friend across the way.  I am having a problem with the definition.  I am not sure  what she means by social economy.  I understand the intent of some of the objectives that she discussed but I think that if there is  an intent,  there should be some measure.  If the object is to provide educational services, the results should be measured to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are well spent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member made reference time and again to this notion of social economy. I simply do not understand what she means by it.  I wonder if she could define that term.  It seems that she has been given a particular responsibility  for that area in government.   I wonder if she could  define her job description and give us some indication of the budget that goes with it, if any.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-869832"></A><a HREF="#Int-869840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-869813"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Eleni Bakopanos: </b>

	If the hon. member had been listening, Mr. Speaker, I  spoke about the budget and the way the budget is divided.  It is $162 million,  the breakdown of which is in the budget.  I spoke about it in my speech.  If the hon. member had been  listening intently, he would have understood.  I also gave examples of social entrepreneurship from one end of the country to the other. I will repeat the examples that I used.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examples were the Cirque du Soleil and the furniture recycling workshop  in my riding.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is co-op housing, also part of social entrepreneurship, but the best definition was given to me by someone whom I consider an expert in this area, in my definition, and that is Professor Greg MacLeod, from Halifax.  He calls social entrepreneurship “community-based businesses”.  And they are businesses.  That is why $162 million was given to Industry Canada: because the economic and social economy is part of what we are trying to do as a government.  We are trying to create jobs.  We are trying to create jobs, but in a new way, in a new fashion, using a partnership of the private sector and the public sector, meaning the three levels of government,  and non-governmental agencies.  We want to engage Canadian citizens who want to improve their community in various aspects by getting involved in the social entrepreneurship movement.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was delighted by the member's focus on the social economy.  I had no difficulty understanding what she was talking about. On this social entrepreneurship, the way our society has developed has at last come together in a way such that it can be dealt with in a policy fashion.  I think these community based businesses are a good way of doing it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding there is a group called COIN, which is a network.  They train.  For example, they train people to fix computers and then sell the used computers.  They train people to use computers.  They set up community access sites for the Internet and put our libraries and our townships on the Internet and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing is that this is business, community business, but while it is being done it is fulfilling a social need. I would be grateful if the member would comment further on this.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-869858"></A><a HREF="#Int-869875"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-869840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Eleni Bakopanos: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I was referring to when I used some examples.  The member has an example in his riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that every single member of Parliament has an example in his or her own riding although they may not know it. That was the idea when the Prime Minister gave me the mandate as parliamentary secretary with the special emphasis on social economy, which is a horizontal role, by the way, and does not belong to one ministry.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what we want to do.  We want to promote the community based businesses across the country.  We want to create social cohesion by allowing people to improve their own situation by creating jobs for themselves or for other disadvantaged groups in society and, through that process, also leaving us with a better community.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as always, it is a pleasure to speak to an important issue like the budget.  The way I have sliced it up today, I would like to talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.  I think that covers the speech in its entirety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some good things.  I have put out a press release mentioning what I thought were some good things in the budget.  It was a very short press release.  It did not take me a lot of time.   I did not waste a lot of ink, but there were a couple of things that I thought were good in their intention.  We will have to see if  they are going to turn out in the long run, but let us say that at first blush there are some good ideas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some tax relief for military personnel overseas.  Pretty well everyone thought that was a good idea, although the caveat is that it applies only to those who are in Afghanistan and Haiti.  Such tax relief was not extended to the folks in Bosnia, for example, with whom I spent a week last fall and who were quick to point out that there have been 25 guys killed in Bosnia.  So I do not know how many guys have to get killed before it can be called dangerous.  They pointed out and rightfully so, I think, that if tax relief is good for military personnel it is good for everyone, but in this case it is an extra appreciation for the stress and time away from family and so on for military personnel.  Perhaps it should be extended to those who are overseas for extended periods of time; I am talking about the whole works, not just those in selected theatres.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an independent centre for first nations governance was a small thing, but it does seem to me that if we are going ask aboriginal people to take on more of their own governance issues, establishing a centre for training administrators and personnel and so on is a good idea. Again, though, it is one of those things.  It is a good idea and it is proper, but whether this government is the one to teach them good governance is quite questionable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure on exactly who is going to put together the formula on this and who the government is going to call;  I assume that it is  not going to appoint an ex-cabinet minister to set this thing up.   If it is truly independent and truly about good governance, then it is a step in the right direction and I would like to support it.  I think it may be a good idea and that is why I put it in the “good” category.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally there is the idea of the education bonds for the future. Education is a very important item for all families, for all Canadians and  for our nation.  I want to believe that this is a good idea.  It is of course for 16 or 18 years down the road; that is when we really benefit from those kind of bonds.  It is hard to be against that.  It is nice to be able to believe or hope that 10, 15 or 20 years from now this will actually help the people it is intended to help. However,  like so many promises, we are not sure if these good concepts are actually going to flesh themselves out and be good in the long run.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a longer list of things that I put under the “bad”, just before I get to the ugly stuff.  The bad stuff is of course no general tax relief.  There is this misconception on the Liberal side that tax relief is passé, that people are content with their level of taxation, that what they see in their lives is good enough and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what I am hearing.  I hear from business folks, homeowners, young entrepreneurs and people who are starting out.  They are saying the idea that the government is giving them all the tax relief they are ever going to get is not just good enough.  They feel overtaxed.  They are sure they can handle their money better than the government can and that if it were left in their pockets it would be more productive than a dollar sent to Ottawa to be circled around amongst friends and given back in programs they have never asked for in a region of the country they have never seen before. They are quite sure about that and  I agree with them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no significant reduction in EI premiums. Again,   I do not know how many times the EI auditor has to say that the surplus is too large, the government is using it as a revenue producing tool, it is not right and  it is an inappropriate use of the taxation system. EI should be helping people with their employment issues.  It should not be used as a general revenue scheme for the federal government.  It is an abuse of the system.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to raise revenue it should be up front about it.  It should not go through the back door and make employers and employees pay through the nose in high EI premiums, and for the foreseeable future because there is no plan to reduce them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no broad based educational help. I put this under the bad side because I really do think education has to be a priority. I would just point out that these are the kinds of things the government has promised students over the last few budgets since 1999. Every year we get a budget where students say, “Hooray, finally some money”. However, here is what has happened. Since 1998, the government promised to help 12,000 graduates per year but has been helping a total of 2,000. It promised to spend $100 million annually on grants for needy students but has fallen short of that by 50%. It promised interest relief to student loan holders but none of the targets in that department have been met. Last year's average student debt was $21,000 and recipients received an average subsidy of $509 in interest relief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to make education a priority, there is no use building the whole program around the idea of a $500 bond for needy children that they can cash 18 years from now when they go to university. That is not going to help the students of today pay for their student debt or handle their student debt problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last under the bad column, although I hate to call any tax reduction bad, is this $1 reduction in the aviation tax for every domestic flight. Is it somehow going to just charge up the industry and bring this nation closer together because when we fly from Vancouver to Toronto the taxes are going to be reduced by $1? That ought to spark the airline industry. That ought to bring Air Canada out of the doldrums.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the kind of thing that is almost like the national dream, when we think of it. Let us just think about it: every Canadian can save $1 on a trans-Canada flight. It just makes me want to get on an airplane right now and go back to Chilliwack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just a farce to reduce the taxes by $1. Jeepers, I feel good about that. I am sure the airline industry just feels motivated to get up this morning and, as we used to say in the logging business, “Give 'r s'noose”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, here are some ugly things from the budget. There is an overall budget increase of 7.6%. I do not know what it is with Liberal finance ministers. The current Prime Minister and previous finance ministers were in the same bailiwick in that they increased spending by over 40% over the last seven years. The projected increase is 12.7% over the next two years. They have never yet met their targets on spending. They always overspend. We are looking at 7.6% this year, with  probably a 7.5% to 8% spending increase next year, and 8% the next year following that.  We can just count on it, folks: under the Liberals we are going to get an 8% increase in spending every year. This is while the economy over the last 10 years has gone through unprecedented growth worldwide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it with these guys that they cannot understand we have to hold the line on spending before we have hopes of managing money well, offering long term tax relief, and letting Canadian businesses compete in a global economy? We cannot keep spending 8% more per year and think we are going to get ourselves out of the debt hole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, speaking of debt, there is no legislated debt repayment plan, something whereby we can count on, every year, paying down a certain portion of the debt. There is no capital tax elimination. Let us get rid of that tax altogether.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another $270 million in venture capital that they want to throw into the mix. It sounds good, of course, as more venture capital is great for our country, but it is a government directed thing and we have no details on how that is going to be handled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an ugly thing to believe that the government is going to be able to direct $270 million. Actually, that $270 million is almost familiar when I think of it. The last time the Liberals got their hands on $270 million, $100 million of it went right to Liberal-friendly firms for work that was never done. So as for another $270 million, maybe it will be spent well but I do not believe it. I am from Missouri, the show me state, and I have not seen from these Liberals anything that has shown me they understand the budgetary priorities of Canadians from coast to coast. They certainly do not understand my riding. They do not understand the priorities of people back in Chilliwack and Fraser Canyon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to bringing forward a budget--and  within the next year, I hope--with a new government and with new priorities that reflect the priorities of Canadians from coast to coast.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to my friend with great interest. I also listened to his leader, who in his speech said that this new party is the party from Sir John A. Macdonald to Brian Mulroney. Let us just examine that. When Brian Mulroney left office, he left a country that was on the verge of bankruptcy. This country had an annual deficit of $42 billion. Does the member wants to talk about ugly? That was real ugly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government brought in seven consecutive balanced budgets. I am wondering if my friend across the way calls seven consecutive balanced budgets ugly or good or beautiful. I call them beautiful. Ugly is the government of Brian Mulroney, a $42 billion deficit, and the leader of that party saying it is the party of Brian Mulroney.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is not hard to balance the budget when money is gouged out of the health care system that goes to the provinces.  It is not hard to balance the budget when advanced education transfers  and Canada health and social transfers are slashed.  It is not hard to gouge extra billions of dollars out of projected military spending and give at least some of it to Liberal friends. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to balance the budget if Liberal priorities are wrong and taxation continues. In this case, spending is going up 7.6% again next year and 12.7% is projected--we know it will be more than that--over the next two years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals happened to hit the 10 years of the longest sustained period of economic growth in the world--and this is no credit to the Liberals, this is a worldwide phenomena--in the last century.  They happened to take government just when that long period of economic growth took place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy the budget is balanced; however,  I am not particularly pleased with how they have done it.  I believe that they could have had a good budget if they thought about the basics they needed to put in place in order to have long term, sustainable growth through the ups and downs and vagaries of international politics and terrorism, and whatever it might be.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not done by increasing the spending by the amount they are doing without also giving  some long term tax relief to businesses, individuals, homemakers and others who are trying to do their part to get the economy going and to make it sustainable in the long run.  That is part and parcel of doing it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not done by devising programs that are subject to every kind of government waste and that road to hell of good intentions, and expect that we are going to get the economy rolling in the long term.  That is not good.  Balancing it on the backs of the health care system was not a good idea either.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that we are going into the fifth year of a $100 billion tax cut. By next year, the year that we are facing in this budget, family tax will be lowered 21%.  For families with children, tax will be lowered by 27%.  A family with two children earning around $40,000 will pay no federal tax at all, so the personal side has been cut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he is concerned about business taxes.  The R and D tax environment in Canada is now equal or better than in the United States.  We are going to the fifth year  of tax cuts.  How is it that he can say there were no tax cuts in this budget?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will give the chairman of the procedure  and House affairs committee a personal example.  I am, as he knows, the vice-chairman of the very same committee that he is chairman.  I found out when I was elected there that I actually get a stipend for being the vice-chairman of this committee.  I receive $367 a month to be a vice-chairman of the committee.  I got my first cheque  in the mail.  It was delivered to my office the other day.  It was $367 gross.  My take home pay was $165.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jim Karygiannis:</b> You are lucky.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</b> It was $165 and I am not complaining.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just pointing out that when more than 50% of people's cheques goes for taxes, is it any wonder people say it is pretty hard to be motivated to expand their businesses, to take a risk, to step out and risk their venture capital when, even if they make it, they are paying 50% of the money in taxes?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that some of the taxes, like a tax on capital, for example, is such a bad and regressive tax that I do not know why the government did not address that up front.  Eliminate it and allow people to invest.  I am not against writing off computers at a faster rate. I am happy about that and  I will give the member that, but this other stuff is regressive. It continues year in and year out, and never changes for businesses trying to get ahead.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in response to the budget speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the bottom line for me is that  program spending jumps over 7.5% from last year to a record of over $143 billion.  It jumps another 12.7% in the next two years, up another $41 billion over the last seven years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing a distinct lack of fiscal discipline coming from the government.  We have an EI surplus continuing to feed general revenues.  That EI surplus will swell by another $4.3 billion in the next year.  We will end up with over $48 billion EI surplus and no premium relief in sight for workers or for employers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other major observations on the budget relate to the fact that there is essentially nothing in the budget for non-urban Canada. The budget not only snubs non-urban Canada, it snubs our Department of National Defence and many of our workers who work in that area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already talked about the EI surplus and how that is continuing to be abused.  There is a premium freeze in place and no relief in sight.  The premiums being collected are much higher than what is required to sustain the program.  Therefore, our workers are paying much more than they need to in order to keep the government afloat in terms of the kind of revenues that it is now used to spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are not getting the level of service from their federal government that is appropriate for the level of taxation that is being dedicated to the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw a small amount of relief on the student front. We saw some government moneys dedicated to a learning bond, which is a longer term savings program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we did not see is what the priority should be for students and that is a focus on reducing tuition and increasing the ability to access the student loan program.  The combination of those two things would do exactly what is right. It would give immediate relief to students so they can carry on with their studies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no delivery on the fuel tax rebate that the Prime Minister has been touting.  It will not take very long before our municipal politicians will become quite cynical. They are not used to the kind of treatment that the government has meted out to the provinces and is now planning on meting out to the mayors and councils at the municipal level.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will play favourites.  We already have a great deal of suspicion that the so-called cities agenda will completely leave out all the smaller communities, the smaller towns, the larger towns and the smaller cities. The so-called cities agenda of the government is going to translate into many municipalities and other municipal levels of government completely left off the agenda.  That is certainly where all the signposts are headed right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had some discussion about the lack of tax relief in the budget. The only people who think there was tax relief in the budget are sitting on the other side of the House. They are on the government side. That is a quick snap when we look at the budget.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to look at the budget in a little more depth and where we sit in non-urban Canada in terms of this budget. For example, in my part of the world, British Columbia is the major softwood producer in the nation with approximately 50% of softwood contribution. We had a government softwood package announced 18 months ago or longer.  As of a month ago we had zero dollar delivery in the Province of British Columbia, whereas we have seen that there has been program delivery on a fairly steady basis, for example, in the Province of Quebec because the government was playing politics. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals thought that the best way to play politics in the Province of Quebec was to continue to make announcements month by month and they thought the best way to play politics with the softwood funding in the Province of British Columbia was to throw it all into the hopper just before the election. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that between that strategy and the fact that this whole exercise was put into the domain of western economic diversification instead of HRDC, that we then had to go out and hire a whole bunch of new people to run this program. Then we had a series of turf wars as a consequence of that within the bureaucracy. We have had second guessing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had initiatives put into the government that were rejected by one level of the bureaucracy and overridden by another level.  These proposals have gone back and forth as many as three times that I am aware of. It is very frustrating at the community level. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we are marching ahead and we are almost at the government's fiscal year end. That also happens to be the provincial government's fiscal year end. This has complicated the whole equation because some of these are dependent on federal-provincial cooperation as well as private sector financing at times. This has become very problematical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frustrations at the rural community level with the softwood package are immense. We have other frustrations as well which are either budget related or government related. Rural  coastal British Columbia is so immensely impacted by the downturn in the forest sector, the fishing sector and other sectors.  I do not know how to be kind in trying to describe what has happened to rural coastal British Columbia compared to 10 years ago when this government came into power. What I do know is the one very strong light at the end of the tunnel is the proposal that west coast oil and gas be a natural development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That requires the political will from the federal arena and the provincial arena  to take us in that direction. The only strong political will that is coming from the government in terms of west coast oil and gas is coming from the Minister of the Environment and it is negative political will. It has put us at least 12 months behind where we should be in terms of that whole prospect. The government needs to get it and it  needs to get it soon.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time is winding down.  There are  other issues  I would like to speak to, but I will conclude by saying that 10 minutes is hardly enough time to point out the problems associated with the budget and the government's performance in the area that I represent.</p>

Jim Karygiannis (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, we have to be clear. The budget does not try to be all things to all people. It simply tries to be real things to real people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague said that we are not doing anything with the cities. He said  that  we are not promoting the cities agenda, that we are allowing transport in the cities to be crippled. This morning there was a joint $1 billion announcement by the city of Toronto, the province of Ontario and the Government of Canada. Mayor Miller, who in my vocabulary is a left-leaning mayor, sang nothing but praise for the initiative that the Prime Minister has taken. The Prime Minister has insight and vision. He has said that   we are here to deliver sustainable development, for the Toronto Transit Commission to start rebuilding to get back on its feet,  to move people, to get people away from using their cars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the hon. member have an opportunity to read the clippings today to see what the mayor said? How does that jibe with what the member is saying? He is saying that we forgot the mayors and the cities, yet the mayor of one of the major cities in Canada, if not the largest city, said that  we are doing good things. Is the member watching  a different TV station or reading different news from  what I am reading?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-870176"></A><a HREF="#Int-870191"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-870146"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is typical, coming from the government side. It is called divide and conquer. It is called be thankful for what we receive because we have been favoured by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government collects $7 billion in federal fuel taxes on an annual basis and gives back less than 10% of that into transportation infrastructure. The provinces spend 100% to 110%. The U.S. federal treasury spends 100%. The Canadian federal government sees fit to use those revenues for anything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the government  makes an announcement  that  it will spend a small part, and  $1 billion   is a lot of money, but it is still only one-seventh of what the government is collecting from our largest city, which represents approximately that percentage of the population. It is getting what it is due, but everybody else is not, so   I am not sure why I should be so excited about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government members are talking out of both sides of their mouths. It is time to deliver. Will the Liberals  continue to collect those fuel taxes or will they  turn them  back to the municipal levels of government, through the provinces, so that the money  can go back into infrastructure?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's announcement is typical of the federal government. It wants to keep its fingerprints all over the announcement rather than doing what is right and giving it to the level of government that can spend it efficiently.</p>

Jim Karygiannis (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to share my time with my colleague from Winnipeg South Centre. It is with great pleasure that I speak to the  budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nation as blessed as ours should always aim higher and reach farther.  Canada is in a position to launch a new decade of achievement.  We have begun the journey with our new government's first full budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget lays the foundation for a better future for all Canadians.  The government has some very specific goals to create an even greater country, one that will give more Canadians the opportunity to succeed, to enlarge their ambitions and to pursue their dreams.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear. This budget does not try to be all things to all people.  Rather, it puts real people, people just like us, at the heart of what we are trying to do. We have a responsibility to make sure that our children and grandchildren lead even better lives in an even better land.  This is a goal  we have set for ourselves.  A nation as great as ours should be able to reach it.  In this budget we are striving to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister came into office with three clear objectives: to strengthen Canada's social foundations;  to build a truly 21st century economy where there is  opportunity for all; and to restore Canada's place in the world as one of pride and influence. This budget puts us on the path toward these objectives, without throwing fiscal caution to the wind, without engaging in a pre-election spending spree, without playing fast and loose with the economic process Canadians have worked so hard to achieve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget makes important investments in such key areas as health care, communities and learning.  It institutes investment and reforms that will put our health system on a truly sustainable footing, to ensure that Canada's communities provide a quality of life second to none, and to put knowledge in the hands of all Canadians, no matter  the geography or   income, in order to put them on the road to individual progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2004 also comes with a financial responsibility.  This year marks Canada's seventh consecutive balanced budget, something that has not been achieved since Confederation.  We are balancing the books and better controlling government spending.  We are keeping our debt burden on a steady downward track, while strengthening financial management and operational integrity within the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in this plan is a new system through a new cabinet committee to examine on a regular ongoing basis expenditures in every government department.  The committee is setting stringent standards that every department will have to meet and is asking tough questions that every department will have to answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget highlights include $1.25 billion for research and innovation, including efforts to bring Canada's research discoveries to the marketplace.  This money, some $250 million of which will go to bring sustainable transportation innovation to the marketplace, is money well spent.  As well it  addresses an issue close to my heart.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the climate change plan for Canada, we are aiming to reduce transportation emissions by 21 megatonnes of Canada's total 240 megatonne reduction target.  It is an ambitious goal and to meet it we must take an imaginative approach.  That is exactly what we are doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is investing to increase the production and use of alternative fuels,  to increase vehicle fuel efficiency, to improve passenger transportation, and to improve the efficiency of freight transportation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Transport Canada's urban transportation showcase program, we are investing in some innovative ideas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from urban transportation.  These range from  hydrogen powered hybrid buses, to an Internet based ride matching service, to a bikeway and bike lockers. They are just  a few examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the motor vehicle fuel efficiency initiative we are encouraging manufacturers to introduce more fuel efficient vehicles in the Canadian market.  We have targeted a 25% improvement which we  hope that industry will comply  with on a voluntary basis.  By  2010 this could account for  one-quarter of the emissions reductions from all of the transport related measures that have been identified so far in the government's climate change plans. If a voluntary agreement with manufacturers is not achievable, the government has legislation on the books which it could enact in support of its goals.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other expenditures in the budget include $665 million in new money, plus $400 million transferred from Health Canada to improve Canada's readiness to deal with public health emergencies. There is   increased weekly student loan limits and the introduction of a new learning bond to help low income families save for post-secondary education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2004 includes $270 million for new investments in venture capital financing. There are further tax incentives for small business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another $250 million for Canada's peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan and the ongoing international efforts to prevent terrorism. There is  another $50 million for our peacekeeping participation in Haiti.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $650 million to address security priorities such as intelligence, border protection, marine and cyber security, and enhanced coordination of systems, information, threat assessments and emergency response. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an acceleration of infrastructure funding for municipalities. There is  $4 billion for cleaning up contaminated sites. There is  $15 million to help establish pilot union-based training centres to aid in developing workplace skills for  the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget also provides an additional $30 million for employment assistance programming for the disabled and new disability tax deductions to reduce barriers to education and employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides for  the appointment of professionally accredited comptrollers to sign off on all new spending initiatives in every government department. There is  the bolstering of the government's internal audit function. There is the establishment of an expenditure review committee which will, among other things, identify within four years savings of at least $3 billion annually for ongoing investments in the priorities of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extra cushion against unforeseen economic circumstances,  another $1 billion will  be added to our $3 billion contingency reserve fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in the budget is a commitment of $15 million over two years to start the Canada corps.  This new initiative is one that will enable young people to make a personal commitment to international aid and provide sustainable development for building nations.  It is my intention to hold community meetings in my riding to explore the direction that this new initiative will take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget makes the initial payments we can afford to make now.  In future budgets and   future years we will build on the steps taken today.  With optimism, pride and cooperation, all of us can succeed like never before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be part of this government that has yet again put forth a budget that balances the need for support of our social programs along with the fiscal responsibility that has been a keystone of this government's tenure.  This is a budget that I believe most thinking Canadians will see as a good budget and one that I would be happy to defend in any election that may come about in the future.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member opposite mentioned climate change during his speech.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that in the budget the government has committed to sell its Petro-Canada shares and   put the money into a foundation.  The Auditor General has criticized the foundations  very severely in the past because she has not been able to audit the foundations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member think this is a good idea? Does he not think we should be putting the money toward lowering taxes or debt reduction, or putting it into an area where the Auditor General can actually audit it?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like  him to comment further on the climate change plan.  The Minister of the Environment basically admitted yesterday that the government has spent upwards of $3 billion and  our emissions are going up.   The government signed the Kyoto accord in 1997 and ratified it last year.  The program has been a failure. About $3 billion has been spent and there is  another $1 billion in the budget and  our emissions are going up.    We are not addressing the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies are concerned about the Kyoto implementation.  They would like to know whether they will get credit for the action they took from 1997 to 2004 under the implementation plan.  The latest response I received from the Minister of Industry was that he did not know and that the government was still negotiating that.  We are now getting to the point where we have to meet our targets.  Does the member not agree that  the companies should get credit for the early action they took from 1997 on?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a few good points. I would like to advise him of a couple of things that I have done under my portfolio of responsibilities, and that is transportation with a special emphasis on the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time we have sat down with environmental groups.  For the first time we have sat down with car manufacturers.  We have asked them where they would like us to go.    Is it with incentives or new initiatives? We have asked them to tell us where they see  us coming along.  We sat down with them many times in the past, but for the first time we sat down and put the two things together: transportation and the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment groups have told us that they need initiatives, that they need us to think outside the box.  When we talked to the industry, they also told us that they needed initiatives and that they needed us to think outside the box.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One environmental group, the Sierra Club, asked why sales people were not given bonuses for promoting hybrid cars, for promoting fuel efficient cars.    If a salesman knows what he can sell, if a salesman knows what it is all about, he can lead clients to the right place and they can buy the right thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to think outside the box.  We need to move forward to ensure that the initiatives, which we talk about, are addressed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  it is a pleasure to speak in the budget debate. I rise as the member for Winnipeg South Centre, as a Manitoban and certainly as a westerner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1870 Manitoba became the first western province to join the Dominion of Canada.  Shortly thereafter, British Columbia joined Canada, thus establishing Canada as one unified link between two great oceans. The Canadian government has a long history of demonstrating its ambition and commitment to expand westward to develop and dynamic idea we call Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage you in a short history lesson.  Sir Clifford Sifton, once a member of the Manitoba legislative assembly, moved to Ottawa in 1896 where he served as minister of the interior and superintendent general of Indian affairs with the Liberal government, under the leadership of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a dedicated Manitoban in his youth, Mr. Sifton was a formidable advocate of western expansion, believing that political, social and economic involvement of the western provinces was central to the prosperity of Canada as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He envisioned a western Canada that was industrious and agrarian.  He established a vigorous immigration policy in which he claimed:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--a stalwart peasant in a sheepskin coat, born on the soil, whose forefathers had been farmers for ten generations, with a stout wife, and a half-dozen children, is good quality.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed but the spirit of Clifford Sifton survives.  Federal initiatives, including the building of a national transcontinental railway, the founding of the Northwest Mounted Police and the constitutional equality of western provinces have done much to join the many parts of Canada and create a cohesive whole with which Canadians are free to share and enjoy the multitude of cultures, values, traditions and customs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Canada has grown into a successful and continually flourishing region, in large part due to the early policies of the federal government.  Winnipeg, for example, experienced a major expansion as emerging railway passages allowed travel to, from and through the city during the late 19th century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many growing and dynamic cities, Winnipeg has faced many challenges and many cycles of development, and continues to do so.  However, as I have said in the House before, Winnipeg is once again on the cusp of a major revitalization and budget 2004 is integral in supporting this.  Federal policies continue to do much to make this happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is allowing municipalities to recover 100% of the GST as of February 1, 2004.  Western Canadian cities and municipalities will receive roughly $173.5 million within the first year alone.  This new deal will effectively increase the financial resources with which Canadian municipalities can address their infrastructure priorities and other pressing projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, individual Canadians will benefit from this rebate since more resources will be available for police, water, transit and other vital city services. Coupled with the many infrastructure initiatives previously announced and the five year acceleration of the $1 billion committed last year, there is a significant new beginning and a significant catalyst for change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the mayor of Winnipeg has commented that budget 2004 includes the kinds of things “we were looking for.”  He continued, “There was a significant payment on the new deal and a significant impact on the infrastructure coming out of this budget”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, cities, as major centres for social, civic and economic activity,  must function smoothly and accommodate the needs and priorities of their populations.  In my city, as in other western communities, the urban aboriginal strategy is a very important initiative. I was pleased to see a 100% increase in the budget for the strategy to $50 million.  It provides the necessary framework in which cities and aboriginal groups can work together to create adequate and sufficient conditions in which to live, work and study.  The urban aboriginal strategy in Winnipeg, for example, has devised new models of how governments and communities work together and within themselves to support housing, inner city schools and youth, employment and transitional services.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to addressing issues of growing communities and evolving municipalities, budget 2004 has made evident the Government of Canada's pledge to enhance the national health care system, both in terms of patient care and public health and medical science and research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Clifford Sifton likely could not imagine that, in addition to being known for its vast prairies, lush farms and rolling hills, western Canada,  notably Saskatchewan, would emerge as the birthplace of universal health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contribution to the Canadian identity and system of values is cherished and enhanced by the federal government.  Like Canadian municipalities, Canada's health care system must remain flexible and well stocked with appropriate funding that will cover the proverbial slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in matters concerning disease, sickness and medicine. The additional $2 billion for provinces and territories will mean an extra $598 million in health funding for western Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we note the Prime Minister's remarks in Winnipeg this past week when he said that there would be more money for health care, but that accomplishing our goals in health care would take transformational change, with an enduring plan and a sustainable solution.  Canadians want their tax dollars committed to a quality accessible health care system. In order to manage the new and growing stresses on our public health systems and to implement a national immunization strategy, western provinces will receive $119 million of the $400 million allocated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget transfers $400 million from Health Canada and allocates an additional $165 million over the two years to assist in creating the new public health agency.  The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is expected to be an integral part of this new agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the federal government recognizes its responsibility to contribute to medical research for the well-being of its own and the international communities, there also exists ongoing interest in supporting non-medical research in such fields as social sciences, the humanities, natural sciences and engineering.  As a result, funding for the three federal granting councils has increased, in which the four western provinces will receive nearly $340 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to mention that Winnipeg is very much the centre of activity for persons with disabilities.  The funding of $30 million to support employment assistance programming delivered by the provinces and territories is a most important first step and is celebrated very much across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manitoba is the home of many fine post-secondary institutions.  Not only do these institutions provide quality programming, they provide opportunity through access programs and special initiatives as well.  The budget will increase opportunities for young people in Manitoba and beyond: increased grants on RESPs; new grants for children in low income families; and skill development for employees in the workplace.  The aboriginal human resource strategy will make a difference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have often heard the quote by the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson as saying that the meaning of success is,  “to leave the world a little better; whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition”. Budget 2004 is not the end of the process.  It is the down payment on future activity.  This marks only the beginning of a long journey, not unlike the settlers who originally established their homes in western Canada, toward embracing and enhancing the Canadian identity.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have  a couple of comments. It was great to hear a  rather artistic portrayal of the early years in Canada's history but  I would like to bring my colleague a little closer to what is really happening with the budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned   the 100% increase in the urban aboriginal strategy,    from $25 million to $50 million, which certainly  was much needed. However  I wonder how much more could have been done for urban aboriginals, as well as other people throughout Canada, whether it was the need for affordable housing, had we also had the $100 million that was wasted in the scandal that took place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member to  put those two figures together, the  $100 million wasted in the  sponsorship scandal compared to praising themselves  for putting another $25 million into an urban aboriginal strategy. Something is wrong with the government's set of priorities and when Liberals feel they need to be cheerleaders for themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would  my colleague also comment on how   it is seen as an enhancement of the health care system when the federal government went  from providing  the provinces with 50% of the cost of  health care services    to providing 16% of   the cost of the services? Does the member,  yes or no,  support  for profit health service providers?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, no, I do not support for profit health service providers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased   my colleague acknowledged the importance of the urban aboriginal strategy. This is an issue that many of us have been working on and promoting for a very long period of time. It is very important that the three levels of government work together to bring congruency, to bring some coherence, to bring some policy initiatives that make sense to aboriginal people who move into the city and where the program dollars do not follow them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that she acknowledged that important initiative and I hope  she will be willing to work on it with me.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to address the House on the budget.  I will be  splitting my time with my colleague from Lanark—Carleton.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I could talk a lot about what is missing in the budget and the problems that the government has with credibility and integrity on the sponsorship program and moneys that were inappropriately spent, but I have a much higher priority right now, and that is the issue of the avian flu in my riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avian flu will cost individuals thousands and thousands of  dollars and thousands of jobs will be lost. I just came from the agricultural committee where I had  initiated a meeting on the avian flu. We have talked to a number of officials from the Canadian Farm Inspection Agency  but I am still not satisfied that we have addressed the problem. Therefore, if I were to say that  anything is missing out of the budget it would be  attention to that particular issue and, since it is not there, we must  find other ways to address the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   want to give Canadians some facts on the impact of the avian flu.  The poultry industry is in excess of a $1.5 billion industry in British Columbia. The current trade restrictions are costing the industry in excess of $15 million per week in lost revenue. Retailers, who have been traditional customers for the B.C. industry, are looking for alternate sources of supply which may require a long term commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the B.C. poultry industry has now created the potential liability, in excess of $30 million by the end of March, as it has placed product in freezers on the lower mainland that cannot be shipped outside of the control area. In addition to the lost revenue, the B.C. industry is now facing incremental costs of over $10 million for the month of April. That is $2.6 million per week in costs associated with the culling of 600,000 to 800,000 healthy birds and hatching eggs per week. It is $400,000 per week in carrying costs associated with product now in freezers. With the pending reduction in production, in excess of 1,000 jobs will be lost in the processing industry commencing next week as production levels are scaled back to 50% of traditional levels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many farmers will face significant financial hardship as owners will be unable to service the debt on their farms and equipment. This, to say the least, is an extremely serious issue in my riding  which depends a great deal on farm income, and it will be  hit hard by this. The people involved certainly deserve some concrete answers and some hope that this issue will be dealt with rapidly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about the amount of compensation that producers and processors will get. I know that CFIA talks about $33 a bird  but that is really not the case. In most cases it is much less than that, likely $3 or so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  therefore am asking the House of Commons to look at   disaster relief for  economic disasters and  employment insurance relief for farmers, special measures. It  would be ordinary to provide tax relief on the compensation dollars that farmers get. We could defer the tax on those dollars for some time, for years  in fact. We can  talk about the many ways for providing  relief to these farmers. I am asking the House to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent a considerable amount of time talking to officials in British Columbia,   the minister of agriculture, the provincial veterinarian, Ron Lewis,  and the CFIA control centre. I have listened to producers and processors. I have had conference calls and we have initiated a parliamentary committee. However  having the knowledge is one thing, but having the gift of Parliament to respond to these farmers well in advance of the situation hitting the hardest is paramount.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than talk about the budget, I would like to place a request before the House of Commons    for a concrete proposal to compensate  those farmers,  who have worked hard all their lives to make Canada a  better place,   for having    to remove infected  birds and for the downtime as a result of avian flu.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-870457"></A><a HREF="#Int-870491"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-870396"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, I will be speaking  about the inadequacies in the budget with regard to agriculture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 60% or 65% of the farms in my Ontario constituency   have some beef or dairy component, and many of them are primarily or exclusively beef or dairy. Among other things, this includes the production of organic beef. There is a wide variety of production. All of it, of course, has been affected by the shutting of the border on May 20 last year and the resulting collapse of our overseas markets. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I am very painfully aware, through the pain that my constituents are feeling, of the inadequacies of the budget with regard to beef and to beef producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded  of a situation that occurred in my constituency about a year and a half ago. Members may recall the  drought out west in the summer of 2002  and that farmers in this part of the country,  who were enjoying a very good harvest of hay, wanted to send part of that crop out west. This became the hay west program, initiated entirely without government support, by farmers  for farmers. One of the railheads at which hay was collected and sent west was in Smiths Falls in my constituency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crisis had gone on for some length of time, the prime minister of the day, Jean Chrétien, came out to Smiths Falls. I received an invitation with about 12 hours notice from the then House leader for the government to come and join the Prime Minister while he made an announcement of some funds to help with the hay west program, a very small amount of funding I might add, perhaps $2 million or $3 million. The exact number escapes me at the moment. Frankly, I turned down the invitation because  I felt that it  was simply an exercise in grandstanding, that the prime minister would stand on a hay bale beside a train and announce what a good boy he was, and that is exactly what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized what the purpose of that announcement had been when I was watching the weather channel, of all things, the next day. The little banner that runs   at the bottom of the weather channel, which tells us what else is going on in the news other than the weather, included a reference to the fact that the federal government had tossed in a couple of million dollars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real point of that exercise had been so that the people who were not farmers and  who would  not see the hollowness of the gesture, would say that they were good guys for  throwing in a bit of money. It was to satisfy the urban vote that rural Canadians and farmers were being taken care of. It was not for the purpose of actually providing any meaningful aid to farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the current Prime Minister's announcement in Picture Butte a few days ago of aid for farmers who are suffering as a result of the BSE crisis is very much of the same nature. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister went to Picture Butte in the riding of Lethbridge, Alberta, my colleague, the MP for Lethbridge, was not even informed of  it. The Prime Minister was surrounded by Liberal candidates as he announced the money. This was simply a way of promoting the Liberal Party and of satisfying people out in TV land that the government cares about farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  farmers themselves know how inadequate and how late this aid is.  The point has not been lost on them that the border closed May 20, 2003 and this package arrives in March of this year, shortly before the announcement of an election. I think the math can be worked out in the heads of most farmers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement was  meant   for the edification of urban television audiences. It was not meant to seriously deal with the needs of farmers. If there had been a real desire to do this, it would have been done much earlier. It would have been based on herd sizes as of May 20. After all, prices collapsed after May 20. They did not collapse December 31. If   farmers had the misfortune of having  been  forced to sell all or part of their  herd at some point prior to December 31, this aid package does not do a whole heck of a lot for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had really cared about this issue and the impact it has had on other ruminants, it would not have fallen upon me personally to be the first person, two months after the crisis started, to raise the issue of other ruminants, of sheep, in the House of Commons. The fact is that the Minister of Agriculture never bothered to talk about other ruminants until I raised the issue.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is typical of the attitude this government has had toward agriculture in general and toward farmers suffering from the BSE crisis in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an endemic problem I want to draw the government's attention to as well, which I think may affect this particular aid package.  One hopes it will not, but it has been the pattern, that is, federal aid to farmers is notoriously slow in coming.  It is quick to be promised.  It is slow to actually arrive.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know this by comparing the aid that my provincial government here in Ontario provides and the speed with which it arrives compared to federal aid.  Last year the government promised $3.1 billion of transfers to farmers.  As of March 1, only $1.3 billion of that had arrived.  That is typical.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in debate on Bill C-398.  This is a bill that we have extreme concerns about.

We do not believe it is going to help his cause in any way, shape or form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a number of concerns. Let me outline them.  Obviously obesity and inactivity are on the rise and there are concerns.  That is what they are talking about when we hear all these studies about our children being at risk.  Of course at the same time we are seeing Canadians take more responsibility for their health.  They are paying particular attention to the foods they eat.  It is widely recognized that there are strategic efforts in health promotion and disease prevention.  That is obviously going to pay dividends.  I fully support those initiatives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I believe that Bill C-398 in many respects is impractical and unnecessary.  The bill would require large  chain restaurants to post the number of calories of menu items beside the corresponding price on menu boards.  Where menus are used, the amounts of saturated trans fats and sodium per serving would be required.  We can imagine going into a restaurant and getting a very thin menu and  a binder full of information.  Every time they changed a menu and every time they had specials, restaurateurs would be required to provide all that information. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the restaurant industry has been doing a very noble and responsible job.  Even the fast food chains are offering many low calorie alternatives.  They are offering healthy choices.  I have letters here from some of them.  The general manager from Burger King sent me a letter.  He says that on a voluntary basis they offer seven different meal packages with under seven grams of fat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little guys love going to McDonald's, which now offers a number of salads and healthy alternatives.  It offers veggie burgers.  A number of voluntary initiatives are being taken by the restaurants. Most of the restaurants I go to offer alternatives that have a heart beside the healthy choice menu item. Restaurants are doing this on a voluntary basis.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just do not think it is practical to start regulating and creating another level of bureaucracy, and that is aside from the astronomical cost and the regulation of all of this. It would force a lot of owner-operator restaurants right out of business, of course, because they change the menus all the time.  It would mean a redesigning of all the menu boards.  Again, there are just so many ways in which this is just not going to be possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is it impractical, but there is an absolute economical cost to this as well.  Of course the implementation of this would mean that every time there was a menu change the new food would have to be sent off to a laboratory for analysis. It can cost up to $150 just to have one single food sample analyzed.  Of course as they make new menu items this would all have to be done to be in compliance with the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to putting on labelling requirements for these restaurants, although the member may have some noble efforts here, I have spoken to hundreds of people from across the country, and I have spoken to members from all five political parties of the House who have raised concerns to me, and I just do not think that this would be a healthy option at this time for the industry.  I do not think it is going to address the problems that the member is trying to address.  It is not going to address the health conscious.  It is not going to address the obesity issues at all.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would urge all government members to vote against this.  I have been told that during this debate in this hour there is going to be a motion coming forward for the member to withdraw the bill. In response, he is going to send it off to committee for further study. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even have issues of concern about sending this off to committee for further study, not to mention that since I have been a member of Parliament we have spent a quarter of a billion dollars on various health care studies.  I just do not see any need in this case.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, which represents restaurants across the country by the thousands, has done an enormous job in researching the bill. It did an  objective analysis that showed all sides of the debate and has presented that to all members of Parliament. It has done an absolutely outstanding job on the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is that the bill is ineffective. Absolutely no research has been done to show the impact of the bill. No research has been done to show if labelling would even have any effect on consumer eating habits. This really is unworkable with the complexity of the bill, because every time there would be a menu change or restaurants would have specials of the day, restaurants would be required to send the food out for analysis, of course  because it is composed of many different ingredients.  There would have to be labelling and all of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the industry needs to be commended for its voluntary efforts to promote healthy alternatives. I go to the dining room in the Parliament Buildings. There are designated symbols for healthy alternatives on the menu. I can name restaurants in my riding, like the Fireside Grill and  other local restaurants. There are all kinds of restaurants in my riding that show healthy alternatives symbols on the menu. People who have concerns about what they are eating usually raise those concerns with the waiter or waitress who is serving them, and they are dealt with in a professional manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for creating another bureaucracy to deal with this and to try to regulate this, I believe we have far too much regulation.  The restaurant industry itself has been doing an outstanding job in dealing with this on a voluntary basis. Regulation is absolutely not necessary at this time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be perfectly honest, I do not see it at any time and this is an issue that I have looked at extremely closely. Because the bill came forward, I took it upon myself to get actively involved and talk to the restaurateurs about what impacts this would have on them. I was not aware of the efforts they do go through to offer healthy alternatives, from Burger King to McDonald's to A&amp;W and all those fast food chains, which are probably at the top of the hit list for being criticized for unhealthy choices.  They have very healthy choices.  As I said earlier, Burger King alone offers a number of menu items with a very low calorie content.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage all members to oppose the bill.  I look forward to listening to the comments of  members from other parties. The owner-operators, the small businesses and the restaurateurs, these people employ hundreds of thousands of people across the country.  We can argue that they are the backbone of the small business economy.  There is no question about it; they do contribute so much to the economy.  Tying their hands in this way is completely unnecessary.  We have to recognize that this industry itself has been a leader. It has been out in front of Parliament on this issue on a voluntary basis and it has done an outstanding job.  For us now to try to regulate that would be ill advised.  I would strongly urge all members of the House to vote against the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be brief because it is not so much a matter of discussing the bill as referring it to the Standing Committee on Health for further study.  This is a motion the Bloc Quebecois agrees with and it will have our support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, have a few comments to make.  Of course we subscribe to the objective of better informing the consumer of calorie content, and particularly saturated fat content, and anything that can provide information to help Quebeckers and Canadians improve their diets is a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we discussed this bill in caucus, however, the colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois were uncomfortable with the idea of supporting the bill in its present form, because we were not convinced it was workable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleague have used the example of Subway or other major chains, where there are multiple choices because of the number of foods and ingredients available.  We wondered how it could be workable for owners of franchises or restaurant chains to provide the specific information listed in this bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt some mid-way solution would have to be found.  I understand that the restaurant chains have themselves indicated some degree of openness toward sharing this information and, in a number of the major chains, it is already available to consumers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we realize that every time it is a matter of providing the consumer with information there is a cost associated with it, and what is more arguments based on cost cannot be definitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this House discussed tobacco labelling, and the possibility of having, not content information, but rather notices or information concerning the harmful effects of tobacco on packaging, I remember the major manufacturers and tobacco companies coming before the Standing Health Committee to tell us this was absolutely impossible.  Yet, three years after regulation, we can see this was in fact totally feasible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Bloc Quebecois attitude is that we want to see this motion go to committee.  We feel it is important for the Standing Committee on Health to seek a workable solution that will make it possible to provide consumers with information.   This is why we are going to support the proposal by the member for  Scarborough Southwest to refer this to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there has been considerable support for the objective of this bill.  I am thinking in particular of the National Pensioners' and Senior Citizens' Federation; the Association des diététistes du Québec, and the Ontario Society of Nutrition Professionals in Public Health.  Several dozen groups in all supported the bill.  The challenge for parliamentarians is to ensure, within an appropriate framework such as the Standing Committee on Health, that we seek a workable way to achieve that objective.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I too would like to speak to Bill C-398, but first, I would like to speak of the original mover of the bill. I would begin by presenting the truth of his determined resolve.  I would like to commend the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest who has shown that he is truly committed to a project and to a cause that he has championed for quite some time, and has shown considerable success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has shown a determined resolve to require the nutritional value of food to be clearly stated on packaged foods, and I applaud his efforts to help to ensure that Canadians have the information they need to combat the epidemic of obesity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that I am joined by all members of Parliament in applauding the hon. member's desire to work to ensure that a discussion around these important issues take place.  It is in this vein that I would now like to offer a consideration of a further opportunity for parliamentarians to participate with the member for Scarborough Southwest in further debate and dialogue on the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that it was indeed the member for Scarborough Southwest's efforts, by the way, that contributed to the new regulations that were published on January 1, 2003, regarding this subject, and I truly congratulate him on that objective and achievement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the House to know that the government shares the hon. member's concern about fair and informative labelling of foods. To ensure that the important issue raised within the bill, including but not limited to the information consumers should receive about food they are eating outside the home, I move, with the full support of the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest, that:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was not going to rise on a point of order, but since you said that you would determine the point of order that was made on the other side, I would like to add a couple of points for your consideration before you make your ruling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that the rules of the House require that a private member's bill that is sent to committee must be dealt with by the House, at least by the committee and reported back by a certain time or it is deemed to be reported back. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only reason for mentioning this is because clearly the House has already set in place a procedure whereby the House has told the committee what it must do with respect to private members' business.  To have a motion of the House, as moved by the hon. member from Newfoundland, which asks that a committee return its report by a particular day is nothing unusual.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it somewhat odd that a member from the Conservative Party of Canada, which championed the rights of private members and championed removing those aspects of rules which would prevent committees from reporting back on private members' business, would raise such an objection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that you consider this, Mr. Speaker, as you consider your ruling.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-870617"></A><a HREF="#Int-870618"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-870615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  speak to  Bill C-398.  I am also pleased that the bill may be going to committee.  That is the proper place for the bill to be dealt with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I had not really looked at the bill.  I do not sit on the health committee.  However, as I look at the bill I like what I see.  I am pleased that the bill may end up at the health committee and be reported back by the end of September.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read the bill, its objectives include the requirement that large chain restaurants, and we are not talking about mom and pop restaurants as the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands would have listeners believe, post the number of calories on menu items, together with the saturated and trans fats and sodium contents. In addition, all fresh meat, poultry and seafood would need to be disclosed with full nutritional information.  As I further read the bill, it seems to me that with the federal government database available this would be relatively easy for restaurants to include on their menus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard  to prepackaged items, multi-ingredient foods would show the percentage by weight of key ingredients, especially with specific relevance to health added items, such as sugars, fruits and vegetables.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of money is being expended in this country, particularly by provinces, to ensure that we have a healthy population.  A poor diet contributes significantly to the costs of maintaining good health.  The estimates are in the magnitude of $5 billion or $6 billion a year in additional health spending.  Unchecked it will result in higher drug costs, higher rates of obesity, diabetes and the like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General has looked at preventive health activities and estimated that, depending on the item, it is somewhere between six and 45 times more effective to deal with health problems before they become problems, to deal with them in a preventive way rather than after the fact.  That is why a number of years ago provinces such as Saskatchewan incorporated wellness programs, to try and deal with the rising costs of health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five thousand deaths annually are related to diet related disease in Canada, including cardiovascular disease, cancers and diabetes.  It is predicted that a new mandatory nutritional label would reduce health care costs and reduce premature deaths and disabilities.  That would be a significant return to the economy and that ought to be of concern to members, including the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with some interest when the member was speaking about going upstairs to the parliamentary restaurant.  It is nice that members of the Conservative Party are now taking advantage of the parliamentary restaurant  because when they were members of the reform party of course  they would not do that.  The restaurant does have heart healthy choices, but what does that mean?  We do not know what necessarily that entails.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting for me to read the background material to this bill and to note  the difference between the amount of saturated fat in a three ounce top sirloin steak versus a shoulder pork blade steak.  The fact is there is four times as much saturated fat in the latter than in the former.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are things  the average consumer would not be aware of, such as the fact that a small McDonald's milkshake has four times as many calories as a fruit or  vegetable shake.  These are things that perhaps would make a difference  to people when ordering--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte:</b>  It is four times as good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b>  Yes, but  people might be interested to know and they might change their order if they were aware of what the caloric intake was for  option A versus option B.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went  through this at the agriculture committee. We discussed labelling and heard the arguments from restaurateurs and some who are opposed to similar labels on food that we are going to have this enormous list of labels.  I simply do not buy it.    To add the amount of calories that would be in a hamburger with cheese would be relatively easy and certainly relatively inexpensive to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutritionists and scientists know that fruits and vegetables result in a lower risk of cancer, fewer stroke results and reduced blood pressure, but two-thirds of Canadians do not consume the 5 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily that is recommended by the guides.  Many processed foods which  indicate that they  contain fruits and vegetables may only contain traces thereof and  this does not really serve the purpose that is required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go on at length, but I think that food labelling and food menus that contain nutritional information are a cost effective means to help Canadians reduce the risk of diet related diseases.  This is a good bill and I am glad that it appears to be pointed in the direction of going to the health committee for further review and study.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to  Bill C-398. The first thing I would like to do is congratulate the member for Scarborough Southwest for getting his bill to this stage. I know what it is like. My Bill C-212 on user fees passed on Friday. It took a couple of years and it was a long and bumpy road. I know what he is going through and I congratulate him for taking this initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has some very laudable objectives. For Canadians to understand better what  they are eating, what is in the food they are eating is something  we should strive for.  I think I can support sending the bill   to the health committee as subject matter for study, but the problems that I see with the bill  are practical in nature. Implementing the bill will cause a lot of difficulties for restaurant owners and I am not sure that  at the end of the day  Canadian customers will get what they want either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food and restaurant industry is a major employer across Canada. The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands talked about tens of thousands, but in fact it was a year ago that we reached the over one million threshold of Canadians who work in the food and restaurant industry, many of them young people. Many of them create a lot of economic activity in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Etobicoke North  is near the airport. It is near the major intersections of the 401 and  the 427. There are    many restaurants and hotels and they  are concerned about this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read some comments from various restaurateurs who have written to me to highlight some of their concerns. One  is the issue around customization. Customization means customers looking at the menu and saying instead of this, they would like that. That creates some very real challenges for restaurateurs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Adrian Whitfield of Jack Astor's Bar and Grill in Etobicoke  said:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a letter stating that  Pizza Pizza makes its    pizzas  to the individual specifications of its  customers. Variations on a product are endless. For example, a very basic pizza such as pepperoni can be changed as follows: regular crust, thin crust, thick crust, regular sauce, easy on the sauce, extra sauce, regular cheese, extra cheese, double cheese, no cheese, light on the cheese, cheese on one half only, regular pepperoni, double pepperoni, pepperoni on one half only. Some of our customers will enhance their pepperoni pizza with olive oil and oregano. Each of these variations impacts the calorie, salt and fat content. Those are the variations on a single topping pizza. Pizza Pizza states  that the  average number of toppings  is three, so that is a problem  it  sees with respect to customization.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDonald's is expressing some concern about space on the menu board, as well as The Keg. These are serious business people employing a lot of Canadians. They are talking about regional differences of supply. How do they deal with that on their unified national menu? New York Fries has some concerns as well as Dixie Lee and White Spot Restaurants. I could go on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect the member's objective here, but there are some very serious practical issues. Perhaps the subject matter can be reviewed at the health committee.  It is important for Canadians to know what they are eating, but we have to arrive at a practical solution to this, not put something in place that is going to cost a lot of Canadians their jobs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming debate, the hon. member for Calgary Southeast.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-870624"></A><a HREF="#Int-870627"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-870623"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my constituents,  many of whom are restaurateurs, to speak to Bill C-398.  Many have said that the objectives of the bill are worthy.  I would tend to agree. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran of the battle of the bulge myself, I appreciate restaurants that provide nutritional information so that I can make more healthy choices when I dine out, which is very frequently given our job.  Many of us are veteran customers and consumers of restaurant and food services.  I certainly am and I resemble that remark as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there is a good and worthwhile intent for restaurateurs to provide more complete information. The fact of the matter is that it is already happening.  One can go down Bank Street to the local Subway franchise and get a brochure filled with nutritional information on the various choices that it offers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is information that is provided in a way that is plausible for that company. The problem with the bill, as with all similar efforts to impose massive government regulation on a free market economy, is that it would have enormous unintended consequences, and huge additional costs that would be borne by entrepreneurs and ultimately consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague across has pointed out that the food and restaurant business in Canada is one of the largest and most dynamic employers in the country now employing over a million Canadians.  Thousands of Canadians have invested their life savings in starting restaurants that have become successful, growing them into chains and becoming franchises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are business people who have created wealth, jobs and opportunity for millions of young Canadians, particularly, to get their first rung up the labour market ladder in their work experience for their entire careers. This is an industry which we must support and not burden through unnecessary regulation, the likes of which is contemplated in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of performing a full nutritional analysis of a menu item could be up to $500 for one item. Restaurants offer dozens of choices and all would have to be outsourced to a lab for testing and analysis. This would present an immediate cost to all restaurants of tens of thousands of dollars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, every time a new special comes in, it would need to be analyzed if an ingredient were switched. A new analysis would need to be performed.  This burden would quickly become unbearable for restaurant and franchise owners across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other costs as well that are implicit in the bill.  Consider the cost of reprinting menus with the specified nutritional information.  Adding in the required details to the existing menus would result in doubling their size.  This could cost thousands of dollars, not to mention the additional cost of reprinting if an ingredient is substituted or a recipe modified. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large restaurant chains would be forced to manufacture new and bigger menu boards that include calorie counts.  This would be an investment for each outlet of tens of thousands of dollars or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. The return on this investment of course would be zero. Presumably, the nutrition police would stop the harassment, but there is no other tangible benefit for the restaurant. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant owners are already in a tough marketplace.  Why would we want to burden them with this ridiculous extra cost?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the bill on the food services industry would be detrimental to consumers. Instead of providing them with extra helpful information, Bill C-398 would only serve to limit the choices available to consumers. Daily specials would be too costly for restaurants to introduce.  Restaurant owners and managers would have to think twice before adding to the menu.  Substitutions and combos would be a huge headache for both the consumers and restaurant staff.  Overall, would consumers really benefit from this legislation?  I doubt it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being inefficient, the bill is also inequitable.  The regulations imposed by the bill apply only to restaurants with over $10 million in annual revenues.  This unfairly discriminates against the owners of franchise restaurants that have branches all over the country.  The bill penalizes one group of business people over another without any justification.  It picks winners and losers and the government should not do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we ignore all the flaws that I have mentioned, the bill is completely unworkable and impossible to implement.  Let us think about the regulations for just a second.  The bill would force restaurants to list the number of calories in a menu item next to its price on the menu board.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider for example a pizza store. Hon. members should imagine they would like to order a medium pizza, but first they have to choose their toppings. Would they like mushrooms, green peppers, onions, double cheese, or tomatoes? The combinations are endless. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using simple mathematics it is possible to calculate that the number of different possible combinations for Pizza Pizza, for example, which carries 28 different toppings, would mean 268,435,455 different options for pizza toppings. Can hon. members imagine a menu board with 268 million entries? That is ridiculous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple sandwich store with five possible toppings would imply 120 combinations which would require specific posted information. A Subway store with 10 toppings has 3.628 million possible total combinations. That is why the bill is not workable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go down to the local Subway store, it will give us information that is practical and responds to the market demand in an efficient way.  It provides the information with  a market advantage over its competitors who are not providing that basic information.  However, if we pass this law, we will require them to post 3.6 million caloric entries on a menu board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just a problem for pizza stores.  It is a problem for fast food outlets and for virtually every kind of food service. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote against this ill-conceived bill. The economic effects would be far reaching and there is really no discernible benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to second the view of my colleague. I received dozens of letters from restaurateurs across the country who were very concerned about the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I   want to acknowledge that I   also    received a number of letters   from restaurateurs and I recognize that there is concern within the industry that this type of bill would  make it too costly to operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to  suggest that this happened because it was all men reading the letters, but as I listened to the comments   being made by my colleagues about the numerous choices for    pizza or   whatever item   was being ordered, all I could think of was that it was pretty simple.  We would have so many ounces that would have so many calories and we would just figure that out. They would only have to show how much each ounce had and we could work it out.  We would not have to have the two mile long menu board.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are taking the right tact by referring the bill to committee where we can have discussions and   we can    listen to the concerns of the  restaurant industry to  see if there are ways to alleviate their concerns.  At the same time, we would be  responding to the need that Canadians have to find out what is in the food they are eating.  As responsible politicians we should be promoting a healthy lifestyle and we should be providing people with the opportunity   to meet that healthy lifestyle while still  supporting  restaurants.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Calgary Southeast mentioned   Subway.     When  I go to a Subway  it has it  marked how much things are, which  is great.  As a result, I have a greater tendency to go there.  Harvey's was mentioned.  Harvey's  offers a grilled chicken and people  can substitute the salad for the fries.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restaurants are making efforts because they recognize that Canadians want to live a healthy lifestyle.  I think this bill is the extra incentive to provide  a bit more information that will benefit all Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  the purpose of my bill is to provide information to Canadians that they can use to make healthy food choices.  During the bill's  hour of debate on a previous occasion   a number of   speakers pointed out the various organizations and citizens groups  that   do support the bill in its current form, never mind with any improvements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I greatly resent the  Chicken Little kind of arguments that have been raised by those who are in opposition to this bill that somehow the sky would  fall if this bill were to pass, that somehow millions of Canadians would be thrown out of work because all of a sudden some regulations come in to show that a particular hamburger has 362 calories on a menu board, which      is all the bill is about when it talks about fast food  restaurants with menu boards only.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to remind those who are listening that it is a gross exaggeration to say that poor old mom and pop restaurants will  be put out of business because my bill has nothing to do with small businesses.  The minimum threshold is $10 million a year gross sales.  What kind of argument is it to say that this bill  would  put  mom and pop restaurants  out of business?   Those are the arguments of desperate people who cannot come up with valid arguments.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I have read the letters from the restaurant association people as well and, by the way, none of  them have ever approached me to sit down and talk about this.  They have simply mounted, as members have heard today, a huge campaign to defeat the bill at second reading.  Some of my hon. friends across the way, apparently, do not even want the subject matter discussed at the health committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked with the Minister of Health.  I understand that the same kinds of arguments were raised by manufacturers when they wanted to put information on prepackaged foods in a voluntary way. They fought it tooth and nail until finally the government indicated that it must be mandatory.  It is clear that people read labels.  It is clear that people make food choices based on the information or lack of information they have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the subject matter to the health committee.  Let the health committee call the witnesses.  Let the restaurant  associations attend.  The bill is not designed to cover six trillion possible combinations.  It is designed to offer the kind of solution that Subway has offered, which is that if people  order  a standard Subway sandwich, they will get approximately seven grams of fat and approximately 350 calories.  Of course, if someone wants it  loaded up with five tablespoons of mayonnaise there will  be more fat, but that is the person's choice.  It is just so people will have an approximate idea of  what they are consuming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members not to panic in terms of referring the subject matter to the health committee for further study.  I have consented to withdraw the bill if the amendment  to withdraw the bill passes, so there will not be any legislation.  We are simply talking about providing consumers with further information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can anybody be against providing consumers with further information? We are not talking about bankrupting restaurants.  We are not talking about putting Canadians out of work. We are talking about trying to find a reasonable middle ground to provide nutritional information to consumers when they go out to enjoy all   the restaurants that have been named, many of which I have attended and have enjoyed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get serious and be reasonable.  Let us   at least study the subject matter. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  We will withdraw the bill  and send the subject matter to the committee where everyone  will have more than five minutes to offer their views, and there will be considered consideration of the principle.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on Monday, February 9, 2004, we asked the Prime Minister why he did not let MPs have a free vote on future reductions to expenditures in the firearms program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister let the government House leader and Minister responsible for Democratic Reform respond for him. Unfortunately, the Minister responsible for Democratic Reform did not answer the question, so that is why I am back here tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister responsible for Democratic Reform said, and I quote, “The firearms registry must continue to exist”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's response has nothing to do with a free vote on expenditures to the firearms program. I did not ask the Prime Minister for a free vote to scrap the registry, just one on future expenditures for the program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Minister responsible for Democratic Reform duck the question? Are free votes only an option for Liberals when it does not threaten a slush fund or one of their prized billion dollar boondoggles?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question was also consistent with promises made by the Prime Minister in the throne speech, one of which I now will quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This will include significantly more free votes, so that Members can represent the views of their constituents as they see fit.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, a JMCK poll showed support for the gun registry at an all time low of 37.7%. For the first time, support for the registry was below 50% in all provinces. Support for the gun registry was lowest in Alberta, with 15% support. Atlantic Canada had 31% support. Saskatchewan and Manitoba had 33%.  British Columbia had 38%, Ontario had 41%, and Quebec had 46% support. In February, an Ipsos-Reid poll produced similar results, with only 43% of Canadians supporting the registry. This newest poll showed support for the elimination of the federal gun registry as highest in British Columbia at 64%, with Saskatchewan and Manitoba also at 64%, Atlantic Canada at 61%, and among Albertans, 57%, Quebeckers, 48%, and Ontarians, 45%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so much public dissatisfaction with the program, it is understandable why the Prime Minister will not let his backbench MPs represent the wishes of their constituents, yet that is what the new Prime Minister, hauling around 10 years' worth  of Mr. Chrétien's battered baggage, promised Canadians. Now he is breaking the promise before the election has even been held.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very odd that the government is so at odds with the views of its own parliamentary secretary for democratic reform, the hon. member for Sarnia--Lambton, who was telling his constituents in January to expect the Prime Minister to allow a free vote when a request for more funding was presented to Parliament in March. His letter stated, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Under the reforms being instituted by [the Prime Minister], it may be very well that the firearms program will die of 'financial malnutrition', that is, no money.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the hon. member has to go back, unfortunately, and tell his constituents that no matter what they think, no matter what the majority of Canadians think, the Prime Minister's so-called democratic reforms are dead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of allowing Liberal MPs to vote freely on the wishes of their constituents on highly contentious issues and programs, the Prime Minister is breaking faith with his backbench MPs and the majority of  their constituents who elected them to office. How can these voters ever trust the Prime Minister or their Liberal MPs to keep their promises?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than allowing a free vote on future funding for the gun registry, a program that is already $20 million over budget on last year's estimates, the Prime Minister says his review of the firearms program will “remove irritants”. Let me tell the Prime Minister that there are no irritants for criminals in the Firearms Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While two million government-licensed firearms owners are required to report their changes of address within 30 days or face up to two years in jail, there are 131,000 convicted criminals who have been prohibited from owning firearms by the courts and who do not have to report to anybody. Why? Because all the bad guys are protected by the Privacy Act. Why? Because the bad guys were left out of the Firearms Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder so many Canadians want to get rid of this farce of a firearms program. No wonder the Prime Minister does not want to allow a free vote.</p>

Roger Gallaway (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Yorkton--Melville for asking this question.  He knows that the two of us are in agreement with respect to the efficacy of the national firearms program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question was posed on February 9 and posed in the framework of a free vote on the national firearms program.  It is a very important question because it strikes at the heart of what the role of the House of Commons is in approving funds. What are the estimates? What is the deliberative role of the House?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the House of Commons in approving funds is the most basic and ancient right of this chamber. It is a right that came to us in section 18 of the British North America Act.  It is that bundle of powers in section 18 that came to us from section 9 of the British Bill of Rights and was included in our Constitution. It is the right of the House of Commons and not the other place to approve funds required by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what are the estimates?  The estimates are in a sense the request of departments and ministers for money for operations of departments, of programs and in certain aspects  crown corporations.  It is the duty of the House of Commons first, through its committees, and second, in this chamber, to examine those requests.  The House and its committees have the right to recommend and enforce reductions.  We cannot give increases.  We can only give reductions to the estimates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what is the deliberative role of the House?  The deliberative role of the House is collective.  Individual members have the right to represent and they also have the right to deliberate in the sense of hearing evidence before them.  Do they think or believe that a particular line item in the estimates is necessary and appropriate?  Do they want to support it?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question asked by my friend opposite was about a free vote.  I am not quite certain any more what a free vote means in this place.  A free vote is a more contemporary term. I would suggest that every vote is a free vote, save and except those that are confidence votes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest also that the question asked by the member opposite and in his response is a little premature.  He is attacking the Prime Minister for saying that this would not be a free vote when in fact we have not arrived at the estimates process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, there were no supplementary estimates requests for the national firearms program, but they are in the main estimates.  Committees will have to deal with that at some point soon.  We will see what happens at that point.  To suggest that the Prime Minister is not honouring his stated intention of allowing the House to exercise its deliberative role is, at this point, premature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in disagreement with the efficacy of the national firearms program, as the member has characterized it.  He and I are in agreement.  However, I am not conceding that the Prime Minister has said that this is a confidence matter.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is the first time in 10 years that I have ever received an answer that was not written by a bureaucrat behind the scenes and then read by a parliamentary secretary.  I compliment the member for that. I appreciate the answer he has given.  It is too bad we do not have more time because we need more decent debate in the House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very happy that he acknowledged that the efficacy   of the firearms system is not in question at this point.  I have studied this thing for eight or nine years now, and I know it is not improving public safety and not helping us.  That is why I would like to see a free vote on the funding for this thing because Canadians want to get rid of it.  The best and quickest way to get rid of it is to make it dry up by reducing its funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to read between the lines in his answer, but I hope there is somewhat of a commitment that we will have more free votes on this because that is what Canadians want.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend opposite that I would note, as he did, that on December 5, 2002, in regard to the $72 million item request from the Department of Justice for the funding of the firearms program--whether it was withdrawn or lost does not matter--clearly on December 5 a reduction of $72 million was not a confidence matter at that time, and it is really difficult to make the argument that today, tomorrow or next week it would be.</p>
