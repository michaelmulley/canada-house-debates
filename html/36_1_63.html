could indicate what document it is he seeks to table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  It has to do with the point of privilege 
that was raised yesterday to do with ACOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. parliamentary secretary 
have the unanimous consent of the House to table this additional 
document? Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could illumine the 
House, before we seek consent, what document it is he seeks to 
table.

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday there was some discussion about whether the minister 
responsible for ACOA had read from an official document with 
respect to the views of the hon. member for Medicine Hat and that 
the document should therefore, in keeping with the traditions of 
the House, be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has examined the document in 
question and finds that it is not an official or state paper but 
is a newsclip from a commercial clipping service that, in keeping 
with the usual courtesies, was sent to the critics of all the 
official parties on the day it became available last November.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no objection to tabling this newsclip for the 
benefit of all members of the House.  It is however not an 
official government paper available in both official languages 
and the House leader is not therefore, nor am I, permitted to 
table this document pursuant to Standing Order 34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish therefore to request the unanimous consent of the House 
to permit me to table this paper as is in order to assist those 
members opposite who have made this request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the parliamentary secretary have 
unanimous consent to table the document?

<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  There is a point related to 
that particular document being tabled as to whether the actual 
quote was mentioned in the “blues” and has he examined that for 
the benefit of this House as to the actual statement made by the 
minister.  Could he tell us that please. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  On this point, I do not think it 
is for the parliamentary secretary to tell us what or what is not 
in the “blues”. The “blues” are now published and are 
available for all hon. members to read and the Speaker has taken 
this matter under some advisement as I understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather not get into a discussion on that point of order 
now.  I think if members have representations to make, the 
Speaker would be more than happy to hear those representations. 
But I also suggest that some of this could be done through the 
usual channels rather than having a debate here on the floor of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
interest but I agree with you.  I think that this is a matter for 
the Speaker, not for the government House leader or myself.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK21">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-21, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this morning I am very proud, honoured and privileged to rise in 
the House to represent my constituents and the people of our 
great country, just as my hon. colleagues who rise in this House 
from time to time are honoured and privileged to participate in 
the debates and to represent Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, sometimes it is important to note that the members who 
debate in the House are looking through the lens of their 
political stripes rather through the lens of issues.  In this 
Chamber it is our moral responsibility to debate the issues 
conscientiously.  I look forward to hearing all members debate 
the facts in this House, looking through the lens of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-21 affects the lending practices for small business. With 
the little experience I have, and after having done some research 
on this issue, it is very hard for me to support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pro small business as are my other Reform colleagues who 
have previously addressed this issue.  However in its present 
form the Small Business Loans Act does not meet its objectives. 
It is an inefficient and ineffective program. After thoroughly 
examining the program and reading the auditor general's report, I 
would like to make the following observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business loans program was established in 1961 to 
increase the availability of loans on reasonable terms and 
conditions for the establishment, expansion, modernization and 
improvement of small businesses in this country.  In the last 
four years 177,000 new loans have been granted totalling 
approximately $11.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to increase the availability of loans.  It is a 
very broad objective.  The act should supplement the services 
provided by the private sector incrementally and not merely 
replace them.  The loans under this program should be made in 
addition to the loans made by other financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a study it was found that half of the borrowers involved in 
the SBLA, 46% to be precise, would have received the loans 
anyway. They had met the criteria and were qualified to get the 
loans.  Therefore in real terms the system has been working at 
50% capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this program the government is not successfully helping 
entrepreneurs or small businesses. The government guarantees the 
financial institutions for the bad decisions which they might 
make, up to 85% of the amount, in the event the borrower 
defaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this program loans are made up to a maximum of $250,000 
for fixed assets like land, buildings and equipment.  The program 
does not provide loans for capital leasing or working capital.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times it does not meet the requirements of the small 
business person and this condition has not changed since 1961 but 
we know the business environment has been changing ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is more growth in the economy and employment in 
the service and knowledge-based industry, the purpose of business 
is not fully served to cater to the needs of small business in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been instances where related parties have obtained 
many loans totalling much more than the maximum limit of each 
loan by creating artificially more than one corporation for the 
purpose of loans.  Therefore those businesses have abused the 
system by millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions have been charging interest up to prime 
plus 3%.  There cannot be any other charges according to the act 
but the application fees or opening fees, or opening file fees, 
et cetera are being charged by some financial institutions and 
that goes undetected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many instances when some financial institutions 
have been charging an extra amount illegally.  The department has 
not been checking it.  There is no system in place to check it, 
unless the case files have been opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other observations.  Income tax implications are 
very complicated under this act.  They have not been addressed. 
They are not simplified to help the small businessman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job creation record is not good either.  There is potential 
for an active displacement effect.  The job creation figures 
under SBLA have been inflated by as much as five times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality and quantity of information provided to 
parliamentarians on the result of this program is very 
inadequate.  Surprisingly, the department is not reviewing risk 
analysis and there is no provision for the losses that may be 
incurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada has emphasized that the program should recover 
full costs but it looks quite unlikely that this objective can 
ever be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business loan program management and delivery 
mechanisms are very weak.  Industry Canada has no yardstick. 
There are no indicators in place.  There are no procedures in 
place to measure the performance results of this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the performance evaluation framework is very important 
for the success of a program like this one.  The department 
operates the accounting system on a cash basis and not on an 
accrual basis.  It creates further implications in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department lacks adequate forecasting techniques. Basically 
the department needs better tools to operate effectively and 
efficiently which will cost billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all that, the purpose of Bill C-21 is to extend the 
SBLA to March 31, 1999 and raise the government's total liability 
to $15 billion, an increase of $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the industry committee of the House of Commons called 
for a review to be done on SBLA.  Up to now, a complete cost 
based analysis has never been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is not only inefficient and ineffective but it also 
discourages the development of alternative and innovative 
financial solutions for small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Industry Canada of this government has been asleep at the 
switch with respect to the operations of SBLA, how can I and my 
colleagues from the Reform Party betray the trust of Canadians 
and support this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, any member from any political party who is looking 
through the lens of issues and facts and not through the lens of 
political stripes will never support this bill until a full 
review is done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to 
the member speaking on Bill C-21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is to extend for one year and to increase the amount 
from $14 billion to $15 billion.  The member also knows that a 
total comprehensive study is in the works.  Some changes were 
made in the 1995-96 timeframe after reviewing the bill and 
previous government experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into a whole pile of other things, does the 
member support the fact that we want to continue the SBLA and 
extend it for one year with an increase of $1 billion?  Does he 
also support the second phase, which is to have the study 
completed in total by members on all sides of the House in 
committee?  Does he agree that should be continued or not, 
without getting into a whole pile of other rhetoric? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not political 
rhetoric that I put in front of the House.  These are solid facts 
and figures.  According to the auditor general's report, this is 
the crux of the matter which was discussed and recommended by the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the industry committee of the House asked for cost 
benefit analysis and a complete review of the system because the 
system was not achieving its objectives.  It was not doing what 
it was supposed to do.  Going through the details of this act, as 
well as going through the auditor general's report, I am 
convinced that this act does more harm than good under present 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act was introduced in 1961 to help small businesses, not 
big financial institutions or banks.  This act was introduced so 
that small businesses, which are creating the jobs and are the 
backbone of this country, could be promoted.  Unfortunately this 
act has failed small businesses because it was not properly 
designed.  There are many things that need to be improved in this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the facts, there is room for improvement and 
modifications to the act.  The act should be changed so that it 
meets the requirements of small businesses and not create 
hindrances and obstacles to small businesses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to both speakers today and cannot help but feel I have 
been somewhat deceived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems as though Bill C-21 is all part of a public relations 
ploy on behalf of the government.  The government has raised 
payroll taxes with the Canada pension plan.  It has taken $7 
billion a year out of the economy with its over contributions and 
the taxes it has in terms of the EI premiums, therefore hurting 
the economy and job prospects in this country.  Yet it gives $1 
billion back through this C-21 with all the strings and problems 
attached. Most of those businesses actually have access to 
capital outside of this loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want somebody to comment on the public relations scam that I 
feel this really is, where the government takes a dollar and 
gives back a dime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concern 
from my colleague and other members who look at issues not 
through political stripes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that when the government sits on the 
operation switch, the system operates with inefficiencies and 
ineffectiveness.  We need to make the system efficient and 
effective so that it can work.  It is up to the government to 
operate this switch.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not get my answer

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Unlike question period when we ask 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  How do you like it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The member perhaps should address the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is that the 
member opposite and the Reform Party are not in favour of this 
bill, nor are they in favour of extending the SBLA.  I take it 
that is the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member seems to 
want me and my colleagues to support a program that is not 
working.  That is appalling.  We need to improve the system 
instead of asking for support for a program that is not working. 
It has proven ineffective for more than 36 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the government review the program carefully.  Let us make 
the system effective and efficient for small business.  We want 
to encourage small business and create jobs in Canada in an 
effective and efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the context of the 
exchange that has been going on in the House, I cannot help but 
feel that one other issue needs to be addressed to broaden the 
nature of this debate.  We have had 38 tax increases since this 
government took office in 1993.  There has been bracket creep, 
business taxes, going after people with social security benefits, 
CPP, EI, et cetera.  I look at all these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that tens of billions of dollars have come out of 
the pockets of Canadians, Canadian businesses, those people who 
create and sustains jobs in Canada.  The money has come out and 
is now being siphoned off to create a bigger administration and 
bureaucracy.  Once again I am struck by how tens of billions of 
dollars can be taken out of people's pockets every year, 
increased taxes, 38 new tax increases since 1993.  There have 
been two so far and more increases proposed since the June 2 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have these pittances.  There is cutting in 
education and giving back a small amount in scholarships.  There 
is raising taxes on businesses, people who create jobs and 
families and giving back a little in some sort of business loans 
program which most businesses do not need when they apply for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we know there are so 
many ineffective government programs that are not productive. 
This is one of them.  How can we waste another $1 billion of hard 
earned taxpayer money on this program?  Are the members opposite 
saying that we should waste another $1 billion?  I cannot do 
that.  I cannot betray the trust of the Canadians who have sent 
me here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program does not only waste money, but government 
interference in the marketplace discourages the development of 
alternative and innovative financing solutions for small 
business.  This program has proven to be detrimental to small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, every time this exchange 
goes on I think of something else to add to this debate.  One 
thing that glares at me from the text of Bill C-21 is the idea of 
subsidizing businesses.  It all speaks to the lack of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across the way and I think about the cuts to seniors, the 
medicare cuts and education cutbacks. I think about the lack of 
priorities where prisoners get exotic foods in jail, where there 
are many working poor in Canada who cannot afford the meals that 
prisoners receive after the heinous crimes they have committed. I 
think of all these things, of the lack of priorities.  Then I 
wonder how corporations can justify these subsidies when all 
these other programs are being cut.  It does not make any sense.

one condition, that whatever we invested in the past does not go 
to waste and if there is an amendment to the act $1 billion will 
not be added to the liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will let the system operate for one more year, if we are 
promised that there will be a comprehensive review and that the 
observations and recommendations of the auditor general will be 
seriously considered so that we help small businessmen.  We will 
support the bill if another $1 billion is not added to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Bloc is in favour of the bill, not because 
it is one that is fundamental in character, but because it at least 
makes it possible to extend the date of application of this act

Instead, the government decided to make only technical 
modifications, ones that merely prolong the life of a program which 
has been in place for a long time and which was designed at a time 
when economic realities were different than they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people behind small businesses in our area, the people we 
see in our riding offices, the ones I see in my riding, often have 
great difficulty in obtaining the necessary funding to start up 
their businesses, not because their idea is not a good one, not 
because they are not in an acceptable financial situation, but 
often because they are operating in new sectors in which the banks 
are not used to lending, and have no incentive to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this Small Business Loans Act has contributed 
substantially to the financial situation of Canadian banks. 
Part of the profits made by banks today come from the government's 
financial guarantees for loans to SMBs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few ideas the government should explore for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this act never covered working capital.  More and more 
small businesses are going into exports.  This is very prevalent 
throughout Quebec, and Canada as well, right now because people are 
realizing that the domestic market is no longer growing.  If 
businesses want to grow, if they want to increase their share of 
the market, they have to look to the American market.  For Quebec, 
for my region, this means mainly New England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses need quick access to sufficient capital to enable 
them to explore these new markets.  Right now, such access is not 
readily available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation could be extended to a business's entire 
working capital.  Now that we are in a positive economic phase and 
the economy is growing, is it not high time we looked at the 
economic tools we should make available to our entrepreneurs in 
order to ensure that, when things take a downturn, we do not find 
ourselves in the same situation this government inherited in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when the Liberals were elected to office, there was 
major criticism about the way capital was made available to small 
and medium-size businesses, especially in Ontario. 
Four years later, we could have expected the government to have 
done something to overhaul this sector.  We could have expected the 
Minister of Industry to assume a leadership role and ensure that 
our small and medium-size businesses have access to loan vehicles 
consistent with the new economy, with the way markets are 
developing, with the way they have to keep up with international 
competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding technology, does the bill as it now stands afford small 
business the necessary leeway to secure the funding required to put this 
technology in place? We have gone from a time when technology meant that 
machines produced higher quality parts in less time, to the new 
technology-oriented economy which emphasizes knowledge and advances in 
telecommunications. There is not enough of this in the government's 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill to help fund the small businesses of the early 1990s was 
finally put forward, but advantage was not taken of the fact that the 
act was being overhauled to give it more teeth so it could meet the 
demands and challenges faced by our entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite frustrating when we see young entrepreneurs in their 
late twenties walk into our riding office with a business proposal after 
knocking at various doors; their ideas are often very good and workable 
but they do not meet the criteria of any existing program. The Canadian 
banking system has developed this timid attitude of saying it will only 
lend them money after the loan has actually been guaranteed under the 
Small Business Loans Act. In amending the act, the government did not 
encourage banking institutions to promote initiative and give a chance 
to new entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form, the act will not allow these young 
entrepreneurs and those who come up with new ideas to implement them and 
get the help they need in the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear that, in the past, the availability of capital 
varied from one part of Canada to another. In Quebec for instance, 
capital money was made available through the Fonds de solidarité, the 
caisses populaires and various local means of assistance, bringing banks 
under more competitive pressure than in any other province of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals, particularly those from Ontario, looked at 
this situation in committee, we were expecting a dynamic approach 
that would enable small and medium size businesses to position 
themselves better in the North American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with the free trade agreement, Quebec and Canadian 
productivity will have to be competitive with that of the 
Americans, if we are to capture markets.  This was confirmed by a 
study undertaken by the Privy Council, which looked at the 
situation in Canada.  There is still a significant difference in 
the levels of productivity of Canadian and American businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told the economy is doing well today, it is getting 
stronger, progress is being made.  However, we are not looking at 
what will be required in future years.  What tools do our 
businesses need? 
How can we manage to reduce the number of small businesses that 
fail to survive the first five years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a business is established and money is invested in it, 
there should be some form of assistance or support that would 
significantly improve the survival rate of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be less impressive in political and electoral terms. 
However, a longer lifespan for businesses would mean the creation 
and maintenance of jobs.  A small business with a solid core that 
starts up with four or five employees and survives the crucial 
first years to expand its personnel to eight or ten employees a few 
years later will reach a critical mass that will enable it to 
compete and create linkages with other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the sectors where the government should have shown 
more originality in the Small Business Loans Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the issue of networking, would it not have been possible 
to include in the legislation provisions to facilitate partnerships 
between businesses and major industries for specific projects, so they 
have access to more financing options that they would on an individual 
basis? Some thought could have been given to this, but the bill is 
silent on this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, the government decided to merely make technical 
adjustments. These adjustments were necessary. It was important to make 
the program more accessible. 
The bill lacks originality, as does all the legislation introduced since 
the last election. The government does not table new bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also have been important for the government to ensure, as 
recommended by the auditor general, better control over program costs. 
We have to make sure that this type of small business loans program is 
well managed and that the loans are made to the right people, so that 
the program will not be questioned on the grounds that too many loans go 
to businesses that do not deserve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important recommendation made by the auditor general is 
that there should be a better assessment of the program's impact on job 
creation. In the past, programs designed to help small and medium size 
businesses did not necessarily take job creation into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the advent of new technologies, the current reality is 
different from that of 10, 15 or 20 years ago. Now, investing in 
technology often results in job losses. 
The idea is not to stop progress, or to refuse to accept the new global 
market. However, when defining the criteria for such a program, in which 
loans are guaranteed by the governments, we must act more responsibly to 
ensure that when banks lend money, they take into account the situation 
of those concerned and the actual number of jobs that will be created, 
not just the economic performance of the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that this requirement will not be readily 
proposed by financial institutions or by the businesses themselves. 
But the government's responsibility toward income distribution also 
includes mechanisms such as this act, provided it were adapted to 
guarantee that the small business loans will have a positive effect 
on employment, but there ought not to be a fall back to the 
arrangements of the past, such as the tax credits for regions with 
a  particular unemployment problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when we look at a draft bill such as this one, when we 
look at the employment and unemployment picture in Quebec and in 
Canada, it is obvious that we would like to see this tool, the 
Small Business Loans Act, made far more efficient and effective so 
as to diversify regional economies in areas with the highest 
unemployment levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision was made 30 or 40 years ago that there would be 
a division in Canada more or less along the following lines: 
Ontario would get the economic development, while the non-central 
regions such the maritimes and eastern Quebec and others would get 
transfer payments to ensure their survival.  That model has been 
rejected by everyone because of its very poor results.  It is bad 
for self-esteem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much prefer it if the government would use concrete 
tools such as this act to carefully evaluate the way the regions 
could be helped to assume more responsibility for themselves, 
reduce their dependency on transfer payments, and have more 
opportunity to forge autonomy and self-sufficiency.  In my opinion, 
each region of Canada has an underlying potential, and that 
potential must be taken into account. 
First, however, the government has to admit that people have a 
right to live in any region, and to have a hand in the development 
of that region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no particular direction behind what the government is 
doing now.  It is letting the market decide.  People are sent where 
the jobs are and terrible vacuums are created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just come back from a quick trip to the Atlantic 
provinces.  I saw difficult situations in Newfoundland that 
illustrate this point.  I am also seeing the same type of situation 
in my region in eastern Quebec.  I urge the federal government not 
just to re-examine the Small Business Loans Act, but to come up 
with a series of measures to ensure that this kind of tool meets 
the development needs of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give one last example.  The federal government 
has just issued a wonderful statement of principle declaring that 
all government programs will now be judged according to their 
impact on rural development in the various regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, who is 
responsible for implementing this new program, this new way of 
doing things, to examine the bill amending the Small Business Loans 
Act under this light in order to see whether in fact it does 
promote the growth of businesses in all regions of Quebec and of 
Canada. This will also allow us to see whether the bill is in 
keeping with the times and is really consistent with what our new 
businesses will need in 1999, in 2000, at the beginning of the 
third millennium, so that people are not working with a tool from 
the past but a tool for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us pass this bill as written, so that there is no 
interruption, but it is essential that the government act quickly 
and announce a complete overhaul of the act in order to make it a 
genuine tool for economic development.  This is what our young 
people are entitled to and this is what they have a right to 
expect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

of the comments of the speaker opposite.  I want to deal with a 
few points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the lack of things being done in the small business 
area.  The member opposite is not a new member.  I am sure he 
knows the work the standing committee has done with the banks for 
the last four years as far as making them more accountable and 
having more SBLA loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member opposite is aware of the technology 
partners Canada program of which there have been a number of 
projects in his province.  IRAP has been extended across Canada 
and has been very valuable, especially for small businesses that 
are getting into some of the research and development that we 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he realizes the refocusing of the business development 
bank.  I am sure he has read that 39% of the loans that go 
through the SBLA are for start-up companies, for companies under 
three years.  Approximately 57% or 58% of the loans go to those 
businesses in the under three-year period where it is difficult 
to get going as a business and to make things happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned caisses populaires.  I was not quite sure of the 
point he was making.  Is he saying that caisses populaires have 
not been doing their work in the SBLAs?  It is the official 
lender under this act in Quebec and across Canada.  I was not 
sure what point he was making with the caisses populaires. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, he shares my objective.  He said that the Standing 
Committee on Industry has made a lot of representations to the 
banks over the past few years to make them more aware of the need 
for loans.  We can see, however, that this voluntary action is not 
enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the Standing Committee on Industry failed to 
come up with amendments.  I believe the Bloc Quebecois presented a 
dissenting report with amendments.  The industry committee was 
aware of the situation of bank loans to small and medium size 
businesses, but the bill does not provide the necessary tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said legislation on the Business Development Bank 
of Canada was rewritten.  It is true, changes were made.  However, 
why was the same approach not taken with all the banking 
institutions? 
Caisses populaires and banking institutions work with the existing 
program, but the government must lead the way and define in the 
legislation the conditions that would provide the right tools for 
businesses at the start of the 21st century.  There is nothing like 
this in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of the new export market, the arrival 
of new technologies, the changes to all the transportation networks 
in North America.  These conditions totally change the way business 
is conducted in Quebec, Canada, the U.S., North America and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have up-to-date tools?  Will they serve our businesses, 
the people who come to our riding offices, business people in 
contact with banking institutions.  Will they enable these caisses 
populaires and other financial institutions to provide loans to 
these individuals and help them get started? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave the example of working capital, of lending money to 
permit exports.  Work needs to be done in this area.  There is 
nothing original in the legislation.  Business people in the 
regions want something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More use should be made of the expertise of those already in 
business, those who have had a business running for 10, 12 or 15 
years and who know what it takes to make it work.  What is needed 
is some incentive. 
Financial institutions are not displaying a lack of goodwill. We simply 
cannot require them to do things that are not included in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions must comply with the existing legislation, 
but Quebeckers and Canadians are concerned about job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took a real close look at this legislation, we would see 
whether or not it meets the job creation requirement that is in effect 
in Canada. Does the bill promote job creation? I am not just talking 
about jobs that are automatically created in a thriving economy, but 
also about hiring people who may not have been so lucky and about 
finding ways of using everyone's potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fewer and fewer people are prepared to say that the economy is 
doing well just because the gross domestic product is good. What 
Canadians really want is a society that allows the largest number of 
people to realize their full potential. The bill is not the perfect tool 
to this end, but it is a useful one, even though it is not as innovative 
as we had hoped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply extends the application of the act for one year, and it 
adds $1 billion to the fund, so that, technically, the money will be 
there to guarantee the loans. The government should have a vision that 
goes beyond 1999. It should ask itself what instrument should be put in 
place to support our businesses all the way to the year 2005 or 2010. 
Should there not be some gentle pressure on our financial institutions 
to ensure that their loans have a positive impact on job creation? 
The government still has a lot of work to do in this respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague to comment on how he sees taxation, 
both income tax and payroll taxes, affecting the business plans 
which have to be put forth by the people who require capital and 
in which areas he would support tax reduction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, this does go slightly beyond the scope 
of the bill per se, but connections can still be made. The Bloc 
Quebecois has put forward a five point proposal regarding the upcoming 
budget, which reflect part of what the hon. member just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we suggested that employment insurance premiums be 
significantly reduced. There is a very large gap between the current 
rate of $2.70 per $100 of insurable earnings and the $2 rate that would 
ensure the plan's self-sufficiency while turning acceptable surpluses. 
There is this 70 cents gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that one half of this amount could be used to improve the 
quality of life of those who find themselves without work, and the other 
half to reduce EI premiums substantially, which would have an effect on 
job creation. I think that would be a significant and appropriate 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar philosophy applies to the budget. At any rate, I do hope 
that what we are hearing about it is not what we will find in it. 
The federal government's approach is somewhat short on originality. For 
the time being, all we are hearing, regarding the upcoming budget, is 
about the government's plans to invest money in the area of education by 
sending cheques with the Canadians flag on them to ensure visibility, 
when it has been known for quite some time that, in Quebec in 
particular, we look after the whole financial assistance program 
ourselves and what is needed is for money to be given back to the 
provinces so that they can fund their programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding employment, the private sector had made a significant 
contribution these past few years. But in the public sector, at least in 
Quebec, for every $1 in cuts to health and education made since 1994, 75 
cents had to be cut because of cuts made by the federal government. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois believes that, among other major job 
creation measures, giving their money back to the provinces that 
contributed to the deficit reduction effort would enable them to 
maintain quality services and ensure a sufficient level of employment in 
the public sector to meet demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on this. I think that there are indeed innovative 
approaches that could be put forward. We cannot find any such approach 
in the bill on small business loans but hope that the government will 
wake up in the weeks to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on this very short bill which basically 
increases the limit of loans under the Small Business Loans Act 
by $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we may think that another $1 billion to help business 
might be a good idea, I would have thought the government would 
have given us some real information on how well the program is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have improved reporting to parliament documents. Industry 
Canada has put one forward under the pilot project.  I looked at 
the improved reporting to parliament to find out exactly what is 
happening with the Small Business Loans Act which is being 
administered by the Department of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 5 under the title “Industry Sector Development” it 
states that in this overall context the department also has 
several specific activities directed toward small businesses such 
as the small business loans administration.  It continues, but 
that is the sum total of the reference to the $15 billion program 
offered to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a look at the numbers, page 43 of the same document 
tells us the amount of the fees collected.  In 1995-96, 
$18,742,000 were collected.  The following year, 1996-97, 
$23,448,000 were collected.  Page 42 tells us that there is a $44 
million liability.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That improved reporting to parliament is the sum total of the 
information the Department of Industry is prepared to provide to 
us.  It names the act, tells us how much revenue it has 
collected, tells us the liability is twice the revenue and that 
is it.  We are supposed to make our decisions based on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt that parliamentarians are getting very much improved 
reporting here and the department has a long way to go in its 
reporting to Parliament if it wants to call it an improvement. 
This to me is a shocking disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do have some other information regarding the program. 
Coincidentally the auditor general did report on the program in 
his December 1997 report.  It is a whole chapter.  He managed to 
get 25 pages on the program, whereas it just gets a mention by 
the Department of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I notice quite alarmingly when I look at 
exhibit 29.5 on page 29-12 of the auditor general's report is 
that the value of claims paid to lenders is going up 
astronomically.  In 1994-95 it was about $30 million.  In 1996-97 
it is up to $150 million and I understand it has continued to 
grow from that point on because the claims are far in excess of 
what the government expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a program that is now going to on the face of it cost us 
$150 million to $200 million a year based on the fact that the 
government has to pick up the cost of the bad debts under the 
Small Business Loans Act.  That is the philosophy.  Financial 
institutions lend the money, the debt goes bad and 85% to 90% of 
it is picked up by the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this happen?  Why did the write-offs rise 
astronomically?  It is all in the auditor general's report.  If 
we take a look at exhibit 29.1, it tells us that in 1993 we 
changed the maximum percentage of financing for equipment from an 
80% maximum to 100% maximum which means that if individuals wants 
to buy a $100,000 piece of equipment they do not even have to put 
$1 down.  They can go to the bank and say, “Under the Small 
Business Loans Act I would like $100,000 to buy a $100,000 piece 
of equipment.  Thank you very much.  I am going to go out and use 
it and make some money”.  But if it does not turn out too well 
the borrower can walk away from his investment which was the 
maximum of $1 and the taxpayer is left on the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it seems to me that Industry Canada was not thinking 
it out very well when it approved this change to go from 80% to 
100% financing and the borrowers get off the hook because they 
have no money. They have no risk involved.  They have nothing to 
say they have to make this project work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is helping small business, I think it is helping small 
business people who perhaps are less ethical than they otherwise 
should be to obtain financing under very high risk procedures. 
That is the type of thing that should not be happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to give the government its due.  By 1995 it realized that 
perhaps it had made a mistake and changed it.  It reduced the 
amount of the maximum level down to 90%, which is still 10% 
higher than before.  However, the losses continue to grow and the 
write-offs continue to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report by the auditor general would suggest that rather than 
asking for another $1 billion, as the government is doing, the 
government should go back and review the auditor general's report 
and perhaps fix the program first before asking us for another $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the auditor general have to say?  On page 29-16 he 
states: “Industry Canada does not assess whether the lender has 
exercised due care when making the loan”.  On the next page it 
states: “Some loan files did not contain information necessary 
to perform a thorough credit risk analysis”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the same page we found a number of cases where, contrary to 
the Small Business Loans Act, the lender had charged 
administration fees.  Carrying on, on page 20, there are no 
provisions in the Small Business Loans Act to prevent a group of 
related entities from gaining access to loans beyond the maximum 
amount allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on page 22, parliamentarians do not have the 
information necessary to assess whether the small business loans 
program is managed efficiently and it is achieving its 
objectives.  Here we are, as parliamentarians, being asked to 
give them another billion dollars when the auditor general says 
we do not have the information in this House to make a proper 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Reform Party says not at this time.  The 
government should do its homework.  It should clean up its act 
and make sure the act is working the way it was intended to work 
before it comes here asking for another billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am critical of the way the department managed this act.  As I 
say, the lenders, the banks and the financial institutions give 
out the money and have the government's guarantee to fall back 
on.  However, I understand that the Department of Industry does 
not audit one file until such time as the loan goes bad, is a 
write-off and it all lands on the department's desk.  Do we think 
these financial institutions are so good that they are not going 
to make any mistakes and are going to follow the law to the 
letter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a small statistical sample, the auditor general finds that 
not to be the case.  Therefore why does the government not audit 
the financial institutions to ensure that the law is being 
followed?  It makes simple sense to me yet it is not being done. 
That is the type of thing we would like to see rather than being 
asked to put up another billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the taxpayer being on the hook for these things. 
Actually the government's intention is to alleviate the 
responsibility of the taxpayer and make this a full cost recovery 
program.  I scratch my head when I say full cost recovery because 
here we have the government saying it wants to help small 
business so it has a program to help small businesses borrow 
money so they can get the business up and going and be more 
prosperous. Then it says it wants to recover all its costs. 
Where is it going to get the money back from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when a businessman goes to the bank and tries to borrow 
money under this program he has to pay a 2% fee right up front. 
If he wants to borrow $100,000 he has to pay a $2,000 application 
fee.  Then every year the bank has to pay to the government a 
1.25% administration fee which it can recoup from the borrower 
through interest rates.  Now we have a 2% application fee and a 
1.25% annual administration that the borrower pays.  This money 
goes into the government coffers and then, when the government 
has a bad debt, it hopes to be able to have enough money in this 
pot so it can pay back the financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is left holding the bag?  It is obviously not the government 
because it is on a cost recovery program.  It is obviously not 
the financial institutions because they turn around and claim 
back from the government.  Therefore the only person who can pay 
is the successful businessman who borrowed the money, paid his 
application fee, paid his annual administration fee, paid the 
interest to the bank, tried to make a go of his business and 
maybe did so with reduced profitability of course because of all 
these front end charges, and he ended up having to subsidize and 
reimburse the government for the bad debts it ended up paying 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the idea of helping small business which turns out 
to be a tax on small business.  It is a tax on the successful 
small business people who end up having to reimburse the 
government to pay for the bad debts and they did not even have a 
say on who received the money.  That is why I scratch my head. It 
gets a little convoluted when the government stands up in the 
House and says it wants another billion to help small business. 
When we analyse the program we know that small businesses are 
helping themselves despite the government being on their back. 
That is what is amounts to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general confirms that by telling us that it is a 
poorly run and poorly administered program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It gave the financial institutions the right to lend 100% to 
buy equipment and the losses went sky high. Therefore the 
taxpayers are on the hook to some degree and the successful 
businesses are on the hook for the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call this help for small businesses. My God, they would be 
far better off if the government said “we will stay out of your 
hair and you go ahead and make money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we found out was this concept of what is called 
incrementality.  It is a little complex to deal with, but the 
concept is that the banks only accept a bit of risk and if there 
is a bit more risk they say they do not even want to lend to 
these people because they have all these profits to make. The 
government says with the government guarantee they will accept a 
little more risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the auditor general found was that 40% to 50% of all the 
loans granted under the Small Business Loans Act would have been 
given by the banks anyway. But they just wanted this extra piece 
of protection so they can get reimbursed either by the government 
and taxpayers or by the successful borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shareholders are not at risk. Bank profits are not at risk. They 
just want to get the extra piece of protection, and surely that 
was not what the program was designed to do, to protect the banks 
so they can increase that $6 billion or $7 billion profit up by a 
hint more. I did not think that was the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not think that banks fell under the qualification of small 
business, and I do not think that Canadians think that banks are 
small businesses and that we have to help them make profits. That 
is not the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to my original point.  Why is the government asking 
us to increase the guarantee by another $1 billion when we know 
the program is poorly managed?  We know that it is a tax on small 
business. It is not helping small business. We know the Liberals 
need to clean up their house and get it in order and they are 
supposed to make these improved reportings to Parliament a real 
improvement rather than more paperwork that does not mean 
anything to us. They are supposed to give us the real information 
for us to make an intelligent decision rather than just endorse 
the request by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a long way to go in building accountability into the 
Small Business Loans Act, into the Department of Industry, into 
the way this government spends taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday the Minister of Finance is going to bring down a 
budget.  And he is going to stand up in this House and tell us 
what a wonderful job the Liberal government is doing. He will 
have platitudes and one will think this country has to be the 
best run country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But scrape away that very thin veneer and what do we find?  We 
find reports such as the auditor general's which say this program 
and every program he reports on need dramatic improvement. We 
find that the improved reporting to Parliament is no improvement 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that money is being spent frivolously. There is no 
control on the management of programs. That is the story and it 
is the taxpayer who gets to pay the bill, and it is the small 
businessman who gets to pay the bill. As government members stand 
up in the House and tell us what a wonderful job they are doing, 
when we look underneath, when we look at the actual programs 
being delivered, we find they are woefully inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an opportunity for the government to listen to the 
opposition, listen to the auditor general and say “we hear what 
is being said, let us go back to the drawing board, let us keep 
this $1 billion request on the table at the moment and wait until 
we have this program running efficiently”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case and if we have the proper information, I am 
sure we would have a much better debate in this House. We would 
not be so critical of the government in its poor and inadequate 
attempts to help small business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this program, helping small business is the name 
of the game according to the government, but small business is 
succeeding in spite of the government.  Small business is 
creating jobs in spite of high taxes and overregulation.  It is 
creating jobs in spite of the fact that CPP premiums are going up 
73%, in spite of the fact that we are carrying a $45 billion a 
year interest on our backs that is paid for by the business and 
economic activity of this country.  Yet we are still able to 
compete and succeed to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take our hats off to the business people in this 
country.  In spite of all the pressure this government has 
imposed on them, they are still able to compete in the world 
marketplace.  They are still able to create jobs and maintain 
some level of prosperity for the citizens of Canada.  Again, let 
us take our hats off to small business people.  They are doing a 
great job in spite of this government.

to increase the loan money available to small businesses by a 
billion dollars.  Could he confirm that he does not want that 
additional help available to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told us we should improve the program but he did not specify 
how.  One of his Reform colleagues who spoke earlier suggested 
government should stay out of the business of providing loans to 
small business, that we should not have a small business loans 
program.  Could the member tell me the position of the Reform 
Party on loans to small business and a government program for 
loans to small business?  Do Reformers want it or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very simple.  We 
have this improved reporting to Parliament that tells us 
absolutely nothing.  We have the comment by the auditor general 
that parliamentarians do not have the necessary information to 
assess whether the small business loans program is managed 
efficiently and is achieving its objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of my speech was to tell the government to give us 
that information in order that we might have an opportunity to 
assess the benefits or otherwise of this program.  Then we can 
make an intelligent decision.  In the meantime we have no 
information.  We are being asked to approve a billion dollars in 
extra lending for businesses under the act and we have nothing to 
base an opinion upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy whip has posed a rhetorical question.  I would ask 
the deputy whip on the government side to bring that information 
to us and let us have an intelligent debate in this House with 
the information before us.  The auditor general is specifically 
telling the House that we need more information.  His assessment 
is that this program must be fixed before it is expanded.

statement.  It is very important for us to recognize the 
contributions being made by small business to our social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Halifax West there are numerous small 
businesses.  Many are experiencing difficulties.  All we can do 
to try to offset those difficulties should be welcomed.  We must 
do more than just take our hats off to small business.  We must 
be sure to support measures designed to assist small business 
because that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill.  Although much more needs to be done, this 
is certainly a step in the right direction.  Like my hon. 
colleague, I too take my hat off to small business people who are 
working very hard to create the kind of society we need.  They 
are employing people and struggling against many bureaucratic 
obstacles while still maintaining a very important function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I tried to make the point 
that we should take our hats off to small business and we should 
give them the assistance that we can. 
We should not tax small business even more, which of course is 
always the NDP philosophy, to bury them under a mountain of 
taxation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out in my speech that because the government has a 
full cost recovery policy on this program, it is the intent of 
the government that it be totally financed by the successful 
small business people who pay the 2% application fees and the 
1.25% annual administration fee.  From those moneys, the 
government is going to pay the banks back for the bad debts the 
banks make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, it was not the successful small business man who made 
the decision to give it to the unsuccessful small business man. 
It was the bank's decision and the small business man has been 
asked to underwrite that, hence a tax on the successful small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said he wanted to support this bill.  If he wants to 
support this kind of additional taxation on successful job 
creating businesses, and I take my hat off to businesses, but I 
have to really wonder about the policy of the NDP if its members 
cannot see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if we want business to be successful then we get 
taxation off their backs, we get rules and regulations off their 
backs.  We give them every encouragement to go out there and do 
what they know, do what they can do best.  That is to create 
profits, which pays taxes, to create jobs, which is what this 
country needs, and that improves our prosperity for everybody. 
Surely the NDP could understand that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
government takes the steps to correct what the auditor general 
has stated with regard to the fact that they have not brought 
forth the proper recommendations, review and so on and so forth 
of the program, would the member and the Reform Party be in 
favour of the increase in the small business loans program as 
recommended by the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I refer the hon. 
member to the auditor general's report saying that we do not have 
enough information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that there has not been appropriate analysis of this 
program.  We do know that the intent is a full cost recovery for 
the government. Therefore they are in it and it will not cost 
them anything. I explained how the successful small business 
person will end up having to carry the can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I am not in any position to say I can support the 
program until I have that information. We need to do a complete 
and full analysis of the program as it is currently devised, full 
cost recovery by the government and so on. They have set the 
lending limits far too high, in some cases 100%, and I have 
explained how ridiculous that was.  That caused the losses to 
rise astronomically which are now going to have to be paid by 
successful small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we have the proper analysis of the program as it is 
currently run, we cannot support this bill. There is a real 
chance we may find that this program is actually a deterrent and 
puts a greater onus on the successful small businesses than if 
they had borrowed the money without the government guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the information I thought this government would have 
brought to this House along with the request.  The government did 
not and therefore I oppose it.

positive toward small business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, his earlier comment 
regarding the success of the NDP governments in Saskatchewan and 
so on perhaps may have some merit.  I am not going to debate that 
under the SBLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that the Liberal government has 
changed the policy of the SBLA to a full cost recovery program. 
It just wants to take the money in and pass it out and there is 
no cost to government.  How can that be a benefit to small 
business when there is no cost to the government?  The successful 
small business carries the full cost of this program.  It is a 
tax on small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding his other point, Mr. Speaker, your point of relevance 
is very true.  We are dealing with small business, with maximum 
sales of $5 million and a maximum loan of $250,000.  I am not 
sure Conrad Black would waste his time making applications for 
that small of an amount.  So it is totally irrelevant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-21, an act to 
amend the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several parts to this act.  The reason Reform is 
opposing it is primarily because the act is not living up to 
sound fiscal principles.  The auditor general has repeatedly said 
that the SBLA needs revamping.  It has numerous loopholes in it 
that waste the taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things which greatly surprises us is that the auditor 
general's reports, the independent audits of government 
functions, ministries and programs, are never listened to.  Sound 
constructive principles are continually put in these very good 
documents of the auditor general.  Does the government listen to 
them?  No.  Not only no, but virtually never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back in history the number of times the auditor 
general's reports have been listened to and acted upon by the 
government can be counted on one hand.  And if it is not in the 
amount of thousands of dollars, it is millions and billions of 
dollars that these programs have cost.  I find it unfathomable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not neurosurgery.  The solutions are there yet 
governments, be they Liberal or Conservative, have repeatedly and 
consistently ignored these constructive solutions that would 
enable the government to spend the taxpayers' money in a wiser 
fashion.  Many of these ideas are not difficult to implement. 
They would be very cost effective and very useful not only for 
the public but also for the people working within these 
ministries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of observations from the auditor general's 
report that I would like to bring up which are critical of the 
SBLA.  He found that under the SBLA the taxpayer was on the hook 
for $210 million.  These are moneys that were lent by lenders to 
people and which the government, that is the taxpayer, picked up 
the tab for.  Why should the taxpayer be subsidizing the lenders 
which are the banks?  The banks have made record profits 
recently, in the billions of dollars, and they have been 
subsidized in the order of $210 million by the taxpayers of 
Canada.  Does this make sense?  This is idiocy.  It does not have 
to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We approve the extension of the SBLA because providing loans in 
a responsible fashion to small businesses so that they can get on 
their feet is exceedingly important.  Small businesses provide 
employment, not only for the people who starting them but also 
for the people they employ.  It is a good idea.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad idea is that the lender is not forced to adhere to 
strong principles.  What is worse is that there is nothing in the 
program to force the government to do an audit or an analysis of 
whether the money that is being lent is being lent properly by 
the lender or whether the borrowers are being assessed in a 
judicious fashion.  The auditor general showed that under the 
SBLA lenders were not being audited properly.  There is nothing 
in the program to force lenders to analyse borrowers properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result 40% of the loans made under the SBLA would have been 
made anyway.  Taxpayers are on the hook for $210 million.  It is 
unnecessary.  That money could be used for many other useful 
programs or it could be applied to debt reduction.  It is a waste 
of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that job creation figures have been inflated 
as much as five times to add justification to the program.  That 
is not useful.  We are advocating that the government take the 
initiative to ensure that the SBLA is audited, that borrowers are 
audited, that lenders are audited and that there is 
accountability.  At the end of the day this program like any 
program is paid for by the public.  It is paid for by the hard 
working, overtaxed public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe one thing to members of the public and that is to spend 
their money wisely and responsibly.  The SBLA is an example, as 
demonstrated by the auditor general, of a program where this is 
simply not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add some constructive suggestions to those that 
have already been made.  First, the SBLA eligibility requirements 
and conditions should produce the expected results.  There is no 
effective analysis, as I mentioned, and no cost benefit analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is important to define the expected level of 
incrementality.  Are we seeing an increase in the number of 
businesses that would not normally get loans other than through 
the SBLA program?  In other words, is the SBLA doing what it is 
supposed to do?  Again there is no analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there should be full cost recovery.  If we manage to get 
full cost recovery what will happen is that the money which is 
lent will be returned to the program to be used to provide money 
to other small businesses.  Obviously when $210 million are lost 
there will be less money to lend to other small businesses. Those 
who are treating the program irresponsibly are not only 
compromising the public.  They are also compromising other small 
businesses that wish to avail themselves of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, Industry Canada should assess whether the lender is 
exercising due care.  The lender is the bank.  Banks sometimes do 
not engage in good fiscal practices when lending money.  The 
claim from the lender must be assessed.  It must be shown that 
the lender is exercising due care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the interest paid to lenders is too high. Interestingly 
enough, while this is a loan provided by the government, the 
lending rate can be prime plus 3%.  The banks are not exercising 
due care.  They are saddling the taxpayer with an interest rate 
that is prime plus 3%.  That is not fair.  It is taking advantage 
of the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is important that we decrease the interest rates 
being charged by lenders.  I am sure that is something the 
government will be very interested in.  Some banks look to the 
program as a cash cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, better information on the performance of the SBLA is 
required.  Parliamentarians must have the information to assess 
the SBLA.  That is an important criticism by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some general comments about the economy. 
Providing loans and start-up money is very important for small 
businesses.  It overcomes one of the obstacles facing small 
businesses.  There are larger obstacles that all businesses face, 
that is the amount of red tape they have to deal with.  The 
government has to take a leadership role and work with the 
provinces to cut the red tape which has managed to put more 
barriers between east and west Canada than north and south.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must decrease taxes.  If we visit small businesses in our 
community what mantra do we hear?  “I can't hire.  I can't train 
because all the money goes to my taxes.  If I had less tax I 
would be able to hire more people, train more people, invest in 
my business and become more competitive, not only within the 
confines of our country but also internationally”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The barriers of high taxes, the barriers of excessive rules and 
regulations not only compromise competitiveness within our 
country but compromise competitiveness internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would like to take one international issue to 
heart which is exceedingly important, there are two major 
fracture lines through Japan and Indonesia right now.  The 
solutions are out there on the table from the International 
Monetary Fund, which have been given to both countries.  They are 
not acting upon it because of a failure in leadership.  The only 
way they will act on domestic changes is through international 
pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can argue that domestic issues are for a country to deal 
with.  However, if Japan and Indonesia fail to deal with their 
domestic problems an economic tsunami will come across the 
Pacific Ocean and smack into Canada.  It will be a significant 
and major impediment to our ability as a country to thrive 
economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that we disagree with Bill C-21.  I hope 
the government will take the constructive suggestions members of 
the Reform Party have put forward, implement them and build a 
better SBLA program for all Canadians.

<A NAME="LINK36">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (for the Minister of Transport, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-4, an act to amend the Canada Shipping 
Act (maritime liability), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as always, I consider it a 
privilege to rise in the House to bring attention to an important 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 is an act representing shipowners liability for 
maritime claims in general and for oil pollution damage in 
particular.  Transport Canada has made a strong commitment to 
updating the legislation which governs the shipping industry. 
Bill S-4 now before us deals with the modernization of the marine 
liability regimes contained in the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with maritime liability and proposes to increase 
the compensation available to Canadian claimants, in particular 
for claims related to ship source pollution damage.  In contrast 
to the current regime for oil spills, these amendments to the 
Canada Shipping Act will establish shipowners liability for 
environmental damage and allow for the cost of preventive 
measures taken in anticipation of a spill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was originally introduced as Bill C-58 in the 
last parliament by the former transport minister.  However the 
bill died on the order paper and was reintroduced in the Senate 
last October as Bill S-4.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends part IX and part XVI of the Canada Shipping Act. 
Part IX deals with global limitation of liability for maritime 
claims, while part XVI deals with liability and compensation for 
oil pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to part IX of the Canada Shipping Act are based 
on the 1976 convention on limitation of liability for maritime 
claims and its protocol adopted in May 1996 under the auspices of 
the International Maritime Organization, the IMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the proposed legislation will increase ship 
owners limits of liability and improve considerably the amount of 
compensation available to claimants involved in maritime 
accidents.  These limits are calculated on the basis of the 
ship's size and apply to all claims arising from the same 
accident.  This enables shipowners to assess their potential 
liability, which is an essential condition for commercial 
insurability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regime of global limitation contained in part IX of the 
Canada Shipping Act applies to all ships including pleasure 
vessels.  The current limit of liability for loss of life or 
personal injury for owners of vessels below 300 tonnes, which 
includes most pleasure vessels, is only $140,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can appreciate, this limit is totally inadequate and 
the new limit for vessels below 300 tonnes has been set at $1.5 
million, which is more in line with the liability levels long 
established in the automotive sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  I believe that if you look very clearly at the 
rules of the House we have a parliamentary secretary basically 
standing up and defending legislation that would put millions of 
dollars in the pocket of the Minister of Finance.  I think there 
is a collusion of interest here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows 
that this is not a point of order.  The parliamentary secretary 
is introducing a government bill, which is quite proper for him 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is quite wrong for the hon. member to rise on the 
guise of a point of order to engage in a debate essentially about 
what is contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, an hon. member cannot on a point 
of order in the House make accusations against a cabinet 
minister.  He cannot accuse someone of committing acts that are 
either illegal or otherwise, stand there with impugnity, make a 
statement and not be forced to withdraw and just leave it at 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask Your Honour to review what was said by the hon. 
member.  I believe that language is unacceptable.  If he were to 
try it outside the House, he might have a rather unpleasant 
surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it cannot be said outside and defended, perhaps he should be 
a bit more prudent with what he says in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am using the word 
potentially.  If you examine, Mr. Speaker, what happened in 
question period yesterday, this was the focus of question period 
all day yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member has made his 
point.  Perhaps he said potentially.  I thought he used words 
like that although I cannot remember the explicit words.  I did 
not think the words were as serious as the government House 
leader suggested in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believed it was not a point of order and I ruled it out of 
order on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared to review the blues to see if something that was 
completely wrong happened.  If something improper has happened I 
will come back to the House and deal with it. I have ruled the 
point of order out of order in any event and I invite the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to resume his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the government House 
leader for his intervention.  Quite frankly, I am used to the 
accusations, innuendoes and unproven circumstances from the hon. 
member for Charlotte so it does not really trouble me very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the hon. member is quite confused because this bill and 
its contents have nothing at all to do with the discussions in 
the House yesterday on a completely different bill and a 
completely different issue.  As usual, the hon. member for 
Charlotte is confused and misled.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention I speak of also provides special provisions for 
the liability of shipowners to their passengers.  This will be a 
new feature in our legislation which will apply to passenger 
vessels, ferries, tour boats and other vessels where passengers 
are carried on a ship under a contract of passenger carriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns were raised in the last Parliament that such a 
provision might not cover all passengers travelling by ship in 
Canada, specifically those carried without a contract of 
carriage.  In response to these concerns the Standing Committee 
on Transport proposed an amendment to Bill C-58 to ensure 
“persons other than crew carried on a ship without a contract of 
carriage” will benefit from the same regime of liability. This 
is of particular importance where passenger ships are hired by 
individuals or organizations for special occasion use by their 
clients, guests or employees, or where carriage of passengers by 
water is provided as part of land tour or hotel packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 also modifies some provisions of the convention in 
order to better meet Canadian requirements, in particular in 
respect of the application to all ships and the application to 
any person in possession of a ship.  These modifications have 
been made in conjunction with the definition of shipowner to 
ensure that the new regime will continue to apply to all vessels, 
seagoing or not, and also to people who have possession of a 
ship, for example ship repairers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act currently establishes limitation of 
liability for owners of docks, canals and ports.  This regime is 
strictly domestic in nature and provides a reciprocal balance to 
the regime applicable to shipowners in the sense that both 
shipowners and dock owners can limit their liability against each 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This regime has been maintained in Bill S-4 with the following 
amendments. The limits of liability have been increased. The 
right to limit liability has been extended to servants and agents 
of the owners of docks, canals and ports in order to achieve 
uniformity with a similar provision respecting the agents and 
servants of shipowners.  We have removed any reference to the 
nationality of the largest ship for the calculation of the limit 
of liability to achieve a more flexible application of this 
provision which currently uses for this calculation the largest 
British ship in the area of the accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I turn to the second issue presented in the bill, the 
regime of liability and compensation for oil pollution damage, I 
will address the economic implications of the amendments to the 
Canada Shipping Act in respect of the global limitation of 
liability.  In respect of commercial vessel owners, those who are 
insured in mutual protection and indemnity associations, 
generally known as P and I clubs, will not likely see any 
substantive change in their insurance rates since the coverage 
already provided by these associations is unlimited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some commercial ship owners who are not currently insured in the 
P and I clubs may experience an upfront increase in insurance 
cost as a result of this revision of limits proposed in Bill S-4. 
In most cases the actual impact will depend on actual claims 
experienced under the new limitation regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to pleasure vessel owners.  The vast majority 
of them are already insured to the level of liability proposed in 
this revision, while others will have to seek additional 
insurance to be fully protected against the new limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adjustment that is likely to occur in the pleasure vessel 
insurance market under the new regime is not expected to raise 
the cost of pleasure vessel insurance to a level that would 
approach the level of other types of personal insurance, 
especially auto insurance.  Most pleasure vessel owners already 
carry a liability insurance in the range of $1 million so they 
should not expect any increase in their cost of insurance as a 
result of this new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue in Bill S-4 is the revision of the existing 
regime of liability and compensation for oil pollution damage. 
This regime was last revisited in 1989 when Canada implemented 
and acceded to the 1969 international convention on civil 
liability for oil pollution damage and the 1971 international 
fund convention.  The 1969 convention established the liability 
of owners of laden tankers for oil pollution damage while the 
1971 fund convention provided complementary compensation to the 
extent that protection under the 1969 convention was inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to participating in the international oil pollution 
compensation fund, Canada has its own domestic compensation fund 
called the ship source oil pollution fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fund of first resort for all claimants for oil 
pollution damage in Canada and in waters under Canadian 
jurisdiction.  Canadian contributions to the international fund 
are paid from the ship source oil pollution fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1969 and 1971 conventions were updated in 1992 when 
protocols were adopted under the auspices of the International 
Maritime Organization.  Under the 1992 protocols, the amount of 
compensation available for pollution damage caused by oil tankers 
was increased from $120 million per incident to approximately 
$270 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other important changes were made in the 1992 
protocols to improve the original conventions.  Shipowners are 
now liable for the cost of reasonable measures of reinstatement 
where oil pollution from a ship results in damage to the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The geographic scope of application of the convention will now 
include the exclusive economic zone of Canada which extends 200 
nautical miles from shore.  The protocols also extend the 
convention to claims for preventive measures taken before a spill 
to prevent or minimize pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this convention now also applies to empty tankers with 
specific reference to the voyage subsequent to the voyage during 
which it was carrying oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 will implement the provisions of the 1992 protocols, 
thus increasing the level of compensation available to victims of 
pollution damage caused by oil tankers in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation will enable Canada to follow many other 
countries that have terminated their membership with the old 
regime and moved quickly to the 1992 regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until Canada follows suit, we will continue to be exposed to 
higher contributions to the international fund due to the reduced 
membership in the old regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore strongly urge this House to consider this important 
legislation expeditiously.  The sooner Canada can accede to the 
new regime, the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to discuss the amendments proposed 
to Bill S-4 by the Senate.  These amendments remove from the bill 
a proposed modification to the definition of pollutant, which 
raised concerns among the industry representatives who appeared 
before the standing Senate committee on transport and 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment to Bill S-4 will allow more time for discussion 
between the government and the industry on the definition of 
pollutant and whether it should be modified in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to endorse, on behalf of the government, the 
amendments made to this bill.  I urge others to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the changes I have outlined here for the Canada 
Shipping Act would not have been possible without the continued 
support of our stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our consultations, Transport Canada officials have spoken 
at length with shipowners, passengers, cargo owners, the oil 
industry, marine insurers and the marine legal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity to thank these industry groups for their 
participation in this reform.  Their strong support of this bill 
has been very gratifying for all those involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport is 
involved in the study of rail passenger transportation in this 
country.  Due to the importance of moving quickly on this 
legislation, I would hope that my colleagues and I can move to 
spend a day on Bill S-4 in committee so that we can deal with it 
expeditiously partly because also we have dealt with this bill in 
its old form before the dissolution of the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has indicated to us that it has been there, it has 
done that, it has talked to the committee and now it wants to 
move forward with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to my colleagues on both sides of this House 
coming together and moving quickly with the legislation when it 
comes before committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I concur with what the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport said.  He has given a good review. There 
are some points I want to add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning what cuts this side of the House to the core is 
when the hon. member mentions that it was the Senate that brought 
in amendments to this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss not to mention my colleague who brought up the 
point of order earlier.  I am not going to discuss the ruling of 
the Chair but I do want to reinforce a statement for everybody in 
the hopes that never again in the history of this Parliament at 
least a Bill goes to the Senate and the Senate makes the 
amendments before it comes back to the elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practice is totally archaic, totally not in touch with 
today's reality.  That really bothers me.  I am not afraid to go 
into the standing committee on transportation and discuss with 
the hon. member the welfare of the industry across Canada.  This 
side of the House is insulted to the highest degree when my hon. 
colleague raises many issues with regard to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 53 of the Constitution Act states the rules concerning 
the breach of the privileges of this House.  I want to read this 
into the record because it directly concerns me. Standing Order 
80(1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aids and supplies granted to the sovereign by the Parliament 
of Canada are the sole gift of the House of Commons, and all 
bills for granting such aids and supplies ought to begin with the 
House, as it is the undoubted right of the House to direct, 
limit, and appoint in all such bills, the ends, purposes, 
considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of 
such grants, which are not alterable by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we like to admit it our not, we are dealing with 
millions of dollars. This is nothing small.  We are talking about 
liabilities up to $270 million.  For that reason I feel very sad 
that we have to come back to the committee and discuss amendments 
that came from the Senate.  That was totally unnecessary.  To 
members on this side of the House it is considered a total insult 
to being elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few more comments with regard to this before I get to 
the bill itself.  The Senate was restricted from originating 
money bills in 1867.  It is a fine point of law whether this is a 
money bill or not.  It is not a money bill in some terms but 
because it deals with the potential of government expenditures 
that is a question we have to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introduction of bills in the Senate gives the Senate more 
legitimacy as unofficial, unelected people.  It gives it more 
legitimacy or as much legitimacy in this bill as members on this 
side of the House and members of the standing committee on 
transportation.  I beg the hon. member, please do not do this 
again in the life of this Parliament.  Please do not ignore the 
people on this side of the House who are elected.  It is not that 
we are going to oppose this bill.  We are not going to oppose the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have every reason to believe what the hon. gentleman has said, 
that it has received the support and consultation of the 
stakeholders.  That is the good part.  I will be asking that 
question when we are in committee, if all the stakeholders have 
been consulted. There will probably be some more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the hon. member please, on behalf of this House, on behalf 
of Canada, do not put this bill to the Senate before it comes 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman has done a good job, as well he should 
because he has been with this bill for a long time.  There are 
some things that I would like to add that perhaps the hon. 
gentleman has not added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 is designed to increase the compensation available to 
public and private Canadian claimants, for maritime claims in 
general, and particularly for claims related to ship source oil 
pollution. As a result of these amendments in S-4, the maximum 
compensation available against the international oil pollution 
compensation fund would more than double. It has doubled to the 
point of $270 million.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say that Bill S-4 enables Canada to accede to several 
international conventions on marine liability.  Thus it 
harmonizes, and I emphasize the word harmonizes, the Canadian 
maritime liability legislation with that of the other major 
maritime nations and previous legislation really did not do that. 
In that respect there is support of the Reform Party because it 
brings the bill up to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention some key features. This bill provides for a 
substantial increase in shipowners' liability limits. In this era 
there are ships that are double and triple the size of former 
vessels using our harbours, international waterways and Canadian 
waterways. Maybe the liability limits are not even high enough, 
but at least it recognizes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates a procedure for rapid amendments, and that is a 
good point. I do not know how rapid they can be, but when we 
think back to the terrible oil disaster off the British Columbia 
coast with the Exxon ship, it was a long drawn out procedure. 
Hopefully this bill will speed that up because Canadians in 
particular, and people around the world I am sure, are more 
environmentally conscious of these things than they have ever 
been before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to mention is that the bill adds a 
provision for liability limits for those small ships that still 
ply our harbour.  The limits of the liability adjust to the size. 
It is like the limits for a Honda car adjusting to a Cadillac. 
Maybe my hon. colleague over there has a Cadillac, I do not know. 
He does not. But if he did have, he would have to pay more in 
liability limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes special provisions for liability of shipowners to 
their passengers. My hon. colleague mentioned that in this case 
most of these people already carry a fair amount of liability 
insurance. I am wondering though if it would not be a good idea 
to jot down as a memo that we need to take a look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A million dollars liability insurance. Is that $1 million per 
person? I am not quite sure what is meant by that. There needs to 
be assurance that these boats are carrying enough liability 
insurance because passengers are more important than cargo. We 
need to take a look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill extends the application of maritime liability rules to 
all ships at sea and inland.  That is important. It is not just 
the oceangoing voyages. And it extends, as my hon. friend has 
mentioned, the exclusive economic zone. Even in the recent events 
of the last few days maybe we need to take a look at that as 
well. As our industry grows and as Canada becomes more of a lead 
player in this particular field, we should take another look at 
that particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern day communications have made it possible that we now have 
a day to day means by which we can be in communication, much more 
so than ever before.  With the use of modern communications 
techniques, radar and so on, the global limitations of liability 
therefore become a very important economic instrument in the 
operation of any ship. We agree that the clauses as they relate 
to that become very, very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raising the maximum compensation, what I worked out is $120 
million to $270 million, some may think is pretty hefty, but if 
we look at the scope of the act, some may even argue it is not 
high enough. It is certainly not too high. 
As I mentioned earlier, when we have these huge boats now 
doubling and tripling the capacity, this is not out of order and 
maybe it is not high enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport there is a need to further solidify Canada's place in 
the international maritime community.  We are very big players 
now.  I suggest to the hon. member that we may get to be an even 
bigger player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada grows there is no question that our part of the 
maritime industry is going to increase.  Because of this, through 
the implementation of both sets of conventions and the protocols, 
and quite frankly I think there has been very limited negative 
feedback concerning the contents of this bill and its predecessor 
Bill C-58, the reaction that I and my party would have is that we 
will support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one principle in particular that I would like to inform 
the hon. minister about.  It has a theme which this party adopts 
and that is user pay.  I believe that is within this bill and we 
can support it on that merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 appears to be a sound bill.  It strives for a balance 
between the shipowners and the claimants which appears to be 
fair.  But we still have to allow time for the standing committee 
to send out the message that if anyone else, a stakeholder, has 
an interest, they will be advised that they can appear before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill exposes the shipowners' insurance companies to major 
financial liability.  It also provides for a transfer of payments 
out of Canada's ship source oil pollution fund to the 
international oil pollution compensation fund.  It is 
questionable that a bill with such ramifications should indeed 
come from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share this with the hon. parliamentary secretary 
as it relates to this bill.  This bill indirectly relates to Bill 
C-9 because they use the harbours, the insurance claims and so 
on.  I refer him to page 14 of the act.  At the bottom of page 14 
it talks about the right that is exercised, that there are 
reasonable grounds to believe there are records in dwelling 
houses related to the reporting of contributing to oil spills and 
all of that.  I am not disputing that but it is something that is 
really difficult for me to imagine at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope none of Canada's oceangoing vessels are involved in this 
but Canada's ports are now a major entry point for the worst type 
of pollutant this society has.  We can clean up an oil spill. It 
is very costly but eventually we can clean it up.  We cannot 
totally erase the damage.  It is there.  But on a recent national 
television program it was shown in graphic detail that coming 
through our ports are large amounts of hard drugs.  They come 
into Canada and find their way into the U.S. market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that in committee we could take a look at this 
catastrophe.  It is hard to clean up a young person's life which 
has been ruined by drugs. 
If we in Canada are truly going to say no to drugs, if we are 
going to have our schools say no to drugs and if parents are 
going to say no to drugs, then it is incumbent upon all the 
players involved, including the shipowners with this bill and the 
port authorities with Bill C-9, to get serious about this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may say that is not relevant, but I believe it 
is.  If we can search a house to obtain records to prove that 
someone has used a boat to bring in oil which has polluted this 
country, then the same thing should exist here, in co-operation 
with other branches of the government, and we should have the 
same power to say no to drugs at Canadian ports. As a Canadian 
citizen I was hurt when I watched that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform will be supporting this bill.  However, I would like to 
reiterate that it should not have originated in the Senate. 
Please introduce legislation in this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
S-4 was first debated in the Senate, as its name indicates. I can 
therefore think of no better way of opening debate than by going over 
what was said at third reading in the Senate on December 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will improve our liability regimes for maritime claims. 
The proposed legislation consists of two sets of amendments, those 
relating to limitation of liability for maritime claims in part IX of 
the Canada Shipping Act, and those relating to liability and 
compensation for oil pollution damage in part XVI of the same act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, the amendments will provide implementation of 
international conventions of which Canada is a signatory. 
First, our current legislation concerning limitation for maritime claims 
is contained in part IX of the Canada Shipping Act and is based on the 
international convention adopted in 1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limits of liability set out in that convention and, by this 
very fact, in our legislation, are very low, too low. This helps neither 
claimants nor shipowners. In fact, current limits are so unsatisfactory 
that, most of the time, claimants have had to take legal action to try 
to go above the limits to obtain adequate compensation. This has often 
resulted in long and protracted litigation with uncertain results for 
both the claimants and shipowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for a shipowner to assess his potential 
liability. 
With higher realistic limits of liability as proposed in Bill S-4, it 
will be much easier for all parties involved to settle claims amicably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new regime of liability for maritime claims is based on an 
international convention adopted in 1976 and its protocol adopted in 
1996. The 1996 protocol to the convention contains a new procedure, for 
future amendments of limits of liability, which responds to concerns 
raised in the past that the method of revision of the limits was too 
cumbersome and costly. It will now be easier to amend the limits in the 
international convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as with the regime of limitation of liability for 
maritime claims, it will now be feasible to increase the limits of 
liability for oil pollution damage by order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adoption of Bill S-4 will enable Canada to follow many 
other countries which moved rapidly, more rapidly than we did, to 
the 1992 regime and, as a result, terminated their membership in 
the old regime in May 1977, with effect from May 1998.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give a brief description of the articles designed 
to achieve these objectives, beginning with those having to do with 
general maritime claims, as implemented by the Convention on 
Limitation of Liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 1 defines those persons entitled to limit liability 
under the convention.  They are the same as those in the current 
legislation, i.e. shipowners, charterers, persons having an 
interest in or possession of a ship, and managers and operators, 
but the benefits of the convention are extended to salvors who are 
not operating from a ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, article 2 defines the types of claims subject to 
limitation of liability under the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 3 defines the types of claims excepted from limitation 
under the convention.  These are primarily claims for salvage, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 6 sets increased limits of liability for all claims 
other than those mentioned in article 7, covered by the convention 
and arising on any distinct occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This now brings me to claims for pollution by oil or other 
pollutants.  The definition of “Convention ship” is extended to 
include ships with persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil from an 
earlier cargo, and the definition of pollutant is amended to 
include aquatic organisms and pathogens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 4 and 5 also amend the definition of “ship” to 
indicate clearly that it applies to vessels navigating Canadian or 
inland waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 extends the application of part XVI to Canada's 
exclusive economic zone or that of any other party to the 
Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, clause 10 significantly increases the responsibility 
of the owners of Convention ships by setting the limits prescribed 
in 1992, which were amendments to the Convention of 1969.  This 
means an increase of 326% over the limits of the 1969 Convention 
and of 125% over the recovery permitted under the 1971 Convention. 
This is a very significant increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve the objectives set, the bill implements, 
as I said, the conventions of 1976 and 1996.  It also implements, 
I should point out, the 1992 protocol amending the International 
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and the 
International Convention on the Establishment of an International 
Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill amends various provisions pertaining to the 
Ship-source Oil Pollution Fund.  It is therefore a total overhaul 
to ensure compliance with the Convention signed by Canada—a 
slightly tardy realignment of Canadian legislation with these 
conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is happy to see that the government, 
hounded by the obligation to implement the conventions it has 
signed, must concern itself with making shipowners more 
responsible.  We are obviously in favour of increased 
responsibility. 
We still have the memory of the unfortunate <I>Irving Whale </I>episode 
fresh in our minds.  It cost the taxpayers of Canada and Quebec 
over $30 million to raise that barge, which makes it seem that the 
people of Canada and of Quebec were more responsible for the 
shipwreck than the shipowners themselves.  One can see how 
ridiculous it all got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such situations must be avoided in the future.  It is not up 
to the government to compensate for the laxness of certain 
irresponsible companies.  Legislation must be therefore put in 
place to avoid such incidents in future.  Hydrocarbon pollution is 
not the taxpayer's responsibility.  We support the polluter-pay 
principle, precisely in order to stop companies causing serious 
environmental damage from getting away scot free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, a need for a clear differentiation between 
the government implementing a user-pay system and a polluter-pay 
system. 
Where user-pay is concerned, we remember all too clearly the bad 
decisions made recently by the federal government concerning 
charges for Canadian Coast Guard services.  The government did not 
agree to carry out impact studies before the new rates were set, 
thus refusing to heed 75% of the people consulted.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government divided Canada into three zones: west coast, 
Atlantic coast and St. Lawrence—Great Lakes, for which it set 
different rates.  As a result, Quebec is disadvantaged because it 
is charged more in order to cover part of the costs of the services 
to Newfoundland, the province of origin of the minister behind the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, charging for Coast Guard services will impact 
heavily on Quebec and Canadian ports, because United States bound 
vessels using the St. Lawrence and the seaway but not putting in to 
any Canadian port do not pay for Coast Guard services.  This 
measure detracts a great deal from the competitivity of Canadian 
and Quebec ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government decided to pass on the bill to shipowners 
and to local port authorities, without first doing something about the 
management of the coast guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy to apply the principle of financial and 
environmental accountability to shipowners. The government will have to 
maintain its principles, while keeping an open mind to make changes in 
the application of the act, should it trigger some perverse effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport must not act like his colleague, the 
Minister of Fisheries, who remains so stubborn. He has to be open to 
change, while preserving his goal of making shipowners and their 
creditors accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle 
underlying Bill S-4. 
However, we look forward to the next stages, when we will hear those 
most concerned by the bill and, if necessary, use their comments and 
reactions to make it a better act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to say 
a few words on the bill before us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing a bill to amend the Canada Shipping Act, a 
maritime liability bill, which my party supports.  Bill S-4 is 
part of the Canada Shipping Act reform.  Parts of the Canada 
Shipping Act are old and out of date with today's realities. The 
NDP believes it is time to modernize the Canada Shipping Act. The 
revision of the existing limitation of liability for maritime 
claims is a very important step toward the modernization of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to limits for general maritime claims, the existing 
regime under the Canada Shipping Act is largely based on a 1997 
international convention relating to the limitation of liability 
of owners of seagoing ships or vessels.  The limits on liability 
set out have naturally lost value as a result of inflation over 
the years.  Most maritime nations consider the limits of 
liability set out in 1957 inadequate.  That is understandable 
since 1957 was more than 40 years ago.  Inflation was very high 
periodically during those years.  In the late seventies inflation 
hit more than 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1957 convention was replaced by the 1976 convention on 
limitation of liability for maritime claims and its 1996 protocol 
as a global standard for the limitation of liability for maritime 
claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members from the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the 
government have pointed out, these amendments to the Canada 
Shipping Act implement the provisions of the 1992 protocol to the 
1969 convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage and 
the 1971 convention of the international fund for the 
compensation of oil pollution damage. We support many aspects of 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain made a point I agree 
with. I want to say a few words about the point I agree with for 
members of the Reform Party.  That may seem kind of odd.  He is 
already wondering what this point is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the point that it is very unfortunate that this bill 
originates not in the House of Commons but in the Senate.  The 
government is introducing more and more legislation from the 
Senate.  I think that is a real affront to democracy.  Why should 
we be debating this piece of legislation which does not originate 
here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the elected members of Parliament coming from five 
different parties in the House of Commons.  The Senate is not 
elected, not accountable and not democratic.  Its members are 
there from when they are appointed to the age 75.  I think that 
is a real affront to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am shocked by the government across the way introducing more 
and more legislation from the Senate.  Why does the Prime 
Minister not screw up his courage and put on the order paper a 
bill to abolish the existing Senate?  That is exactly what the 
Canadian people are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Thompson is only a catalyst, the tip of the iceberg.  He 
is not the only senator who hardly ever shows up in the Senate. 
He is not the only Senator who is not elected. None of the 
senators is elected or accountable.  It is a real affront to 
democracy to have a legislative body in the 20th century, almost 
the 21st, that is not accountable.  It is a hangover from the 
feudal days of the past and it is about time we abolish that 
particular Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder some people think this place is a farce.  The people 
are telling us to abolish that unelected place.  The people of 
Canada want their say and they want to speak out.  It is about 
time we, the members of Parliament, said no, enough is enough. 
We, as members of Parliament, should say we are not going to take 
it any more, enough is enough.  We are going to originate bills 
in this House through a democratic and transparent process, which 
is exactly what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should just stop right now in protest. Therefore I move:

lost. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill S-4, which amends the 
Canada Shipping Act as it pertains to maritime liability.  It has 
taken a long time, too long in fact, for the bill to get to this 
stage, but because it is here now I am very pleased to speak to 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Saint John, New Brunswick, where we have the largest 
tankers in the world coming into our harbour because we have the 
largest privately owned oil refinery in Canada.  I have had the 
pleasure of being taken out in a helicopter to fly over the 
largest tankers in the world.  It is something to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in Saint John, New Brunswick, we have something that is 
unique in Canada and not anywhere else in Canada.  It is a swivel 
anchor because we have the highest tides in the world.  Mr. K. C. 
Irving devised this swivel anchor.  When the largest tankers in 
the world come in, they hook on to this anchor out in the bay. As 
the tides rise we can see the tankers swing around and swing back 
again.  It is very unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my colleagues to know that Saint John, New Brunswick, is 
a very unique place.  I invite all my colleagues to visit Saint 
John.  When they come we will take them to the refinery so they 
can see what I am referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill began as Bill C-58 in 1996.  It went through a 
committee process and died on the order paper with the election 
call in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important changes contained in the legislation.  It is 
certainly a shame that the government did not recognize the 
importance of it at that time but instead chose other priorities 
over this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having said that, we are here now and we are dealing 
with the bill.  I am pleased to be here to speak to it.  The bill 
will substantially increase the amount of compensation available 
to Canadian claimants for maritime claims in general and for oil 
pollution damage in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also harmonizes Canadian rules for maritime liability with 
those of other maritime nations and will enable Canada to accede 
to relevant international conventions.  This point is important. 
We must bring our rules into harmony with those of our major 
trading partners that carry both import and export cargoes each 
day to and from Canadian shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the part of the bill dealing with limitation of 
liability for maritime claims, Bill S-4 amends part IX of the 
Canada Shipping Act to implement the provisions of the 1976 
convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims and its 
1996 protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 therefore will—and I am sure all my colleagues in the 
NDP would want to hear this—first, substantially increase ship 
owners limits of liability; second, allow cabinet on the 
recommendation of the transport minister to implement new limits 
of liability to reflect inflation; and, third, limit the 
liability of owners of small ships of less than 300 tonnes to $1 
million for loss of life or personal injury and $500,000 for 
other claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also extend the application of the liability regime to 
all ships operating in Canada's inland waters, not just sea going 
vessels.   Finally, it increases liability limits for owners of 
docks, canals and ports for property damage claims to the greater 
of $2 million or an amount based on the tonnage of the largest 
ship that has docked in the area in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of the bill relates to oil pollution 
liability and compensation.  Bill S-4 will amend part XVI of the 
Canada Shipping Act to implement the provisions of the 1992 
protocol to the 1969 civil liability convention and the 1971 
convention on the establishment of an international fund for 
compensation of oil pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will make ship owners liable for clean-up costs for oil 
pollution damage, and that is long overdue.  It will make 
compensation available for pollution damage caused by tankers 
with residues of oil remaining from their previous cargo.  It 
will also make it possible to recover costs incurred for 
preventive measures in anticipation of a spill from a tanker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum compensation currently available to claimants in an 
oil pollution incident is approximately $120 million.  As a 
result of the bill, the amount will be more than double that to 
$270 million.  That is important and is long overdue.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we are pleased to support the legislation.  As I 
have stated, it is long overdue and very much needed in the 
maritime industry in Canada.  We are supporting it because it 
will improve the compensation for the benefit of all Canadian 
claimants involved in any maritime accidents in general and 
certainly for purposes related to pollution claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the important harmonization of our laws with other nations 
in the world benefits every participant.  Here I am speaking 
about all participants involved in maritime trade, shipowners, 
cargo owners and charters, by providing consistent, 
internationally recognized and accepted rules which deal with the 
economic consequences of unfortunate accidents at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without these formal rules, international shipping on which 
Canada relies to a tremendous degree would otherwise become 
extremely expensive and unpredictable.  As a result, it would 
have negative consequences for the Canadian industry on the 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the legislation and only wish that it could have been 
moved a little more quickly through the legislative process.  I 
want to thank all of those who were involved in bringing it 
before the House and the senators who worked so hard to make sure 
it was here today.  It is good legislation and we will support 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
could the member comment on the appropriateness of whether or not 
the bill should be brought forward from the House of Commons or 
from the Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel it does not 
matter whether it comes from the Senate or from here.  It is 
whether it is a good bill or a bad bill and whether we have an 
opportunity to vote on it and to speak on it.  It is long overdue 
and I am pleased that it is here.  If it was the Senate that made 
it come here today, I am pleased because, coming from a shipping 
town, it is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being in the House today and hearing the comments that are being 
made about other people who also work for the betterment of 
Canadians, I found it tugging at my heart.  Yes, we are also 
saying there has to be Senate reform and the senators are saying 
this.  It is not just the Reformers who are saying it.  Everybody 
knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to do what we did today was a waste of time and energy 
and a cost to taxpayers.  This should not have been done.  We 
should have continued on with the debate.  This has tugged at my 
heart.  It was not easy because I know people who work hard in 
the Senate and I know some who do not show up.  You deal with it. 
The majority of them work hard.  If we need to make changes then 
we can deal with it in a way in which we do not have to point 
fingers at people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the bill goes, whether it came from the House, from 
the government side, from this side or from the Senate, if it is 
a good bill we deal with it.  This is a good bill and I am 
pleased to be here to say that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too wanted to lend my 
comments to the hon. member and thank her for her remarks on this 
piece of legislation, Bill S-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind those opposite who spoke so negatively to the fact that 
the bill came forward through the Senate that in 1986 the 
government initiated Bill C-58.  It was introduced in the House. 
The House dealt with it at second reading and put it into a 
committee of the House of Commons.  The House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Transport dealt with the issue, heard witnesses, put 
forward the amendments, came back to the House of Commons at 
report stage and then, because of an election, it died on the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer the hon. member's question about why we did not 
move it sooner because of its importance in the marine sector. 
We dealt with the marine sector in our dealings with the Canadian 
port authorities.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were seized with Bill C-9, the Canada Marine Act.  That took 
precedence.  The member would agree with me that Bill C-9 is a 
very important bill for Canada.  That is why we dealt with that 
bill first.  At the same time we had the opportunity to move the 
bill, this particular bill, the old Bill C-58 which this House 
dealt with, through the Senate as Bill S-4.  We are just making 
effective use of valuable legislative time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that it does 
not matter where the bills are introduced.  We supported the 
NDP's motion today because of the procedural move, as all 
opposition parties voted against the government in a procedural 
move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have waited a long time.  A city like mine has the largest 
tankers in the world at our ports.  We can see them out there 
with the oil rigs.  We are saying that this is long overdue.  I 
thank the hon. member on the government side for working to 
ensure the bill's consideration in the House today.  I thank all 
of those who were involved in bringing this bill before the House 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I reiterate on behalf of the NDP to the parliamentary 
secretary that if he does not like democracy, he should think of 
another line of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has very good merit but that is not what upsets us. The 
fact is that amendments were made in the Senate where senators 
are appointed and not elected.  That is why we voted to adjourn 
today.  If the member does not like democracy in action, that is 
just too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  The Senate could have made amendments 
anyway you dummy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  If <I>Hansard</I> will show 
he used unparliamentary language against me, I would like him to 
apologize before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair did not hear any 
unparliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  We did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry the Chair did not hear it. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I must admit, but it 
was a term of endearment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair did not hear terms of 
endearment or otherwise.  I am afraid I am in the dark about this 
and will remain so unless I am illumined.  I will consider the 
matter closed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not often that I take issue with the hon. member 
but it does matter where a bill originates.  It is important. 
This is the elected House of Commons.  We, the members of 
Parliament who sit in this Chamber, were elected and given a 
mandate by the people of Canada to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people down the hallway were not elected.  They were not 
given any form of legitimacy by the people in Canada.  In fact I 
would suggest that they do not have the moral authority to 
continue to sit in that Chamber. It is quite clear that the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians want to see the Senate 
abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the cost involved in having a vote 
in the House of Commons.  I would simply ask her to compare the 
cost involved of running the Senate, the tens of millions of 
dollars involved.  I do not support Senate reform because I do 
not believe the Senate should continue to exist. The Andrew 
Thompson case is but an example of a very serious problem with 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work undertaken by the Senate is work that should be done by 
committees of this House, by elected members who are accountable 
to the people of Canada.  It seems that at some point we have to 
take seriously the question of the future of the Senate.  It is 
not enough to simply say that it would require a constitutional 
amendment and that it is unlikely the constitutional amendment 
would be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the government must show some leadership 
and begin the process.  I believe abolition of the Senate is the 
will of Canadians.  However, if reforming the Senate were the 
will of the people of Canada, we should at the very least begin 
the process. 
If not, the Senate will continue to carry on, continue to be 
discredited by the people of Canada. Not only do the actions of 
the Senate discredit itself, but they also discredit the House of 
Commons I would submit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this bill should have been initiated by the 
government or by a member in this House. If the bill has the 
merit that the hon. member says it has, then perhaps an 
explanation is in order as to why we had to rely on unelected 
senators to introduce this bill.  Why could the bill not have 
been introduced by the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything, it is a reflection on the people in this House if 
we do not have the foresight or the knowledge or the ability to 
recognize the merit of the bill. I think it does matter where a 
bill originates. All bills should originate in this House. It 
should be the elected members of this House who determine public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, to my hon. friend for whom 
I have a great deal of respect, I just want him to know that it 
did go throw the process. It went through the House here and it 
was referred to the Senate, which is the normal process as we 
already know. Perhaps hon. members feel that should be looked at 
and assessed, but it did go through the House and it went through 
the normal process. The Senate looked at it and it will go 
through it again and it is over when it comes back from the 
Senate. There will be others that will come, but it goes through 
a normal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time in the last Parliament when I personally had an 
opportunity to see the role they had to play when we did not have 
an official opposition that represented the whole of Canada. 
There was an opposition there that worked extremely hard. I would 
say they did not play party politics in the Senate all the time. 
They did what they thought was best. So there is a time when 
there is a need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard talk today about heartstrings, and let me tell you my 
heartstrings are pulled as well when I think about Bill S-4. 
Except that they are pulled in a little bit different direction 
maybe than what the hon. member referred to when I asked 
questions before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to section 53 of the Constitution Act that provides that 
only the House of Commons may table money bills, bills which 
require the expenditure of public funds or involving a tax or 
impost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With all due respect to the Chair, it may be a point of 
information for the Chair on this point of order, but when debate 
is occurring on this particular bill, and we are talking about 
S-4 and how it applies to marine liability, some may question 
whether this is part of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the hon. member rises to speak on whether or not 
the Senate should have initiated this particular bill, I think 
the Chair has to keep in mind that the Speaker of the House of 
Commons has already ruled on S-4 and its legitimacy on whether or 
not it came from the Senate. I would submit to the Speaker that 
any references as to whether the bill originated here or there is 
out of order and we can stick to the issue at hand, which is 
marine liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I certainly know that the hon. member 
for Calgary West will want to ensure that he does not reflect on 
a ruling of the Chair, which as he knows is contrary to the rules 
of the House. Reflecting on a ruling where the bill has been held 
to be properly before this Chamber and on which the Speaker has 
already ruled as I understand it, would be improper. So I know he 
will want to move his remarks along very smartly and avoid any 
suggestion that he is reflecting on the ruling of the Chair and 
discuss the merits of the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the comments 
in terms of the smart comments on behalf of the member for 
Calgary West.  I would never indeed question the good judgment of 
the Chair.  We all value your position, Mr. Speaker, and the 
contributions that you have made to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must however talk to the whole idea of this bill not having 
been considered by five official parties as represented in the 
House. In its place of origination since the election on June 2, 
it has only had the representation of two parties, and those not 
being in this Chamber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that really speaks to whether or not this bill is 
actually an accountable one, whether or not it circumvents 
government accountability because indeed, there are five parties 
represented in the House. If the other three have not had a voice 
in this piece of legislation and if it did not originate here 
when it does involve something that has to do with money, then it 
is a very difficult matter indeed.  It strains the democratic 
accountability of both houses and of Parliament generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this bill needs to be accountable to the constituents 
of five respective parties as opposed to just two parties, one of 
which only represents 7% of the population as it stands here in 
the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want Bill S-4 to be reflective of an archaic, 
unelected, unaccountable and unrepresentative body.  We believe 
that this is a slow erosion of the power of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a member who sits in the other Chamber, 
somebody I talked to just this afternoon.  Last year the Senate 
had 67 sittings of which many of the people in that place only 
sat for roughly 50% of the time. I would like to go through the 
math of this for a second.  I think it is pertinent.  At 67 
sittings a year with a salary in excess of $64,000 a year that 
would work out— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The debate is not germane to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I must say that the Chair is having 
trouble determining how it is that the number of sitting days in 
the Senate has any relevance to Bill S-4 which is before us. I 
would invite the hon. member to move more quickly than he has 
been moving to get his comments on to the subject matter of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will quickly wrap up my 
point with regard to the originators of this bill, the one last 
point being that the originators of this bill get more than 
$1,000 a day.  I wrap up by saying that this bill should be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4, an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, be not now 
read a second time but that the order be discharged, the bill 
withdrawn and the subject matter thereof referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions and comments.  Resuming 
debate. On a question, the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to seek clarification with regard to the motion that has 
been tabled.  The intent of the motion appears to be motivated by 
whether or not there is jurisdiction of the Senate to do this. 
Indeed the House has already dealt with that and it is proper for 
the Senate to have initiated the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of that and in view of the fact that it has been 
requested that the bill be referred to the committee on procedure 
and House affairs, I would ask the Speaker to rule on the 
admissibility of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has ruled that the 
motion appears to be entirely admissible.  The motion does not 
state any reason for the referral.  It simply says that the bill 
be not now read a second time but that the subject matter be 
referred to the committee on procedure and House affairs. In the 
opinion of the Chair, the motion is admissible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my riding, we have a 
huge shipyard that is as big as the one in the riding of the hon. member 
for Saint John. I pay attention any time the issue of shipping is raised 
because of its connection with shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is right across from Quebec City, on the opposite shore 
of the St. Lawrence River, on which there is a lot of shipping. So, we 
in Lévis want to see as many ships as possible. But at the same time, we 
want to make sure that, should an accident occur, these ships will not 
harm the environment. 
Bill S-4 deals with liability for shipping accidents and oil pollution 
damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I was not in favour of looking for ways to delay 
passage of this bill, essentially because this bill should have been 
passed a long time ago. Why has it not been passed into law yet? Because 
last year, Prime Minister Chrétien decided to call an early election 
because he feared the impact of the Employment Insurance Act reform on 
people in the maritimes. That was not a bad idea, since the government 
majority fell significantly from what it was in the last Parliament, and 
had he waited until the fall, he would probably have ended up with a 
minority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may have been a good move for the Prime Minister, but not for 
this bill to amend the Canada Shipping Act, which was first passed in 
1932. The changes will be implemented in stages because the government 
is not quite ready to put all the new provisions into effect. The 
government has decided to make the changes required in two stages, and 
this part covers only what the government is almost forced to do as a 
signatory to the 1976 international convention, which was to come into 
force in 1990, but whose implementation was later postponed to March 31, 
1996, at the latest. But the government negotiated an extension which 
took us to this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, having signed an international convention, the 
government can no longer delay passage of this legislation. When someone 
does something because he can no longer postpone it, it shows how little 
he cares about it. 
The government does so because it is obliged to, because other 
countries on the international scene have already done so, and it 
is among the last stragglers, so now it is acting in order to save 
face.  I am shocked by this.  The people of Lévis whom I represent, 
the workers at the Lévis shipyards, are also shocked by the low 
priority this government gives to shipping.  The message it is 
sending to them is discouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Liberals were so hot to gain power that the Prime 
Minister's current chief of staff was a Liberal candidate in Quebec 
City. All the candidates in that region signed an undertaking 
stating that they found this issue so important that they were 
going to hold a summit on the future of the shipyards and of 
shipping as a whole.  He was not elected, of course.  Perhaps that 
is why nothing has happened in the area of shipping since then. 
The government stalls. Then, if the polls seem favourable, an 
election is called and shipping is forgotten altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most neglected sector in the area of transport. It 
seems to be the last to get any attention, so much so that the 
former president of the Canadian shipowners, Mr. Bell I think, 
waited until after the election to reach his decision, not wishing 
to get involved in politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had been in that position for a dozen years or so.  He 
commented: “Things are going so badly.  They change ministers just 
about every two years, in transport and for shipbuilding.  We 
cannot figure out where we stand.  Things are going so badly that 
I have decided to step down, because the message I am getting is 
that this is not an important issue for the Liberal government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost a year into the second Liberal mandate, the Senate 
finally turns up with this.  I am like everybody else.  I will not 
go on any longer on this point, or the parliamentary secretary will 
be rising to bring me back on topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally things are not at their fastest in the Senate.  When 
the Senate is faster than the House of Commons and the Liberal 
government, that means the latter are very slow indeed.  It would 
be almost impossible to get any slower.  When the senators push the 
government to pass something, things are happening.  Things are 
going awry.  It has come to that.  This is almost a distress 
call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will of course support this bill and help it through as 
quickly as possible so there are no problems and to avoid any 
incidents. We know what the Irving Oil disaster cost taxpayers. 
There were other incidents in the St. Lawrence.  There was the 
<I>Exxon Valdez</I>.  Twice ships have run into the Quebec City bridge. 
Fortunately, hulls were not damaged and there was little oil 
spilled.  We managed to avoid any catastrophes. Is the government 
going to wait for an environmental catastrophe to happen before 
introducing a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is sending the Liberal government a wake-up call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> You have to be pretty low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Very low indeed, as the member for 
Trois-Rivières has pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are citing the Brander-Smith report, which 
proposes, because of the shoals in the St. Lawrence, that ships 
with double hulls be built as quickly as possible.  With its usual 
lack of speed, the Liberal government intended to pass this 
legislation in 2007, in ten years.  In the meantime, what we see 
sailing past are old tubs, most of them under foreign flags.  And 
we should not be worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the time to be building new ships.  For ten years now 
they have been warning foreign ships about the 20-year limit, but 
they are still letting them in.  Fortunately, in this instance, we 
have the senators. 
For once in their lives, at least, they will have proven their 
usefulness. The senators are trying to get the government to wake up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also turned a deaf ear when other key players spoke. 
Last August, at the federal-provincial conference held in St. Andrews, 
the former premier of New Brunswick told his fellow premiers that action 
was urgently required. He urged the federal government to take action in 
the shipping industry. Since his resignation, we have not heard him say 
anything more about the issue, but still, nothing has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally do not approve of using delaying tactics to hold up 
this bill. What I want is a real bill on a real shipping policy, a real 
shipbuilding policy. This is what workers want, especially but not 
exclusively in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saint John moved a similar motion last fall. 
Each party had one speaker address the issue. Everyone, including the 
opposition, was in agreement, whether in western Canada or in Ontario. 
After all, the Great Lakes region is also interested in shipping. The 
parliamentary secretary comes from that region. I know that he is 
interested in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is the government waiting for to establish a true shipping 
policy, a true shipbuilding policy? It should do like the United States, 
where $400 million is earmarked every year to replace the U.S. merchant 
fleet. It should do like most countries of the world, where shipyards 
get some support because they are considered important.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping is actually the cheapest mode of transportation. If this 
activity is conducted properly, if measures such as double hulling are 
taken, we can avoid accidents or incidents, particularly those involving 
oil. It is the least expensive mode of transportation, and the least 
dangerous one from an environmental point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, using old ships to carry oil can have a major 
environmental impact, if they sink like the <I>Irving Whale</I>. 
This is why the world fleet must be renewed. Ships entering Canadian 
waters must be safe. Otherwise, they should get stiff penalties, so that 
they will think twice before entering our waters and threatening the 
environmental safety of Canada and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the main points I wanted to make on this issue. I will be 
pleased to answer any questions.

<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague mentioned the maritimes.  I want to thank him for 
giving me that lead-in to say that we in the maritimes are very 
supportive of anything that will assist the marine works and 
shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at dealing with the financial aspect of 
catastrophes that may take place.  There is an important point to 
be made on preventive action.  It has recently been mentioned 
that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is going to be 
cutting back or terminating a lot of the lighthouses in the 
maritime region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency concern has been expressed to me about the 
safety issues that are presented with that move. We would see 
that as an important aspect which has to be considered when we 
talk about marine safety, the preventive aspect as well as the 
response afterwards.  We hope that would be taken into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final comment with respect to the terms of endearment used 
for my hon. colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore, as I have 
said in this House before, we need to use respect for each other 
when we are in this House.  The fewer terms of endearment used, 
the better.  That way we will accomplish things in the interests 
of all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that the member 
for Halifax West is also concerned about shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, he comes from a region that is greatly affected by 
it. Although the bill does not address the issue of navigational 
aids, he is right to be worried about what is being done in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this topic, we in Quebec deplore the fact that icebreaking 
is now the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  Since the Liberals have been in office, we have lost a lot 
of icebreakers and now we can no longer ensure marine traffic in 
winter.  This winter, it was not too noticeable, because the 
weather was warmer than usual, but I agree fully with what my 
colleague said about safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not, however, understand his reference to birds.  I do 
not know what he meant.

purchased the equipment with their own money and who give their

today I want to pay tribute to a very special Canadian and 
Edmontonian.  Her name is Zoie Gardner.  She recently received 
the Order of Canada in recognition of her volunteer work and for 
being a foster mother to 100 kids, as she calls them.  She has 
been doing this labour of love for 60 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She began her calling at the age of 19, tending a six-day old 
infant.  By the age of 21 she had 10 kids in her care.  She is 
still mothering four disabled adults in their thirties and 
forties. Two of them were her kids since they were six days old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 79, Zoie keeps on mothering.  She said “I like kids and I 
enjoy working with them.  I have to be busy.  I do not mind 
growing old, but I sure mind growing useless”.

national unity and a deficit free Canada require strong

aboriginal peoples will have their rightful place at future first

today the Senate will vote on whether to suspend Andrew Thompson

ironic coming from a Tory patronage appointee who shows up only 
50% of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could Senator Ghitter's sudden conversion be an attempt to shift 
the focus away from his own sorry attendance record?  And whatever 
could Senator Ghitter mean when he talks of Senate reform?  For 
him it surely could not mean Senate elections.  Why?  This is the 
same Ron Ghitter who was first appointed in 1993 to replace 
Canada's first and only elected Senator, Reform's Stan Waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note to Mr. Ghitter.  Perhaps a first step to reforming the 
Senate should start with your own cushy seat.  How about stepping 
down and giving Albertans the chance to tell you what they think 
of a tardy Tory Senate appointee who refers to his home province 
as a “backwater”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I try to give as much latitude

the budget has been balanced”.  There is nothing here about down 
the road, nothing here about over the mandate.  Now the finance

spent to improve our programs and one half will go to tax cuts 
and reduction of the debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a big difference between that and what the Minister

said:  “We are moving towards a time when the budget will

every billion dollars”, the first billion, the second billion, 
the last billion, to debt reduction and tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

will read it to the Prime Minister again:  “We are moving

reach that time, we will allocate every billion dollars of fiscal 
dividend” half to reducing taxes and half to debt reduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

with an <I>s</I> because there will be more than one, “so that 
over the course of our mandate”, un mandat en français, “one

the GST went way over the course of the mandate of the last 
Parliament.  The Prime Minister went on TV in 1993 and said that 
he would scrap the GST.  He later broke that promise. 
It was on videotape, though.  That was the unfortunate part for 
the Prime Minister.  Then in 1997 he went on national TV and said 
that he would spend half the surplus on tax and debt relief 
“once the budget has been balanced”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government announced the student summer jobs program 
with not one dollar more than last year.  Worse, the program 
promises young people 10,000 fewer jobs than last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remarkably the government had no trouble finding funds for a new 
promotion program.  Is this glitzy promotion package, with its 
whiz-bang, high tech, all plastic ballpoint pens, in the Prime 
Minister's view any substitute for real investment in desperately 
needed jobs for young Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader of the 
NDP for giving me the opportunity to remind the House that we 
have actually doubled this year, for the second year in a row, 
the program available to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doubling that number we are very pleased that it will help 
over 60,000 students in Canada to get a job and 350,000 more to 
have the right information about the job market.  This is very 
good news. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government's press release shows that it is aiming for 10,000 
fewer jobs than were created by the program last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roughly one in every five students in Canada cannot find a 
summer job and 48,000 fewer young people are working than just 
two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this warmed over, recycled program an indication of how the 
Prime Minister intends to eliminate the human deficit that his 
policies have created?  How does a goal of 10,000 fewer jobs help 
us to eliminate the human deficit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a youth employment 
strategy that is working.  Last year with a budget of $120 
million, which we doubled for the student summer jobs program, we 
were able to get to 70,000.  I am confident we will get to 70,000 
again this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to deliver on its promises.  I am 
guaranteeing over 60,000 and hopefully that number will reach 
70,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has created more than a million jobs in Canada, 
which will benefit the young as well as the whole Canadian 
population.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is obvious that Canada's chief negotiator, Yves Fortier, 
resigned because the government has no political will to resolve 
the Pacific salmon dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When President Clinton called the Prime Minister to discuss 
Canada's support in Iraq, did the Prime Minister ask President 
Clinton to get involved in resolving the Pacific salmon dispute?

Speaker, whenever I talk with the president I always refer to 
this problem.  I hope the American government will be able to 
help us find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is willing and was willing to make an agreement.  The 
problem is that there are something like 25 different groups in 
the United States that have to approve the agreement.  That is 
why it cannot put forward a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appointed two people to negotiate among themselves.  They 
have made recommendations which we are working on.  I hope this 
will result in an agreement.  The president told me that it is 
his desire to have an agreement, just as it is mine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Pacific salmon fishery dispute has caused great 
hardship for many west coast salmon fishermen.  Canada has a very 
reasonable and defensible position on the Pacific salmon dispute 
that recognizes the principles of equity and conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 New Zealand Ambassador Beeby indicated in a report that 
Canada's position was very defensible.  He supported Canada's 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the Prime Minister considered going to international 
arbitration to settle the Pacific salmon dispute? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I would like to correct one of the 
misunderstandings in the preamble to the hon. member's first 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yves Fortier was our negotiator on this file for four years.  We 
had full confidence in him, confidence which was repeatedly 
expressed.  When he wrote his letters which were tabled in the 
House a little more than a week ago, it was clear from his 
letters that he supported our position and vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of binding arbitration, we would be 
very pleased to have binding arbitration.  I welcome the 
Conservative Party's support for that position.  But it takes two 
people to agree to binding arbitration and we have not had that 
agreement from our American friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would add that deputy minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-28 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister is the owner of Canada Steamship 
Lines.  The more money it makes, the more money he makes.  It is 
therefore completely unethical for the finance minister to have 
sponsored Bill C-28, which could see him personally profit 
millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Prime Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I ask you to be very 
judicious in your choice of words.  I would like the hon. member 
to go right to the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question to the Prime 
Minister is why was the finance minister allowed to sponsor this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, from the beginning the minister who acted on this file 
was the Secretary of State for Finance.  It is very clear.  The 
minister was not involved according to the rules that were 
established when he became Minister of Finance.  Everybody knows 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to say that the Minister of Finance is 
making a profit from it, rather than use the immunity of the 
House of the Commons, he should go in front of the camera outside 
and live with the consequences. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister is twisting the facts.  Here are the facts 
that Canadians know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister improperly sponsored a bill that would 
benefit him personally.  The ethics counsellor did not find out 
about it until he read it in the newspaper.  Yesterday the ethics 
counsellor said “I was not informed and I should have been”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the finance minister compound his unethical behaviour by 
hiding it from the ethics counsellor? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I said from the beginning that according to the 
agreement between the Minister of Finance and the ethics 
counsellor the procedures were followed.  The file was given to 
the Secretary of State for Finance.  At no time did the Minister 
of Finance participate in any discussion on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member accuses the Minister of Finance of benefiting 
from this action, again he should have the guts to make the 
accusation in front of the camera outside. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister first defended the Minister 
of Finance by saying that it was the secretary of state who 
sponsored Bill C-28.  They then said he had sponsored clause 241. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1435"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister explain to us how the individual he 
identifies as the sponsor of clause 241, the Secretary of State for 
Financial Institutions, has never defended this clause, which he 
supposedly sponsored, in the House or in committee? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Because the 
hon. member did not put a single question to anybody, Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not the 
one sponsoring the bill.  According to the Prime Minister, the 
Secretary of State for Financial Institutions is.  Let him ask his 
secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the answer the Prime Minister has given no longer stands 
up, as it is obviously not the secretary of state, who has nothing 
to do with clause 241, what does the Prime Minister have to say now 
in defence of his finance minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since the bills at the Department of Finance are very complex— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  —everything is done to help the 
House of Commons examine them fully. There was an omnibus bill that 
included this clause. It is an omnibus bill.  This is a practice 
that has been around for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was once Minister of Finance as well and the procedure was 
the same.  In money bills, a number of elements are always 
incorporated and a bill is put together so that the House of 
Commons can examine all the problems at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case— 
</I></B></P><P align=left> <B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when he finally heard about the finance minister's conflict of 
interest he did not call any tax experts.  No, he called the 
companies themselves.  Surprise, surprise, the finance minister's 
own company exonerated itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Prime Minister what is the real use of 
an ethics counsellor if he really approves unethical behaviour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I said, there is nothing unethical about it and so 
said the commissioner in charge of this file.  He said that very 
clearly in front of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, because the finance minister is presenting a budget and 
it is going to be a good budget, they are completely desperate on 
the other side and just want to hit below the belt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will neither affect the Minister of Finance nor the 
Canadian public. The Minister of Finance is a man of honesty, 
integrity and competence and will deliver his budget next 
Tuesday. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
their first red book the Liberals promised that they would not 
follow Brian Mulroney's ethical example.  They said they would 
appoint an ethics commissioner who would report directly to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, they did not.  Their so-called ethics counsellor reports 
in secret to the Prime Minister.  Scandal after scandal and the 
ethics counsellor always has enough whitewash for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question.  What is the use of an ethics counsellor if 
he just rubber stamps the finance minister's unethical behaviour? 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the counsellor was in front of a committee of the House 
Tuesday and he replied to the question.  He did not refuse to go 
there.  He said very clearly that there was no conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members are desperate.  They cannot find anything to 
attack the government so they are trying to attack the integrity 
of a person who cannot be attacked because he has proven that he 
is a very competent and honest Minister of Finance.

<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
is fascinating about this ongoing saga that we are discussing 
today is that it has shed some light on the finance minister's 
shipping company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, did you know that one of the finance minister's big 
ships, the <I>Atlantic Erie</I> is actually registered in the 
Bahamas?  That is not illegal but it says a lot about taxes in 
this country.  Taxes are so high that the finance minister 
registers his ships where the taxes are lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be true that it is better in the Bahamas, but will the 
finance minister ever lower taxes for ordinary Canadians so that 
ordinary Canadians get tax relief and not just those who can 
register their ships in a foreign country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, we have already done it in the last budget, reducing 
taxes.  We did it on January 1 when we reduced the contribution 
to the employment insurance program.  Hopefully there might be 
more next Tuesday, but I am not to tell you if I know, and I 
don't know if I can tell you. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the Prime Minister is missing the point here.  It is no 
joke that the finance minister is avoiding his own taxes by 
registering his ships offshore. By flying the flag of the Bahamas 
instead of the Canadian flag the finance minister's company saves 
a lot of tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Prime Minister on behalf of my 
constituents.  If they raise the Bahamian or the Liberian flag, 
can they pay less taxes too?

<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have already started to reinvest. The very first thing this 
government did, the first step we took after restoring fiscal 
sanity to the country was to reinvest $1.5 billion in transfers 
to the provinces. We established a stable cash floor in exactly 
the amount that was recommended by the National Forum on Health. 
If the hon. member would pay more attention to the facts than the 
characteristically empty rhetoric of the NDP, we would be a lot 
further ahead.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has destroyed the fishery on the east coast. A 
positive step in rebuilding this resource would be a realistic 
plan to buy back fishing licences at today's market value. Many 
senior fishers would take this opportunity to leave the industry 
with dignity thus reducing pressure on an already stressed 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit to a licence buy back program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

measures taken by this government for licence buy back which on 
the east coast was over $100 million and on the west coast was 
approximately $80 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to him that the moratorium on groundfish 
stocks occurred in 1992 when another government happened to be in 
place, curiously a Progressive Conservative government. The hon. 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party was the Minister of 
the Environment, the closest minister to the minister of 
fisheries when advising that government on what to do about 
environmental disasters which Tory policies brought upon the 
fishing industry on the east coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> That answer, Mr. 
Speaker, does not help one single fisherman today. When will this 
government come to a clear decision?  When will this minister put 
the interest of east coast fishermen ahead of those of the 
foreign fleets? 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are no foreign fishing vessels 
fishing within the 200 mile limit and the hon. member knows that. 
There are seven vessels outside the 200 mile limit and that is a 
fraction of what it was during Tory times. The total amount in 
tonnage of fish taken within the 200 mile limit by foreign 
vessels today is between one-half and one per cent of what it was 
when his government was in power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Prime Minister said that he was personally in 
favour of changing the Senate.  He said a requirement that was 
needed was that the provinces approve this because of the 
constitution.  We all know that.  Why will the Prime Minister not 
take the first step, go where no other prime minister has ever 
gone before him, and begin the process by tabling in this House a 
motion to abolish the existing unelected, unaccountable Senate?

have the agreement of the provinces.  We wanted to have an 
elected Senate but the Senate needs more than to be elected.  It 
needs to be repartitioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may not want to have a second House although it would 
be very useful for the regions.  I do not think it will advance 
the case if we just have a resolution at this time.  We would

for him “My primary responsibility is not to fishermen to catch

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

Conservatives so consistently were unable to manage the fishery. 
They do not understand that without fish you cannot have 
fishermen.  This critical fact is completely ignored by the 
member. 
He does not realize that to have an effective fishery, to have 
fishermen with decent incomes, and to enable their families to 
take part in our society like others who have decent incomes, we 
need to have an adequate supply of fish.  He does not understand 
that, but he comes to this House to try to tell us that somehow 
or another we should ignore conservation and simply allow 
allocation for fishermen.

who made a brilliant speech on shipping, a few minutes before oral 
question period. 
My colleague very eloquently showed the laxness, carelessness, 
incompetence and negligence of the federal government regarding the 
management of the St. Lawrence River and all related activities, 
including port traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. Lawrence River is the world's largest inland waterway and 
85% of Quebec's population lives along its north and south shores. Yet, 
the federal government has always been negligent regarding the 
management of the St. Lawrence River. The hon. member for Lévis made a 
brilliant presentation on the environmental risks created by this 
laxness in the protection of the environment, including the dangers 
posed by oil tankers; as we know, the Quebec City bridge was recently 
hit twice by oil tankers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all this, could the hon. member tell us how the St. Lawrence 
River and its neighbouring regions should be managed, in terms of 
economic and regional development, in the context of a sovereign Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. 
I would say to the member for Trois-Rivières that there would 
finally be a government with full jurisdiction that would handle 
shipping like any normal country would.  A normal country would act 
like the United States, the Scandinavian countries, and the other 
countries in the world with shipyards.  In those countries, they 
build ships with the help of the government, not in conflict with 
it, and the passage of ships flying foreign flags with tax 
advantages and of old vessels that do not meet the standards is not 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A normal country looks after normal things, such as its future 
in shipping and its economic development, and does not wait for the 
Senate to wake it up when it comes to shipping issues, the way the 
Liberal Party has.  It is unbelievable.  They do not come any 
slower.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to rise in the 
House and lead off the debate on a bill that I believe is as 
important as any bill we will introduce in this session.  It is 
for the labour and management stakeholders who are affected by 
its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 proposes major changes to part I of the Canada Labour 
Code, the legislation that provides the framework for collective 
bargaining for the federal private sector.  Members who sat in 
the last session of Parliament will recognize much that is in 
this bill.  It is very similar to former Bill C-66 which was 
passed by the House last April.  That similarity is not without 
good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who were not in the Chamber during the last session a 
bit of background might be useful.  As hon. members might know, 
Canada and each of the provinces pass and administer their own 
labour laws.  Jurisdiction is mainly dependent on the nature of 
the work being performed.  The Canada Labour Code applies to 
industries that are in many cases of national significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These industries often cross provincial and international 
boundaries.  Approximately 700,000 workers and their employers in 
interprovincial and international transportation, airports and 
airlines, broadcasting, telecommunications, banking, shipping, 
longshoring and grain handling come under federal jurisdiction. 
The code also applies to some crown corporations, as to private 
sector operations in the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although federal jurisdiction is relatively small in terms of 
numbers it is very important because of the key sectors it covers 
across the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending this legislation which provides a process and 
procedures to the collective bargaining system is no small 
matter. Canada has had such labour legislation on its books for 
most of this century.  It has changed over time of course to meet 
new demands and new circumstances, but it has served us 
remarkably well, so well in fact that the overwhelming majority 
of collective agreements in the federal jurisdiction are settled 
without the ultimate recourse of strike or lockout.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, part I of the Canada Labour Code has not been 
substantially revised in over 20 years.  In a world of incredibly 
rapid change on the technology, trade and economic fronts it is 
beginning to show its age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1995 the government established a task force of eminent 
labour relations experts chaired by Edmonton labour lawyer Andrew 
Sims to conduct an independent review of the legislation. The 
list of those making oral and written submissions reads like a 
who's who of Canada's respected union and management 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close to 50 groups and individuals made oral presentations and 
almost 90 made written submissions.  In short, almost all the 
major players who would be affected by changes to part I placed 
before the task force their perspective of where changes were 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the process, the task force made use of a key working 
group known as the labour-management consensus group. On the 
labour side were representatives of the Canadian Labour Congress, 
the Confederation of National Trade Unions and the Canadian 
Federation of Labour.  On the employer side were the Federally 
Regulated Employers in Transportation and Communications, 
otherwise known as FETCO, the Western Grain Elevator Association 
and the Canadian Bankers Association.  A senior official from the 
labour program acted as a facilitator for the consensus group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group managed to reach agreement on a number of key issues. 
Many of the group's recommendations became the recommendations of 
the task force, which in turn have found their way into this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force report was called quite appropriately “Seeking a 
Balance”.  It was released in February 1996.  The release was 
followed up with a series of cross-country meetings to hear the 
views of all the interested parties on the task force 
recommendations.  The result was Bill C-66 introduced on November 
4, 1996 and passed by this House in April.  The bill was awaiting 
third reading in the Senate when Parliament was dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand the history of this bill.  It is 
substantially the same as its predecessor.  Everything that made 
that bill balanced and fair, and the end product of extensive 
consultation with the very people it will affect, applies to this 
bill.  To make sure that we have crossed all our <I>t'</I>s and 
dotted all our <I>i'</I>s, since becoming Minister of Labour last 
June, I spent the summer and much of the fall consulting these 
very same parties, including such major players as FETCO, the 
Canadian Bankers Association, the Western Grain Elevator 
Association, the Canadian Labour Congress and the CSN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these discussions and listening to the parties, 
we have made some drafting changes which I will get to.  I want 
to repeat that the principles and the merits of this bill remain 
the same.  The proposed amendments are in their total endorsed by 
the main stakeholders.  They are needed to bring our collective 
bargaining process in line with the demands and the realities of 
the 21st century. The details are best left for our committee 
hearings.  Let me just review its broad strokes and point to 
where we have made some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old Canada Labour Relations Board will be replaced with one 
that is more representative of its clients.  The new board will 
be called the Canada Industrial Relations Board.  Like its 
predecessor, it will be charged with the orderly management of 
the collective bargaining process.  It will have a neutral chair 
and vice-chairs, and this is the critical part, it will have 
equal employer and employee representation.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new board will also have additional powers and 
responsibilities resulting in a more effective vehicle for 
addressing labour disputes with greater flexibility to deal 
quickly with routine matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are introducing changes to representation and successor 
rights.  One of the more important amendments in this group for 
example provides that when an undertaking moves from provincial 
to federal jurisdiction either through a sale or a change of 
activities, both the bargaining rights and the collective 
agreement will be carried over. In these fast moving times when 
ownerships and activities can change rapidly, this protection 
will prevent needless disruption in labour-management relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the representation side, one of the more contentious 
amendments for Bill C-66 dealt with providing names and addresses 
of off site workers to trade union representatives. The workers in 
question are often home workers or those who, for whatever 
reason, do not perform their duties at a work site. These 
employees by virtue of being off site can often be excluded from 
participating in decisions about collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of the employer about releasing names and addresses 
centred around the issue of privacy.  Let me assure members that 
I have listened to these concerns.  I consulted with the 
stakeholders on both sides this past summer and modified this 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will still have the discretion to give an authorized 
representative of a trade union a list of names and addresses of 
off site workers.  However the board will now have clear authority 
to act as a transmitter of information itself if it concludes 
that privacy cannot otherwise be assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, a statutory prohibition against the use of 
information provided under this section for other purposes has 
been added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the board may order information to be transmitted to 
off site employees over the employer's electronic mail system. 
The employer retains control of operating the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have now succeeded in protecting the privacy rights 
of off site workers while offering them adequate opportunity of 
access to union information and decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes a number of changes to the bargaining cycle 
designed to speed up the system, improve flexibility and 
encourage earlier settlement of disputes. A primary objective 
here is to reduce delays in the collective bargaining process. 
These amendments cover such matters as extending the period of 
serving notice to bargain from three months to four months, 
establishing a streamlined, single stage conciliation process, 
and the requirement for a secret ballot on strike and lockout 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also sought to clarify the rights and obligations of the 
parties during legal strikes and lockouts.  The most 
controversial area was the use of replacement workers. As was the 
case in the previous bill, there will be no general prohibition 
on the use of replacement workers during a legal strike or 
lockout.  However their use for the purpose of undermining a 
trade union's representational capacity would be an unfair labour 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some claimed that the wording did not reflect the intent of the 
task force recommendation, a recommendation widely accepted by 
both labour and management as part of a package of 
recommendations. Others found the wording confusing, alleging 
that nobody knew what it meant and that the mere presence of a 
replacement worker would become unlawful. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While concerns about the clarity of the replacement worker 
provision in Bill C-66 were debatable, I have decided to act. 
Again, after consultation with the stakeholders this summer, the 
provision has been reworded to more accurately reflect the 
narrative used in the Sims task force majority recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision now explicitly points out that the use of 
replacement workers for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a 
union's ability to represent its workers rather than the pursuit 
of legitimate bargaining objectives will be an unfair labour 
practice. Where the board determines a violation has occurred, it 
can order the employer to stop using replacements for the 
duration of the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these changes I believe we have adopted a reasonable middle 
of the road approach that can be accepted as a workable 
compromise by both labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues to be the policy of this government that industrial 
disputes are better settled by the players themselves. 
Curtailment of rights should only be a last resort and used under 
certain conditions such as the threat to public safety and 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments will therefore require labour and 
management to maintain services necessary to prevent serious and 
immediate danger to public health or safety during a work 
stoppage.  If they cannot come up with a workable solution for 
providing such protection, I as Minister of Labour could use my 
discretion to ask the board to make necessary determinations and 
directions to the parties to make sure that public health and 
safety are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have added particular provisions pertaining to disputes 
related to grain handling.  Grain handlers and their employers 
will retain the right to strike or lockout.  However in the event 
of a work stoppage involving other parties in port related 
activities, including longshoring, services to grain vessels 
being loaded at licensed terminals or transfer elevators must be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will address the vast majority of the disruptions to grain 
exports at Canadian ports, most of which have not involved grain 
handling disputes directly.  In fact since 1972, of the 12 work 
stoppages governed by the code at the west coast ports which have 
greatly curtailed grain exports, only three directly involved 
grain handlers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to ensure this amendment works 
remains.  The effectiveness of the grain provisions will be 
reviewed again in 1999 after the next round of west coast 
longshore bargaining.  If this step is not strong enough to 
protect the vital flow of grain exports from our ports, then 
stronger measures will have to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to make a quick mention of the repeal of 
part II of the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act.  The 
act deals with the collection and reporting of statistical 
information on labour unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under part II of the act, Statistics Canada collects information 
on nearly every major labour union in  Canada.  However the 
agency has found a more effective way of collecting information. 
The information gathered under the proposed system could result 
in a more accurate picture of the role of unions in the Canadian 
labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada proposes to obtain its information directly 
from Canadian workers.  This amendment will save Canadian 
taxpayers $300,000 a year and the updated information will be 
more useful. 
These are the principal amendments proposed for part I of the 
Canada Labour Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House will indulge me when I suggest a cautious 
approach to making changes to this bill.  I have outlined its 
history.  The amendments proposed are the end result of many 
hours of consultation.  It is not time to reinvent the wheel.  It 
is not time to cherry pick one item or another to meet the needs 
of one constituency over another.  It is not time to go back to 
the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the task force report.  The bill reflects its work, 
which in turn reflects the expert input from the very 
stakeholders it will affect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the bill will result in an industrial relations 
climate where labour and management will be able to resolve their 
differences in a more efficient and more positive environment. 
Better labour relations are good for everyone:  for the employer, 
the employee and the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this is balanced legislation.  It is fair.  It is up 
to date.  It demonstrates that we have listened to Canadians.  In 
large measure it reflects consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one thing left to do.  Put it in law.  It is time 
to get the job done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak today on Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the Minister of Labour attempted to 
revamp part I of the Canada Labour Code.  He failed in that task 
when his Liberal colleagues in the other place refused to give it 
expeditious passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the summer to address the flaws in Bill C-66, it appeared 
that the new and improved legislation would be a priority.  It 
was the first item on the order paper for this, the 36th 
Parliament, but it took the minister another six weeks to 
introduce it and another seven weeks to convince his House leader 
to schedule it for second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers hoped that the delay would mean a fair and balanced 
bill would be forthcoming.  The minister could have waited longer 
because the minor adjustments barely make any difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who only had access to the minister's press release would 
have been fooled into thinking that real improvements were made 
to the legislation.  Closer scrutiny reveals, however, that the 
few technical changes will not make much difference to this 
botched attempt to modernize part I of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party proposed a series of amendments to Bill C-66 
that would have gone a long way toward improving industrial 
relations in the country.  Had the government not used its 
majority to squash our proposals, Bill C-66 would have sailed 
through the House unimpeded and would have easily passed the 
scrutiny of the other place.  Today it would be law and we could 
turn our attention to cutting the $600 billion national debt and 
giving Canadians a much deserved tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair and balanced labour laws play an integral part in Canada's 
ability to attract and hold business.  Uncertainty fuelled by the 
threat of work disruptions can scare away potential investors and 
cause existing industries to question whether they would be 
better off elsewhere.  As a nation where the unemployment rate 
for the last four years has hovered around 9% we must take steps 
to encourage job creation and not scare it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the government with its dependence on high payroll taxes 
is doing an exemplary job of discouraging job creation.  It is 
widely acknowledged that high taxes kill jobs.  Even the finance 
minister of the Liberal government agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know government infrastructure programs and other make work 
projects do not create permanent jobs.  Labour legislation and 
regulations made on a case by case basis will not create jobs 
either. 
Stable labour relations will promote investment, reinvestment and 
those sought after jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interest of all Canadians to have reliable access 
to essential services, to keep employment within our borders, and 
to establish and maintain a reputation as a worldwide reliable 
exporter of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reputation is jeopardized whenever we have a work stoppage 
in one of our key sectors.  Take the recent postal impasse for 
instance.  Weeks of uncertainty over whether or not there would 
be mail delivery created havoc.  Not only did it cost Canada Post 
millions of dollars.  It dealt a severe blow to small businesses 
and charities that depend on the pre-Christmas period to ensure 
their viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canada Labour Code contained a permanent dispute 
settlement mechanism, workers and management would be better off. 
Customers and business would be assured of a reliable mail 
service.  Yet the government passed up another opportunity to 
stabilize industrial relations by not including a permanent 
dispute settlement mechanism in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a long term solution, but so far the 
government has refused to implement it.  Final offer selection 
arbitration is a tool to effectively and permanently control 
labour issues that fall under federal jurisdiction.  It is fair 
because it does not favour one side over the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how it works.  If and only if the union and the employer 
cannot make an agreement by the conclusion of the previous 
contract, the union and the employer would provide the minister 
with the name of a person they jointly recommend as arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union and the employer would be required to submit to the 
arbitrator a list of the matters agreed upon and a list of the 
matters still under dispute.  For disputed issues each party 
would be required to submit a final offer for settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrator then selects either the final offer submitted by 
the trade union or the final offer submitted by the employer: all 
of one position or all of the other position.  The arbitrator's 
decision would be binding on both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that rather than go to back to work legislation 
every time there is a work stoppage in one of these key areas, 
this tool should be there for management and the union to use.  I 
submit that when this tool is used to its ultimate it is not used 
at all because it encourages both parties to bargain earnestly 
and come to a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said earlier, the best agreement you can have is 
one that is agreed to by both parties.  I believe the final offer 
selection arbitration would go a long way to achieving that very 
goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 one of the first actions of the newly elected Liberal 
government was to legislate an end to work disruption at the west 
coast port, back to work legislation.  In those days the prime 
minister did not deem it necessary to have a separate labour 
minister, so the human resources minister of the day included 
final offer selection arbitration as a mechanism to settle the 
dispute between the longshoremen and the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which was it?  Was it back to work legislation or was it final 
offer selection arbitration?  It was both. Legislating the 
parties back to work gets the wheels moving again, but it does 
not do anything to resolve the issues that are still in question 
in the contract.  They have to bring in final offer selection to 
resolve that.  There is the precedent for the very thing we have 
been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the ongoing tensions created by the need for yet 
another legislated settlement, the government set up an inquiry 
commission into labour relations at west coast ports.  The 200 
page report recommended final offer selection arbitration as a 
way to provide protection to the economy and to the interests of 
the public and third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very nice for the minister to say that he will be very 
stern in cases where public safety is at stake, but I think he 
has an obligation to protect the Canadian economy too. 
We are all very interested to see our employment figures improve 
and to see the economy improve.  As a minister of the crown he 
should take very seriously these threats to our national economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this was just another inquiry commission with the main 
purpose of taking the heat off the government and letting it 
appear as if it is doing something, because the west coast ports 
inquiry recommended that final offer selection arbitration be 
included in labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the House debated my private member's bill, Bill 
C-233, which proposed the use of final offer selection 
arbitration as a process to prevent costly strikes and lockouts 
at west coast ports.  My bill was based on the very 
recommendations I just spoke of from that inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be too surprised at the government's reluctance to 
implement a permanent solution to crippling strikes and lockouts. 
There is a recurring and notable reticence by the government to 
give up control of anything.  For that very reason government 
members think they will be seen as heroes by the voters for 
legislating an end to work stoppages.  They could be real heroes 
by taking action to prevent an economically crippling work 
stoppage in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A costly interruption of government business is not required. 
While there is need for regulation by various levels of 
government, it is neither practical nor prudent to implement 
emergency measures whenever labour and management are unable to 
reach a satisfactory agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resolving the differences of these two groups can be achieved 
without interrupting the regular flow of government proceedings. 
A permanent and fair resolution process must be put in place, 
removed from the whims of government.  We need permanent 
legislation that would provide both sides with a predictable rule 
and timetable by which to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour-management problems at west coast ports have been 
studied over and over.  Yet this legislation would not solve any 
of the problems at the ports.  In fact it will actually 
complicate and hinder the bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of Confederation grain elevators were declared to be 
for the general advantage of Canada.  Since then the government 
realized what western farmers have always known, that any dispute 
involving grain handling threatens the Canadian economy and our 
reputation as a reliable exporter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals, I suppose not wanting to be seen as protecting the 
grain industry from all too frequent work disruptions, included a 
provision in the legislation guaranteeing the tie-up, the let go 
and loading of grain vessels, and the movement of those vessels 
in and out of port in the event of a work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface this looks like a positive measure for the grain 
industry, but like so many of the measures we have seen the 
government initiate, once we scratch the surface the cracks 
appear.  Since one of the worst fears of grain exporters is that 
a labour disruption might stop a shipment from reaching the 
customer, this is a small step forward.  It is a baby step. 
Contrary to the information circulated by some groups, it does 
not “prohibit third parties from shutting down the flow of grain 
in the event of a dispute”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's meagre concession to grain producers falls far 
short of ensuring the product reaches market and farmers are not 
left in the lurch.  The disruption in 1995 that brought rail 
traffic to a halt is still fresh in the minds of western 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two year settlement imposed by the back to work legislation 
expired at the end of last December and some unions have yet to 
sign a new contract.  Failure to reach an agreement could mean a 
strike or lockout this spring and grain shipments, regardless of 
the status of the legislation, could come to a standstill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that it is fine to load the grain that gets to the 
port, but if a strike takes place between here and the port there 
will not be any grain at the port to load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain represents 30% of the business of the port of Vancouver. 
What about the other 70%?

nor is its economic impact greater than the implications of the 
port shutdown on the exporters and importers of other 
commodities, including forest products, coal, sulphur and potash, 
to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of provisions such as found in section 87.7, that 
create an uneven playing field among various sectors of the 
economy, is unnecessary and not helpful in making Canada an 
attractive place to visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When representatives of groups such as the B.C. Maritime Employers 
Association, which represents 77 wharf and terminal operators and 
stevedoring firms in Vancouver and Prince Rupert, appeared as 
witnesses before the standing committee on human resources 
development during the Bill C-66 debate, they told us that the 
grain provision in this bill could actually worsen the already 
rocky history of labour disputes at the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of final offer selection arbitration in the Canada 
Labour Code would level the playing field and ensure grain and 
all other exports are not held hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of the technical changes found in Bill C-19 relates to 
the government's feeble attempts to appease those opposed to the 
ban on the use of replacement workers.  The son of Bill C-66 
attempts to clarify the wording, but the end result is still a de 
facto ban on the use of replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says in his statement that no general prohibition 
of the use of replacement workers is in this bill, but I submit 
there is a de facto ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision still gives too much power to the new Canada 
Industrial Relations Board, which will be hard pressed to deny any 
union leader's contention that their rights have been violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that was to be clarified over the summer was 
clause 50, which amends section 109.1 of the Code dealing with 
union's access to off site workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changing nature of today's work environment has seen an 
increasingly large number of people working away from the 
traditional workplace.  The government decided to help fledgling 
union membership by permitting unions to acquire the names and 
addresses of potential new members.  When the privacy 
commissioner appeared before the committee of the other place 
studying Bill C-66, he said: “What is missing, as we see it, in 
clause 50 is the element of consent”.  That is how we see it, 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tinkered with clause 50, but the element of consent 
is still missing.  I moved an amendment to Bill C-66 requiring 
employee consent before the release of any personal information, 
but of course it was defeated. The inclusion of consent in this 
bill is crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government passed off to the CIRB the authority 
to make decisions on a case by basis instead of showing real 
leadership by protecting the rights of Canadian workers.  Another 
major flaw remaining in this legislation is the provision giving 
the CIRB the authority to certify a union even though a majority 
of the employees are opposed.  How can that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer you to the most publicized case of how this type of 
provision works against employee wishes.  That can be found at 
the Wal-Mart in Windsor, Ontario.  The Ontario Labour Relations 
Board agreed to certify the union, even though the employees at 
the Windsor store voted 151 to 43 against it last May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should have the right to join a union if the majority 
of their fellow employees agree.  If they are opposed, membership 
should not be forced on them.  The workers should be empowered to 
make the decision, not the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mandatory secret ballot is the only fair way to determine if 
the employees want union representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all powerful board will emerge from the ashes, or perhaps 
the crumbs, of the Canada Labour Relations Board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Relations Board has been in disarray for years 
and a steady succession of cabinet ministers stood idly by while 
it struggled.  In 1995 a power struggle between the chairman and 
the vice-chairs over who should assign and schedule cases was 
played out in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to question the effectiveness of such an important 
quasi-judicial decision making body that was unable to resolve 
its own problems. It took a mediator and about $203,000 worth of 
public funds to settle this internal dispute.  At least Bill C-19 
reduces the term of employment for the chair and the vice-chairs 
to five years from the current 10 years.  As a Reform Party 
labour critic I proposed this change to the Sims commission two 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the difficulty the government encountered in its 
attempt to fire the chairman of the CLRB, Bill C-19 should spell 
out not only the terms and conditions of employment for the board 
executive and members, but it should clarify exactly what it 
means “to hold office during good behaviour”. Maybe some 
expense account guidelines would not be going awry either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for specific policy and enforceable guidelines is 
essential if the board is ever to regain its credibility.  It is 
absolutely incomprehensible that no one stepped in when the 
chairman claimed $700 Paris lunches or charged for travel and 
meals for other international jaunts.  These were deemed okay 
because of the chairman's position as head of the international 
board. Where was the benefit in this to the Canadian taxpayers? 
Surely there should be some stipulation for this kind of 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how the board operated.  In 1994 the chairman 
apparently informed the members that the CRLB “must address 
certain financial practices which do not comply with Treasury 
Board directives or with the spirit of the government's 
philosophy concerning the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars”. 
The auditor general found this advice was not adhered to or 
implemented.  The chairman did not heed his own directive so why 
should he expect anyone else at the CLRB to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the Treasury Board, the PMO, the privy council office 
and a series of labour ministers took no notice.  They did 
nothing, even when he charged $53,000 for expenses to attend 28 
meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the task force review of the CLRB's performance 
concluded that decisions were not being made in a timely manner. 
The auditor general stated: “The problems of the CLRB are due to 
poor management practice, inadequate paper oriented 
communications, poor leadership from senior members of the board 
and a general lack of professionability and accountability which 
have created a climate which is at times venomous, harassing, 
stressful and which undoubtedly is eroding morale, the quality 
and efficiency of the board's work and the board's internal and 
external credibility and integrity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about as strong a directive as I have ever seen an 
auditor general use.  The things he said leave out nothing. Board 
members cannot get along, the board cannot function, it does not 
function in a timely manner, it is not conducting its business, 
it is in fighting, morale is being eroded and it is stressful and 
venomous.  That is a pretty condemning statement.  I applaud the 
auditor general's courage in making it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attempted to have the chairman called as a witness before the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status 
of Persons with Disabilities.  I sent a formal request to the 
committee clerk last summer.  It would have provided MPs with the 
opportunity to question the chairman.  It also would have given 
Mr. Weatherill the opportunity he wanted to publicly defend 
himself. When a meeting was eventually scheduled for some reason 
it was cancelled.  That reason is still unknown to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report must be seen as confirmation that 
things were definitely awry at the Canadian Labour Relations 
Board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we have to ask how well Canadian labour and 
business has been served by this body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to answer for the longstanding mismanagement 
at the CLRB.  The minister must take steps to ensure that this 
never happens again.  The board's decisions are for all intents 
and purposes final.  While the Federal Court Act allows for a 
review of the board's decisions, there is no provision allowing 
this senior judicial body to set aside board decisions if there 
were legal errors or if the case was handled in an unreasonable 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the situation facing one interprovincial transportation 
company where both the employer and the employees are 
dissatisfied with the board's certification ruling.  The current 
Canada Labour Code does not provide them any recourse and Bill 
C-19 does nothing to help their plight either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support Bill C-19 in its present form for the reasons 
I have outlined.  We will be proposing a series of amendments 
which will go a long way toward achieving fair and balanced 
labour laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill, finance; the hon. member for Mississauga West, 
youth employment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today for the first time as the Bloc Quebecois 
labour critic.  I am pleased to do so in connection with Bill C-19, 
which amends the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations 
and Labour Unions Returns Act and makes consequential amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this bill implements reforms to the industrial 
relations provisions of part I of the Canada Labour Code, to 
provide a framework for collective bargaining that enhances the 
ability of labour and management to better frame their own 
agreements and allows workplace disputes to be resolved in a timely 
and cost effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key components are as follows:  first, the creation of a 
representational board, the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with 
appropriate powers to allow for the timely and cost effective 
administration of the system. 
Second, streamlining of the conciliation process. Third, 
clarification of the rights and obligations of the parties during 
a work stoppage, including requirements for strike and lockout 
votes and advance strike and lockout notices. Fourth, a 
requirement for parties involved in a work stoppage to continue 
services necessary to protect public health and safety. Fifth, a 
requirement for the maintenance of services affecting grain 
shipments in the event of legal work stoppages by any third parties 
in the ports.  Sixth, making the undermining of a trade union's 
representational capacity during a strike or lockout an unfair 
legal practice.  Seventh, improving access to collective bargaining 
for off-site workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text also repeals the provisions of the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act respecting trade unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a significant bill, if only because it affects 700,000 
workers across Canada, 115,000 of them in Quebec.  Its areas of 
application are enormous: for example, banks, interprovincial and 
international transportation, airports and air lines, broadcasting 
and telecommunications, port and shipping operations, grain 
handling.  Many crown corporations are affected by the Canada 
Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses part I of the Canada Labour Code, which is 
on labour relations, while part II deals with occupational health 
and safety, and part III with labour standards, or in other words 
the working conditions in businesses governed by the federal 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us was preceded by a vast consultation of 
stakeholders, which began in June 1995 and which led to the Sims 
report, named for the chair, which was released in February 1996, 
nearly two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring, on the eve of the election, we were considering 
Bill C-66, which unfortunately did not come to fruition. Today we 
are looking at the newly arrived bill bearing number C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will oppose this bill, because, despite vast consultations, 
no doubt carried out in good faith, the reform is incomplete. 
The Liberal government lacked the political courage to do what it 
had to in a number of regards.  We have criticisms of various 
aspects of this bill we are not happy with, starting with the 
government's change in the name from the Canada Labour Relations 
Board to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It claims to represent the parties.  However the clause 
relating to this, clause 10(2) reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the members of the Board other than the Chairperson and 
the Vice-Chairpersons are to be appointed by the Governor in 
Council on the recommendation of the Minister after 
consultation by the Minister with the organizations 
representative of employees or employers that the Minister 
considers appropriate to hold office during good behaviour for 
terms not exceeding three years each, subject to removal by 
the Governor in Council at any time for cause. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the organizations the minister considers appropriate 
will be consulted, without recourse necessarily—the approach 
suggested by the parties—to the lists of people suggested by the 
parties, as employers and employees, for the minister to choose 
from.  That was not the approach chosen by the minister, because it 
will not automatically be the people considered representative of 
these associations who will represent them on the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board. 
So there is something wrong from the start, which makes this bill 
rather insensitive, given its pretensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the case of the RCMP and its employees.  For 
many years the employees have asked their employer, the federal 
government, for real power to negotiate their working conditions. 
A common occurrence in the West.  There is nothing outlandish in 
requesting 
negotiations that could be successful. The people involved carry out 
very specific duties and represent the state in a unique capacity as 
peace officers, but do not have the right to strike. Everything is 
settled in advance, but they wanted the right to go to arbitration if 
both sides cannot come to an agreement. The government refused, letting 
RCMP managers be judge and jury, as has been the case for years, causing 
a great deal of frustration for RCMP employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very disappointing that, despite the golden opportunity 
provided by this broad consultation it was conducting, the government 
turned a deaf ear to the RCMP employees' representations, which seem 
legitimate to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same can be said of public service employees, at least those 
represented by the Professional Institute of the Public Service and the 
Public Service Alliance, who have been asking for over ten years to be 
subject to the Canada Labour Code, and not just to the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act. This is a situation similar to that of the RCMP. It 
is a very unfair and unpleasant situation in that the government is both 
the legislating government and the employer making regulations.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no real collective bargaining taking place, it is 
prohibited, and working conditions are set by the employer. Quite 
legitimately, federal public service employees want to come under the 
Canada Labour Code, so that the legislator will no longer be judge and 
jury but rather have to participate in the normal bargaining process as 
we know it in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to the current situation, whether one comes under the 
Canada Labour Code or the Canada Labour Relations Act makes a world of 
difference. One has to be a unionized employee, as I was in the Quebec 
public service, to realize how important things like working conditions 
are. Job security too is very important. 
Contrary to popular belief, there is no true job security in the federal 
public service. Since the employer also makes the laws, it is biased, 
and it can, even for political motives, lay people off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who may not know it, there is no job security in the 
federal public service, while significant progress has been made in the 
private sector. There is currently no protection in the federal public 
service against the technological changes that may take place, at the 
expense of workers who are at the mercy of the decisions made by 
management. These workers have absolutely no say in the restructuring 
process that may take place following such changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how significant, traumatizing and threatening these changes 
can be for someone who earns a living working for the government. Public 
servants should be allowed to make suggestions to make it easier to cope 
with technological changes, so that these changes will cause a minimum 
of hardships to individuals, and so that the new technologies will be at 
the service of these human beings, and not the reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot understand the spirit that prevails among managers in the 
public service. We cannot understand why these people are not more open 
to such an approach. After all, private businesses, which are the most 
effective ones, adjusted to technological changes and they made sure 
their employees accepted these changes, so that the transition would be 
as smooth as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public service managers would be a little more modern in their 
approach if they were receptive to this type of ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that public servants are not governed by the Canada Labour 
Code but, rather, by the Public Service Staff Relations Act, has a 
direct impact on their career, which is very important when one works 
for this type of employer. It is a huge structure with many levels. 
Employees have no say in the job classification or description process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government agreed to have its employees governed by the Canada 
Labour Code, these public servants would be able to discuss with their 
employer—more or less on an equal footing—the very important 
issues of job classification and description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the appointment, promotion and transfer processes 
are all very important issues during one's career.  They are all 
part of what the public service refers to as a career plan, an 
individual's entire professional life, which is not recognized 
because the government plays the role of both judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple matter of asking the government to give its 
employees the right to negotiate their working conditions, like 
millions of other workers in Canada, thereby reducing bargaining 
restraints by allowing new rights that could be called:  the right 
to strike, such as they have in Quebec's public service, the right 
to arbitration and the right to grieve, which do not exist right 
now, the employer being both judge and jury, as we keep saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the problem arises, where the government has turned a 
deaf ear to these entirely legitimate claims by the employer, is on 
the issue of replacement workers.  The government does not deserve 
our support on this, because it has shown a lack of political 
courage, given the strength of the arguments made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read paragraph 42(2.1) in order to illustrate my point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>42.(2.1) No employer or person acting on behalf of an 
employer shall use, for the demonstrated purpose of 
undermining a trade union's representational capacity rather 
than the pursuit of legitimate bargaining objectives, the 
services of a person who was not an employee in the bargaining 
unit on the date on which notice to bargain collectively was 
given and was hired or assigned after that date to perform all 
or part of the duties of an employee in the bargaining unit on 
strike or locked out. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will have noted, as did my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, last spring, the convoluted wording, behind 
which the meaning and particularly the government's will are 
difficult to find. The only obvious thing is this government's 
typical failure to take a stand, except where the Constitution is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from making it illegal to hire scabs, to call them what 
they are, or replacement workers, this practice legalizes, 
legitimizes, supports the hiring by an employer of such workers. 
When the bill says that no employer shall undermine a trade union's 
representational capacity, as in the passage I read earlier, what 
it is really setting out to do is to undermine the union's strike 
force with respect to the employer, who is authorized by law to 
hire replacement workers, or scabs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been so easy to follow Quebec's example. 
Here, as in many other areas, Quebec is an example of civilization 
and harmony.  In 1977, René Lévesque, with the then Labour Minister 
Pierre-Marc Johnson, had the strong support of his cabinet, 
although there was no consensus among Quebeckers, any more than 
there is consensus among members of the Canadian public today. 
Management is obviously not keen on the idea.  It was not keen in 
Quebec, it is not keen in Canada, it is certainly not keen in the 
United States, and it is probably not keen in France either.  In 
all western countries, there is no doubt that it goes very much 
against an employer's grain to be prohibited from engaging 
replacement workers to maintain production when employees are on 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question of balance of power, however.  This was what 
the Government of Quebec realized in 1977, even though there was no 
consensus. 
But fortunately the legislation was passed in 1977.  The Quebec 
Liberal Party took office in 1985, and never dared to tamper with 
Quebec's antiscab legislation, although Mr. Scowen, a cabinet 
member, was mandated by the government to study the issue and 
recommended that it be amended.  In its wisdom, the Bourassa 
government decided not to follow his advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was even a ruling by the supreme court in favour of the 
Conseil du patronat.  Members have heard of the wonderful supreme 
court.  Once again, in 1991, it overturned the law and authorized 
the Conseil du patronat to pursue its case to overturn the antiscab 
legislation.  The Conseil du Patronat also had the wisdom, heaven 
only knows why, not to take advantage of the opening being handed 
to it by the Supreme Court to take its case further.  That is very 
significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because further examination revealed that, since the 
introduction of antiscab legislation, strikes were 35% shorter and 
violence non-existent on picket lines.  These are signs of 
civilization.  These are signs of social progress that Canada, our 
neighbour, should be emulating.  No, it preferred to turn a deaf 
ear to the very legitimate claims of unions in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution would simply have been to declare the hiring of 
replacement workers or scabs an unfair practice by the employer, 
just as other practices have been declared unfair under the Canada 
Labour Code.  The definition of unfair practice is an important 
one.  It is an allegation that an employer, a union or an 
individual has taken part in an activity prohibited under the 
Canada Labour Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples of unfair practices: changing the conditions 
of employment after notification of an application for certification; 
negotiating in bad faith, if it can be demonstrated—this is an unfair 
practice recognized in the Canada Labour Code; interfering in the 
business of the union is an unfair practice on the part of the employer; 
failing to fulfil its duty of fair representation is an unfair practice 
on the part of the union; failing to provide members with financial 
statements is also an unfair practice under the Canada Labour Code and 
is subject to a penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not simply recognize that the hiring of scabs is an unfair 
practice under the Canada Labour Code? 
This is the bill's major flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hiring of replacement workers should be recognized as an unfair 
practice. The government cannot plead ignorance, because our research is 
based on the opinions and representations made by labour unions during 
the consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read two paragraphs in the brief submitted by the CSN at the 
hearings: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of antiscab provisions is a fundamental flaw that has 
the effect of prolonging labour disputes and creating an imbalance 
that prevents free collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hiring of scabs during a labour dispute is a source of 
frustration and violence. 
The presence of scabs being escorted by private security agencies, 
when it is not the police paid for with our taxes, is upsetting. It 
is difficult for employees who have made the reputation of a 
business or of an institution to see scabs crossing the picket 
lines every day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to read the very moving testimony given at these 
hearings by Claude Tremblay, the president of the Ogilvie workers union. 
This strike in Quebec was a very long one because the employer hired 
scabs. I will read long excerpts from the brief submitted at the time by 
Mr. Tremblay: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 110 workers I represent were more or less forced out 
on strike on June 6, 1994 after close to two years of 
unproductive negotiations with our new employer, the American 
giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). After an attempt to force 
us to accept its collective agreement, ADM took advantage of 
a loophole in the Canada Labour Code to impose it on us 
effective December 10, 1993.  In fact, legal precedents 
applying to the Canada Labour Relations Board allow an 
employer to unilaterally modify working conditions, once the 
right to strike or lockout is acquired, even though our 
previous collective agreement called for it to be in effect 
until renewed.  Unfortunately, these precedents provide—and 
the Canada Labour Code has nothing to say on the matter—that 
such clauses are illegal and do not prevent the employer from 
taking advantage of the legal vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this employer-imposed agreement did away with our 
seniority rights and the employer was threatening lay-offs 
that were not in order of seniority, we were forced to walk 
out in order to prevent the employer from doing this and also 
to force it to maintain what we had acquired over more than 30 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Powerful employers like ADM, and most of the employers subject 
to the Canada Labour Code, have plenty of power already 
without being given the additional power to impose their 
working conditions as soon as they are entitled to lock out 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a union, we believe that collective agreements should be 
maintained by law, at least until the right to strike is 
exercised.  As well, the act ought to permit inclusion in a

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After nearly 16 months of striking we managed to wring an 
ordinary collective agreement—ordinary within the context 
of Quebec—out of ADM.  However, it was extraordinary 
compared to the American pattern of agreement ADM had forced 
on its employees in over 138 collective agreements throughout 
its empire. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paragraph that follows is very significant.  There is no 
explanation for the government's insensitivity to these 
representations. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and 
month out, we endured subtle, underhanded and persistent 
violence. 
The violence of watching scabs stealing our rights, trucks 
entering and leaving full of wheat or flour, the CUM police 
arresting colleagues for nothing, security guards hired by ADM 
spying on us with cameras on public roads and up to our 
doorsteps, as if we were some sort of scum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part was 
discovering on our return to work that the scabs had botched our 
production so badly as to threaten the quality of Five Roses 
flour.  This reputation for quality is surely the best guarantee 
of our jobs.  The law, however, encourages short-sighted 
employers to threaten the survival of a business by allowing them 
to use unskilled workers, only to give them a psychological 
advantage against us in negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was this useful to ADM if, in its back to work agreement, the 
company not only agreed to fire these scabs but also promised not to 
rehire them for the duration of the collective agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the Canada Labour Code not prohibit the hiring of 
scabs, but the employment office in Verdun was even called upon to 
recruit them. Two months after the end of a 15 month long strike, 29 of 
our members, those with the least seniority, were not called back to 
work. Yet, they too had fought for the seniority rules that eventually 
had those with more seniority called back to work. These guys all had 
between 12 and 26 years of seniority and good and loyal uninterrupted 
service. They had contributed to the UI plan during all these years. 
Just the same, they did not qualify for benefits, while the scabs, who 
had worked unlawfully for 16 months, were treated with kid gloves and 
got full unemployment benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to us that this is a system that clearly works against 
workers who democratically decide to fight for their rights, against 
powerful and faceless companies like ADM, which pocket more than 
US $500 million in net profits every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are definitely in favour of prohibiting the use of scabs in the 
Canada Labour Code, in order to send a very clear message to foreign 
employers like ADM. Their investments are welcome in Canada and Quebec, 
provided that they show a minimum of respect for our ways. 
And these rules cannot be easily broken, because the 
Government of Canada, supposedly the government of Canadian 
workers, will have given us the tools to resist if they want 
to challenge the consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who think that prohibiting the use of scabs 
changes the balance unfairly in favour of the unions, I say 
“Have a look at things in Quebec and draw your own 
conclusions”.  Workers do not enjoy being on strike.  They 
exercise their right to strike only when they have no other 
choice, because it always ends up costing them a lot.  In 
passing, if you can get yourself a worthwhile job when you are 
on strike, you let me know, particularly when unemployment 
seems forever high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of changing the balance in favour of the unions, 
prohibiting employers to use scabs brings the forces back into 
balance to a point that favours more reasonable negotiations 
where both employer and union work to quickly find a common 
ground, develop relations that will enable them to reconcile 
their divergent interests and find solutions that reflect 
their convergent interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we want— 
</UL>
<This is still the president, representing the CSN, speaking:

receptive to this appeal, a dramatic one from a president speaking 
reasonably, honestly and courageously on behalf of his membership 
in a desire to advance the cause by suggesting useful amendments to 
the Canada Labour Code.  But this government preferred to listen to 
management and cronies, as it so often does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I draw members' attention to this issue of 
antiscab legislation, which exists in Quebec, but not in Canada, 
giving a constitutional flavour to the debate. 
In Quebec right now there are three categories of workers, which 
might very well get unionized employees in Quebec governed by the 
Canada Labour Code thinking.  On the eve of the next referendum, 
people should give some thought to the fact that Quebec—not that 
we are boasting—is ahead of Canada in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three categories of workers: non-unionized workers, 
unionized workers governed by the Quebec labour code and unionized 
workers who are protected by antiscab legislation in Quebec, and 
Quebec workers whose employment is governed by the Canada Labour 
Code, and who, if they ever went on strike, could see scabs turn up 
at any time and take away their jobs because they are governed by 
Canadian legislation that applies in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sovereign Quebec, all Quebec workers governed by the 
Quebec labour code would be safe from the sudden arrival of scabs 
to undermine their strike force.  I think this is something that 
could become important when Quebeckers are called upon in the near 
future, I am sure, to decide which side they are on.  I think that 
here, as in other matters, Quebec shows itself to be a civilized, 
and forward-looking society, whose progress on social issues is 
unparalleled in the western world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to take a bit of a different approach from 
the other opposition parties who have spoken already.  Both the 
official opposition and the Bloc Quebecois have spoken against 
Bill C-19 for very different reasons.  The NDP caucus is in 
favour of Bill C-19 and I would like to elaborate on some of the 
reasons we have taken that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with many of the remarks made by the Minister of 
Labour.  He spoke at length about the spirit of co-operation and 
consultation that went into arriving at the changes to the Canada 
Labour Code contained in Bill C-19.  That in itself is a process 
we want to recognize and value for future consultations.  By all 
accounts it was truly comprehensive and thorough.  All the people 
who should have been spoken to were and had ample opportunity to 
make their views known.  I do not think we could have done a more 
comprehensive job in consultation around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been noted already that the Canada Labour Code provides a 
framework for collective bargaining for over 700,000 Canadian 
workers.  It is incumbent on us to move speedy passage of Bill 
C-19 for those 700,000 workers who will benefit from much of the 
new amendments and changes to the code in making their workplaces 
more fair, more balanced and more equitable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 and its predecessor bill, Bill C-66, represent the 
first significant amendments to this legislation since the early 
1970s.  This is a review which we both welcome but think is long 
overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said, in June 1995 the task force chaired by Andrew 
Sims conducted a complete review of the code and recommended 
these legislative changes.  The task force held public hearings 
and the working group of labour and management officials was able 
to reach consensus on a number of key issues.  Its report 
“Seeking a Balance” was publicly released in February of 1996 
and in April of that year the Minister of Labour held meetings in 
a variety of locations to hear the views of all interested 
parties who cared to make a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66, unfortunately, was awaiting third reading in the 
Senate when Parliament was dissolved for the federal election. 
Were it not for that we would be enjoying some of the benefits of 
the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his credit, the current Minister of Labour has continued 
consultations with interested parties and while there have been 
changes to the wording of a few provisions, notably those dealing 
with replacement workers and off site workers, we are satisfied 
that these changes do not substantially alter the intent of the 
clauses and we are therefore pleased to report that our caucus 
can support Bill C-19.  Like most Canadians, we look forward to 
its speedy passage through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend those who participated in the process from labour, 
management and government for the work they have done in arriving 
at these changes.  I believe they have demonstrated a spirit of 
co-operation which is essential when dealing in matters of 
industrial relations, and their ability to do so bodes well for 
the long term stability which we all seek to achieve in this 
country's labour relations climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus believes that the Canada Labour Code, like any 
labour relations act, can and should be an instrument which 
fosters industrial relations harmony, economic stability and 
labour peace.  We believe that the proposed amendments bring this 
legislation that much closer to those principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend the proposed amendments which call for the 
establishment of a truly representational Canada industrial 
labour relations board composed of a neutral chair and members 
from both labour and management.  We believe this is a positive 
step which will more closely resemble the composition of 
provincial labour relations boards and which will be very much a 
vast improvement over the current Canada Labour Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also applaud the fact that the newly configured board will be 
given greater flexibility to deal quickly with urgent or time 
sensitive matters.  It will be a dramatic improvement when a 
single vice-chair will be able to determine some cases rather 
than waiting for the current three member panel which would be 
required to hear cases in the current configuration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current board structure has often been unable to respond 
quickly to matters brought before it, even when a delay can 
seriously jeopardize the case of the applicant, and we are 
critical that as many as 90 applications for certification are 
currently pending and waiting to be heard, especially when it is 
well known and well documented that unreasonable delays often 
cause the erosion of the applicant union's support in matters of 
application for certification.  We feel this situation is unfair 
to working people who have applied to be represented by a union 
of their choice and we hope that the matter can be corrected 
quickly by the introduction of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposals under the category of representation and successor 
rights recognize the right of the employers to communicate with 
employees during union organizing drives.  We caution the 
government that the proposed language in this clause has not been 
tested and that there is a great deal of room for abuse in 
provisions of this kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who is familiar with industrial relations knows that it 
is common practice for employers to try to thwart union 
organizing drives by using threats of plant closure, layoff or 
other negative consequences which are allegedly stemming from the 
employees' choice to form or join a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our belief that employers should be barred completely from 
communicating with employees in any matter pertaining to their 
right to join or to form a union.  Even the most subtle 
interference by an employer can intimidate an employee in these 
situations.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we are glad that other amendments in Bill C-19 
enable the board to remedy such unfair labour practices by 
granting automatic certification to an applicant union despite 
lack of evidence of majority support from the employees if the 
board is of the opinion that unfair labour practices such as 
threats or intimidation or coercion have made it impossible to 
determine the true wishes of the employees by use of a secret 
ballot because they fear some kind of negative reprisal from the 
employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision is similar to what already exists in a number of 
provincial jurisdictions and it is very important and key to the 
fairness of the whole organizing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important provision under this category enables the 
board to give an applicant union a list of names and addresses of 
off site employees who might work at home or some place other 
than the normal work place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment we feel reflects the changing nature of the 
workplace, and more and more workers have non-traditional work 
arrangements and may not be present at an employer's main 
workplace when a union organizer comes to distribute information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is only fair and reasonable that these workers who work at 
home or elsewhere should have access to the same information, the 
same literature the union might be promoting in the same way that 
it is only fair that they have a right to accept or reject the 
union's overtures. The union should have the right to communicate 
with all the employees in the bargaining unit and we applaud this 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 also contains positive amendments designed to clarify 
the rights and obligations of the parties during legal strikes 
and lockouts. It is understood there will be no general 
prohibition on the use of scabs during a legal strike or lockout. 
The use of scabs for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a 
union's representational capacity will be considered an unfair 
labour practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree fully with the previous speaker from the Bloc Quebecois 
that this language does not go far enough to protect the rights 
of workers and in fact many unions that made representation to 
the Sims task force spoke very strongly that absolute anti-scab 
legislation was necessary in any fair and civilized country that 
truly is trying to balance its labour relations climate. The 
province of Quebec is a good example, and I am glad the previous 
speaker spoke very eloquently about the impact of anti-scab 
legislation in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true the statistics and the empirical evidence bear out 
the fact that anti-scab legislation results in fewer strikes, 
shorter strikes, less picket line violence, in fact no picket 
lines because you do not need a picket line. Picket lines are 
designed to keep scabs out. It is simply the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very disappointed and we are very critical that Bill C-19 
does not give workers the satisfaction.  We are certainly not 
satisfied that we have done enough in this regard. This provision 
falls well short of true anti-scab legislation. At best it is a 
very weak compromise position. It just barely recognizes the 
legitimacy of the arguments associated with the use of scabs in 
strikes and lockouts.  The empirical evidence is easily available 
from as close as the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we wish this language were much stronger. It is not 
meant to be in this round of amendments to the labour code.  As 
such, there was a great deal of give and take and compromise in 
the development of these amendments. This is one of those things 
not meant to be in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, however, pleased that the code will guarantee that 
employees who are on strike or locked out will return to work 
before any scabs hired to replace them. In other words, there 
will be job protection for employees who are forced out of their 
jobs by either strike or lockout. They will go back to work first 
of course and they will have priority in any hiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jury is in on this one. There can be no doubt of the basic 
fairness of this issue. I think even my colleague from the Reform 
Party would have to agree that it is only right and it is only 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that a great deal of time and energy was spent by 
the task force looking for ways to ensure that work stoppages do 
not endanger public health and safety, and also to maintain grain 
exports during work stoppages involving port operations. Those 
two things were key and paramount and had to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new legislation the parties will be required to 
maintain certain services necessary to prevent danger to public 
health or safety during a work stoppage.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the grain handlers and their employers will retain the 
right to strike and the right to lockout, services to grain 
vessels will be maintained.  That point should be made very 
clearly and people should understand that there is nothing to 
stop the grain handlers or their employers from striking.  It is 
not a no-strike clause.  But grain will continue to go through 
even if there is a strike or a lockout or a work stoppage of any 
kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel this aspect of the code is of great interest to the farm 
community, to the agricultural industry and to the Canadian 
economy in general.  These changes will address once and for all 
concerns about work stoppages interfering with the marketing of 
our grain exports and I am confident that all parties can see the 
value in this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is one of those areas where there was a great deal 
of generosity and good will and compromise from all the parties 
around the table because it was brought as an issue to the task 
force.  The task force recognized that it is in the common good 
that grain should go through and in fact it has resolved it once 
and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the nature of this type of legislation that we are never 
going to please everybody and no stakeholder is going to be fully 
satisfied that all of their concerns are addressed, but in this 
instance I suggest it is the best we can do and I hope all the 
parties can see fit to support it on this basis if for no other 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even they do not like other aspects of this bill, this clause 
alone, the movement of grain, is of such critical importance that 
all parties should be getting behind Bill C-19 to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of Bill C-19, we are doing better than 
average.  A diverse cross-section of associations and 
organizations approve of Bill C-19.  They range fully from the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce to the Canadian Labour Congress and 
all the groups in between.  They believe that these amendments to 
Bill C-19 are the right thing to do and are a positive step 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are optimistic that all the parties in the House of Commons 
can see the value of these amendments to the Canada Labour Code 
and will vote in favour of Bill C-19 when called on to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always remember that we have an enviable labour 
relations climate in this country.  As the Minister of Labour 
pointed out, almost all negotiations under the jurisdiction of 
the Canada Labour Code are resolved with no time lost and no 
strike, no lockout, no labour unrest whatsoever.  A figure as 
high as 95% to 97% of all the bargaining and all the collective 
agreements are settled peacefully and amicably with both parties 
getting what they need through the collective bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a myth that the country loses significant productivity due 
to strikes and lockouts.  We will often have negative people 
saying this.  In actual fact in the province of Manitoba we lose 
about 50,000 person days a year to strikes and lockouts.  It 
sounds like a lot, except we lose 500,000 days a year to 
workplace injuries, accidents and illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really serious about productivity and about the 
economic impact of lost time due to work stoppages, cleaning up 
our work places would do a lot more good than being a nattering 
nabob and griping about strikes and lockouts all the time when in 
actual fact it is a myth.  We have created a tempest in a teapot 
for ideological reasons.  The actual facts do not bear it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who criticize this country's labour laws and regulations 
and those who think that unions cause a lot of strikes and 
lockouts usually do not know the facts.  They do not know the 
facts and figures like the numbers I just gave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are collective bargaining does not in itself cause a 
significant loss of productive time.  Therefore measures are not 
necessary to try to address that.  It is unsafe workplaces, I 
argue, that cause the significant loss of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus supports the changes to part I of the labour code but 
we ask this government to go further.  We ask this government to 
move quickly to review part II and part III of the Canada Labour 
Code, and some steps in those directions are already under way, 
so that we can really update and revamp the entire code to make 
it a more balanced and fair piece of legislation, especially in 
the case of part II which deals with workplace safety and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for Canadians to take seriously the issue of 
workplace safety and health, if not for ethical reasons or the 
obvious downside of people getting injured, for the economic 
reasons I have pointed out, the hundreds of thousands of 
productive days lost to workplace injuries. 
Surely if we can put a man on the moon we can design methods of 
production that do not result in significant harm to workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been a sore point for me that workplace injuries 
and workplace deaths rarely make the newspapers.  If someone is 
stabbed or murdered in the streets of Winnipeg it is going to be 
front page news.  However if someone is injured on the job, we 
somehow resign ourselves to the fact that some industries are 
dangerous, people get hurt, accidents happen.  This is simply not 
true.  We cannot tolerate it and we should not be tolerating that 
kind of an attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba there are fatal workplace accidents every year. 
There are enough amputated limbs, digits and toes to fill a 
pick-up truck every year.  It is a graphic illustration about how 
unsafe our workplaces really are.  We really do not know how many 
are slowly being poisoned by some kind of chemical soup they are 
forced to work with or the impact of various types of chemicals 
when harmless chemical <I>A</I> meets with harmless chemical 
<I>B</I> and if our kidneys create chemical <I>C</I> which is in 
fact harmful to the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I am hypersensitive about this particular issue.  When I 
was young, age 18 to 20, I worked in the asbestos mines in the 
Yukon. At that time asbestos was not recognized as an 
occupational hazard.  Workers compensation did not cover asbestos 
because it denied it was bad for us.  When we asked if it was 
true that this stuff was supposed to be bad for us, the foreman 
would say “No, it is harmless so do not worry about it”.  As a 
result we were covered with the stuff.  It gets up your nose, it 
gets in your ears, it gets under your armpits and it is on your 
clothes when you go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, within two years of quitting the mine and being 
lied to by those people who did know better, an announcement was 
made internationally that there was no such thing as a safe level 
asbestos.  One part per billion is too much asbestos.  It is 
carcinogenic and it is hazardous at any level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of example we are dealing with.  We do not know 
how many substances are like that in workplaces.  It is that much 
more critical that we have to revamp the labour code to offer 
real, solid protection to Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have WHMIS.  We have WHMIS legislation.  We have the right 
to refuse unsafe work.  We do not have it updated and modernized 
and clearly stated so that it can act in a way that will protect 
the interest of working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as we are in favour of part I of the code, we strongly 
encourage the government to move quickly on part II and part III, 
finish the job and move forward with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of workers and taking care of themselves in hazardous 
conditions, any further amendments to the code must have some 
recognition of whistle blowing protection.  Workers do not dare 
sound the alarm for unsafe conditions for fear of being slapped 
with a lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak again from my personal background.  I shut down a job 
one time because the scaffolding was so dangerous that it was a 
hazard to the people working there.  Within a few days that same 
scaffolding fell over on to the emergency room of a hospital.  It 
punctured the roof, caused half a million dollars in damage and 
almost killed a bunch of people waiting for medical services in 
the emergency room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case went to court, the judge found the company not guilty 
and there was no fault or blame assigned.  The company sued me 
for turning the company in and saying that it had unsafe working 
conditions on site.  It wanted $80,000 damages because I damaged 
the reputation of the company by saying its scaffolding was 
unsafe when it fell over on to the hospital.  I was okay.  I was 
working for a union and the union picked up my tab.  Normal 
workers do not have that protective umbrella. Without some kind 
of whistle blowing protection they would never be able to protect 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the speedy passage of Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, we are going to have 
questions and comments for 10 minutes.  I see two members 
standing so we will split their time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with the member for Winnipeg Centre that Bill C-19 is good 
legislation.  I am not sure about the amendments, but the bill is 
good.  I disagree with him on the remark he made about asbestos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countries in Europe that are currently proposing 
banning asbestos. 
That would be devastating for asbestos workers across Canada. It 
is based on the same misinformation that the member for Winnipeg 
Centre cited. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the International Labour Organization in Geneva, with 
which the Canadian labour union movement operates very, very 
closely, has developed a convention that has been approved by the 
ILO.  It talks about the safe use of asbestos and ways of 
applying and installing asbestos safely.  I would ask the member 
to please check his facts on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment briefly if I could on the comments 
earlier by the Reform labour critic.  We have had this debate 
before in this House very briefly.  It has to do with final offer 
selection arbitration. Again I come back and ask the member, if 
there is a system where they either accept one position or the 
other, it seems to me that what there is is one happy party and 
one unhappy party. I am not sure that is the way we should solve 
labour disputes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded again of some of the ironies of Reform policy 
positions.  On the one hand, they will say we should let the 
market decide, but there are big exceptions when it comes to 
labour negotiations when it affects prairie farmers.  I would 
have to say at the outset I have a lot of empathy with the plight 
of the prairie farmers when it comes to getting their product to 
market, and all Canadians do. On the one hand they say to let the 
market decide and on the other hand they say when it comes to 
labour-management negotiations as it affects wheat shipments to 
the ports that we should put in this final offer selection 
arbitration where neither party will be happy with the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should pause and reflect on these proposals by the 
members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the 
issue about the safe levels of asbestos.  There is no safe level 
of asbestos.  One part per billion is unsafe.  There are handling 
procedures.  It is much like a class 4 virology laboratory. 
Everything has to be double sealed in a pressurized environment. 
Workers have to change their clothes as they go into the chambers 
and when they go out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so complicated that the cost of removing asbestos in a 
building 20 years old is greater than the cost of building the 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a lot about asbestos.  We teach the courses on how to 
work safely with asbestos with our union because sometimes it is 
unavoidable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the building I am in, the Wellington Building, they are 
trying to remove the asbestos from that building because they are 
concerned that one part per billion in the air will cause 
hazards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a famous case of a little girl who would ride her 
bicycle to the mine in Asbestos, Quebec to bring her father his 
lunch only during the summer holidays.  Maybe a couple of times a 
year she would bring her dad his lunch to the mine.  She wound up 
with asbestosis after the 20-year incubation period. There is no 
safe limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is criminal for countries to be dumping asbestos into the 
third world and everyone knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could just quickly comment on final offer selection, I have 
very strong views about final offer selection. I have used final 
offer selection in my own collective bargaining where it was 
allowed under the legislation in the province of Manitoba. It is 
not a solution.  It is not a magic bullet. The Reform Party keeps 
revisiting this as though it is some new idea.  It is nowhere 
near a new idea.  It is not even a very good idea.  It has very 
limited value in the labour relations climate and that is why it 
is rarely used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to agree with the previous speaker that final offer 
selection is highly overrated.  It is a tool in the tool chest of 
labour relations practitioners who can use it if they both see 
fit. But any time it is legislated, it will lose its value and it 
will corrupt the whole labour relations process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find the member from Winnipeg and his comments rather alarming in 
the sense that he is from an agricultural province and he sure 
does not understand the system when it comes to the unions and 
how they can tie up grain as it moves across the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions.  One specific question I would 
like to ask the member is if the brotherhood of electrical 
workers decides to go on strike and the other unions, the 
maintenance of way, the Canadian Auto Workers, the stevadores who 
may load the ship, and the grain handlers do not, does he think 
for one minute that any of those other unions are not going to 
cross the picket line in support of their brothers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather alarming that he would even suggest to this 
House and to those who are listening that the unions are not that 
tightly bound and that this legislation does not solve that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being that the member is from an agricultural province, I can be 
certain about one thing, he knows absolutely nothing about grain 
handling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  He is from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  So what if he is from Manitoba, that is 
an agricultural province is it not?  He is not speaking on behalf 
of the farmers, nor does he even understand the losses that 
farmers have obtained through these kinds of foolish antics where 
the unions have tied up grain movement across the western 
provinces to the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the member, and the members across the way who formulated 
this legislation, going to see that the interests of the farmers 
are being paid attention to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer as best I 
can, but I found it to be a very convoluted question.  The member 
does not fully understand what is going on here in terms of Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 states that even if there is a strike or a lockout 
from any of those unions that are under federal jurisdiction, 
grain will continue to be shipped with no interruption not only 
to the port but loaded onto ships and beyond. The member does not 
fully understand.  The changes to this are making his argument 
for him.  Bill C-19 means that grain will move even if any one of 
those unions or all of those unions go on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Yes, it is true.  The grain will be 
loaded onto the ships and it will be shipped out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is saying that other unions will cross the picket 
line to go with their brothers.  I do not think he really 
understands how labour relations work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Manitoba does have a great agricultural 
industry.  I have grown up with it so I probably know as much 
about it as the member does.  I do not think he really did his 
homework or he would not be so flummoxed about this whole 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  You haven't done yours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  You are wrong.  You are fundamentally 
wrong.  You are absolutely wrong. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
severeal months after indicating its intent to introduce a bill to 
amend part I of the Canada Labour Code, the government has finally 
got around to introducing Bill C-19 in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might have thought that, after such a long wait, the 
government would have made some constructive changes.  One might 
have thought that it would also have taken the time to amend its 
bill so as to respond to the legitimate concerns voiced on all 
sides during the last Parliament.  But no. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1995 the Minister of Labour appointed a task force of 
labour relations experts chaired by Andrew Sims to conduct an 
independent review and recommend changes to part I of the Canada 
Labour Code.  Its report “Seeking a Balance”, also referred to 
as the Sims report, was released in February 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After consultation with unions and business representatives, the 
former Minister of Labour introduced Bill C-66 in November 1996 
during the last Parliament.  Bill C-66 was rushed through the 
House of Commons.  The Senate social affairs committee gave it 
careful consideration and PC senators outlined major flaws in the 
bill, especially with respect to replacement workers, off site 
workers and union certification without the majority vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 6, 1997 the Minister of Labour introduced Bill C-19, 
vastly similar to its predecessor Bill C-66.  The minor 
amendments proposed to the bill do not go far enough to allay 
some of the concerns raised during the last Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government chose to make half-hearted 
changes.  Instead of concerning itself with developing the best 
legislation possible, it chose the easy route. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great pity, for the bill we are examining is 
intended to substantially modernize industrial relations.  This is 
the first time in 25 years that part I of the Canada Labour Code 
has undergone a thorough revision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one more reason to make sure the proposed changes 
stand up to the closest of scrutinies.  If we have to wait another 
25 years for any changes to this bill, let us make sure that the 
proposed amendments are properly tailored to the reality of today's 
and tomorrow's work place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our actions throughout this entire process will be prompted by 
that concern, to develop a bill that is fair and equitable for all. 
The Sims report is entitled “Seeking a Balance”, and that is what 
we too are seeking, a balance between interests and parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like a number of the others who have spoken out, we too hope 
that the government will make an effort to resist the temptation to 
ram this bill through without allowing the lawmakers time to 
analyze the impact of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be perfectly clear, it is not our wish to delay passage 
of this bill unduly.  What we do want is for all parties concerned 
to have the opportunity to bring out their points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how important the proposed changes to the Canada 
Labour Code are.  As I indicated earlier, we have legitimate 
concerns, which we hope to address in greater detail at subsequent 
stages of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment, our reservations are such that we cannot vote 
in favour of this bill as this stage in the legislative process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns we have with the bill as it stands deals 
with replacement workers.  Understandably this is one of the most 
contentious issues for all parties concerned.  For the Sims task 
force this issue is one of the few on which the authors could not 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the authors argued in favour of a complete ban on the use 
of replacement workers, as is the case in labour legislation in 
Quebec and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority argued against a general ban on the use of 
replacement workers and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be no general prohibition on the use of replacement 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the use of replacement workers in a dispute is 
demonstrated to be for the purpose of undermining the union's 
representative capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives, this should be declared an unfair labour 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of a finding of such an unfair labour practice, the 
Board should be given the specific remedial power to prohibit the 
future use of replacement workers in a dispute. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 did not stipulate clearly that there was no ban on the 
use of replacement workers.  Instead it stated that no employer 
or person shall use the services of a replacement worker for the 
purpose of undermining a trade union's representational capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During Senate hearings no one seemed to know how the terms of 
the bill would be interpreted.  For instance, this is what Nancy 
Riche of the Canadian Labour Congress had to say: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This is a very interesting clause but no one seems to know 
how it will be interpreted.  We will know that only after the first 
case has been heard by the CIRB.” 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What constitutes an unfair labour practice and what constitutes 
undermining a trade union's representational capacity were left 
in the air for the new Canada Industrial Relations Board to 
interpret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their report senators from all parties urged the new CIRB to 
respect the findings of the Sims task force in interpreting and 
applying the provisions concerning replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the government made changes to the replacement 
workers provisions in Bill C-19.  The bill now stipulates that no 
employer or person shall use a replacement worker for the 
demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this formulation comes closer to what the Sims task force 
had in mind, in our opinion it is still not made clear enough 
that it is an exceptional measure meant to address reprehensible 
behaviour on the part of an employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As senators argued in Bill C-66, there is a fundamental 
difference between using replacement workers to ensure that the 
employer may carry on its normal business during a strike and 
using them for the purpose of undermining a union's 
representational capacity.  The mere use of replacement workers 
does not in and of itself raise the presumption of unfair 
bargaining practices.  These arguments still ring true in Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as it stands does not properly address the meaning of 
the wording used.  As further evidence, here is what the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> has said about these provisions in its November 21, 
1997 editorial.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technically, the ban (on replacement workers) would apply only to 
workers whose employment would undermine the “representational 
capacity” of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But since strikes are a tool unions use in representing workers, 
and replacement workers make strikes less effective, it is hard 
to imagine any of them that would not fit that definition— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, an article in the <I>Financial Post</I> expressed 
the following concerns: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—now that they've had time to read the fine print, the major 
industries affected aren't so pleased—The revised code will 
still allow federally regulated industries, some of which are key 
to keeping the economy running, to use replacement workers during 
a strike or lockout, but not if it is seen to undermine a union's 
representational capacity. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means exactly isn't entirely clear.  Also, the wording 
of this provision may prevent management transferring people from 
other parts of the company to keep operations going. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another big concern of ours has to do with unions having access to 
lists of off site workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims work force recognized the need to balance the opportunity 
for off site workers to consider the benefits of collective bargaining 
or take advantage of these benefits against their right to privacy and 
personal security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-66, the government legislated that the new Canada 
industrial relations board may provide an authorized representative of 
a labour union a list of the names and addresses of employees who 
normally work at home for an employer and allow this representative to 
contact them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister stated he had consulted the Department of 
Justice to make sure the privacy of off site workers would not be 
jeopardized, the Senate committee heard the Privacy Commissioner of 
Canada, who had serious reservations about the provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister at the time even suggested that the privacy 
commissioner's concerns were not legitimate. He tried to minimize them 
by intimating that they arose from management lobbying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the offices of the privacy commissioner and the 
information commissioner are independent offices, accountable to 
Parliament and no one else, the same way that the auditor general is for 
instance. By minimizing these concerns, the minister could justify 
sweeping them under the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, the current minister tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to 
correct the situation with Bill C-19. He added a statutory prohibition 
on the use of information provided under this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, he further defined the board's power to release 
information to off site workers or to instruct the employer to do so 
through its electronic communications system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these amendments do not appear to be enough. This 
time, the minister's officials consulted with the privacy commissioner, 
who said that he still had some reservations about the provisions of the 
bill, particularly the infamous clauses 50 and 54. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am running out of time so I will only address one other issue 
of concern even though there are more.  It is the case of the new 
board's ability to allow certification without a majority of 
employees having voted for unionization.  The board can do this 
if it feels there has been an unfair labour practice on the part 
of the employer.  In Bill C-19 the legislation remains unchanged 
on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 election we proposed to strengthen worker protection 
under federal labour laws giving workers more democratic powers 
by requiring secret ballots and votes on union representations 
and decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such reforms were enacted by former Conservative Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher in Britain.  They have proven so popular with 
workers that they are now endorsed by the Labour Party under Tony 
Blair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of ensuring more democratic power to workers, the 
government has chosen the way of ill-conceived legislation that 
has proven to have bizarre interpretations in other 
jurisdictions, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring to the attention of the House a situation 
that occurred recently in Windsor where the Ontario Labour 
Relations Board, armed with provisions similar to those in Bill 
C-19, ruled that a minority of workers could impose their will on 
the majority because of an alleged unfair labour practice on the 
part of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the unfair labour practice?  The managers of the store 
asked whether it would close if it were unionized, followed legal 
advice and refused to comment.  What were they supposed to say? A 
yes almost certainly would have been judged to be intimidation, 
but a no would have led to lawsuits had higher labour cost in 
fact put the store out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also have helped the union's case immeasurably, which 
an employer should not be obligated to do.  In the OLRB's view, 
the managers' refusal to answer was such a grievous violation of 
workers' rights that it invalidated not only this but any future 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the managers could not avoid unfair labour practices by 
saying yes, saying no or saying nothing, it is reasonably clear 
that legislation of this sort has some peculiar implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the implications of such provisions, we should be wary 
of enacting the same ones here. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by touching very briefly on a few other issues that 
concern us regarding the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the provisions to the effect that the grain would 
continue to move in the event of a work stoppage at ports. However, we 
are prepared to look at the impact of extending this protection to other 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also feel that the repeal of part II of the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act is suspicious and could deprive Canadians of 
valuable information on unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues and many more will be reviewed when Bill C-19 is 
examined in committee. 
Again, I hope we can conduct a serious and thorough review of this bill. 
It will ensure the quality of the legislation passed by this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I was interested in the member's comments.  I would like his 
opinion on a couple of points that have not been addressed in a 
thorough manner.  They deal with the old board with a new name. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board has a fair amount of power and yet does not seem to 
have an opportunity for any kind of recourse for a decision that 
it may make, regardless of how it may impact on either of the 
parties.  In other words, there is no appeal, for the most part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, with the power granted to this board it can 
certify a union, for one thing, without the consent of the 
majority of the employees.  I am curious about the member's 
opinion on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIRB can also order an employer to release to the union the 
names and addresses of off site employees, which again can be 
done without employee consent.  Again, there is a fair amount of 
power associated with that kind of decision making.  I am 
wondering what the member thinks of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point has always been a concern here, especially so 
since the Liberal government has a tendency to really love these 
quasi-judicial bodies.  They can make decisions and the minister 
can stand up in the House and say “I cannot do anything about 
that.  That is a quasi-judicial body and I cannot interfere with 
any decisions it makes”.  And there are lots of them over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes away the responsibility of the minister in dealing with 
the issue at hand.  In other words, he is no longer accountable. 
I see the same kind of events taking place here with this new 
labour relations board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the board makes a decision, its intents and purposes are 
supposed to be final.  Although the federal court says it will 
allow for a review of the board's decision, there is no provision 
allowing this senior judicial body to set aside the board's 
decisions even if they were legal errors or if the case was 
handled in an unreasonable way.  What is the recourse that an 
employer would have?  What is the recourse even that an employee 
or group of employees would have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for Calgary Northeast to give me the opportunity to stand 
again and speak more on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member.  One of the situations that I put 
in my speech is when we look at the situation of the store 
manager where the vote was 151 to 43, and they installed the 
union anyway, what is the recourse for the company here?  What is 
the recourse for the employees who did not want it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other vehicles that we can put in place.  When there 
is a strike, where it becomes violent and tension starts to build 
is when replacement workers are brought in.  There is no vehicle 
put in place where the employer and the unions can meet in trying 
to alleviate this tension, this violence.  I suggest that we 
might even talk about having a vehicle put in place to bring down 
violence in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every strike, where it starts is exactly right there.  When 
replacement workers start to come in, we see broken windows, we 
see everything happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to that 151 to 43, I wonder if the government today 
would pass legislation if we had the same vote, 151 against and 
43 for.  Would it pass legislation anyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I asked a question of 
the member for Winnipeg. 
Of course he, living in an urban area, working in a neat little 
office, tucked away in some high-rise building, would not 
understand what some of the farmers have to go through and the 
losses which are incurred when a strike takes place.  Being from 
the legal profession, that gentleman answers from that point of 
view.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the average hardworking farmer or those in the 
industries related to farming, he is not really addressing their 
concerns.  I do not think he really wants to, given the fact that 
the courtroom is where so much of this is decided. This 
legislation fits into that whole scheme of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to look at clause 87.7(1) which 
concerns services to grain vessels— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member of the Reform Party has referred to my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre as a lawyer and the record should 
show that my colleague is not a lawyer, he is a carpenter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  I am sorry, Madam Speaker. I did not mean 
to tarnish his image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 87.7(1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a strike or lockout not prohibited by this part, an 
employer in the longshoring industry, or other industry included 
in paragraph (a) of the definition “federal work, undertaking or 
business” in section 2, its employees and their bargaining agent 
shall continue to provide the services they normally provide to 
ensure the tie-up, let-go and loading of grain vessels at 
licensed terminal and transfer elevators, and the movement of the 
grain vessels in and out of a port. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the member's interpretation of that clause I would ask him if 
he understands that to mean just dockside and in close vicinity 
to the grain handling on that end, or does it really apply to the 
whole myriad of unions involved in grain handling and rail 
transport from the prairies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not from a grain area, 
I am from New Brunswick.  But the member for Brandon—Souris is 
the only member of our party who is from western Canada, and 
believe me, I know about grain.  I did not know anything before I 
came to this place, but I know now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the comment of the member is concerned, in my speech I 
supported the movement of grain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also want to look at other industries. Hopefully it 
applies to all ports and all unions.  That is my understanding. 
I do not know if it is his understanding.  If grain is shipped 
through western Canada, through eastern Canada or wherever, 
farmers should be able to ship that grain through whatever means 
available, whether it be via trains or the ports.  They are all 
federally regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments of the hon. member are well taken.  I certainly 
approve of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

and I have about a nine minute speech, I would like to ask that 
the House allow me to deliver my speech even if it goes over the 
time permitted by two or three minutes.  Would there be consent 
for me to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the House give 
its consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
niceness of my colleagues this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to stand today in support of Bill C-19, an act to 
amend part I of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important conclusion of the Sims task force, whose work 
contributed greatly to this bill, was that the Canada Labour Code 
is generally accepted by labour and management groups as a viable 
framework which has facilitated collective bargaining in the 
federally regulated private sector. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the bill does not seek to drastically overhaul the 
Canada Labour Code.  Rather, it seeks to bring the code more into 
line with present realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has two very important objectives, to update 
regulations governing the collective bargaining process so that 
it can function more effectively, and to improve the efficiency 
of the administration of the federal labour law.  Both of these 
objectives are very timely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time part I of the Canada Labour Code was subjected to 
comprehensive amendments was in the early 1970s.  As my 
colleagues will appreciate, the federally regulated private 
sector workplace, to which the code applies, has been subject to 
a number of significant changes since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privatization of government services has meant the transfer of 
some jobs from the public service to the private sector.  They 
are now regulated by the code.  Deregulation policies such as 
open skies and the elimination of the Crow rate have changed the 
conditions of competition in a number of industries regulated by 
the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has had a direct impact on collective bargaining as unions 
and management have realized that a work stoppage can have a 
serious impact on market share and profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in trade policies, the adoption of new technologies and 
changing market conditions have also had significant effect on 
the federally regulated private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of these changes, unions have generally been on the 
defensive.  Employers have pressed for industrial change and the 
very existence of collective bargaining has come under some 
scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the view that collective bargaining is no longer 
relevant.  The freedom of workers to organize and bargain 
collectively is a cornerstone of our democratic, market based 
society.  It is the means by which employees claim a proper 
reward for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian employers also benefit from a collective bargaining 
system.  It helps to ensure stability, predictability and 
efficiency.  For example, more than 95% of collective agreements 
in Canada are negotiated without a work stoppage.  When problems 
do occur, the services of experienced and effective mediators and 
conciliators are available to assist in finding solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic growth and social development depend as much on social 
relations and social processes as on technology and capital.  In 
times of dramatic economic change, globalization and new trading 
blocs, it is important that we have in place an efficient, 
effective and responsive collective bargaining system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss just a few of the measures contained in 
this legislation which will ensure that we have such a system in 
place as we face the challenges of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would significantly improve the administration of part 
I of the code by restructuring the Canada Labour Relations Board. 
The non-representational CLRB would be replaced with a 
representational Canada industrial relations board.  The new 
board would be made up of a neutral chairperson and 
vice-chairpersons and equal numbers of board members representing 
labour and management groups.  This would increase the confidence 
of those appearing before the board that their submissions are 
fully understood and properly reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions made by the board, especially those involving the 
exercise of the board's discretion, would be more credible in the 
eyes of both labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of part time regional representatives of labour 
and management would significantly improve the cost effectiveness 
of the board, allow the board to benefit from the expertise of 
persons who are active on each side in the labour relations and 
foster links between the board and the labour relations 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures to reorganize the board contained in the bill would 
also make it more flexible, allowing it to respond much more 
quickly to both routine and emergency issues.  Rather than a 
three member panel, for example, a single vice-chairperson would 
be able to resolve some cases.  In some cases such as preliminary 
motions or requests for the extension of time limits this simply 
makes sense.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to the board would be enhanced by a repeal of the 
provision which requires the parties to obtain ministerial 
consent before filing an allegation of bad faith bargaining. This 
would be particularly significant in cases where an immediate 
hearing is needed to break a deadlock in negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would give grievance arbitrators a number of important 
new procedural powers.  These would make for a more flexible and 
efficient arbitration process and would be an important step in 
ensuring that grievance arbitration is reserved for the 
resolution of disputes that the parties cannot resolve on their 
own.  These new powers are necessary because the arbitration 
process has become more and more complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the administration of the Canada Labour Code 
would also be enhanced by the provisions in the bill to 
strengthen the federal mediation and conciliation service.  This 
service is important and has repeatedly proven extremely 
effective in helping management and labour to reach collective 
agreements.  The economic impact of work stoppages prevented by 
the FMCS is incalculable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final provision of the bill which would improve the 
administration of the code is the requirement that the Minister 
of Labour meet occasionally with representatives of labour and 
employer groups and with labour relations experts.  This will 
allow the minister to receive advice and feedback from the labour 
relations community, a good thing I would think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the benefits of Canada's long history of free collective 
bargaining has been the development of an exceptionally talented 
labour relations community. It is appropriate that the code be 
amended so that the minister can take full advantage of the 
talents of our mediators, facilitators, arbitrators, fact 
finders, adjudicators and labour relations academics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time prevents me from discussing the many other provisions of 
this legislation which will improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Canada Labour Code.  Allow me to conclude by 
saying simply that this bill recognizes what labour and 
management groups have already said, that the code is an 
effective framework for collective bargaining in the federally 
regulated private sector.  The bill seeks to improve the 
efficiency and relevance of this framework and not to replace it. 
Faith in collective bargaining and in the labour relations 
community is central to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the bill are based on extensive consultations 
with union leaders, representatives of employer groups and other 
interested parties across the country. Although these parties 
agree that part I of the Canada Labour Code has functioned well 
in the past to provide a stable environment for collective 
bargaining, they also agree that the time has come to amend the 
code, to make sure it continues to function well into the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to support this legislation because I believe that it 
will help both employers and employees in the federal 
jurisdiction by providing them with the type of modern and 
relevant collective bargaining and labour-management system that 
they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deserves all of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5.33 p.m.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should: (a) 
develop, along with their provincial counterparts, a 
comprehensive National Head Start Program for children in their 
first 8 years of life; (b) ensure that this integrated program 
involves both hospitals and schools, and is modelled on the 
experiences of the Moncton Head Start Program, Hawaii Head Start

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, some years ago I was working in a jail 
as a physician. 
A couple of young women, 13 and 14 year old prostitutes and IV 
drug abusers were sitting across from me. They were incarcerated 
for the nth time in this institution. After examining them I said 
that I did not think they would live to see their 18th birthdays. 
They smiled and said quite softly that they probably did not see 
any need to live to 18 years of age anyway. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were individuals who had endured many years of suffering. 
Their parents were prostitutes.  They had lived on the streets 
since they were 10.  They started hooking at the age of 12 and 
started mainlining drugs at the age of 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wrong.  It was not that they did not live to see their 
18th birthdays; they did not live to see their 15th birthdays. 
One young woman was found murdered at the end of a lonely road. I 
saw the other one while doing rounds on the pediatric ward. She 
had suffered a massive stroke after a cocaine overdose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the children who are affected by the problems in our 
society.  We look at those who are in custody in detention 
centres.  While their history does not exonerate them for their 
actions, perhaps looking at their history will provide us with a 
clue as to how they got there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of those children in detention centres have 
suffered years and years of abuse in environments we would not 
wish on anybody.  Years of neglect, sexual abuse, violence, 
malnourishment, complete lack of parental involvement in their 
upbringing. These are the histories of so many of those children. 
Our response historically has been the expensive management of 
these children while they are in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Motion No. 261 I am trying to change our focus, to look 
not at the management of crime but to use some of our existing 
resources in the prevention of crime and to look at the root 
causes of crime.  Parental neglect, child abuse, physical abuse, 
the witnessing of abuse, malnourishment, even the absence of 
proper parental involvement with the children, all of these 
things play a role in the development and damage of an 
individual's psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent medical evidence has demonstrated quite conclusively, 
from things such as the positron emission tomographer, that the 
development of a normal psyche starts while the fetus is growing 
in the womb of the mother.  At that time events can take place 
that can radically change the ability of that individual to 
function properly in society, such as the exposure to alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the child is born the exposure to abuse, neglect and 
malnourishment all have a profound effect on the ability of the 
child to develop the underpinnings of a normal psyche which 
enables them to become a productive, integrated member of society 
who can have normal interpersonal relationships.  Destroy the 
development of that individual at that critical time in the first 
eight years of life and we have a child that at best often 
develops personality disorders, conduct disorders or at worst, 
becomes incarcerated in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to move our thinking and engage in a paradigm shift.  If 
there is one thing I hope the government and its members, as 
members on our side and in fact in all political parties will do 
is to recognize the fact that prevention is more important than 
management. It is a lot cheaper and more effective for us to deal 
with these problems from time zero than to try to manage the 
situation when the child is incarcerated in an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change our thinking.  If the government were to adopt 
this motion it would be the single greatest paradigm shift in 
social policy thinking in this country in the last 20 years.  It 
would radically save a lot of money and dramatically change the 
lives, welfare and well-being of so many children, particularly 
some of the most underprivileged children in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is based on a few programs.  I would like to give 
credit today to the member for Moncton who has been a leader in 
our country and in fact the world on developing the Moncton head 
start program. She has done an outstanding job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay credit to my colleague from 
Saanich—Gulf Islands.  He has done an outstanding job in our 
hometown of Victoria in trying as a lawyer and now as a 
parliamentarian to develop ways in which we can not only address 
individuals who are incarcerated now but also to engage in 
prevention.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is based on three programs, one of which is the 
Moncton head start program which the member for Moncton was a 
leader in starting. This program recognizes that there needs to 
be parental involvement in the development of children. It 
started in 1974.  It brings together high risk families in an 
environment where the parents are involved with the children in 
learning things that sometimes we take for granted, nutrition, 
proper parenting skills, the importance of play, the importance 
of having quality time with those children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that many of those parents did not 
themselves have good parenting skills because their parents did 
not have good parenting skills.  The cycle continues and in order 
to break that cycle, sometimes active intervention is required in 
a co-operative and constructive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton head start program demonstrated that very 
conclusively.  It worked.  It decreased crime rates.  It 
decreased the incidents of those children running afoul of the 
law. They stayed in school longer.  It also demonstrated a $6 
saving for every dollar that was put into the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hawaii head start program has been in existence for quite 
some time.  It has seen the importance of using volunteers, 
usually women who were very good parents and were trained to 
develop a bonding relationship with families at risk.  They dealt 
with child abuse, violence in the home, drug problems, substance 
abuse problems. These were dealt with in a co-operative 
arrangement.  The outcome was a 99% drop in child abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last program has actually been in existence the longest.  It 
is the Perry pre-school program in Ypsilante, Michigan in 
existence since 1962. We have had over three decades of rigorous 
scientific analysis of this program to see what works and what 
does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this program demonstrated as many of the other ones did is 
that active early involvement to provide children with the basic 
necessities of life enabled the children to stay in school 
longer.  There was a 50% drop in the crime rate and a 40% drop in 
teen pregnancies.  There was less demand on social programs and 
the welfare rolls and the children got through school and had 
higher incomes at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a win-win situation. It also demonstrated a massive 
saving to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 261 asks the government to work with its provincial 
counterparts to implement the best from all these programs. There 
are good things and bad things.  One can easily take a motion 
like this one and build it into some kind of Cadillac model where 
money will just be poured down some sinkhole and little will get 
to the people who really need it and little effect will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is to become a reality, it requires a leader.  It 
is true that most of the sentiments expressed within this motion 
are in the realm of the provinces.  I will be the first to admit 
that. But for heaven's sake, someone has to take a leadership 
role and no one is.  A hodge-podge of programs exists within our 
country, a little bit here and a little bit there.  Some of them 
are good and some of them are not.  There is overlap.  The left 
hand does not know what the right hand is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can take a leadership role by bringing 
the first ministers together, locking them in a room like was 
done for the Dayton peace accord and telling them they will not 
get out until they sort out the problem.  They will put on the 
table what they have and they will develop a comprehensive 
strategy that involves medical personnel, the schools and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way there is no overlap.  There is a streamlining of the 
program and we can ensure that the basic needs of the children 
are met not in a Cadillac program but in a program that is cost 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has to be analysed very carefully to ensure that our 
outcomes warrant the investment and that money is not spent 
unwisely.  There is a lot of room here for financial abuse and 
inefficiency.  But there is also an enormous opportunity for us 
to take the bull by the horns, put our existing resources where 
they can make the best effect and deal with prevention to ensure 
that these children do not slip through the cracks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech the government mentioned a few interesting 
things that demonstrate in principle a support for the type of 
motion I am talking about and also the fact that it has put a 
series of important funding programs in existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health transition fund is being organized by the government 
to help the provinces make innovative and co-operative 
arrangements with the federal government to deal with areas of 
primary care. I would argue that this is an issue of primary care 
that goes across health care, justice and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than having this conglomeration of programs where all 
this overlap exists, swallowed up in part by bureaucracy, let us 
make sure the dollars get to the kids and where they are needed 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the national children's agenda that exists. All 
these can be used against the backdrop of what this motion is 
asking for, and indeed the government has already implemented 
among aboriginal communities head start programs which I hope 
will be effective and which are long overdue. Not only the 
aboriginal community on reserves should have access to this but 
also aboriginal people outside reserves and non-aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that can come into this program that I think 
would be a fallacy is to associate impoverishment with money for 
the people involved.  What these programs have found is it is not 
money that makes the child, but a loving, caring, secure 
environment with caring, loving parents provides children with 
the best hope they can have in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible, caring parents are the most important gift that a 
child can ever have. I and others can probably pay testimony to 
the parents who have given them so much and for which they can 
never repay them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government takes the initiative, looks at this motion 
and implements it. I also put down in the motion that it be 
implemented before the year 2000, the reason being fear of the 
House proroguing sometime before that and this motion merely 
getting tossed under a carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national crime prevention council that the justice committee 
sensibly asked to be organized has come forth and been an 
advocate for many of the sentiments expressed within the national 
head start program.  It has done tremendous work, and yet its 
good work lies on a table in its building, not for lack of desire 
or talent or hard work on its part, but because of inertia that 
pervades this place all the time. It is something that all of us 
as members labour under and try to find ways to overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that this is a motion that transcends party lines. It is 
a motion which I think members from across party lines will be in 
acceptance of, at least in principle. I hope members from across 
party lines will adopt it and provide the government with 
constructive suggestions to implement it, not for us but for all 
the children out there who come home to environments that are 
rife with abuse, neglect, malnourishment and hopelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These children deserve hope if only for the humanitarian reason, 
but also for the cold, hard, pragmatic reason that what we do not 
deal with today we pay for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the increasing epidemic of crime. Just in my riding of 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, the death of Reena Virk was a profound 
tragedy.  A young 14-year old girl was beaten up by a group of 
teenagers. This is not an isolated incident. Tragically, it 
occurs in other parts of the country, perhaps not to the same 
extent but it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not winning with our current proposal of detection, 
deterrence and incarceration. That needs to happen for certain 
people and we need to do that too. But we need to also focus our 
minds, focus our efforts into trying to prevent these tragedies 
from occurring, and it has to start from time zero.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that half the people in jail suffer from fetal 
alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects.  FAS is the leading 
cause of neurological damage in this country.  People with FAS 
have an average IQ of 68.  They have irreversible neurological 
damage that prevents them from engaging in appropriate 
interpersonal relationships with other individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unfortunate number of those individuals go on to commit 
crimes.  This does not excuse them from their crimes but it 
provides a clue that this is a preventable problem.  It is a 
tragedy when any of these children come to see you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak personally of my work in emergency departments.  A 
child comes to you to be taken away from an abusive situation. 
You have a scared, emaciated child sitting in a corner.  You take 
that child an do the appropriate exam before the child goes to a 
foster home.  I have been fortunate enough to see a child like 
that again four months later.  Now the child is a bubbly, chubby, 
smiling, gregarious, playful little one.  I have to do an 
examination, as so many other physicians do, before that child 
goes back into the same abusive environment as before.  That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone to judges, lawyers and social workers and what have 
they said?  It is the system.  I cannot reconcile, nor I am sure 
can others in this House, putting that child back in the same 
abusive environment as before.  One year old children have no 
business going back in that type environment where we know they 
have no chance.  We can only imagine the horrors those children 
endure for the rest of their young lives.  Who knows where they 
will end up?  They will end up in a place none of us would want 
to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we can take children away forever but for 
heaven's sake let us be the advocate of the child first and 
foremost and the parents second.  Let us ensure those children 
are put in environments with loving, caring secure parental 
involvement.  That is the best asset any child can ever have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first hour of debate on this motion.  There are two 
hours left.  In advance I thank my colleagues for spending the 
time to do the investigation.  I hope we can work together to 
make this motion a reality for the children of our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I begin by congratulating the 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for his commitment to the 
welfare of children in general, in particular Canada's children. 
If his work on the land mines issue is any indication of his 
commitment, he is to be congratulated and appreciated for his 
sensitivity and his caring on such matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with his point quite aside from the intention of his 
private member's bill that there are some things we cannot 
legislate.  We cannot legislate love.  We cannot legislate proper 
nurturing.  We cannot legislate a healthy environment but we can 
aid in that process.  We can provide the tools for families, 
individuals and communities.  We can provide that environment and 
work toward that healthy relationship of nurturing between 
parents and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child development is a complicated issue.  The hon. member's 
suggestion that increased resources be channelled into early 
child development is a laudable one.  It reflects a growing 
consensus that the well-being of Canada's children is a shared 
responsibility of all citizens and all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member will recall, the Government of Canada 
recognized the importance of early child development in the 
Speech from the Throne.  Early childhood experiences influence 
overall health, intellectual development and well-being of 
individuals for the rest of their lives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing early in children's healthy development, we are 
investing in their long term health and in the long term health 
of society.  Federal, provincial and territorial governments have 
identified healthy child development as a priority and have been 
working closely for some time on collaborative initiatives aimed 
at helping children living in conditions of risk to get a better 
start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives include the community action program for 
children.  This is a very successful program.  This program is so 
successful that the views are to expand on that program and to 
continue that program.  It speaks to many of the concerns and 
many of the initiatives that should be undertaken as stated by 
the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal head start program was referred to in one of our 
documents for the election. It was a commitment that we made and 
it is a commitment that we saw through.  The aboriginal head 
start we have found so successful that we have expanded on it. 
We have doubled the funding.  I would like to see a further 
expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is an area that the Canadian model does not 
address and that is the fortification of the linguistic and 
cultural base that individual children have.  This adds much to 
the self-esteem of the individual once they have that basis. They 
are able to develop properly in and out of their own environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada prenatal nutrition program is another one that talks 
about early head start.  We believe we have a head start when it 
comes to this initiative. When we have 21,000 low birth weight 
babies born and it costs approximately $60,000 per infant to deal 
with the effects of low birth weight or premature births, which 
are sometimes the case from not having the proper prenatal 
nutrition care, we feel this is a very worthwhile investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that we can avoid the exorbitant cost if we do 
continue on with this program.  It is extremely successful, not 
only with the children but also with the parenting.  It also 
provides the appropriate foundation for young people, 
particularly single parents, single mothers in this instance, to 
go forward and to build a proper nurturing and caring before the 
child is born as well as to continue on once they have given 
birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these programs have proven highly successful in meeting the 
needs of the target population, not to mention the Inuit and 
first nation child care program which we know that we did not 
have a jurisdictional issue on.  The federal government has very 
clear jurisdiction.  We went forward and instituted $72 million. 
On the other child care issues we did not enjoy the same kind of 
agreement among our partners out there, so we could not proceed, 
this being one of the reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as a society are to ensure that all Canadian children have 
the best opportunity to develop to their full potential, our 
investment must be much broader and much more comprehensive than 
early child development alone.  I can assure my fellow 
parliamentarians that the Government of Canada fully supports the 
idea of a national strategy focused on early child development, 
but not in a narrow sense.  Every program, every service offered 
to children should have that litmus test that speaks to early 
intervention, that speaks to child development per se from the 
age of zero onwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A substantial body of evidence exists which shows that the 
quality of early childhood experiences is at the root of many 
adult health and social problems and I think my hon. colleague 
spoke quite well to that.  The links between poverty and chronic 
illness, teen pregnancies, youth suicides, drug abuse, family 
violence and long term unemployment are well documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this, the national children's agenda will be taking 
discussions beyond the government level.  All Canadians will be 
invited to help shape this agenda.  As part of the agenda, we 
believe the overriding issue is addressing child poverty, 
something we are working toward with the new national child 
benefit system.  This is one approach.  This is one effort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit will give Canadian children a better 
start in life by improving economic benefits and social services 
available to low income families with children.  It will reduce 
the barriers many low income families face in moving from social 
assistance to the workforce.  Over time it will reduce poverty, 
support families, make work pay and enable governments to work 
together to improve children's chances of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of this mandate we will double our initial 
investment of $850 million in the national child benefit system. 
We are also collaborating with the provinces and the territories 
on the national reinvestment framework to redirect savings from 
welfare spending into new and improved services and benefits for 
low income families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit system is a cornerstone of the 
national children's agenda.  Together, governments are working to 
develop the agenda as one that will continue to evolve and build 
on programs to support children.  It will include many partners 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my hon. colleagues that these are not the only 
activities we are engaged in to promote and improve children's 
well-being.  The Government of Canada has announced three new 
initiatives as part of the national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are establishing—and I am sure my hon. colleague with 
his background will appreciate this very much—centres of 
excellence on children's well-being to broaden our understanding 
of how children develop and what we can do better to support them 
in the early years of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the cornerstone pieces of research that the centres of 
excellence can undertake is the effects of FAE and FAS children 
have had to endure, the long-lasting effects of fetal alcohol 
effect and fetal alcohol syndrome.  I hope we realize that FAS 
and FAE are the most preventable disabilities that our country 
can do something about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are expanding on the successful aboriginal head start 
program to help children on reserves to get a good start.  We are 
doubling the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we will build on the HRDC and Statistic Canada leading 
edge survey, the national longitudinal survey on children and 
youth, as the foundation for reporting on the readiness of 
Canadian children to learn.  We have a profound interest in how 
our children develop intellectually, not just in one particular 
way.  In a very multifaceted way we want to know that our 
children develop psychologically, mentally, physically, 
spiritually and intellectually in a manner that is appropriate 
for their age group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collectively these new initiatives, along with existing federal 
programs such as the community action plan for children, first 
nations child care and child care vision, are equipping us with 
powerful new tools that will help us to create a made in Canada 
strategy for the country's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member.  I hope he realizes that perhaps 
we do not call it a national head start program but the 
collective of these is early intervention and head start. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am really 
pleased to rise in support of the motion.  It is critical and 
comes at a critical time in our development.  As our society 
changes there is more and more stress on families.  We do not 
have the ability to stay home and look after our children.  The 
environment I grew up in was a mother at home with eight family 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that the motion is not about money.  It is about 
time and about how we allocate time to the nurturing and 
development of our whole society because each individual adds or 
detracts from our collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot expect to have healthy communities and a strong 
country if what is coming up behind us is a lot of individuals 
who have lived in poverty, who are uneducated and who have been 
neglected by their parents.  They do not fit in because they do 
not speak the same language as us or communicate in the same way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have any positive effect on the future of our 
country, I would agree with my colleague who introduced the 
motion that we have to do it at an early stage.  We have to be 
diligent, aware, conscientious and particularly caring if we are 
to have a constructive and co-operative intervention at an early 
age and be serious about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the example of what is happening in a town in B.C. There 
is outrage.  The intent on all parts is to work together to do 
something positive to protect those who are vulnerable, our 
children.  We have to focus on our children and put the rights of 
parents second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very sensitive issue both culturally and individually. I 
have worked with people who have had their children taken away 
from them.  Extreme trauma is suffered by both the children and 
the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a will ,there is truly a way for us to overcome 
these obstacles.  We should not say that it is a provincial 
responsibility or the mother's responsibility and has nothing to 
do with us.  We need to work together because it has everything 
to do with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reena Virk was killed we all felt horror and outrage. Where 
did we fail?  The motion is an attempt to look at where we 
failed.  What on earth went wrong to create that level of 
violence among Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If as a collective group, as citizens of the country, we want 
individuals who are physically strong, who are emotionally strong 
and who have psychological health so that their energy is 
directed toward being teachers, carpenters, architects, lawyers 
or doctors, we have to go to the beginning.  A large part of that 
is to recognize the role of motherhood and the role of fatherhood 
within society.  From there we should link it to every policy we 
make so that we strengthen families, so that each family in turn 
produces children who are strong, who are a benefit to our 
country and who are people we can be extremely proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that we cannot teach love and caring, but we 
can.  We can teach by example what love is and we can teach how 
to care.  Through every gesture which shows care and protection 
we show love.  It is up to us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone does not know how to do that, there have been 
examples given of how one mother will work with another mother, 
which is a very natural process, or one father will work with 
another father.  Just think of all the men and women who act as 
coaches.  They teach sportsmanship and how to work together in 
difficult situations.  For children sporting events are difficult 
situations.  If we teach them principles and values at that stage 
they will follow through to how we treat each other in the House. 
We can teach how to love and how to care.  We cannot legislate 
those things, but we can certainly make sure that people know how 
to do them.  We can set the example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to address these issues we have to recognize what 
they are linked to.  A lot of it is poverty.  We have to address 
what our government can and should do about poverty.  We have to 
address what we can do to make sure people are educated and fed. 
We have to intervene when there is abuse, whether it is physical, 
emotional or verbal.  Again that relates to teaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to address alcoholism we need a drug strategy.  We 
need to be serious about it.  We need to address it at all 
levels, from its beginnings to the violence and the criminality 
which result from alcoholism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot change the fact that there are many people afflicted 
with fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect but we can 
prevent it.  We can be very serious about preventing it and 
making access to alcohol a lot more difficult than it is, rather 
than it being a ritual or some sort of right of passage of 
drinking and carrying on at a certain age.  That does not have to 
be part of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remove stress from families.  Our role as government 
is to see how we connect, how our policies link to each other, 
instead of dividing everything into separate parts and saying you 
are responsible for this, that department is responsible for that 
or the provinces can do this.  We should be open minded enough to 
look at where we can really make a difference in the lives of 
families so they have the time they need to look after their 
children who are a part of our community and society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I would like to say it is not just about money.  It 
is about time, the time we need to bring up our children.  We 
must recognize that and make sure it is possible for people to 
bring up their children and not have to do it alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to be left alone with many young children. 
We should recognize the hardship of that and that it is 
unnatural.  We need to help each other in bringing up our 
children.  It benefits us all, or it will be to the detriment of 
us all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, let me say from 
the outset that the Bloc Quebecois is against Motion M-261, the purpose 
of which is to develop more national standards and guidelines in areas 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this motion, the Reform party calls on the Liberal 
government to ensure greater government visibility across Canada by 
developing an integrated program for children under the age of eight, 
which would involve both hospitals and schools. We need not analyze the 
motion before us very long to realize what the Reform Party is really 
trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting Motion M-261 forward in this House, the Reformers are 
acting as accomplices of a government desperate for visibility and more 
concerned with promoting Canadian unity that with resolving the problems 
experienced on a daily basis by Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec 
National Assembly are sensitive to the rise in youth crime. All 
Quebeckers agree that we must deal with the root causes of crime. What 
institution is in a better position than the family to address the 
problems experienced by children under the age of eight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is so keenly aware of the importance of these 
1.6 million children and of the key role of families in the future of 
our children that, in 1997, it tabled a white paper outlining its new 
family policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy statement creates links between the Quebec government's 
economic and social priorities and comes out in favour of our families 
and our children. The Quebec minister of education and family stated 
that “In Quebec, as elsewhere around the world, family is at the heart 
of society. That is where children learn the values that will shape them 
and help them spread their wings. On the eve of a new millennium, we 
must preserve the best we have come up with to support children and 
their parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things, but it is of prime importance for 
me to highlight the principle underlying this statement of policy: 
the recognition of parents' primary responsibility for the needs of 
their children and of the support role of government.  This 
principle finds expression in three objectives: to ensure fairness 
through universal support for families and additional help to 
families with low incomes; to facilitate the reconciliation of 
parental and professional responsibilities; and to promote the 
development of children and equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just fancy words, this is the way Quebec wants 
to increase the consistency of its action to promote greater 
equality in family matters.  This is the way Quebec identifies the 
role of the family in child development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite the fact that these measures proposed by the 
National Assembly received broad approval from the people of 
Quebec, it has become very difficult to implement them, because of 
the obsessive policies of our federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government wants to dictate national standards at all 
cost out of a concern for visibility and in order to justify its 
presence.  This is the third time since the start of the week that 
I have risen in this House to criticize the devastating effect of 
the federal government's centralizing policies, and I hope we are 
being heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centralizing measures of the Liberal government have, 
since 1993, been devastating for Quebec.  Why?  Because the Liberal 
government, with the support of the Reform Party today, is doing 
its best to prevent the Government of Quebec from developing 
measures that are so vital for young people in Quebec and for the 
support of their parents. 
Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures limiting Quebeckers' choices are the cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, the refusal to reimburse Quebec the $2 
billion for harmonizing the GST, the Liberal government's refusal 
to review its tax system and the measures that are impoverishing 
the less fortunate put in place by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few minutes here to talk of the harmful effect 
of one of these measures: the savage cuts by the Liberal government 
to the employment insurance plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is trying to sell 
us on the idea that this is a generous reform for the workers, but 
what planet does he come from, this minister of human 
impoverishment?  Giving it the name of employment insurance does 
not make the reform equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals need to come down from their ivory towers and go 
ask the seasonal workers, those who have to live through the “black 
hole of spring”, or the students who pay into employment insurance 
but cannot collect it, if they think the reform is a generous one. 
At the same time, they could ask them if they agree with the 
Liberal government's using the surplus it has saved in this way to 
eradicate the deficit and sneak still further into provincial areas 
of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This disdain of workers has its limits.  If the employment 
insurance fund records a surplus, let it be given back to the 
people who have contributed that surplus, by creating jobs, by 
improving this cobbled-together employment insurance program, by 
lowering the contributions made by workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is viciously 
attacking the unemployed, while the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs is trying to stifle seven million Quebeckers by asking nine 
judges to put words in our mouths that are not ours. 
While the Prime Minister is getting ready to trample over 
provincial jurisdictions as never before, the Minister of Finance 
is forcing us to take a magnifying glass to a bill which would 
allow Canada Steamship Lines, which he fully owns, to be completely 
sheltered from any Revenue Canada attack on its profits from its 
holdings in tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at everything the Liberal government is doing to 
increase poverty, I wonder why the Reform Party is so bent on 
encouraging it to disregard provincial jurisdiction.  How can the 
Reform Party encourage the Liberal government in new overlapping 
and interference in exclusively provincial jurisdictions instead of 
urging it to return, in the form of tax points, the money the 
Minister of Finance grabbed, with his cuts in provincial transfer 
payments for hospitals, schools and income security? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is convinced that the provinces are better 
placed to implement measures that will effectively address the 
problems of youth.  Despite this attitude, we are in no way 
imposing our point of view on other provinces.  We respect the 
provinces that prefer to let the federal government call the shots 
in these areas. 
Why would we not be entitled to expect the same from the provinces, 
the Liberal government and the Reform Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this motion because it will give the government the 
power to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the hon. members today on Motion M-241, in my 
capacity as the Progressive Conservative spokesperson for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the motion in large part addresses child and youth 
crime, I believe that the problem goes beyond the mandate of the 
justice system.  I am delighted with my colleague's initiative, 
since it is high time that the matter of prevention is addressed, 
and an attempt is made to find the causes and solutions for some of 
the violent behaviour among children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among experts in social development that 
certain physical and psychological needs are fundamental, and must 
be met if a child is to develop into a well-balanced, responsible 
adult concerned about his environment. 
The experts agree that children who spend their first few years of 
life in a secure environment, with decent housing and diet, coupled 
with positive experiences free from any aggression or neglect, are 
more likely to lead prosperous and productive lives as adults. 
They will also be less likely to commit serious crimes.  Is there 
not, therefore, a close connection between children's behaviour and 
their economic situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a long term study by the National Crime 
Prevention Council, those who commit crimes and re-offend the most 
frequently come from the poorest families and the poorest housing. 
According to a study carried out in Michigan, there must be early 
intervention, with a focus on the whole range of disadvantages 
which have heavy consequences for the children of low income 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be well on the way to preventing juvenile crime if we 
were able to focus on child poverty.  We in the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada firmly believe that the best defence 
against poverty and crime is a strong economy.  Parents with good 
jobs can provide their children with living conditions that are 
conducive to normal psychological development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly not wish to suggest that all children living 
in poverty have, or will have, criminal behaviour, but I think the 
relationship is too close to ignore.  I think we must do everything 
possible to prevent crime. 
As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By keeping young people in school, by intervening earlier in 
the lives of people having trouble, by making young people more 
aware of the consequences of criminal behaviour, we increase our 
chances in the fight against crime.  In addition, by developing 
head start programs, social stakeholders in hospitals and schools 
will be able to identify families who are at risk and in need of 
assistance and provide them with the resources they need to 
redirect negative behaviour.  Both children and their parents must 
be educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many parents will themselves have come from disadvantaged 
backgrounds that will have seriously hindered their psychological 
development.  It is difficult to turn around problems of this 
nature later in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a teenager who has seen his alcoholic father 
mistreat the family all his life will also have a tendency to adopt 
the same behaviour. 
If the cycle is very hard to break in adolescence, imagine what it 
must be like in adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one more reason to begin the programs at a very early 
age, before the development of behaviour that will lead some young 
people to turn to delinquency and crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole series of social development programs that 
have proven effective, including programs of intervention in early 
childhood and programs providing recreation for young people.  On 
the whole, the children taking part seemed better adjusted socially 
and to have overcome a number of risks relating to their poverty 
and their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show clearly that early prevention efforts are 
successful and benefit the participants, their families and the 
community as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can therefore assure my colleague that our party will 
support his motion, because, when it comes to the welfare and the 
future of our children, we are always there to lend a hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it was my intention to speak at this moment in the House 
notwithstanding that I have sat here slightly aggravated in 
listening to the presentation by the Bloc Quebecois speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a comment I must make before I give up the balance of 
my time to the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands.  He cancelled a 
flight in order to be here, disappointing his constituency, and 
to reflect his respect for the subject matter.  I will be pleased 
to give him his time, but in one moment please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has presented a very 
important motion, the concept of which I fully support.  The 
mechanism is a matter for discussion just so long as the ends are 
found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' narrowness of spirit and narrowness of view 
is totally reflected in a lack of understanding in this North 
American continent and in fact within the western nations that 
share many of these problems, the issues of what to do for youth, 
for children, particularly prebirth, prenatal and immediately 
following birth, love, nurturing, affection, emotion and how to 
be a parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these are issues we are all looking at.  It is hard to know 
the reason why we have the number of young people acting out as the 
member pointed out in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to highlight that if we were to put these walls 
around Quebec so that we should not be, God forbid, working 
together federal, provincial and municipal and volunteer 
associations and researchers, we would be losing or perhaps 
duplicating and wasting money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer them to a study on crime prevention by Dr. Tremblay in 
Montreal.  He was the director for youth protection in the 
province of Quebec.  My colleagues who were the directors of 
youth protection and I have looked at all kinds of programs 
worldwide, in particular in Canada, including Quebec. We would 
have looked at Dr. Tremblay's longitudinal study on the root of 
criminal behaviour. It can often be traced back to childhood 
experiences, the reasons for aggressive behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers have begun to investigate the protective factors 
that allow a child to be resilient and to succeed despite bleak 
negative environments.  Their research has revealed that 
resilient children generally have certain characteristics.  This 
can all be found in the initiatives of the Canadian government 
combined with the provincial governments.  It was done under 
safer communities, a parliamentary crime prevention guide.  The 
status of women's group was very much involved with this as were 
parental groups and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the Bloc take heed of what this member has 
brought to this House.  It should look at ways of implementing 
it.  Never mind the name, never mind the party. Just look at the 
possibility of addressing a very serious problem that we do not 
want recycled generation after generation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the member from the other side.  This is a very 
serious issue. Since their are seven or eight minutes left, I ask 
for the unanimous consent of this House that I be given the 
opportunity to finish my speech which will carry us two or three 
minutes over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the members present 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege to participate in this debate on Motion No. 
261 which was introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I note the concern expressed in the 
comments of members from all parties with the exception of the 
Bloc. This is an issue of great interest to me as a father, as a 
lawyer and as a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is asking the government to develop a comprehensive 
national head start program for children in their first eight 
years.  He is talking about a co-ordinated effort between the 
federal and provincial governments and ministries.  There are 
programs out there and he would like them to work together.  That 
is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him that it is important to ensure our children 
have the best opportunity to develop to their full potential. 
While parents have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing 
and development of our children, we as legislators must ensure 
parents have the support they need.  We must develop partnerships 
with our provincial and municipal counterparts to support 
initiatives aimed at reducing youth crimes. This is all about 
co-ordination and working together for the good of all our 
children in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must go beyond crime management.  We must shift to crime 
prevention.  I will discuss some examples I am familiar with 
through my practice in criminal law as a lawyer in youth court. 
Verbal, physical and sexual abuses are all obvious threats to 
normal psychological development. They have a devastating effect 
on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the consequences of child neglect firsthand in the courts. 
They were easy to identify.  They say it costs about $95,000 a 
year to keep a youth in a detention centre.  That is arguable.  I 
know we could debate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stories of some of my personal experiences in the courtroom will 
emphasize the importance of prevention.  A child of 12 or 13 
could be before a judge for the first time.  If a good, 
understanding judge had the tools and programs available, 
although quite often they were not, and there was family support, 
there were success stories.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could follow up on these youths and the schools that played 
an integral role in the management of these youths who were not 
back before the courts. Yet we could see the chronic youth, those 
at the age of 14 with criminal records two and three pages long 
who were going through a revolving door.  Yes, we have to hold 
these children accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is talking about is that we have to get to these 
children at an early age.  There will be some who will slip 
through and end up in our justice system.  However, from what I 
have seen in the courts, I honestly believe that we could stop a 
large part of this if we started at day zero.  That is the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reena Virk case is an example.  I probably saw some of these 
youths in the courtroom when I was practising law.  It is the 
very courtroom I practised in.  A 14 year old girl was savagely 
beaten by a gang of eight or nine children. Other children 
watched and did nothing.  They beat her again and then broke her 
arms and her back and threw her in a river to die.  It brings 
tears to our eyes.  The worst part is that this is not an 
isolated event. In my own community of Sydney in the last few 
years we had another youth killed again by a group of youths. 
These are within 20 miles of each other.  These are not isolated 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that these 
things are not going on.  We as parliamentarians have a 
responsibility to co-ordinate.  My comment on the remarks by the 
member who spoke earlier is that I support all the programs and 
things that are being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the member is asking for a big wheelbarrow full 
of money.  He is asking that we co-ordinate this together with 
the ministers from the provinces and the federal government and 
the people who are involved. We should get together to try to 
really and truly help these children to ensure they are getting 
the love, the nurturing and assistance they need in order that 
they do not end up in our justice system, like a revolving door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These examples prove to us that the earlier years in life are so 
crucial.  If we address them we will drastically reduce the 
social and economic costs to our society. This is a very small 
investment with a huge return.  It is like an RRSP, the benefits 
are just enormous at the back end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many programs already exist in centres in Canada and the U.S. 
There is the program in Hawaii pioneering early intervention 
programs for children focusing on high risk families. They go 
right back to when the woman is still pregnant. If assistance is 
needed at that time it is provided. There is also a program in 
Michigan which my colleague has spoken about. The evaluations of 
these programs have shown a decrease in juvenile and adult crime 
by 50%.  These programs are working and that is the most 
important part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really encouraged to participate in a debate where all the 
parties, with the exception of the Bloc, seem to have children in 
their hearts.  The long term savings to the taxpayers will be 
absolutely enormous.  It works out to roughly $6 in dividends for 
every $1 invested.  This is going on the statistics from these 
other programs.  That in itself is something we cannot ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party stands for tougher laws.  In no way is this 
motion suggesting that we cannot hold people accountable for 
their actions.  The ones who slip through, yes, we have to hold 
them accountable and ensure they are dealt with toughly. 
However, what this is all about is stopping half of them before 
they get to that door.  It is a travesty to see them coming 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I practised in the criminal courts myself and of my own 
choosing.  In our occupations we always want to feel we are 
making a difference and are quite proud of our work. Some would 
argue how anyone could be proud of their work while practising as 
a criminal lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However if we get the youth early and get them into the 
programs, we can make a difference, even for offences such as 
shoplifting which are deemed by the courts as very minor 
offences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we would get the family in there.  We would send them 
off to counselling, probation, all kinds of programs.  We could 
tell that that person was not coming back, that they were not 
going to be back and they were not. This is just enforcing that 
we should take that one step before and give these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my friend's comments about the baby in the 
hospital and having to do an examination before sending the baby 
back into that terrible environment.  It almost brings tears to 
one's eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When sentencing these children in the courts they go through the 
child's history before giving the sentence. Every single time 
they describe the circumstances, the sexual abuse, the 
prostitution in the families, the physical abuse between the 
parents, just horrible conditions. Almost every time with those 
who are involved in serious crimes that is what is described 
without exception. That is what they went through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I commend my friend and colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca for his dedication to these very sensitive issues, something 
he believes in dearly in his heart and wants to make a 
difference.  I thank again the hon. member for Mount Royal for 
her gracious offer to allow me to speak today.

<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on October 28 I asked the finance minister a question 
prefacing it by saying to him that he is rumoured to be a 
successful businessman in Canada or elsewhere, we are not sure 
now.  But this businessman, I said to him, is now telling our 
kids that he will be taking 10% of their lifetime earnings and he 
will manage their money so that they will get back a 1.8% return 
on all that money, that lifetime investment.  I asked the 
minister that as a businessman would he put his money into a 
venture with that kind of a return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer was very instructive.  He said first of 
all that the return that is projected is a 3.8% return, not 1.8%. 
This was very disingenuous of the finance minister who knew very 
well that his own actuarial report says that our children will 
indeed get only a 1.8% return on their lifetime investment.  The 
3.8% return he was referring to, to kind of muddy the waters, is 
the return that he says will be earned by his new CPP investment 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just saw in the pages of the newspaper today some grave 
warnings by financial analysts saying that as this fund's 
investment is presently structured it is doubtful that it will 
get even such a low rate of return as 3.8%, which I might point 
out is not even as much as the new RRSP bonds that Canadians can 
buy from the Canadian government.  But to get back to the point, 
our children for a lifetime of having to put 10% of their 
earnings into this CPP fund will get a return of 1.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the great advantage of the Canada pension plan 
is that the Government of Canada stands behind it regardless of 
market fluctuations.  I might point out that the government in 
fact intends to invest our money in the market, but of course we 
are not smart enough to do that ourselves.  Only the government 
can do that.  But then he said the Government of Canada stands 
behind that.  Is that not reassuring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess who the Government of Canada gets its money from.  From 
us.  So if the Government of Canada screws up and miscalculates 
and does not do its investment properly, guess who it can look to 
to make it up.  Us. So we get to pay more in premiums, in taxes 
or in lost benefits. That is not very reassuring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he said, using some scare tactics to keep people from 
looking at alternatives, that Canadians should not have to be 
subjected to having their retirement at the whim of market 
volatility, as if the stock market were the only kind of 
investment Canadians could make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just have a follow up question which I would be very pleased 
to have the government answer.  I hope people who are watching 
these debates at home will answer the same question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your child or grandchild comes to you and says “I want your 
advice on some investments.  You have lived a few years and have 
managed your money well.  Now I need your advice.  I have heard 
about a good new investment. I will contribute 10% of my salary 
and the fund manager will guarantee 1.8% return on my investment, 
a real rate of return over the years.  Should I buy in?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry but the 
hon. member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let us understand that whether 
you are 16 or 60 the Canada pension plan will be there for you 
when you retire.  Those who say otherwise are mistaken and those 
who wish otherwise are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately this is about values.  You either believe in the CPP 
or you do not. The government does.  The Reform Party does not. 
The Reform Party can talk about its plans to destroy the CPP. The 
government will talk about what we have done to preserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary—Nose Hill has said in recent radio shows 
that we need to look at perhaps getting some of this unfunded 
liability out of the general tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying off the outstanding obligations year by year as they come 
due would require a $20 billion to $75 billion payment each year 
over the next 60 to 70 years.  Paying off the outstanding 
obligations over 30 years would require almost a doubling of GST 
or a 25% increase in personal income tax.  Which taxes do the 
Reform Party want to increase to pay these outstanding 
obligations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told the government that they want the burden to 
be spread evenly across generations.  If no changes were made, 
our children and grandchildren would be asked to pay 14.2%.  Some 
claim, as the Reform Party does often, that young people are 
getting a raw deal from the CPP changes.  Young Canadians will 
get 50 cents for every dollar they invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of statement is incorrect.  The fact is that all CPP 
contributors, present and future, will receive more from the CPP 
than they pay in.  Young people will receive $1.80 for every 
dollar of contributions.  The return could be higher if we as 
Canadians were prepared to renege on existing contributions for 
today's seniors and for those who have been paying into the CPP 
for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the provinces as joint stewards of 
the CPP will honour all commitments made to Canadians in the 
fairest way possible.  The government will not renege on our 
obligations to Canadians as the Reform Party will do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I compliment the Reform member for Saanich—Gulf Islands 
who, just prior to the rant we witnessed by the member opposite, 
made what I thought was a very thoughtful and important speech 
about young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about his concern about young people, about children. 
He talked about having a two year old and a four year old at home 
and how he was concerned about their future.  That is the exact 
reason why I asked the question some time ago of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.  I talked about what the government 
did in its first mandate and what it is continuing to do in this 
mandate as it relates to youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have children.  They are not really children any more. 
They are 23, 25 and 27 years of age and in various stages of 
education and working.  I see all three boys and a lot of their 
friends who come to our place.  These young people today, who are 
the immediate resources that will be leading us in the near 
future, are very concerned about their future.  They want to know 
about opportunities for advancement.  They want to know about 
training opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Mississauga West we are experiencing an 
unemployment rate that is a bit below the national average.  It 
is about 12% for young people.  That is way too high, even though 
it is lower than the national average.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question has to do with my concern that I hope the minister 
will work with local community groups and boards of education 
that have put forward alternative proposals and with the private 
sector to implement programs that will create opportunities for 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the minister approved a program known as Ice Youth. Ice 
Youth is a tripartite agreement between the private sector, a 
company in the business of building arenas; the board of 
education in Peel; and the government.  These young people will 
be trained and given class <I>b</I> refrigeration licences.  It 
will teach them about all the sophisticated equipment and 
everything necessary for working around an arena.  In Canada that 
is a huge business and a terrific career opportunity, but it is a 
very small program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will look at other programs like that one 
where we can involve our young people in working co-operatively 
with the private sector, the local municipality and the school 
boards to create new opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen training programs in past governments designed to 
train people but no jobs tied to them at the end.  Programs like 
the Ice Youth program and others I hope we will see approved 
following the budget of the Minister of Finance next week will be 
tied directly to jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector will take advantage of funds from the 
government to create economic growth by saying to a particular 
young person “We are going to train you in this field.  We are 
going to give you a trade.  We are going to give you skills.  We 
are going to give you knowledge that will then be tied to a 
job”.  What is the point of training someone and then having 
them sit at home with nothing to do?

of $120 million will create over 60,000 summer jobs and help 
350,000 students across the country in their search for summer 
employment.  These are but a few of the initiatives we have 
undertaken to help young Canadians find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much remains to be done.  A 15.8% youth unemployment rate is 
still much too high.  That is why the Prime Minister and his 
provincial colleagues confirmed during last December's first 
ministers meeting that helping our youth find employment was a 
national priority.  They reiterated the need to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
continue to work with his provincial and territorial colleagues 
to put in motion an action plan on youth employment.  The plan 
will recognize that governments, the private sector and 
communities have roles to play to help young Canadians get and 
keep a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, stay tuned on Tuesday when the budget is released 
and you will see even more priorities of the government.
