</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak briefly today on 
the bill which proposes a few amendments to the Canada Elections 
Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament will know, from time to time we need to 
revisit our laws to make sure they keep up with the changing 
needs of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes this entails introducing totally new legislation as 
happened with Bill C-2, the Canada Elections Act, in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the impetus for change usually comes from the public 
or this House, it can also be the result of rulings by the 
courts.  An example is the Figueroa case heard recently by the 
Ontario Court of Appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of 
the provisions in the Canada Elections Act relating to the 
registration of political parties. 
He argued that requiring a party to nominate 50 candidates 
before it could be declared a registered party, and thus 
before having tis name appear on the ballot, violated section 3 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms since smaller 
parties could not achieve this threshold and were therefore 
denied some of the financial benefits accorded to registered 
parties. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its ruling, the court ruled that it was in fact reasonable to 
require parties to have 50 candidates before they qualify for 
financial benefits.  I repeat that the court said it was okay. 
The reason it did so and I quote the court.  It said that the 
requirement “is a reasonable method of distinguishing between 
parties whose involvement reaches the appropriate level of 
participation and parties whose involvement does not”.  That was 
a quote from paragraph 88 of the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision of the Canada Elections Act pertaining to the 
eligibility for financial benefit remains unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plaintiff also challenged those provisions requiring parties 
to have 50 nominated candidates before their names could appear 
on the ballot.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument was that having a candidate's political affiliation 
on the ballot was desirable since it provided voters with 
important information they needed before making an informed 
choice. In other words, if there were two John Does on the ballot 
and one of them was John Doe from such and such party, as opposed 
to John Doe, independent, voters would have the right to know 
that it was John Doe from such and such party. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the court ruled that this use of the 50 
candidate threshold was not valid and represented an 
unjustifiable limitation on the right of voters to make an 
informed choice since it denied them important information 
about candidates, as I have just shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, it violates section 3 of the charter.  Consequently 
the court referred the offending portions of the act back to 
parliament and gave it a specific time frame to take remedial 
action. 
This is why it is important to respond to its ruling. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us responds to this part of the ruling by 
proposing to lower the threshold for including party affiliation 
on the ballot, in other words the informative part, to just 12 
candidates, which is less than a quarter of what it would have 
required before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke in committee to why the number 12 was used. It was used 
because it is a threshold with which we are familiar. It is one 
that exists elsewhere for political parties, namely 12 is the 
minimum number of members of parliament to be recognized by the 
Speaker as a party for the purposes of the House.  That would 
suppose that a party with 12 candidates would elect all of them 
all of the time. Although that is unlikely it is at least 
possible, and that is the number we used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have used a slightly higher threshold, namely 15, 
because it was the one recommended by the Lortie commission.  The 
Lortie commission, appointed by the previous Conservative 
government, had made such a recommendation in the past.  In any 
case, certainly if 15 works 12 is a number that is even less 
onerous and therefore would work not only as well but some would 
argue even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues were studied by the parliamentary committee.  I 
thank the committee for the excellent issues that were raised.  I 
did not always agree with everything that was raised by some hon. 
colleagues in committee, but largely they were very constructive, 
as they usually are.  I hope my responses to them in committee 
were as equally informative as their questions were interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these hearings the question of how many candidates should 
be required was discussed at length.  There were members who 
called for a far greater number than 12, while others wanted to 
lower the number.  As a matter of fact, there is a private 
member's bill before the House by a member of the Canadian 
Alliance arguing for a stronger threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a threshold some place.  The court spoke to this 
eloquently.  It said the designation on the ballot had to be what 
it called a party in the real sense of the word.  That was the 
expression used by the court.  One person is not a party.  I, 
running under my own party, would not have the status of a party. 
A party that would bear only the individual's name would not 
satisfy that criterion.  Again the court referred to that in its 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced approach was required.  To use a threshold that had 
foundation in law, the number 12 certainly has that and the 
number 15 as well.  Both were reasonable and we used one of them. 
It is the balanced approached.  Mr. Speaker, you will be very 
familiar with the government's usually balanced approach to most 
things, if not everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters could be, as I said, misled if a ballot indicated a 
candidate was affiliated with a political party that was in fact 
not a political party. 
That would not serve to make the system more transparent but 
could arguably make it less so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, one colleague was very concerned about the 
fact that people could put their names on a ballot for the 
purpose of giving publicity to a commercial enterprise.  In other 
words they could simply satisfy the criteria for the ballot and 
advertise.  One hon. member gave the example of her real estate 
office or something like that.  That is not what the ballot is 
designed to do.  It is difficult to reconcile all these things, 
but we tried to use the number that would make it all work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the rationale for choosing 12 is already found 
in our parliamentary system.  Once passed, this measure would 
allow political parties with at least 12 candidates to have their 
names appear alongside those of their candidates.  In other words 
the ballot would say that John Doe is running under the XYZ 
party, if that happened to be the name of the particular group of 
people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the other provisions, I will mention them briefly before 
concluding.  These tend to be technical amendments designed to 
correct a few anomalies that have become apparent since the new 
Canada Elections Act came into force and terminological changes 
aimed at making the English and French versions more consistent. 
As such, they should make our existing electoral laws even 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank parliamentarians from all parties who took 
part in this exercise, and I mean this sincerely. 
I also wish to thank those who worked hard on drafting Bill C-9: 
the people at Elections Canada, the Department of Justice, Privy 
Council, my own team, and of course all those working on the 
bill right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by repeating the promise I made to the 
parliamentary committee. What we have before us today is not an 
overhaul of the Canada Elections Act.  It is simply a response 
to the court and the correction of certain technical details, 
certain anomalies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we remain committed to again overhaul the Canada 
Elections Act, as must be done, particularly on the heels of an 
election and following the report and recommendations of 
Canada's chief electoral officer, which will probably be 
released shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later there will have to be consultations with the 
political parties, not just in the House but within the parties 
themselves because sometimes political parties 
have important things to say and they are not just said by 
parliamentarians.  There will have to be this kind of 
consultation with them and with the general public 
in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what is before us today.  We are looking 
only at the corrections I have just mentioned, but the firm 
undertaking to improve the Canada Elections Act in general 
remains and I wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate this 
in the House, as I did in committee a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note I will close because I know that parliamentarians 
will soon want to move on to Bill C-24. In order to speed 
things up a bit, I will conclude my remarks here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues in advance for the contribution they will 
make to this debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start today by making a few general observations, by 
dealing with some philosophical points, by creating a larger 
framework, and then perhaps by delving a little into the details 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliamentary system in Canada is derived partially from 
that of the United Kingdom and partially from that of the United 
States.  This surprises some people who think it is entirely 
derived from the United Kingdom, but we have a written 
constitution like the Americans, a Senate with set membership 
like the Americans, and a charter of rights similar to the 
American bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can learn about the motivating spirit of our democracy by 
dipping into the writings of the great constitutionalists of both 
of the world's streams of democratic thought.  From the British, 
for example, we can read Bagehot, Dicey, Acton and Sir Henry 
Maine.  We can go back in history and read Blackstone.  When it 
comes to the Americans we can look and learn from the writings of 
Madison, Jefferson, John Taylor of Caroline and of Alexis de 
Tocqueville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to a particular well known 
statement made by Thomas Jefferson.  He made the observation once 
that the natural course of things is for liberty to give ground 
over time to tyranny.  He then tried, through his great student 
Madison who was present at the constitutional convention in 
Philadelphia in 1789, to build institutions which would prevent 
that natural course of events from taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that Canada's constitution was designed with 
exactly this purpose in mind, but unlike the Americans we had a 
wealth of experience upon which to draw.  We had the British 
example and we drew upon that extensively and wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fathers of Confederation also drew extensively upon the 
American example, so much so that A. V. Dicey, the great British 
constitutionalist, made the observation that although the 
preamble to the Canadian constitution, the British North America 
Act, talks of a constitution similar in spirit to that of the 
United Kingdom, the word kingdom could have been withdrawn and 
the word states put in its place and it would be equally true, 
according to Dicey.  We could learn from both these examples and 
from what has been said by the great scholars of both these 
traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the protections in the American system for individual 
liberty and freedom that we built into our own system are 
federalism, being the most obvious and powerful example, and a 
Senate with a fixed membership and regional representation.  Of 
course the British house of lords does not have a fixed 
membership and it does not have any form of regional 
representation built into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dates for elections could not be postponed beyond five 
years.  That was written into our constitution without very 
substantial consent within parliament itself, whereas in Britain 
parliament has always had the unilateral right to change the 
period between elections without notice.  This was done in the 
18th century when the period between elections was changed from 
the traditional level of three years to seven years which 
remained throughout the 19th century.  It was then changed again 
to five years.  In Canada the five year level was set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all indications that we looked at the British model 
and saw much that was wise there, looked at the American model 
and saw much that was wise there, and together tried to integrate 
them to build truly profound protections for liberty to ensure 
that Canada would be the freest country in the world.  To a large 
degree the Fathers of Confederation were successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also gained, in our initial constitutional arrangement, 
certain benefits for liberty that were taken from the British 
model.  I would like to cite some of those.  Initially judicial 
review of our laws was placed in a non-resident institution, the 
house of lords and typically the judicial committee of the privy 
council.  That was done to ensure that we could not have any kind 
of political control ultimately over rights.  There was an 
institution that would protect us from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were subjected originally to the colonial laws validity act 
which was designed to ensure that no law repugnant to the laws of 
Britain could be passed in Canada, or indeed in any of the other 
countries that in those days were characterized as British 
colonies, which would take away rights from individuals. 
That law was subsequently removed in 1931 by the statute of 
Westminster.  Again, it is an indication of the number of 
protections that we thought were important for liberties and 
democracy in the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important protection in the eyes of our founders for 
liberty in the country was that we were a monarchy.  We had a 
monarch chosen by the lottery of birth who, as Bagehot said, 
would bear the dignified portions of the government, whereas the 
efficient portions of governance would be carried out by the 
House of Commons and our Senate.  This was seen as a way of 
ensuring a tremendous respect for liberty and a protection that 
would go beyond that which was available either in Britain or in 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a bit of time to make the point that our tradition is one 
which is very respectful of democracy, of liberty and of the full 
right of participation for all Canadians regardless of their 
political views in the process on a level playing field.  It 
seems to me that in recent years we have seen an erosion of some 
of these rights.  That concerns me a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen, for example, a persistent effort on the part of 
the current government to ensure that third party advertising is 
restricted as much as possible.  This has been pursued with a 
tremendous amount of tenacity by the government in order to 
ensure that private parties are unable to participate in the 
electoral process and that competition is largely shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a refusal to implement legislation that would permit 
citizen initiation or review of legislation on the Swiss model. 
We saw the erosion of rights of members of parliament.  We saw 
the extreme use in this place of votes of confidence.  Everything 
is a confidence motion.  That has had the effect of enforcing 
rigid party discipline and taking away the ability of members to 
speak their own minds freely in a way that would reflect the will 
of their constituents and of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw an absolute refusal of the government to make 
non-partisan appointments to the Senate or to recognize Senate 
elections.  There was a very reluctant willingness on the part of 
the prior prime minister, Mr. Mulroney, to allow one elected 
senator from Alberta, the hon. Stan Waters, to take his seat as 
the voters had decided.  Similar respect for the voters of 
Alberta has not been shown in its choice of Professor Ted Morton 
and of Bert Brown, who were fairly elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we looked to the United States, which at one point had an 
appointed senate, we saw that the process of developing elected 
senates started when the state of Oregon elected its senators and 
the senate itself allowed them to sit.  This led to a rapid 
spread of senate elections and eventually an amendment to its 
constitution.  These are all valuable changes that would make the 
country more democratic.  Preventing them from occurring keeps 
the country less democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the prevention of an expansion of democracy, we 
see an actual clamp being put on free democratic expression and 
the ability of parties to compete on an equal playing field. This 
is what we see when we turn to the present piece of legislation 
and the ancestral pieces of legislation passed over the prior 
eight years by this government and the prior government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a systematic attempt to cut off the privileges of 
minor parties.  If we go back to 1993, legislation was passed at 
that time which was clearly designed to make it impossible for 
two new parties, which at that point did not have substantial 
representation in this place, the Reform Party as it then was and 
the Bloc Quebecois to compete on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation said, among other things, that if there were 
less than 50 candidates on the ballot the name of the party could 
not be placed on the ballot.  The party could not issue tax 
receipts.  The party could not have assets.  Its assets would be 
forfeited immediately to the Receiver General for Canada and 
money could be spent only on activities that related to that 
forfeiture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This did not of course have the intended impact which was to 
ensure that the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois could not 
contest an election on a level playing field or indeed on any 
terms at all because both parties were able to produce more than 
50 members in that election.  Even though the two parties for 
which this was intended managed to overcome the hurdle, the law 
remained in place and was clearly a pernicious law.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider an example.  There are 75 seats in Quebec.  The 
Bloc Quebecois naturally had more candidates than the minimum 
amount permitted under this legislation.  However let us say 
there was a smaller region that wanted to put forward candidates 
to represent its interests, for example, a maritime rights 
movement.  I remind the House that in the 1920s there was a 
maritimes rights movement which was very active and represented 
some very legitimate interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say for the sake of argument that advocates of the 
maritime rights movement wanted to put forward candidates.  There 
are not 50 seats in the maritime provinces, therefore they would 
deprived of the right to issue tax receipts, put their name on 
the ballot, to have assets and function in any way as a party. 
Yet that would be a legitimate interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be other regions of the country where the same thing 
could occur.  I will return to this a little later, but it is 
interesting to note that right now the 50 candidate rule still 
remains law for certain provisions of the original law and has 
not been struck down by the courts.  It is still impossible to 
issue tax receipts.  This law does not deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer does a party has to forfeit its assets if it has less 
than 50 candidates.  That is not because of anything this 
government has done.  The original court ruling that dealt with 
the Figueroa case struck down that provision of the law and the 
government realized it was constitutionally indefensible chose 
not to appeal it.  However it attempted to appeal the ruling that 
the name could go on the ballot with less than 50 candidates but 
it was struck down again.  This time the court said a lower 
number had to be put into the law within six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government waited until three days before the six month 
period and let an election go by which ensured parties could not 
function during that election under the new rules mandated by the 
court.  It then puts forward an absolute minimum rule, which is 
applied in the minimal manner possible with the court's ruling, 
and allows 12 candidates as the standard for getting a name on 
the ballot.  However it has done nothing else which the court has 
not forced it to do.  That is clearly highly objectionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke very eloquently in favour of the merits of 
using 12 as our number.  An equally eloquent argument can be made 
in favour of two.  However there seems to have been a consensus 
among small parties before the court case that 12 would be okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is such a good rule for putting names on the ballot, 
then why on earth is it not also acceptable to issue tax 
receipts, or having access to advertising that is set aside by 
the Canada Elections Act, and for all the other privileges?  The 
only reason I can think of is that there is still an attempt to 
freeze out small parties.  We have the parties which exist now 
but perhaps there are future problems that could arise for the 
government.  I think the government wants to keep on ensuring 
that no one else can enter into this place.  It wants to make it 
is impossible for other parties to get in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that this is a pattern we see occurring 
elsewhere.  It is a regrettable pattern.  We are not unique in 
the world in having this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out some of the dangers that can occur if we go 
too far down the road of trying to restrict the free right of 
small parties to contest elections on the same terms as the major 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the United States for example.  The tangle of 
election laws in the United States has ensured that incumbents in 
the house of representatives enjoy a 98% re-election rate.  They 
are nominally the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.  On 
some issues they differ but in many respects there are critics 
who say it is really one party, the incumbent party.  When it 
comes to dealing with electoral law that is a fair statement to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole focus of American electoral law reform for the past 30 
years has been to ensure that independent candidates cannot make 
it in.  That is if a Republican is the incumbent in the seat it 
is hard for a Democrat to make it in and if a Democrat is the 
incumbent in the seat it is hard for a Republican to make it in. 
Therefore congress becomes a cozy little club in which there is a 
great deal of collegiality.  It is a club in which democracy is 
not operating as it should, as Madison and Jefferson would have 
wanted it to operate.  Both of men would have been absolutely 
appalled by this spectacle.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see how this works.  From the point of view of a ruling 
party, the ideal is to have a permanent division of seats in 
which the smaller parties are ensured some representation and 
some privileges.  However they never actually contest the ability 
of the dominant party to control at least half the house and 
therefore 100% of the legislation in the house.  This is 
absolutely contrary to the beliefs of our founders, the Fathers 
of Confederation.  This is a terrible shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not think it is intention of the government to take 
us down the same road as the Americans, the danger is there.  The 
government ought to reconsider very carefully what it is doing. 
We are well on our way down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canada wants to head in this direction.  I would 
never impugn that kind of motive to anybody.  The danger is a 
country could wind up with the kind of situation that existed in 
Poland in the mid part of this century, from the late 1940s to 
1989, with the de facto one party rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three parties represented in the Polish Sejm, that is 
the Polish Diet or legislature.  The three parties were the 
Polish United Workers Party or the Communist Party, then the 
United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party which were smaller 
parties that had a limited number of seats, no influence on 
legislation and served essentially to provide the illusion that 
there was a functioning multiparty democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the extreme.  I do not believe Canada is heading that 
far but that is the model we have to avoid.  The government 
should be proactively saying what it can do to ensure that 
smaller parties have the right to contest elections on exactly 
equal and fair terms with the larger parties like the Canadian 
Alliance, the Liberal Party and the other parties represented 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we heard the testimony that was given at committee by the 
leaders of the Christian Heritage Party, the Communist Party and 
the Green Party, we heard tremendously eloquent and thoughtful 
people.  They were presenting points of view that were not the 
same point of view that the minister nor I share.  However they 
were profoundly intelligent points of view that deserved to be 
heard by the Canadian people on exact and equal terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians decide that they should put their trust in one of 
those parties, the parties should have the right to receive that 
trust.  Those parties must have the right to present their case 
on exactly the same terms that those of us who are here today 
enjoy.  Anything less is undemocratic, unfair and unacceptable to 
the spirit in which our constitution was crafted and to the 
spirit that is the heart of every Canadian, which is that this is 
a truly free, truly democratic, truly pluralist country in which 
every point of view is valid unless it is intolerant or hate 
filled.  None of the people who represent those parties have that 
kind of sentiment or intolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to set an example that shows that we are, as our 
founders intended us to be, the freest and most generous country 
in the world.  Anything less is unacceptable and that makes this 
bill unacceptable.  I urge every member of the House to consider 
those facts and to vote against the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central, I 
am very pleased to participate in the third reading debate on 
Bill C-9, the Liberal government's proposed changes to the 
elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my remarks I want to commend the hon. member for 
Lanark—Carleton for his significant contribution to this debate. 
His comments are highly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has two main focuses.  First, Bill C-9 would amend the 
Canada Elections Act so that candidates, other than those of 
registered parties, may have the option of indicating their 
political affiliation on the ballot. Second, it provides for 
various technical amendments that would correct certain details 
of the new Canada Elections Act.  The bill is supposed to amend 
the Canada Elections Act that became law on September 1, 2000 in 
the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals passed the bill only a few months ago.  The bill we 
are debating today is the Liberal government's attempt to correct 
the mistakes they made in the previous bill in the 36th 
parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is continuing to try to force the 
government to do its work, as we asked it to do in the 36th 
parliament.  I spoke to that bill in the last parliament and I 
warned the government about the pitfalls which it did not 
prevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at second reading of the bill, I do not mind helping 
the Liberals to do their homework.  I will present some ideas 
which the government can listen to and adopt amendments to the 
bill so that it does not have to amend it again after a little 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer appeared before the procedure and 
House affairs standing committee that conducted hearings on the 
bill last month.  He said that these technical amendments did not 
raise any administrative concerns, apart from the fact that they 
were not exhaustive.  The chief electoral officer also said that 
he had discovered other provisions that would warrant revision 
since some of these technical amendments created undesirable 
effects.  The light is flashing, but I do not know if the 
Liberals are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Bill C-9 does not resolve the incongruity of the 
situation in which eligible and suspended parties are considered 
exactly like third parties.  There should be some difference 
between a small political party and one that has been suspended. 
These two types of party status are seen as the same. However 
they are different and our laws should reflect that.  At this 
late stage of the bill's progress, that is third and final 
reading, I ask the government what will it do about the fact that 
suspended parties are treated the same way as a small party.  It 
is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a concern that parties, which are not represented 
in the House regularly, raise questions about their participation 
in the electoral process.  The chief electoral officer is 
concerned about the frequency and wide range of complaints about 
how smaller parties are treated and the obstacles they face 
trying to compete with large, more established political parties 
like the governing Liberals.  Our electoral system should be 
fixed so that everyone is treated fairly and equally.  The weak 
Liberal government that lacks vision is not addressing these 
problems in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer will be tabling a report in the fall 
of 2001 wherein he will suggest ways to improve the current 
system.  We look forward to his report, but I am sure that 
members on the government side do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's provisions regarding the identification of political 
affiliation on ballots raises another question.  It creates a two 
tier political party system, with different kinds of benefits 
accruing to political parties, depending on whether they are 
large parties with 12 or more candidates or small parties.  The 
Liberals are only passing the bill because they want to limit 
their competition.  That is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate at second reading we heard many speakers 
indicating the problems they had experienced with Elections 
Canada during the last election and in the previous election. The 
government could make improvements to the way we conduct our 
elections.  The Liberals have refused to pass Canadian Alliance 
amendments proposed at committee stage.  Those amendments would 
have made the bill more acceptable to smaller parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, leaders of Canada's smaller political parties 
testified before the procedure and house affairs standing 
committee on the invitation of the Canadian Alliance critic for 
intergovernmental affairs.  Ron Gray, leader of the Christian 
Heritage Party; Chris Bradshaw, leader of the Green Party; and 
Miguel Figueroa, leader of the Communist Party testified to the 
discriminatory spirit of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill proposed by the Liberals, large parties with 12 
or more candidates or registered parties would have the right to 
receive final electors lists, issue tax receipts, reimbursement 
of partial election expenses, broadcasting time on national TV 
and preferential rates during prime time.  Smaller parties and 
independent candidates are barred access to those resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee stage of Bill C-9, the Canadian Alliance tried to 
have several amendments passed but the Liberal dominated 
committee refused them.  We tried to have the Liberals adopt the 
following amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief Electoral Officer shall deliver a printed copy and a 
copy in electronic form of the final lists of electors for each 
electoral district to each candidate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to change the word party to candidate.  This would 
make the act more democratic.  There is no reason to prevent any 
candidate from receiving that list.  It would be undemocratic if 
candidates were not treated fairly and equally and were not given 
the electors list so that they could do their campaigning. How 
could we prevent them from having access to the final electors 
list while candidates from established larger political parties 
have access to that list?  That is very unfair.  The Liberals 
refused to accept that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment submitted by the Canadian Alliance would 
strike the phrase, in the preceding election, from subclause 
12(2)(d).  In the case of a general election a party has 
candidates whose nominations have been confirmed in at least 12 
electoral districts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the clause reads now and would continue to read prevents 
a candidate in a byelection from having the party name with which 
he or she is affiliated appear on the ballot unless the party was 
qualified to have its name appear on the ballot in the previous 
general election.  This again is an unfair situation that new 
political parties would face in a byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should not be afraid of new political parties.  The 
government should be careful not to put any barriers in the way 
of new parties.  This would encourage democracy to flourish, but 
the Liberals do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 17 of Bill C-9 we tried to have subsection 335(1) of 
the act replaced with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the period beginning with the issue of the writs for a general 
election and ending at midnight on the day before polling day, 
every broadcaster shall, subject to the regulations made under 
the Broadcasting Act and the conditions of its licence, make 
available, for purchase by all political parties for the 
transmission of political announcements and other programming 
produced by or on behalf of the political parties, six and one 
half hours of broadcasting time during prime time on its 
facilities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the official opposition was pleading the case of 
smaller or newer political parties.  We wanted to remove the word 
registered from appearing before the word party so that any party 
could have access to broadcasting time, thus giving all parties 
an equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to make it possible for a party to become a registered 
party if it could obtain the names of 5,000 electors who were 
members of that party or who supported the right of the party to 
be a registered party. 
It would be fair and make our democracy more open and 
transparent.  However the Liberals refused it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians feel that under our electoral system every 
candidate in Canada must have equal access to the electoral list 
and the ability to issue tax receipts regardless of political 
affiliation, but the Liberals do not want that.  They are so 
arrogant and heavy-handed and into power and control that they 
want to crush even the smallest voices in our electoral system. 
The bill is all about incumbency protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is apparent that the Liberals would go to any length to 
protect their seats and even deny the democratic rights of other 
Canadians.  We must not forget that the bill is the government's 
response to the Ontario Court of Appeal ruling on Communist Party 
leader, Mr. Miguel Figueroa's challenge to the limitations 
imposed on smaller parties as a result of Bill C-2 that came into 
effect in November 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 was flawed.  The Liberals did not listen to the 
opposition, other Canadians and witnesses who appeared before the 
committee.  I spoke in the debate on that bill in the previous 
parliament and I warned the Liberals that their phony bill would 
be challenged in the courts.  I warned them that they would lose 
the case.  It was challenged and they did lose the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Communist Party has pledged to sue the government as soon as 
Bill C-9 is passed.  I warn them again.  I may have to speak 
again when the bill comes back before the House.  I remind them 
that it is the opinion of the four political party leaders who 
testified before the committee that the Liberal government is 
only grudgingly complying with the Ontario court's decision.  It 
is doing so in the narrowest possible sense.  Anyone supporting 
Bill C-9 is pulling up the drawbridge to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these measures had been in place 10 years ago, new parties 
like the Reform Party of Canada would have been barred access to 
the vital resources that facilitated its rise to the office of 
the official opposition and now the Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other technical matters Bill C-9 also stipulates that if 
the chief electoral officer wishes to examine alternative voting 
processes such as electronic voting, the alternative cannot be 
used without the approval of both the House and the Senate 
committees.  Under the current legislation only approval of the 
House of Commons committee is required to give the chief 
electoral officer the freedom to examine alternatives that are 
innovative and could help modernize our electoral process, which 
is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However on this side of the House our ears perk up when we hear 
the word Senate.  Are the Liberals preparing to have the Senate 
kill any innovative ideas the chief electoral officer wants to 
propose?  We know for sure that we cannot trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee hearings the Canadian Alliance proposed to amend 
this part of the bill but our amendment was again struck down. We 
know that the Senate is not elected.  How could it interfere with 
the election process when senators are not elected?  It is very 
unfair and undemocratic.  The Canadian Alliance policy declares: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the representative nature of our electoral system, we 
will consider electoral reforms, including proportional 
representation, the single transferable ballot, electronic 
voting, and fixed election dates, and will submit such options to 
voters in a nationwide referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 does not go far enough to democratize our electoral 
process.  We believe all parties should be treated equally and 
fairly, not merely those with 50 or more candidates or 12 or more 
candidates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that when the House was debating Bill C-2 in 
the last session the Liberals ignored the Reform Party's 
recommendation to drop the 50 candidate rule.  As usual, the 
Liberals were forced into action not by the wishes of Canadians 
but by a court ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-2 was before the procedure and House affairs 
committee, constitutional lawyer Gerald Chipeur made it clear to 
the Liberals that the 50 candidate rule would be struck down. The 
Canadian Alliance always rejected the Liberal's claim that the 50 
candidate rule was designed to protect voters from frivolous 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that voters and not the 
government, this arrogant, weak Liberal government that lacks 
vision, should decide whether a party or candidate is worthy of 
their vote.  If Canadians feel a candidate or political party is 
worthy of their vote then they should vote for them.  It should 
not be up to the government to tell Canadians which candidate or 
party is worthy of their vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is very unhappy that Bill C-9 creates two 
classes of political parties.  There should be an equal and fair 
opportunity for each party and candidate in the electoral 
process.  However the bill denies that.  It creates two classes 
of parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes the Canada Elections Act should 
be neutral and treat everyone equally and fairly.  Bill C-9 is 
not neutral because of the reasons I have mentioned.  It creates 
two classes of political parties and does not give equal 
opportunity to all candidates.  We are therefore left with no 
option but to oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government still has time to give Bill C-9 a second thought. 
I know it is late, but the government should have given it a 
second thought and accepted the amendments, listened to the 
witnesses in committee and given every candidate and party an 
equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not only undemocratic; it is anti-democratic.  We 
have an elected dictatorship in Canada and that will not change 
if the bill is not changed.  Let us see how Canadians feel.  We 
on this side of the House oppose the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased in turn to speak to Bill C-9 at this final stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate right away that our political formation 
will support this legislation, but without any great enthusiasm. 
I would even say that we do it out of pique, in a way, because 
we recognize that parliament must abide by the court decision in 
the Figueroa case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that there are in the current Canada 
Elections Act, resulting from the reform adopted in the last 
parliament, a number of mistakes, all in all minor, that could 
nevertheless have had some rather dramatic effects in certain 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems of agreement between the two texts, of poor 
translation from English to 
French since this bill was obviously first drafted in English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also a number of mistakes in the numbering of some 
subsections and paragraphs. Again, this may seem trivial at 
first sight, but on closer look this could have had in the last 
election effects that although not dramatic could certainly 
be described as prejudicial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically we should correct these difficulties, these small 
problems, these technical mistakes as I call them, in the 
Canada Elections Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some technical mistakes were introduced in the elections 
act, I think we have to recognize that it is simply because we 
have proceeded hastily—unwillingly, I may add—with the elections 
act reform in the last session of the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proceeded with too much haste and this haste was dictated to 
us by the government, whose motives were—we saw it later, but we 
had suspicions at the time—essentially political and partisan. 
The government wanted to campaign under the new act, and since 
the government party was planning an early election we had to 
pass the new elections act as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to proceed hastily, which prevented us from doing the 
work as conscientiously as we wanted to or as we should have, 
and the main result was that we were unable to make substantive 
changes to the elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were certainly very interesting changes, which had the 
effect of improving the act or the Canadian electoral system. 
However the fact still remains that we should have certainly 
examined changes that were much more substantive, but with the 
limited time available we obviously were unable to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell the House that as representatives of the people of 
Quebec and Canada in this House we should be deeply 
troubled and concerned by the rate of participation in 
elections, which is constantly declining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were able to see, particularly during the last federal 
election, that the rate of participation was dramatically low. 
We were able to see, particularly during the last federal 
election, that the rate of participation was dramatically low 
in spite of all the efforts made by the chief electoral officer 
to inform Canadians and Quebecers of the procedure to be 
registered on the voters' list and to exercise their right to 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This drop in the rate of participation also occurred in spite of 
the many changes made to the act to make it easier to vote. In 
fact, it is possible to vote under almost all circumstances in 
Canada and abroad. Some would even say that the Canada Elections 
Act is written in such a way that makes it easy, and a few 
journalists demonstrated this in the last election, to vote 
fraudulently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We facilitate as much as possible the exercise of people's 
right to vote. In spite of that the participation rate is 
getting lower at each election. As I said, as parliamentarians 
I think this worrisome trend in our democracy must be cause for 
great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are losing interest in politics and in 
the election process, we must draw certain conclusions and make 
certain changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must carry out a reform of parliament that takes the 
expectations of the people we represent into account. They must 
be absolutely convinced that what we are doing here is being 
done on their behalf, that we are representing them, that we are 
protecting their interests and that we have a real say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is cause for concern with regard to for 
what I would call the democratic drift that threatens the 
process of globalization we are going through and the 
negotiation of the FTAA in which parliamentarians are 
definitely not involved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need to change our parliamentary system, and that 
includes an indepth reform of the Canadian electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examined Bill C-2, which was supposed to 
be one of the most major reviews of the Canada Elections Act, 
we could have made substantial changes. We agreed with those changes but for 
political and partisan reasons we did not make them. That resulted, as we 
know, in the participation rate during the last federal election 
being one of the lowest since 1867. We missed a unique 
opportunity to carry out an indepth reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that since the beginning of this new 
parliament the government has been dragging its feet somewhat 
on parliamentary and electoral reform. With this bill we could 
have started afresh, but no, the government has chosen to make 
cosmetic changes, to correct some technical mistakes to which I 
alluded and to abide by the court's decision in the Figueroa 
case. I will come back to these two issues a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk briefly about what we could have done. I 
hope the government House leader is listening to what I am saying. 
I hope we will have the opportunity very soon, after the chief 
electoral officer tables his report or his recommendations 
following the last federal election, to review, amend and reform 
much more thoroughly the Canadian electoral system so that our 
fellow citizens will feel that this system is relevant to the 
decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might examine the voting procedure and the representation 
system. We had a debate in the House some time ago and we 
discussed the possibility of striking an all party committee to 
look into all these issues. The government has unfortunately 
shown very little interest in the idea of even discussing a more 
thorough reform of the electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to hear the government House leader say that we 
would have the opportunity to examine more thoroughly the issue 
of the electoral system once the chief electoral officer has 
stated his position on the subject. I must say that he missed an 
excellent opportunity of showing tangible interest in this when 
we debated a motion brought forward by the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might examine the representation system. Would it be relevant 
or not to integrate into Canadian legislation an element of 
proportional representation in our electoral system? Should we 
adopt a purely proportional electoral system? Of course there 
are pros and cons. We have already had an opportunity to discuss 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the advantages, there is the fact that it would 
eventually allow for a better representation of women and young 
people in parliament. 
As far as the electoral process is concerned, minority groups 
would be better represented, and election results would better 
reflect the various points of view and ideologies in society, 
including some of the more minority ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a proportional representation component the system will 
avoid the distortions sometimes created by the first past the 
post system which makes it possible for a government to gather 
almost 100% of the power with only 40% of the votes.  A 
proportional representation system would allow for better 
co-operation with the opposition and would encourage government 
to take into account the opinions of the opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are some disadvantages to such a system. We 
will have to take them into consideration when we consider the 
system so that the necessary corrective mechanisms can be put 
in place.  Instability can result from pure proportional 
representation and sometimes from a system with a proportional 
representation component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the risk that a proportional representation 
component could also create two classes of members: those who 
have ridings and constituents to whom they are accountable and 
to whom they must provide services and those who are appointed 
from the party lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom are the members accountable?  To the people who elect 
them or to the party who puts them on the ballot?  Those are 
questions that still need to be asked if we at some later 
point come to question the appropriateness of integrating 
proportionality into the Canadian electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have examined the system of appointing returning 
officers, a system that gives Canada the image of a democracy 
that is somewhat behind the times, somewhat aging, somewhat 
archaic. I, an opposition MP, am not the only one who says so. 
Canada's chief electoral officer said the following when he 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs on October 28: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—when I go out on the international scene I do not recommend that 
the Canadian system be emulated where it comes to the 
appointment of returning officers 
I clearly indicate, as I do in Canada, that the appointment of 
returning officers under the present system is an anachronism. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lortie commission, in volume I of its report at page 
483, stated as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of public confidence in any democratic system of 
representative government is an electoral process that is 
administered efficiently and an electoral law that is enforced 
impartially.  Securing public trust requires that the election 
officials be independent of the government of the day and not 
subject to partisan influence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be acknowledged that in the present system returning 
officers are appointed by the governor in council, that is to 
say the government.  They are not appointed as the result of a 
call for nominations. 
They are not appointed as the result of an independent 
examination where they will be selected on their intrinsic 
abilities, their own qualifications.  They are appointed as the 
government sees fit.  They are appointed according to their 
political stripe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion this is basically undemocratic and archaic in a 
democracy that claims to be modern.  Returning officers need to 
be appointed by the chief electoral officer.  They need to be 
dismissable by that same officer. They need to be appointed 
after a public call for nominations and selected in an 
independent process of examination of their ability to carry out 
their duties.  They need to be answerable to the chief electoral 
officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that we will eventually have an opportunity to address 
such an amendment. 
It is high time we brought this change in the Canada Electoral 
Act. It will be noted that all opposition parties agree with 
this and that the only one against it is the government, 
because incidentally it has the privilege of appointing 
returning officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will also have the opportunity to examine the whole 
issue of political party financing, which is a basic issue in a 
democracy. In a democracy it is one person, one vote; not one 
dollar but one vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we consider the facts. 
This government has been elected on a platform of honesty and 
integrity and of condemnation of the previous Progressive 
Conservative government for its spending and mistakes, but 
experience has shown that, with the present government there is 
sometimes a very strong link between contributors to the Liberal 
Party of Canada and people who are awarded contracts by the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange and surprising. This patronage system where 
contracts are awarded to contributors to political parties is a 
remnant of the past.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That system should be influenced only by those who are entitled 
to vote on polling day. If the influence must also express 
itself with a monetary contribution, those who are entitled to 
vote on polling day should be the only ones to be able to 
exercise that influence in between elections and during election 
campaigns by giving money to political parties. Only the voters 
should have the right to finance Canadian political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have in Quebec: financing of the political 
parties by the public. 
Quebec's party financing system is held up around the world as 
one of the most modern systems, since we can be absolutely sure 
of its probity because only voters can contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side might tell me “Yes, but it is well 
known that this legislation encourages people to circumvent the 
law, since businesses may well contribute to a party through an 
individual”. The Quebec election act clearly prohibits this. 
Penalties are therefore imposed for contravening not only the 
letter but also the spirit of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec election act also provides for a cap on election 
contributions. 
In Canada the people watching us and the people in the gallery 
will be perhaps surprised to know that there is absolutely no 
ceiling.  A company can give any amount to a political party. 
There is no limit to contributions in Canada.  There are limits 
to election expenses but not to contributions.  In Quebec 
contributions are limited to $3,000 per voter.  There are 
therefore two components to public funding: the contribution 
ceiling and a clear definition of who can contribute, that is 
voters only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least we might have expected that the federal 
government would agree to set a limit, a ceiling, for 
contributions if it did not want to set very strict limits on 
the source of the contributions, 
but even that is too much to ask it.  Why would the 
government deny itself generous contributions when it can 
count on them year after year?  The major banks give the party 
in power tens of thousands of dollars.  It would certainly not 
deprive itself of this manna falling in its lap which it 
generously repays, as the facts indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have the opportunity perhaps to consider, or we 
might have had the opportunity if we had made the effort to 
really do so last time, incentives to increase the proportion of 
women involved in the electoral process and consequently 
taking part in public affairs and the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>France has just passed legislation requiring half the assembly 
to comprise women, which will mean that half the assembly 
will comprise women.  Some of the Scandinavian countries have 
established legislation setting a minimum for the proportion of 
women in their legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be this sort of legislative incentive or financial 
incentives to encourage political parties to promote the entry 
of women into politics, which might encourage them to increase 
the number of women candidates in the running at elections. 
I want to point out in this regard that it was the government 
House leader himself who, during the review of Bill C-2 
introduced in the last parliament, urged members of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to propose 
such an amendment to the Canada Elections Act. At the time the 
hon. member for Longueuil presented an amendment, but it was 
subsequently rejected by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the consistency when the government House leader asks 
members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to propose measures to increase the number of women 
involved in the political process, only to then have the 
government defeat an amendment to this effect? There is a lack 
of consistency and there is a problem in terms of real political 
will to make substantial amendments to the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also raised a number of lesser issues such as the tax 
credits for contributions to political parties. 
The policy currently followed by the government is fundamentally 
discriminatory because the tax credit program is unfair to low 
income taxpayers making contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a low income taxpayer makes a contribution to a political 
party, chances are that the tax receipt which he gets will make 
absolutely no difference. If his income is not taxable, his tax 
receipt is absolutely worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the value of a contribution by a low income taxpayer who 
takes the trouble to donate part of his savings to a political 
party and to make a financial contribution to the exercise of 
democracy?  The state generously rewards those who make handsome 
contributions and have sufficient income to claim a tax credit 
but does not encourage in any way low income earners who wish to 
take part in the electoral process by making contributions to 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised this inequity but the government refused to remedy 
it.  The elections act contains another inequity.  It was 
acknowledged by everyone in committee, even the Liberal members, 
yet they refused to make any changes to the elections act 
relating to the participation of self-employed workers in an 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am a self-employed carpenter with my own company the 
elections act does not allow me to work for one candidate or 
another, for example to make lawn signs, because that would be 
considered a contribution or a campaign expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something abnormal about treating the self-employed 
differently from any other citizens when they want to take part 
in the electoral process.  If a carpenter working for a company 
does the work, this is allowed provided he does so as a 
volunteer. Yet if a self-employed carpenter wants to do the same 
in order to be part of the electoral process on behalf of 
one or another candidate, he is not allowed to do so because 
this would be considered a contribution or a campaign expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there are flaws in the Canada Elections Act. 
Certain features must be completely overhauled.  The government 
has shown no interest in moving ahead with this until now.  I 
hope that it will demonstrate a much more open attitude in the 
future, considering the fact that the public's interest in 
politics is now declining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take note of this and have the courage to make the 
decisions required under the circumstances so that the 
electoral system the political system and the parliamentary 
system better respond to the expectations of the people we wish 
and claim to represent in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now get back to the central features of the bill under 
consideration.  First, Figueroa forces the government to 
reduce the number of candidates that a party must nominate in 
order to have its name appear on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this has no impact on the 50 candidates that a party 
must have nominated in a general election to qualify for tax 
benefits, financial benefits, from the government.  Now, 
however, only 12 candidates will be required in order for the 
party's name to appear on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a rationale behind this.  The rules used 
were those that apply in the House, which require that in order 
to have party standing a party must have at least 12 members. 
Similarly a minimum of 12 candidates is required for a 
political party to have its name appear on the ballot. 
Fine. This is a formula whose value we can certainly recognize 
and accept.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, it must also be recognized, as pointed out by 
Canadian Alliance members, that for all intents and purposes we 
are creating a new category of recognized political party. Of 
course this is not what the wording of the bill says, but this 
is what it means. Political parties that can have their names on 
ballots and those that run a number of additional candidates may 
be entitled to the benefits enjoyed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be understood that this new provision, which seeks 
to comply with the court ruling in the Figueroa case, has one 
major flaw regarding byelections. A political party can be 
created between two general elections and be recognized by the 
public as such, but under the rule just proposed by the 
government that political party will not be allowed to put its 
name on the ballot. This is under the ruling of the court 
itself a violation of the rights of citizens to be informed of 
the party being represented by the candidate running for office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a prime example of this in the case of a member now 
sitting in the House. 
In 1990, when the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie became the 
first Bloc Quebecois member to get himself elected, no one in 
Quebec would have challenged the fact that the Bloc Quebecois 
was a political force, a political party in the making but a 
political party nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules that prevailed at the time did not allow 
the current leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie, to put the name of his political party on 
the ballots. However, under the government's proposed rules, he 
would still have been in the same position because his party would 
not previously have had 12 candidates running in a general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed an amendment to the government House leader that 
could have corrected this discrepancy.  It must be understood 
that this discrepancy leaves the government open to new legal 
challenges, which will again be very costly for taxpayers and 
which it again risks losing.  According to the words of the 
judge in Figueroa, the voter's right to be fully informed of a 
candidate's political affiliation must be maintained.  This 
applies in a byelection as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I proposed point blank to the government House leader was 
that a party be officially recognized as a political party as 
soon as it agrees to present 50 candidates at the next general 
election. 
Naturally the reply was “Yes, but what if it does not present 
50?”  The elections act must provide a way for the government to 
recover the money it would have given this party.  Provision 
must be made for this, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this would at least mean that this party's candidate 
could put the name of his or her party on the ballot in the 
meantime.  The advantage of this proposal was that different 
categories of parties would not be created and the discrepancy 
that will remain in the elections act after Bill C-9 is passed would 
have been removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another provision that is somewhat disturbing to 
us. Before dealing with it I would simply like to say 
concerning the proposal we made that members of parliament will have 
understood well what I said, that is that the government House 
leader rejected this proposal out of hand, saying “You know, 
this goes beyond the scope of this bill” and so on. The 
result was the same: the government refused to consider a 
substantive proposal from the opposition. This is probably 
because simply it had not come up with the idea itself, as seems 
to be its way of running things since 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to say there is another provision in clause 2 that 
seems unacceptable to me. It is the one aimed at ensuring that 
when the chief electoral officer wants to test new voting 
systems, and in this case we are thinking more particularly about 
electronic voting, he will not be able to proceed without the 
prior approval of the procedure and House affairs committee 
which has to examine all matters related to the Canada Elections 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, after a Liberal senator woke up and said 
“They forgot to include the Senate”, said “Yes, this is true. 
Oops, the Senate has not been included. We should also ask 
the approval of the Senate committee responsible for electoral 
issues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an unelected institution demands to be given a voice we 
realize how outdated the Canadian political system is. Maybe we 
would have agreed, and we moved an amendment to that effect but 
it was defeated by the government, that the Senate could express 
its views. There is something of a paradox here when the 
approval of an unelected house is required for a proposal of the 
chief electoral officer on the exercise of the right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government's argument has been that as long as 
the Canadian constitution has not been amended in order to 
reform or abolish the Senate both houses have to be included in 
any legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a legislative process but a consultation process. 
The chief electoral officer needs the approval of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. This is not a 
legislative process in any sense. We are talking about 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might have agreed to let the Senate express its views, 
but that is a far cry from giving it the right to approve a 
proposal by the chief electoral officer who is responsible for 
the implementation of the elections act and who is very 
knowledgeable about our electoral system and the exercise of the 
right to vote. He would have to present his proposal for 
approval by senators who are not elected but appointed by the 
government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's desire to include the Senate committee in this 
provision of the bill is certainly questionable because this is 
not about a legislative process. We are talking about 
consultation on whether the chief electoral officer should go 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9, which we are considering, also raises a number of 
questions relating to the possibility for an independent 
candidate to have access to the revised electoral list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions were raised and some are still unanswered. There are 
still many reservations about the bill. I think the 
government, if it has clear answers, did not give them to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Maybe there 
was once again too much haste because several members came 
out of the committee process with unanswered questions and 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to several of us, every candidate in an election, no 
matter whether he or she is associated with a political party or 
independent, must be on a level playing field and have the same 
tools as any other candidate. In this regard there are 
obviously unanswered questions in Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear the government House leader saying “No, no”. As I 
said before, if the government had clear answers on the question, 
it neglected—I will put this politely—to give them to 
members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, 
because some members still had some concerns after the minister 
appeared before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously for the government, we disagree, because 
we have missed the point.  For the government the failure to 
understand always lies with the other party.  It is always the 
opposition which has failed to understand.  This is perhaps an 
indication of one of the problems we have in the Canadian 
parliamentary system, one which makes us think about the changes 
that should be made.  That is another matter entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, since we indicated our willingness to vote in 
favour of the proposed legislation from the start, we might at 
least have expected the government to demonstrate a certain 
degree of openness to our proposals, given that we showed 
openness by indicating from the start that we were going to 
vote in favour of this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-2 the government was 
completely unreceptive to any substantial amendment that might 
come from opposition members, particularly Bloc Quebecois 
members since, as I said, we indicated that we were going to 
support the legislation proposed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside the Liberal Party there is apparently no salvation.  If 
a party other than the Liberal Party makes a substantial 
proposal, and we have seen this in the past, not in connection 
with this bill, that proposal can only be a bad one. 
Regardless of how positive and worth while it might be, it 
absolutely must be rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as evidence of this government's narrow mindedness 
and arrogance once again. It attaches little importance 
to members of the opposition, although they were elected just 
as democratically as the members of the government, and any 
differing views expressed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, to give credit where credit is due, despite the 
reservations I have just been expressing, I must thank all those 
who made consideration of Bill C-9 possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to particularly thank and congratulate the 
committee members and the MPs from our party and others who 
have expressed their views in the House on Bill C-9. 
I also want to thank those who appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and the committee 
staff who provided us with a great deal of support in our 
consideration of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank all those who were involved in the drafting 
of this legislation, the Privy Council staff, Michael Pierce, 
Ms. Mondou and their team; the people at Department of justice; and of 
course those at Elections Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I thank the staffs of our party and other parties who 
made a contribution.  I would be remiss in not 
noting the contributions of my own staff, particularly Patric 
Frigon, for so much support in my consideration of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on that note, with the comment that I hope the 
government will learn something from the speed with which we put 
electoral reform through in the last parliament, which now 
obliges us to make changes, cosmetic ones in some cases because 
of that excessive haste.  I also hope we will be able if the 
opportunity arises, and I hope the House leader is open to this, to 
carry out an indepth reform of the Canada Elections Act to 
bring it in line with the expectations of our fellow citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
doubt very much if I will take the full 20 minutes, therefore 
leaving time for members of the government side or opposition 
benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be able to put forward our party's position 
on the third reading of Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to commend and congratulate my colleague, the 
House leader of the Conservative Party and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who has the carriage of this 
piece of legislation.  In my opinion he does yeoman's duty in 
making sure that positions are put forward.  In fact maybe even 
the government could take notice of the quality of the 
suggestions put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it could even accept some of those suggestions for the 
future because, as was mentioned earlier by the previous speaker, 
the government has a part to play in this piece of legislation. 
The part that it has to play is to look at the process used to 
put forward Bill C-2 prior to the last surprise election called 
in October 2000.  Bill C-2 came forward and there were many 
problems with that piece of legislation, as we have now 
identified.  There were many difficulties with that legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government listened to opposition members and looked at 
the very valid amendments that were put forward, it would not 
have had to rush through a very bad piece of legislation that now 
has to come back with another amendment, Bill C-9, to be able to 
fix the myriad of problems that it faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal specifically with Bill C-9 as it is before us. The 
bill reduces from 50 to 12 the number of candidates a party would 
have to field for purposes of having its candidates' party 
affiliation indicated on the ballot.  It also clarifies and 
harmonizes certain provisions in the act and proposes one 
amendment to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also say that we in the Progressive Conservative Party 
will be supporting the legislation for any number of reasons, one 
of which is that the Senate still has the opportunity of 
reviewing it and perhaps making some clean up changes that are 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, despite the work accomplished by parliamentarians in a 
very short period of time when Bill C-2 was under consideration, 
the government admits that certain translation and concordance 
errors between the English and French versions slipped through 
into the new elections act.  It was sloppy workmanship and I am 
sure the government will accept its full responsibility for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-9 was debated at second reading, the government 
House leader said that the application of the new legislation had 
revealed a number of irregularities that had to be rectified. 
That is in <I>Hansard</I> at page 1053.  Some of these could have 
caused problems because, as we see further on, they went beyond a 
simple act of concordance between the English and French 
versions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the government said that the government did not have 
to worry about that because it was not its job.  Well it is the 
government's job to make sure that legislation is in fact the 
right legislation for Canadians, particularly when it deals with 
the Canada Elections Act.  This is what is at the heart of our 
democracy and at the heart of what we as parliamentarians in the 
House should be dealing with, where the electorate, the public of 
the country, have the right to put the people who they want in 
the House for a particular time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is too important to simply say that it was not 
the government's fault.  It was the government's fault and we are 
trying to fix it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of the electoral system is important to Canadians. 
There is no doubt that errors could have been avoided if the 
Liberal government had given parliament more time to consider the 
provisions of the new Canada Elections Act with greater care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a few minutes outlining some of the 
specific amendments that are dealt with in Bill C-9.  As has been 
mentioned before, and I am sure I will repeat some of the 
comments that were made, I will touch briefly on some of the 
areas that are of particular concern to me and certainly to my 
colleague for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part that we heard about earlier was party affiliation 
on the ballot.  When Canadians go into a polling booth and look 
at the ballot they know that my name is associated with a 
particular political party, as are other names of people sitting 
in the House.  The amendments proposed in Bill C-9 are due in 
large part to the court ruling in the Figueroa case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the Ontario Court of Appeal ruling, clause 12 of 
Bill C-9 would amend subsections 117(2) of the act reducing from 
50 to 12 the number of candidates required for their party 
affiliation to be indicated on the ballot.  This new provision 
would apply only if the nomination of the 12 candidates had been 
confirmed for the general election or, as in the case of a 
byelection, in the immediately preceding general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Lortie commission report recommended 15 candidates as 
the minimum, the Liberals have chosen 12 because that is the 
number of members of parliament that a political party requires 
to be officially recognized in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this legislation deals with 12 as being the number 
for party affiliation is accepted by our party.  Certainly most 
of the parties in the House have been represented by 
substantially more candidates than have run in previous 
elections.  The fact is that we do have party affiliations.  I am 
very proud of my party affiliation with the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I believe, and my party accepts the fact, that the 
affiliation should be identified on a ballot so that when 
Canadians go to the polling booth they will know exactly who and 
what party they are voting for to sit in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently section 18(1) of the act currently provides that the 
CEO may carry out studies on voting, in particular with respect 
to alternative voting means, and devising and testing an 
electronic voting process for use in a future general election or 
byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of such a process must be approved in advance by a 
committee of the House of Commons that normally considers 
electoral matters.  This is an accepted part of the legislation 
but I do put a caveat on that.  We must be very careful when 
dealing with any type of alternate way of counting ballots.  As 
we have seen just recently in the United States election, there 
are a number of different processes used and some of them are not 
quite as competent as perhaps others.  We should be very careful 
when suggesting that an improvement to the system will make it 
better because in some cases it does not necessarily do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consideration of Bill C-2 by the Senate, a number of 
senators, both Progressive Conservative and Liberal, said that 
they were disturbed to see that the Senate was excluded from this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the commitment made by the government to members of 
the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
during the consideration of Bill C-2 in May 2000, Bill C-9 would 
amend section 18(1) to include in the approval process the Senate 
committee that considers electoral matters.  Normally such 
matters are referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal 
and Constitutional Affairs.  The input from our colleagues in the 
other place is an important aspect of this process and one which 
I am pleased to see included in Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard comments from my colleague from the Bloc who suggested 
that his party will put forward an amendment or subamendment to 
change this particular clause.  Our party agrees with what has 
been put forward in Bill C-9 which was not put forward in Bill 
C-2.  We can sit in the House and debate the legitimacy and the 
necessity of the other House but I am not prepared to do that 
right now.  What I would like to say is that there must be a 
backstop when a majority government puts forward legislation in 
this House.  There must be a second opinion of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A perfect example of that particular situation was when Bill C-2 
came forward.  It was pushed through with very little discussion, 
if any, and no changes were made to a very bad piece of 
legislation.  It has now come forward again because of that. This 
is a prime example of why the Senate must have an influence on 
this legislation.  Bill C-9 speaks to that and we are very 
pleased that the government has corrected this very glaring 
error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the bill deals with the registration of the 
electors themselves.  Subsection 44(1) of the Canada Elections 
Act requires the CEO to keep a register of electors, in other 
words, a permanent voting list containing the names of all 
Canadians qualified to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under subsection (2) of the act, the list shall contain each 
elector's family and given names, sex, date of birth and civic 
and mailing addresses, as well as any other information that the 
CEO may require under section 55 of the act.  Section 55 allows 
the CEO to communicate information in the register to a province 
when it decides to establish a list similar to the federal one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information compiled by the CEO under section 195 of the act, 
statement of ordinary residence by an elector belonging to the 
Canadian forces, may not be communicated to the provinces because 
the wrong provision is cited in subsection 44(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4 of Bill C-9 would amend subsection 44(2) to correct 
that error, an error that should not have gone forward but did. 
It is subsection 195(7) and not subsection 195(3) that allows the 
CEO to communicate to a province information about the ordinary 
residence and members of the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A substantial amount of Bill C-9 deals with third party spending 
reports.  Subsection 353(1) of the act requires third parties to 
register with Elections Canada once they have incurred election 
expenses of more than $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 359(1) requires third parties to file a report 
documenting the value of expenses and advertising, as well as 
their funding sources during the campaign and for the six month 
period prior to the issuing of the writ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 20 of Bill C-9 would amend subsection 359(1) to specify 
that only third parties required to be registered with the CEO 
must file such a report.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-9 was tabled, several observers thought that the 
government would propose amendments dealing with the ceiling on 
expenses imposed on third parties during election campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 349 of the act, a third party is defined as “a 
person or a group other than a candidate, registered party or 
riding association of a registered party.  It could mean an 
unincorporated trade union, trade association or any other group 
of persons acting together by mutual consent for a common 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Elections Act passed in May 2000 provides that, 
during a general election, the ceiling on third party election 
spending is $150,000 at the national level and $3,000 for each 
electoral district.  In a byelection a third party may spend 
$3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 23, 2000, Mr. Justice Cairns of the Alberta Court of 
Queen's Bench granted an injunction prohibiting Elections Canada 
from enforcing the third party election advertising spending 
limits in the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally the injunction was to be in effect until Judge Cairns 
handed down his ruling on the main matter before him, that is, 
the constitutionality of provisions relating to third parties in 
the new elections act.  The injunction was upheld shortly 
afterward by the Alberta Court of Appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The injunction was granted in response to legal action 
undertaken by the National Citizens' Coalition led by a former 
Reform Party member, Stephen Harper.  The coalition is currently 
contesting the new provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on November 10, 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada 
lifted the injunction in its ruling in Canada vs. Stephen Joseph 
Harper.  Eight of the nine justices were in favour of staying the 
injunction until the constitutionality of the contested 
provisions could be ruled on or by the courts.  Only Mr. Justice 
John Major opposed this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In paragraph 11 of the judgment, the majority opinion of the 
court held that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the public interest in maintaining in place the duly enacted 
legislation on spending limits pending complete constitutional 
review outweighs the detriment to freedom of expression caused by 
those limits. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, Elections Canada announced that the provisions 
regarding third party spending would not be enforced for the 
period from October 22, 2000, the date that the writs were issued 
for the general election, to November 10, 2000.  They would 
however be enforced after that up to November 27, 2000 which was 
polling day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta Court of Queen's Bench has still not ruled on the 
constitutionality of the Canada Elections Act provisions with 
regard to third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we welcome legislation, perhaps this should have been 
avoided if the government had not done such sloppy work on Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the legislation going forward for a number 
of reasons, as I have tried to indicate in this dissertation.  We 
would also suggest very strongly that one of the reasons we 
support it is that it will have an opportunity to be heard on the 
Senate side.  We will have an opportunity to discuss, debate and 
perhaps put forward amendments to legislation that could be 
better enforced and put forward better in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we have learned some lessons from the inconsistencies and 
problems that came forward with Bill C-2 and do not repeat them 
with Bill C-9.  Hopefully, when we bring in legislation, put them 
to a committee, and listen to legitimate concerns, complaints and 
suggestions as to how they could be made better, that maybe the 
government will listen to those concerns and suggestions openly 
and honestly, and make those changes at that point in time, as 
opposed to taking forward legislation that is inaccurate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an occasion for which I as a 
parliamentarian am deeply grateful that this institution exists 
and I have an opportunity to express myself when I have serious 
misgivings about legislation that is passed through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By coincidence, the member who spoke before me, the member for 
Brandon—Souris, touched precisely on the area of concern that I 
wish to devote my remarks to, and that is the question of third 
party advertising and how it was dealt with in Bill C-2, the 
previous legislation, and how it should be dealt with in the 
future.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to give some background just so people will understand 
what happened.  The member for Brandon—Souris in fact gave some 
of the background and I am grateful that he has done so because 
it saves me going over that ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the general public should understand that the Canada 
Elections Act sets limits on campaign spending by candidates. In 
each riding it varies a little according to geography, size and 
population, but most candidates for a federal election are 
restricted in their spending during the campaign to usually 
around $60,000.  I think my campaign ceiling for election 
expenses is around $65,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back a little, during the 1993 election campaign, which 
was my first experience in running as a candidate, the law was 
such that there was a limit under the law on third party 
advertising expenditures.  There was also a blackout period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being referred to there is the idea that people or 
groups who are not related to the political party or the 
candidate might wish to buy advertising during an election period 
to support one candidate or another, or one party or another, or 
to advance a controversial issue during an election campaign, 
hopefully to get a debate going among the candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its wisdom, parliament, prior to the 1993 election, put 
restrictions on third party advertising.  The idea was that the 
limit of expenditure on groups who wanted to take out advertising 
during election campaigns supporting one candidate or another was 
restricted to $1,000.  Indeed there was a very long blackout 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory behind that limitation was that if candidates were 
restricted in their spending, they were restricted in their 
spending so that there would be an even playing field.  Whether 
one is a candidate from the government in power, an incumbent, a 
candidate from a party in opposition or a candidate from a small 
fringe party, everyone faces the same amount of potential 
election spending.  It is relatively modest at $60,000.  Most 
groups and organizations can raise the amount of private 
donations necessary to reach that objective in spending, so it is 
quite reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we add third party advertising into the equation, 
as it exists in the United States where there is a great deal of 
soft money around during an election campaign, then there is a 
danger of distorting the process.  There might be a situation 
where a special interest group, a corporation or whatever 
else—and this does happen in the United States—spends enormous 
amounts of money, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars even in 
a single riding, to run advertising election material with the 
specific intent of seeing that one particular candidate, whether 
it is an incumbent or otherwise, does not succeed in the 
election.  The restriction in my view in 1993 was very 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was described by the member for Brandon—Souris, that 
provision was challenged prior to the 1997 election by the 
National Citizens' Coalition on the charter grounds that it 
limited the right to free expression during an election campaign. 
This provision prior to the 1997 election campaign was suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was my second election campaign, Mr. Speaker, and I should 
tell you that in my first mandate as a member of parliament I 
undertook quite an initiative to bring special interest groups 
that were receiving public funds to account.  I put out several 
reports calling for transparencies of such groups and I named 
some of these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, during the 1997 election, when the limit on 
third party advertising disappeared, what happened was that I was 
enormously attacked by television ads, by print ads and by radio 
ads.  The spending to attack me as the candidate by these special 
interest groups, some of them charities but most of them not for 
profit organizations linked to various charities, was easily far 
more than I spent.  In fact in the 1997 campaign, even though my 
election spending ceiling was about $65,000, I only spent 
$32,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that I am very much a grassroots candidate.  I 
have no corporations behind me.  I have no big interests behind 
me.  My campaign donations are exclusively from the ordinary 
people in my riding who have confidence in me as an individual. 
It is more their confidence in me as an individual than my party 
affiliation that has enabled me to raise the money in my riding 
that permitted me to run the campaign.  I have received no money 
even from the party during my election campaigns, not only in 
1997 but in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1997 election campaign the government undertook, 
through Bill C-2, to address the challenge that the National 
Citizen's Coalition had succeeded in.  When the Alberta court 
ruled that the limits on third party advertising expenditures 
were unconstitutional, the government undertook to redraft the 
law in Bill C-2 in which it defined limits on third party 
advertising expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it said basically in Bill C-2 was that third parties that 
wanted to engage in buying advertising during an election 
campaign should be required to identify themselves and they would 
be limited to only spending $3,000 in each riding, to a maximum 
of $150,000 across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the problem, and that is why I am here speaking today 
and why I am so very concerned.  When Bill C-9 came forward it 
was an attempt to correct the problems that exist in Bill C-2, 
but there was no opportunity to address the problem of third 
party advertising because Elections Canada had still not reported 
on the effect of third party advertising under the new rules, who 
indeed had registered and what they had done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a printout from Elections Canada that describes the 
registered third parties that participated in campaign 2000.  I 
got this only when Bill C-9 was in committee, so there was no 
opportunity to discuss it before committee and I have to bring it 
before the House.  What we have here is the name of the 
registered third party and the name of the applicant who 
submitted an address, and that is the complete information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, what we have here is a number of special 
interest groups and organizations.  We have unions.  We have the 
Canadian Medical Association.  We have an animal rights 
organization.  None of that is surprising.  We also have third 
party organizations that identify themselves only by name.  We 
have Rick Smith of Red Lake, Rod Gillis of St. John's and Liz 
White of Toronto.  That is all we know about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2, the law that exists, requires no more information.  It 
is sufficient to register a personal name.  The people who are 
making the application are the people who take the name of the 
third party that is actually buying the advertising, presumably 
to take one stand or another for or against a candidate or for or 
against an issue that may be before the electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one set of third party registrants that I would like to 
draw to the attention of the House.  The first one is the 
coalition for the Liberal member for Edmonton West. The next one 
is the Edmonton supporters for the Liberal member for Edmonton 
West.  The third one is Edmontonians for the Liberal member for 
Edmonton West.  The official titles of these third party 
organizations contesting this election name the member for 
Edmonton West.  That member is the sitting justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the problem.  I am pleased to be able to say that there 
was no attempt to hide anything.  These three organizations made 
it very clear that they were taking out ads under the law to 
support the Liberal member for Edmonton West.  The problem is 
that under the current legislation, given that each third party 
organization that wishes to take part in the election campaign in 
a riding can spend $3,000, these three organizations were enabled 
to spend $9,000 in advertising to support the member for Edmonton 
West, the justice minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, had there been 10 such individuals who wished to be 
third party organizations buying advertising during an election 
campaign, they would have been able to spend $30,000 supporting 
the hon. member for Edmonton West.  Twenty individuals would have 
been able to spend $60,000 supporting the hon. member for 
Edmonton West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the problem is that there is no control whatsoever on 
individuals, separately indeed, deciding to support an individual 
candidate in a riding and investing more money than that 
candidate himself or herself would spend in the riding.  We have 
a problem there.  The whole spirit of a ceiling on candidates' 
expenses could be circumvented by all the members of a riding 
association, for instance, deciding to take out third party 
advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a dramatic example.  I am actually very grateful that 
these people who were supporting the justice minister were 
upfront so that I can actually present this very dramatic example 
of what is wrong with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you do not think that is meaningful you should 
be aware that the hon. member for Edmonton West won her seat by a 
single vote in 1993, and that in the year 2000, when these three 
third party organizations were buying ads in support of her, she 
won her riding by only 730 votes.  If anyone should think that 
third party advertising does not have a bearing on an election 
campaign and cannot influence an election campaign, I assure them 
they are wrong, particularly if the campaign is closely 
contested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When campaigns are closely contested, the real problem is that 
Bill C-2, as it exists now, makes it possible for organizations 
that we cannot clearly identify as to intent to spend enormous 
amounts of money to support one particular party or candidate in 
an election.  In other words, Bill C-2, because it is loosely 
written, opens up the same opportunity for abuse in election 
spending as now exists in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that it is not just a case where, as in the case I 
cited, an incumbent is getting support.  There is also another 
organization which very amusingly calls itself the Zap-a-Rock 
organization, and it was obviously raising money in Etobicoke and 
we presume that it was aimed at the health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not know is the intentions of organizations like the 
International Fund for Animal Welfare, which is a very aggressive 
international for profit animal rights organization that makes a 
great deal of money by promoting animal rights causes.  We have 
even here the Christian Heritage Party of Canada which has taken 
out third party advertising spending status and it, in the 
previous election, was a registered political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point always comes down to this.  As the legislation is 
written now, we have no guarantees as individual candidates that 
there cannot be spending on advertising in our riding by a dozen, 
60, 50 or 100 special interest groups whose combined spending can 
more than overpower the campaign ceiling on expenditures that we 
are required to meet ourselves as candidates and that is defined 
by the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It something so fundamental to our democracy that anyone in this 
country should be able to run for high office, for federal 
office, and not have to curry favour among outside organizations 
to enable them to spend money on advertising either across the 
country or in their ridings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my particular case, as someone who had alienated an entire 
sector, the not for profit sector, by criticizing numerous 
charities and by criticizing numerous non-profit organizations, 
in the election of 1997 they banded together, they grouped 
together and brought out advertising against me.  The current 
legislation prevents that from happening, but there was nothing 
stopping every organization that I criticized from separately 
taking out $3,000 worth of advertising and going after me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a chill on a member of parliament doing his duty, 
whether it is not for profit organizations or for profit 
organizations or any other special interest group out there.  If 
members have to worry about organizations being able to buy more 
advertising against them during an election campaign than members 
are entitled to spend on the entire campaign, then I am afraid 
sitting members of parliament will think twice before they speak 
their minds in the House, will think twice before they 
aggressively go after those organizations they feel are not doing 
a proper job in this society or, indeed, are even questionable in 
the most literal sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of parliament need to have a situation whereby the 
spending limits during an election campaign are known, are 
precise, and if organizations are dissatisfied with individual 
candidates, then the way they should go after those individual 
candidates is by investing in the parties in opposition to those 
candidates or in the candidates themselves of those parties, but, 
Mr. Speaker, it is very, very wrong, very, very wrong and 
dangerous if we have a situation where individuals, be they 
individuals as groups or individuals as persons, can separately, 
buy advertising during an election campaign, separately, that 
cumulatively might be an expenditure in the hundreds of thousands 
of dollars against an individual candidate.  This is a very 
serious threat to our democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that when it comes to the 
charter and freedom of speech, it is understood that there have 
to be reasonable limits on freedom of speech.  If freedom of 
speech is interpreted as allowing an open field of election 
spending against candidates when the candidates themselves are 
restricted in that spending, then I think we are all in serious 
trouble. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the speech just made by the member 
opposite and I know he has made this type of speech in the past, 
indicating that he really does not like third party advertising. 
I think it is most unfortunate that he somehow misrelates 
spending to voting.  He thinks somehow that the amount of money 
spent determines the outcome of an election or a referendum or 
any electoral event.  That is simply not the case.  There is not 
a scrap of evidence from anywhere in the world showing that the 
amount of money spent on an electoral event can guarantee the 
outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the Charlottetown accord, for example, as one of 
the cases.  It was a big referendum here in Canada, where the yes 
side spent 10 times as much as the no side but the no side won. 
There are studies of referendums in Switzerland and in the United 
States.  In all the states that have referendums there have been 
studies done comparing the amount of money spent by people 
arguing the yes side or the no side.  There is absolutely no 
correlation between the amount of money spent and the electoral 
success, because it is the issue that counts.  It has nothing to 
do with the amount of money spent.  If voters have a valid issue 
to consider, they will consider the issue and they will make the 
right decision, because the voters are not stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the things, unfortunately, that the member 
opposite assumes is that the voters are so stupid that they can 
be bought, that somebody who comes into the riding and spends 10 
times as much money automatically has 10 times as much success. 
As I said, there is not a scrap of evidence to show that is the 
case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is plenty of evidence and there are plenty of studies from 
everywhere in the world where there are democracies that exactly 
the opposite is the case and that it is the issue that determines 
the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member defeats his own case by talking about the charities 
that organized opposition to him in his own riding.  He complains 
that they organized and they ganged together against him, but he 
was re-elected.  He defeats his own case with that argument, 
because the charities did not have an issue that was valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public understood that the member opposite had a valid 
complaint about these charities, that he was justified in 
questioning the way they spent their money, that he was justified 
in challenging their books and asking them to show the validity 
of their operations.  The public understood that and that is why 
he won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had nothing to do with how much money was spent by the third 
party.  That is why the government has had every one of its gag 
laws struck down as unconstitutional.  It has not been able to 
prove any connection between the amount of money spent and the 
outcome.  The expert witnesses it has had in court have never 
been able to cite a single study that shows any correlation 
between the money spent and the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when the supreme court delivers its decision on the 
latest challenge of the National Citizens' Coalition to this 
elections act I am certain it will again strike it down.  Four 
attempts have been made by governments in the last 10 years to 
institute these gag laws.  They are unconstitutional.  They are 
undemocratic.  They cannot be supported.  The member defeated his 
own argument when he stood here 10 minutes ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>An Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article dated March 3, 1999, explained 
the prevalence of organized crime.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is particularly vulnerable to drug trafficking—the 
principal source of revenue for most organized crime 
groups—according to the Drug Analysis Section of the RCMP. 
Smugglers are attracted to Canada because of the low risk of 
arrest due to limited police resources that have stymied 
investigations, relatively light penalties, and our sprawling, 
largely unmonitored borders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article highlights three of the huge concerns dealing with 
drug trafficking as well as organized crime.  The first is 
limited police resources.  The second is light sentences.  With 
the light sentences being handed down, people understand that 
crime sometimes does pay.  Of course the third point is the 
geographic location of Canada and the fact that it has such huge, 
long, unmonitored borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International drug trafficking is an organized criminal activity 
that threatens democratic institutions, fuels terrorism and human 
rights abuses and undermines economic development.  Drug 
trafficking is an inherently violent activity.  Violence is used 
by involved organizations to protect turf, settle disputes and 
eliminate those who oppose them.  Some of those who oppose them 
are government members, the judiciary, investigative journalists 
and reporters, individuals who are willing to take a stand.  We 
all, as a joint body here, need to be willing to take a stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government estimates the revenue involved.  It 
shocked me when I heard that the amount of revenue our Canadian 
government estimates is in the underground illegal drug market in 
Canada is $7 billion to $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian drug market is dominated by many foreign 
organizations.  We know of many of the countries that are 
involved.  There are Italian based organized criminals who are 
involved in upper echelons of the importation and distribution of 
many drugs.  Asian based groups are active in heroin and, 
increasingly, in cocaine trafficking at the street retail level 
in Canada.  Colombian based traffickers still control much of the 
cocaine trade in eastern and central Canada.  As well, outlaw 
motorcycle gangs play a major role in the importation and large 
scale distribution of cannabis, cocaine and other chemical drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motorcycle gangs and those involved in organized crime are not 
in only one or two provinces.  Provinces throughout this nation 
are now recognizing and understanding the concerns in regard to 
organized crime as they deal with the motorcycle gangs and 
especially the drug trafficking of those gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most illicit drugs arrive in Canada by aircraft, marine 
container or truck.  More than 9 million commercial shipments 
enter Canada each year, 75% at land borders and the rest at 
international airports, marine ports, postal facilities and 
bonded warehouses.  Approximately 1 million marine containers 
holding illegal drugs enter Canadian ports annually and another 
200,000 enter by truck or rail after being unloaded at United 
States marine ports and then moved out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 5.2 million trucks entered Canada from the United 
States.  Three years ago it was estimated that by the year 2000 
this number would reach 6 million to 6.8 million.  We have a 
customs inspection rate of less than 2% and we are talking about 
5.2 million vehicles that are estimated to contain drugs and are 
crossing the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least 100 tonnes of hashish, 15 to 24 tonnes of cocaine and 4 
tonnes of liquid hashish are smuggled into Canada each year. 
Some 50% of the marijuana available in Canada is produced in 
Canada, but the other 50% is brought in from other countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The domestic production of marijuana is estimated to be at 800 
tonnes.  In 1994 an RCMP operation found that $10 million worth 
of marijuana was exported from British Columbia to the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To exemplify this point I again quote from a news article, this 
one appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> in April 1999, just two 
short years ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dale Brandland, a sheriff from Washington State, testified that 
many marijuana growers have moved to Canada in recent years to 
escape harsher U.S. drug laws.  U.S. police have said that 
organized crime groups, including the Hells Angels and various 
Asian gangs, are shipping the highly popular drug back into the 
United States, sometimes swapping it pound for pound for cocaine. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 sentiments expressed by the former commissioner of the 
RCMP regarding the prevalence of organized crime was recently 
echoed by the president of the Canadian Police Association who 
has said that organized crime is gaining the upper hand on law 
enforcement and it is time for tougher laws.  Canadian Police 
Association president, Grant Obst, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are going out of control and it is time to do something 
about it.  The biggest problem organized crime has is they have 
too much money.  And our biggest problem is we do not have 
enough. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding resources this is what the president of the Canadian 
Police Association said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fighting a battle with a group of individuals who have it 
would seem an unlimited amount of dollars available to them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old saying goes that it takes money to make money.  In 
Canada it takes money perhaps to be involved in organized crime 
and it would be very obvious that they seem to have that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put in place resources for those individuals who are 
willing to fight organized crime.  It is time our country takes a 
stand and provides them with the right resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-24 the federal government is injecting $200 
million over the next five years to implement the legislation and 
related prosecution and law enforcement strategies.  This funding 
is to build on the $584 million that the RCMP received in the 
2000 budget to help fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the money is a welcome addition it simply is not 
enough.  I have already discussed that the drug trafficking could 
be close to $10 billion per year and we are throwing $200 million 
more at the problem.  It seems to be a drop in the bucket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's national police force cannot fulfil domestic 
obligations, let alone our international obligations to provide 
legal and police assistance in countries such as Colombia and 
Peru due to the previous cuts.  The report on plans and 
priorities for the RCMP funding for 1998-99 to 2000-01 showed a 
continuous decline in spending for federal policing services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts affected policing services in the area of drug 
enforcement, customs and excise, proceeds of crime and 
international liaison.  The cuts affected policing services in 
the area of drug enforcement.  That is organized crime.  The area 
of customs and excise is directly related to organized crime. The 
area of proceeds of crime and international liaison is also 
related to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was to be a 65% reduction of the 1996-97 funding levels 
for the anti-smuggling initiative despite the fact that larger 
sophisticated criminal organizations continue to successfully 
engage in the smuggling and distribution of contraband goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without adequate increased funding and more highly trained 
skilled provincial police and RCMP officers, the bikers, the 
Mafia and the Asian based organized criminals will continue to 
have a free run and to smuggle drugs across our borders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen in Edmonton and Calgary they will have the 
ability to kill innocent bystanders who are caught up in turf 
wars and caught up in money laundering.  They will continue to 
intimidate and threaten.  They will continue to injure and kill 
members of the judiciary, crime reporters, correction officers, 
and maybe even some day members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore urge and recommend a significant increase in 
the expenditures proposed in Bill C-24.  I do so with the 
confidence that the majority of Canadians would agree that 
fighting organized crime is a top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 report of a national survey on organized crime and 
corrections in Canada revealed that Canadians support increased 
funding for the RCMP to combat organized crime.  I will quote 
from page 3 of that document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually all respondents want government to spend more money to 
fight organized crime; in a forced-choice situation, respondents 
picked organized crime as a spending priority over all other 
proposed options except health care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only scratched the surface of this most important piece 
of legislation.  I hope to get another opportunity in the near 
future to speak again to this criminal law bill.  Some of the 
other points in the bill are well worth supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a concentrated effort on everything it would 
take to fight organized crime.  Canadians want to feel safe.  We 
want to feel safe in our homes, in our communities, in our 
provinces and in our country.   When we look at the survey we 
understand why Canadians want more money for health care.  They 
want to feel safe.  They want to feel if they become ill that the 
resources are there to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to be safe on their streets.  They want to know 
the Canadian government is absolutely committed to keeping 
communities safe.  The great fear many Canadians face is the 
onslaught of crime.  I do not mean petty crime although we want 
to fight that as well.  They fear organized crime because it is a 
direct threat to our society, to the well-being and safety of our 
communities, and to our children and our grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for Crowfoot.  I acknowledge 
there is no question the federal Liberal government has been 
absolutely irresponsible in its failure to properly fund social 
programs, the RCMP and a number of other departments and programs 
throughout the country.  As a result, we have a very critical 
situation in a number of different areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned a number of different things such as 
the need for people to feel safe and to attack organized crime. 
The people most vulnerable to organized crime are people who are 
poor and living in very austere conditions.  They end up buying 
drugs or becoming victims of the abuse that goes along with 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party has been absolutely brutal any time there is 
a suggestion that funds should go to improving housing, to people 
living in poverty, to improve conditions or to provide programs 
to help such people.  His party has been absolutely brutal in 
attacking any kind of funding for those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His party and its pressure, its constant bickering and belly 
aching about government expenditures, were ultimately behind the 
cuts in those services and in policing.  It gave the government 
the opportunity to cut various things to make sure it had a 
balanced bottom line.  It was his party that did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he not see the domino effect of that kind of attitude and 
the consequences that Canadians would feel as a result?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for a very good question.  She suggests that when we are dealing 
with something as important as criminal law and fighting 
organized crime it comes back to a housing project or education. 
Perhaps we should take a look at a whole umbrella of things that 
have caused it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that obviously we need to look at social concerns. 
We need to have social programs, but police forces are asking for 
the resources to fight organized crime and the New Democrat Party 
is saying that we need housing programs.  Our party has talked 
about balance.  We want strong legislation that would give the 
resources to the police forces and all people who fight crime so 
that they have the ability to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Canadian Police Association says that the 
forest is ablaze and we are standing there with our squirt guns 
trying to put out a little bushfire.  The New Democrats, I would 
suggest, are coming forward with the same rhetoric we hear day 
after day, hour after hour, of throwing another social program at 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need balance for all.  Provincial and federal governments 
need to work together in areas of their own jurisdictions.  When 
we are talking about justice and bills, the federal government 
needs to say we need social programs but we also need resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some other parts of the bill I want to discuss at the next 
opportunity in the House deal with the application of the 
criminal code which we have been concerned about in the past. 
Certain parts of the bill would give police officers the 
opportunity to fight and would provide for indictable offences 
under the criminal code and other acts of parliament when police 
forces are fighting crime.  It would give them the ability to go 
in quickly with pre-emptive strikes to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again my answer to the hon. member is that we unquestionably 
need social programs, but with organized crime it is not only 
those who are impoverished.  It is not only those in organized 
crime who get caught up in drug trafficking and living off the 
avails of drugs.  It is a blue collar problem.  It is a problem 
in every area of society.  Much work needs to be done 
internationally as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading in the paper this past week about other 
governments being concerned about the war against drugs.  A 
terrible atrocity took place, I believe in Chile or Peru or one 
of those countries, two governments that are very proactive.  It 
was thought that aircraft were leaving with drugs on them and an 
error in judgment was made.  We saw a tragedy where three or four 
missionaries from the United States were travelling and the plane 
was shot down.  A mother and small child were killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very aware that we need to fight crime where it 
is.  It is an unfortunate situation and circumstance, but we need 
to fight crime.  The bill moves us in the right direction.  I 
encourage members of the New Democratic Party to say is good 
legislation and they will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be amendments to it.  We would like to see more 
money given to the police forces, to the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, but let us applaud the Liberal government when it finally 
brings in something for which we have been calling for years. Let 
us give a bit of credit and say that it is moving in the right 
direction.  Let us all jump on board and support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to the 
member's comments, without question we must fight organized crime 
and we must ensure the resources are in place to deal with 
organized crime, but it is crucially important that we get to the 
root of the problem and address all the issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my question to the hon. member I was suggesting that the 
government go beyond just looking at this issue of organized 
crime.  The government should start putting some of the dollars 
needed into other areas to also help with that problem.  It 
should not always come out with that last minute attempt to 
get some press and some headlines by saying it wants to keep 
people safe, when a lot of what it is doing is what is making it 
impossible for everybody to be safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not a war on 
headlines and press.  This is a war on crime.  Without doubt the 
New Democrats would suggest that we need to throw money at the 
problem.  We need to direct money.  It not just more money 
continually thrown at something that is going to solve the 
problem.  It is a balanced approach to directing the moneys that 
are available to programs that are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member wholeheartedly that if there are social 
concerns we need to dwell on them.  These social concerns are the 
root of much crime.  We need to support the measures this bill 
would put in place, the deterrents that would fight crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
know how much I have been concerned about organized crime and 
the fight against organized crime as the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say right off that I find this bill introduced by the 
Minister of Justice and her colleague, the Solicitor General of 
Canada, extremely positive.  We will certainly have to work in 
committee to improve it, but I think our colleague, the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm and Bloc Quebecois justice critic, has also 
said he is relatively pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that in the early 1990s, we 
learned as parliamentarians 
with some stupefaction just how deep the roots of 
organized crime went in our societies.  We were used to calling 
ourselves a country of law and order, where basic freedoms 
thrive and where there is essentially no political corruption. 
This remains the case and continues to be relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came to realize in the early 1990s that the 
real threats we faced as parliamentarians representing a 
challenge for the future for all of our societies included 
those related to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members will remember that the catalyst, the event that 
triggered this realization, was the killing, the car bomb that 
went off in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve on August 9, 1995, which for 
the first time in the history of crime claimed an innocent 
victim, a young lad of 11, Daniel Desrochers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I am wrong to say that because of this event we 
as politicians realized the scope of the threat of organized 
crime in our societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was followed by action, which I and other parliamentarians 
joined in.  Not only did politicians realize the scope of 
organized crime. So did the agencies responsible for law 
enforcement.  Police forces also called for more resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also remember that in 1997, two years after the car 
bombing, the House passed a bill creating the new offence of 
participation in a criminal organization. A new offence was 
added to section 467.91 of the criminal code, namely the offence 
of participating in a criminal organization, of gangsterism. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill was passed very quickly. We were fairly convinced that 
it would provide a useful additional tool to law enforcement 
bodies and police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must admit that we had underestimated the incredible 
adaptability to change of biker gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about organized crime there are two or three 
realities to keep in mind. The first one is that 
organized crime exists across Canada. There are 36 biker 
gangs in all the provinces. 
The most powerful ones are those that have ties with 
the Hell's Angels which have managed to set up chapters 
across Canada. For a long time they had been excluded from 
Ontario, but last year they managed to move into the 
Ottawa—Vanier area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime has three features. It is a criminal 
organization that is motivated by the prospect of money and it 
is generally a transborder organization. It must be realized 
that organized crime is involved in the import-export business. 
Some conditions must exist for organized crime to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s, when I began to take an interest in this 
issue as a member of parliament, I met a number of police 
officers. 
The officer who has been the most helpful, the best trainer and 
the one who gave me the most judicious advice was at the time 
the officer in charge at the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police and the officer in charge of organized crime in the 
Montreal urban community police department. This officer was 
Pierre Sangollo, who today is on duty in the small city of 
Sainte-Julie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Sangollo had told me “Never forget that in order for 
organized crime to proliferate, prosper and expand in a society 
it needs at least three conditions”. It needs a 
society with a minimum of wealth since organized crime gets 
richer through extortion, plundering, robbery and fraud. 
Therefore organized crime needs an environment where there is a 
minimum of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs a society where there are rapid means of communication. 
When we look at the strategies used by organized crime we see 
that its members often have contacts in the harbours, in air 
traffic and in areas where one can make rapid connections with 
various continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To proliferate, organized crime also needs a bureaucratized 
society. The Canadian charter of human rights is a positive 
document, in its own right. Everybody is in favour of a society 
where the rule of law is paramount, where everyone is equal 
before the law and where constitutional protections exist. I am 
sure parliamentarians who passed the charter of human rights 
in 1982 never expected there would be such obstacles to the 
fight against organized crime, for the charter has proved to be 
in certain respects an ally in the proliferation of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you an example of this. 
Some clauses of the charter provide that everyone has a right to 
full justice. Some natural justice principles are entrenched in 
the charter of rights. My colleague and friend, the member for 
Chicoutimi, knows that principles of natural justice are 
entrenched in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s the supreme court handed down a ruling, 
called the Stinchcombe ruling. 
Under this ruling crown attorneys have to disclose all the 
evidence they have against the accused. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the subcommittee of the justice committee was struck it 
travelled across Canada. Crown attorneys told members that a 
criminal investigation involving some shadowing of members of 
organized crime can easily cost the state, the crown, $1 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Stinchcombe ruling members can imagine the 
reproduction and reprography costs involved when there are tons 
and tons of documents by the boxful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travelled to Vancouver I was shown, while the crown was 
preparing the trial of some members of organized crime, a room 
the size of the House containing full boxes of documents used by 
the crown to prove its case. These documents had to be copied 
and provided to the defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had to be done because of a principle entrenched in  the 
charter of rights. One can imagine how complicated it can be for 
those implementing the act to deal with such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for organized crime to prosper a certain number of 
conditions are required: a bureaucratized state where there are 
constitutional guarantees for all, a society where routes allow 
transborder trade, and a society which is 
bureaucratized and often acts as an ally of members of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all this, in 1997 we passed it in good faith. I 
remember that the five parties in the House at the time were 
unanimous. We passed the bill in less than one week at all 
stages. In committee everyone worked in good faith; everyone 
acted quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had with Bill C-95 a new tool that we thought would be 
effective in the fight against organized crime. What was that 
tool? It was a definition in the criminal code creating an 
infraction for gangsterism. When five people were convicted of a 
crime punishable by a five year term in prison they were 
considered to be a gang. To take part in a gang crime, to take 
part in its money making schemes and to commit a crime for gang 
members was punishable by a 14 year prison sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were convinced that with this tool, Bill C-95, we could bring 
down the heads of organized crime. In 1995 there were 36 biker 
gangs: Hell's Angels, Rock Machine, the Outriders and so one. 
There were 35 of them across Canada. Believe it or not, in five 
years, with Bill C-95, we have been able to press charges in only 
three cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1995 and 2000 no more than three trials in all of 
Canada were conducted on the basis of Bill C-95 and the new 
infraction in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were we not able to bring the leaders of organized crime to 
justice? Because organized crime is smart. Organized crime has 
means. Organized crime is rich and has a formidable capacity to 
adapt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the leaders of organized crime do?  They set their 
various groups up as satellites. The Hell's Angels created 
affiliate clubs: the Spartiates and the Nomades, to name 
them.  These affiliates recruited young people without records, 
people who had not in the previous five years committed an 
offence punishable by five years' imprisonment and who could not 
therefore be brought before the courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the crown prosecutors told us “The tool you gave us 
with Bill C-95 does not work, and the definition of organized 
crime has to be changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example of how ineffective the tool we 
adopted was.  I have to say that the government did not drag its 
feet with respect to organized crime.  There are at least six 
laws that were amended, including the proceeds of crime 
legislation, the Witness Protection Act, and the law that 
permits shadowing and setting up storefronts legally.  As 
lawmakers we have been extremely busy with legislation on 
organized crime. 
It has not been a partisan issue in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of examples.  Dominic Tozzi, one of the greatest 
money launderers ever caught in Canada, got out of prison two 
years after being sentenced to 10 years in penitentiary for 
laundering $27.2 million.  Dominic Tozzi laundered $27.2 million. 
He was sentenced by a court of law to 10 years in prison, but 
with the applicable rules of law he was released after two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Antonio Volpato, one of the major figures in the Montreal Mafia, 
was released after serving one year of his sentence instead of 
six.  The sentence arose from a charge of plotting to import 180 
kilos of cocaine.  It is rather a 
lot in terms of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also Joseph Lagana, a former lawyer and financial 
adviser 
to the mafia who served two and a half years of a 13 year 
sentence for importing 558 kilos of cocaine and laundering $47.4 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after passing Bill C-95 and amending 
six acts recently, there have been situations involving 
known members of organized crime. We are not dealing with young 
offenders subject to the Young Offenders Act but rather known 
criminals capable of laundering $47 million with the support of a 
huge network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all challenges we had to overcome in order to fight 
organized crime. I am sure members all have in their 
ridings, and there may even be some in the gallery today, people who 
think it is easy to crack down on criminal organizations. As 
parliamentarians we now know that it is extremely hard and that 
we need much more powerful tools than the ones we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this problem the justice minister, with whom I 
regularly train in the gym, introduced a bill that would change 
the definition of organized crime slightly. The organized 
crime offence will be much easier to prove in court. It will no 
longer be necessary to have five people who have committed 
punishable offences in the last five years. 
Organized crime and the related offence of gangsterism are now 
defined as participating in or contributing to any activity that 
helps a criminal organization achieve its objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also provided that a well known leader of a criminal organization 
like Mom Boucher is liable to life 
imprisonment. This is interesting. For a long time that was the 
problem. We were able to convict members of criminal 
organizations but not their leaders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by pointing out another positive aspect of the 
bill. The notion of offence related property will be broadened 
so that the proceeds of crime money laundering act will be 
used a lot more. This is another very positive aspect of the 
bill.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ELDORADO NUCLEAR LIMITED REORGANIZATION AND DIVESTITURE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK28">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 25 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-3, an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-3, an act to 
amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture 
Act and the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there has been any doubt where the New Democratic 
Party is on the bill.  It was indicated yesterday by speakers 
from our party that we intend to oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to give a bit of a summary for Canadians who are 
listening to what is happening in the House.  I am pleased to 
indicate that when I go around my riding there are a number of 
people who watch what goes on in the House, so it is important 
that we take the time to have some discussion in debate and to 
maybe let Canadians know exactly what is entailed in the 
different bills that come before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill relates to the mandatory provisions in the articles of 
Cameco Corporation, formerly Eldorado Nuclear Limited and 
Petro-Canada.  Bill C-3 was first introduced in the 36th 
parliament as Bill C-39 and subsequently died on the order paper 
with the dissolution of parliament in the fall of 2000 for that 
wonderful election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment provides that articles of Cameco Corporation will 
have to contain a 15% individual non-resident share ownership 
limit for voting shares, as well as a cap on aggregate 
non-resident share ownership voting rights of 25%.  It stipulates 
that the articles of Petro-Canada will have to be amended to 
allow for a 20% individual share ownership limit, while the 
aggregate non-resident share ownership limits will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the prohibition of the sale, transfer or disposal 
of all or substantially all of Petro-Canada's upstream and 
downstream assets will be replaced with a similar prohibition on 
the sale, transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of its 
assets without distinguishing between the upstream and downstream 
sectors of the activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that left a lot of people out there guessing just what 
the heck we were talking about.  The bottom line is that once 
again it is the sell off of Canadian resources to foreign 
companies with no other party in the House speaking out against 
it except the New Democratic Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources made some comments about it not being a big worry 
because there was only a certain percentage of foreign shares in 
Petro-Canada.  Even though it could be as high as 20%, there are 
a mere 6% or thereabouts that are under foreign shares.  We are 
going to open the door wide and say that we are for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada, the last hold on any kind of control over that 
energy resource in Canada, is up for sale.  We are going to throw 
it out on the open market.  This is the last opportunity for any 
kind of control, as limited as it is, because the previous 
federal governments put it up for sale like they did with so many 
of our other very important national programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources 
indicated that he did not see it as a big issue, that he did not 
see anyone buying it and that it would still be controlled by 
Canada.  People will have to excuse me for not having much faith 
in that because that was the same argument the previous 
governments used for CN and CP, and will probably be the same one 
this government will use for our airline industry.  Little by 
little it is chipping away and saying that Canada is for sale. 
Canadians will no longer have control over our important 
resources and programs.  Therefore I obviously have very little 
faith in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was indicated that I would get an opportunity to speak 
today, I reviewed the debates that took place yesterday.  I was 
extremely impressed with my hon. colleague for Palliser and I 
want to thank him for his in-depth speech.  If anyone wants to 
really get the true picture of what is going on, one needs only 
refer to yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> and read the hon. member for 
Palliser's comments, his experiences and the situations that are 
out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read his comments, as well as some of my other colleagues' 
comments, I also had the opportunity to read the comments of one 
of the Alliance members.  I was shaking my head and thought that 
this is truly the form of the Alliance.  It was the ultimate 
double speak that I had ever read at any one point, and I want to 
make reference to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been quite surprised that politicians literally speak out 
of both sides of their mouths.  They are in favour of this or 
that because they want to use their householders or ten 
percenters and have everyone on their side.  The bottom line is 
there are differences.  We cannot always be on everybody's side 
because there are times when there are important issues and 
politicians want to be there for Canadians and support what is 
beneficial for them.  A politician does not want to get every 
vote.  There are principles involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect on the double speak from yesterday.  It was 
the member for Athabasca who was speaking.  His comments were: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the legislation is mindful of the 
possible consequence of high levels of foreign ownership of 
uranium resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party has always been concerned over the 
possible consequences of foreign ownership of our very important 
natural resources.  The Alliance member is acknowledging that, 
but then goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lower limits on Comeco shares reflect across the board 
government restrictions on foreign activity in uranium mining. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is saying that because we do not allow more foreign shares to 
be sold that is a real issue.  That means we have to be concerned 
about foreign shares, but then we are concerned that we cannot 
sell them.  He goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Alliance is all for Canadian businesses having 
all the opportunities to succeed, we must also be conscious of 
the need to keep such potentially volatile resources within 
Canadian control. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used the words volatile resources in Canadian control.  Then 
his next line is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows for greater flexibility in the selling of shares 
in Canadian companies, and I support that effort. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has anyone ever heard more double speak in such few short 
paragraphs?  It got better when he went on to talk about 
Petro-Canada and basically said much of the same thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to parliamentarians and to all Canadians that uranium is a 
volatile resource but so are our oil and gas resources.  Are they 
not crucial resources to Canada?  Should we not be concerned over 
the total sell off of those resources to foreign companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if members of the Alliance, Liberals or Conservatives 
believe that it is okay if they are bought up by Americans? There 
is a serious risk in selling off our resources in totality to any 
foreign company.  We as Canadians must retain control of those 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like Canadians to recognize the type of doublespeak that 
goes on here and to emphasize the importance that the New 
Democratic Party places on having Canadians controlling our 
natural resources.  We felt that way about our railways, our 
airlines and our water because they were serious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear this kind of doublespeak from members of other 
parties, I wonder how they would protect our water resources. 
Would they do things any differently when all they can see in 
their minds is the ideology of privatization?  Their answer is 
that everything is for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that if they could find out how to privatize the sweat 
off somebody's back and make a profit from it, and they do those 
kind of things anyway through their labour legislation, they 
would figure that is okay too.  They believe anything can be 
privatized. It is time that members of parliament and all 
Canadians take a serious look at the drastic consequences of 
allowing open season on all our natural resources. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member who just spoke raised some very interesting 
questions.  I faced the same dilemma with one of my neighbours 
not very long ago when we got into a debate.  He has a little 
farm in Alberta that he wanted to sell because it was just not 
viable any more.  He wanted to get rid of it.  He did some 
advertising and he was offered $100,000.  A foreign buyer came 
along and said that he would give him $250,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the dilemma.  I object to foreigners buying land in 
Canada and yet how could I say to the farmer that he should be 
forced to take $100,000 for his land and not accept the $250,000, 
which is a little closer to what it is actually worth?  What 
mechanism do we use to assure that Canada stays Canadian?  It is 
a concept in principle with which I agree. However, what is the 
New Democratic Party policy?  Do we compensate people with 
government tax money or do we make it illegal for them to sell 
their product or property at the higher price? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question 
that Canadians do not want to see all of Canada for sale.  They 
do not and that is the issue here.  We had legislation in place 
and I see no reason that it had to be changed.  I would have 
preferred seeing these companies continue as totally Canadian 
government owned, the way they were at one time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have legislation in place and these companies are doing well 
financially.  Why is there a need to suddenly change it, unless 
it is to say that there is an open sale on resources in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue in the area of farming, but some provinces have 
rules in place where they have limits on the amount of foreign 
ownership allowed, whether it be in farming or in tourist areas. 
It is a concern right now in Nova Scotia where a great length of 
the coastal shore has been bought out by foreign individuals who 
do not live there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same situation with farming.  If a farmer moves to 
Canada my guess is he will end up being as Canadian as most of us 
if he is farming that operation.  No one would argue about that. 
We need that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we reach a limit we need something in place to make sure 
that other farmers or industries that may wish to sell are able 
to get a reasonable price for their property.  Banff went through 
the same as far as foreign ownership is concerned.  There are 
ways of doing that without selling our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment to make on the issue of privatization. 
There is one story I like to tell about privatization that for me 
says it all.  It has to do with the privatization of the Manitoba 
telephone system which was done by a Conservative government.  It 
said that it would never do such a thing and then did after it 
was elected.  Many friends of the government made a lot of money 
by buying cheap shares and having them escalate in value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story is about a phone located on the perimeter highway in 
Winnipeg.  The phone was placed there for people whose cars broke 
down or who had some kind of emergency or whatever.  As long as 
the phone was publicly owned it was fine because it was 
cross-subsidized and was available as a public service.  It was 
there to serve a public need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the Manitoba telephone system became privatized and 
shareholder value became the guiding principle of that 
corporation, rather than a public service all phone stations were 
evaluated.  The company felt that phone did not pay because it 
was only used 75 to 150 times a year.  Boom, out went the phone. 
To me this says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With privatization comes a value system.  Only those things 
which are profitable for shareholders are to be valued.  Things 
that at one time under a different ethic and a different form of 
ownership served other needs, other than the profit strategies of 
the corporations and the needs of shareholders, were put in 
place.  With privatization we see the disappearance of these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true with railways, airlines and telephone companies and 
it will be true with water if we allow our water system to be 
privatized.  Water is the next thing on the hit list of global 
corporate privatizers.  We make no apologies for having been 
against this trend when it first began and we are still against 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that my 
colleague raised this issue.  I had the opportunity in my 
comments but I had so many other things to say that I never got 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation he talks about with the Manitoba telephone system 
is one of the most despicable things the Conservative government 
in Manitoba did.  We had a viable telephone operation that was 
beneficial to the whole province and people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very remote riding.  Some 27 communities do not have 
all weather road access.  A number of communities had a few 
phones and most often they were pay phones.  MTS came in and that 
is where the pay telephone story comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The school and the nursing station got a phone and one other 
phone went in.  These were not pay phones.  The only pay phone in 
town was pulled out because there were now three other phones 
that everybody could run and use.  That is the type of approach 
taken when profit is the only motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the partners in that process is now the hon. member for 
Portage—Lisgar.  There was an open sale of MTS.  The people of 
Manitoba ousted the Conservative government directly as a result 
of the sale of MTS because they were not happy about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It increased the cost of phone service on an ongoing basis.  The 
cost of a phone has been increasing.  The service is far less 
than it ever was.  We had by far the best phone system in the 
world.  Now there are problems after problems.  MTS does not put 
any money back into the service.  It is willing to sell it at 
whatever the rates and does not put the money back in.  It is 
definitely a big issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will take only a few minutes.  I know the government is anxious 
to bring this to a close.  The hon. member for Churchill said 
that the privatization of MTS was the most dastardly thing the 
Conservative government of Manitoba had ever done.  That reminded 
me of an even more dastardly thing that was done by the Liberals 
when they came to power in 1993.  I am referring to the 
privatization of Canadian National Railway which was perpetrated 
by the Benedict Arnold of transportation, the hon. Doug Young. We 
are forever grateful to the member for Acadie—Bathurst for 
removing that political scourge from the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  He is a lobbyist now for CN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Now he is a lobbyist for CN.  I am sure 
he is doing quite well.  I do not know what the ethics counsellor 
thinks of that.  I suppose he passed through the required time of 
cleansing and everything is being done by the rules, however 
inadequate those rules may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a travesty.  I remember when we had a publicly owned 
Canadian National Railway infrastructure from coast to coast.  It 
was operating on business principles but nevertheless from time 
to time could do things that served the needs of particular 
communities or regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have that same Canadian National Railway, no longer 
worthy of that name, which is becoming more and more of an 
American railway.  It merged with the Illinois Central.  There 
are more and more American senior managers coming up and running 
the CNR according to American railway principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who really owns the CNR?  Up to 60% of its shareholders are 
Americans.  We had a vast public infrastructure paid for over the 
years by the Canadian public which was turned over for a very 
cheap price to what are now American shareholders.  We no longer 
have control of that enormous piece of transportation 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was part of the common wisdom of the country and of 
parliament for years that given the size of Canada transportation 
was a critical thing the government had to have some say in. 
Through the privatization of the CNR and through their relaxing 
of the regulations that used to attend the regulation of railways 
we now have a toothless organization. Whatever Paul Tellier wants 
Paul Tellier gets.  Whatever the CPR wants the CPR gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may remember when we had a Canadian Transport 
Commission that could actually make railways do things they did 
not want to do because it was in the public interest to do them. 
The CTC could prohibit them from doing things that were harmful.

comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has said, Doug Young left politics in 1997. 
In the fall of 1998 he was quoted in the <I>Telegraph Journal</I> 
as saying he had privatized CN himself and that it was now the 
best client he had ever had.  This was Doug Young, a Liberal 
minister on the other side of the House.  That same article 
quoted him as saying he was one of the directors who had 
privatized the four lane highway in New Brunswick.  There again 
he was making millions of dollars on the backs of New 
Brunswickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sold CN to the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and we lost 
a bridge in Bathurst, New Brunswick, about 10 months ago which 
had been owned and maintained by CN.  The federal government had 
also been involved with the bridge.  It was on one of the busiest 
streets in Bathurst and now everyone must go around it.  This has 
forced businesses to close.  We lost CN in Bathurst because of 
privatization.  The government has simply washed its hands and 
said it has nothing to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
He has had more than 20 years of experience in parliament and has 
seen privatization coming all along.  I am sure he has seen other 
cases where Liberals were involved in privatization after leaving 
politics.  Does he wonder whether they are doing it in the best 
interest of Canadians or the best interest of their own pockets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
newly privatized companies, not just in Canada but around the 
world, are rife with former government officials.  They tend to 
move into sectors which have been privatized and are doing very 
well in terms of shares, stocks, contracts or whatnot.  None of 
that is necessarily illegal but it does raise questions about 
what the agenda really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are plenty of examples, both provincial and federal, which 
arouse the well founded suspicion, shall we say, that while it is 
done partly out of ideological fixation it is also done to serve 
the interest of certain friends of the government who are doing 
the privatizing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a problem right now because of our very low 
dollar.  The business of the country is for sale at bargain 
basement prices on the international market, so it is a problem 
indeed. 
One thing the bill deals with is privatization, and I believe it 
includes elements of the Petro-Canada deal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke will recall that it was a number 
of years ago that Petro-Canada was created.  I do not know 
whether he was in the House at the time.  As part of the bill we 
are now divesting ourselves of Petro-Canada.  I would like to 
know whether the hon. member supported a nationalized oil company 
at the time and whether he supports the part of the bill that 
would now get rid of it.  How far would he take the 
nationalization of these industries?  Would he encourage Canada 
to gain control of all its major oil companies?  How far would he 
take it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a bill to divest 
the last vestiges of government ownership in Petro-Canada.  If 
the member knew his history he would know that the NDP was 
instrumental to the formation of Petro-Canada.  It was one of 
things the NDP leader, David Lewis, and his caucus pressed for in 
the minority parliament of 1972 to 1974.  Petro-Canada came into 
being shortly thereafter and perhaps even during the life of that 
minority parliament the groundwork was laid for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had always felt it was a good idea to have a publicly owned 
oil corporation but we were not always happy with the way the 
Liberals ran it.  Over time the Liberals gave public ownership a 
bad name.  All too often they saw it as an opportunity for 
patronage rather than a chance to do something better than could 
be done by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we therefore had, along with others who saw 
a role for public ownership in certain sectors, was that the 
Liberal Party of Canada gave public ownership a bad name.  It 
became something we wanted to defend in principle but not always 
in practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still think a measure of public ownership in the oil industry 
would be a good idea.  That is why we have opposed the 
privatization of Petro-Canada.  However Petro-Canada was not 
created through nationalization as the member suggests.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House 
on second reading of Bill C-6, an act to amend the International 
Boundary Waters Treaty Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians recognize that water is a natural resource unlike 
any other.  It plays a key role in every aspect of our daily 
lives: at home, at work and many other places or occasions.  A 
bountiful supply of fresh, clean water is the basis for much of 
Canada's economic and agricultural development, and the towns 
and cities of our nation. 
Last, but certainly not least, it plays an absolutely critical 
role in ensuring the continued health of Canada's ecosystems, 
and every living thing that depends on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians look to all levels of government to take action now to 
protect Canada's water.  We must ensure that our children and 
grandchildren inherit a Canada in which our freshwater resources 
are secure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades Canadians and the Government of Canada have given a 
consistent response to extravagant schemes to redirect the waters 
of the North American continent:  Canada's water is not for sale. 
Many such designs have involved the Great Lakes, which contain 
20% of the world's fresh water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking action now.  Bill C-6 would protect 
boundary waters, including the critical resource of the Great 
Lakes, from bulk removal under federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing act implements the 1909 Canada-U.S. boundary waters 
treaty.  It is one of our oldest treaties and a landmark in 
Canada-U.S. relations.  With over 300 lakes and rivers along the 
Canada-U.S. border, the drafters of the treaty recognized the 
critical role played by water and the importance of providing a 
structure and mechanism to prevent and resolve disputes between 
the two countries.  Ninety-two years later we are using the same 
mechanism to ensure these waters will be protected for future 
generations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act 
in Bill C-6 are based first on Canada's treaty obligation to the 
U.S. not to take actions in Canada which affect levels and flows 
of boundary waters on the U.S. side of the border.  I would note 
that the U.S. has the same obligation to Canada, that is, not to 
take actions in the U.S. which affect levels and flows of 
boundary waters on the Canadian side of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments also have a second objective, to protect the 
integrity of boundary water ecosystems.  The amendments have 
three key elements: a prohibition provision; a licencing regime; 
and, sanctions and penalties. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prohibition provision imposes a prohibition on the bulk 
removal of boundary waters from the water basins.  Exceptions 
will be considered for ballast water, short term humanitarian 
purposes and water used in the production of food or beverages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many boundary waters along the Canada-U.S. border are 
affected by the prohibition, the main focus would be on the Great 
Lakes.  This would enable Canada to stop future plans for bulk 
water removal from the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be a licensing regime separate from the amendments 
dealing with prohibition.  Licences would cover dams and other 
projects in Canada that obstruct boundary and transboundary 
waters if they affect the natural level and flow of water on the 
other side of the boundary.  Under the treaty such projects must 
have the approval of the International Joint Commission and the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of approving such projects has taken place under the 
general authority of the treaty for the past 92 years without any 
problems.  In essence the process would not change except that it 
would now be formalized in a licensing system.  The licensing 
regime would not cover bulk water removal projects.  These, if 
proposed, would be covered by the act's prohibition provision.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will also allow for clear and strong sanctions and 
penalties.  This will give teeth to the prohibition and ensure 
Canada is in the position to enforce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to set Bill C-6 in the general context of 
Canada's strategy announced on February 10, 1999, to prohibit 
bulk removal of water out of all major Canadian water basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Government of Canada take this initiative? The 
removal and transfer of water in bulk out of a water basin may 
result in irreversible ecological, social and economic impacts. 
We want to ensure, for future generations of Canadians, the 
security of our freshwater resources and the integrity of our 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, any credible policy approach to the issue of bulk water 
removal must address two important elements.  First, the 
management of Canadian waters involves multiple jurisdictions. 
Second, any approach should take into consideration the many 
factors, man-made and natural, which exert significant stresses 
on our water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pretend that one government can solve the issue with a wave 
of the legislative wand, or that the issue may be simply reduced 
to one aspect, such as “water export”, in the words of some 
critics, is unrealistic, ineffective and undermines the goal we 
all share. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flowing water does not respect political boundaries.  In the 
case of the Great Lakes system, two federal governments, eight 
state governments, two provincial governments and a number of 
regional and binational organizations are involved in managing 
and protecting freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of bulk water removal involves the significant 
pressure and uncertainty of removals, diversions, consumption, 
population and economic growth, and the effects of climate change 
and variability.  Finally, we must factor in the important 
influence of the cumulative effect of all these factors on our 
water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All levels of government must act effectively and in concert 
with their respective jurisdictions, hence Canada's February 1999 
initiative included three parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canada would act within its jurisdiction.  Bill C-6 
fulfils this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the recognition of the primary responsibility of 
provinces and territories for water management.  The Minister of 
the Environment proposed a Canada-wide accord to prohibit bulk 
water removal out of major Canadian water basins.  As of today 
all provinces have put into place or are developing legislation 
and policies to prohibit bulk water removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Canada and the United States agreed on a reference to the 
International Joint Commission to investigate and make 
recommendations on consumptive uses, diversions and removals in 
the Great Lakes, the greatest of our shared waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IJC in its February 2000 final report concluded that the 
Great Lakes require protection from bulk water removals and other 
factors.  Bill C-6 is consistent with and supportive of the IJC's 
conclusions and recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is self-evident that we must work closely with U.S. 
jurisdictions, both federal and state, to ensure that the 
regimes on both sides of the border are as consistent and 
restrictive as possible.  In the years ahead, the Boundary 
Waters Treaty will remain a critical instrument in protecting 
Canada's rights on the Great Lakes and other boundary and 
transboundary waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the eight Great Lakes states, and Ontario and Quebec, have 
been working for over a year on the development of common 
standards to manage bulk water removal on the Great Lakes. 
The draft plan, unveiled for public comment in December 2000 by 
the Council of Great Lakes Governors, attracted a good deal of 
criticism in both the U.S. and Canada as being too lax.  The 
Government of Canada shared these concerns and made its views 
known.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month Ontario and New York State announced that 
they could not support the proposed standard.  In future 
discussions we will urge these governments to consider seriously 
the recommendations contained in the IJC report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adopting Bill C-6 parliament would set down in law an 
unambiguous prohibition on bulk water removal in waters under 
federal jurisdiction and especially in the Great Lakes.  This is 
a forward looking action which places the highest priority on 
ensuring the security of Canada's fresh water resources.  It 
demonstrates leadership at the federal level.  It affirms an 
approach which is comprehensive, environmentally sound, 
respectful of constitutional responsibilities and consistent with 
Canada's international trade obligations.  I urge all members to 
give their support to Bill C-6. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to join with my colleague, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, in speaking to Bill C-6. The 
protection of freshwater is a global as well as a major national 
responsibility.  Canadians are deeply concerned about the long 
term security and quality of our freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are concerns for Canada's freshwater on a number of fronts 
ranging from the safety of our drinking water, and I remind 
everyone of the problem of Walkerton, to pollution, to floods and 
droughts, and to the potential impact of climate change on the 
future availability on our freshwater resources.  We are working 
with the provinces, the territories and internationally to ensure 
that these and other issues are addressed and that Canada's water 
is protected and conserved for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June my provincial and territorial counterparts and I 
agreed that we all share the common objective to ensure a clean, 
safe and secure water supply for our country.  In meeting those 
objectives all orders of government, whether territorial, 
provincial or federal, and all Canadians have roles to play. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the issues of concern to Canadians is the possibility of 
removing and exporting large quantities of water from Canadian 
watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999, the government announced a three part strategy 
to prohibit the bulk removal of water from large Canadian 
watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about protecting wildlife, we also want to protect 
watersheds. The strategy recognizes that the safest and most 
effective way of protecting Canada's water resources is through 
an environmental approach enabling us to preserve our freshwater 
in its natural state, and not through an approach based on trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to turn off the tap at the source, not at the 
border. The bulk removal and transfer of freshwater from lakes, 
rivers and aquifers can have profound environmental, social and 
economic effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could witness the introduction of parasites, diseases and 
harmful non native species, the deterioration of ecosystems and 
the disruption of communities that rely on a natural water supply 
from a watershed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact is the same whether the water is destined for foreign 
markets or other places in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are already informed of these matters based on 
experience with project effects of all kinds.  To cite one 
instance, we continue to oppose the Garrison diversion in North 
Dakota on the basis that it would introduce non-native or 
invasive biota and pathogens from the Missouri system across the 
continent's divide to the Hudson Bay watershed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 covers one of the three elements outlined in the 
government's strategy that I announced in February 1999.  I 
therefore strongly support the bill introduced by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs as one component of the federal strategy on bulk 
water removals, which is intended to cover all of Canada's water 
resources and at the same time respect the shared jurisdiction in 
Canada over water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act 
would give the federal government the legislative authority 
needed to prohibit bulk removals from the boundary waters shared 
with the United States, principally in the Great Lakes, but also 
on the New Brunswick-Maine boundary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the issue of removing water in bulk from watersheds is a 
complex one and the consequences can be wide ranging.  These 
amendments are a key tool for assisting us in working with our 
American partners to protect the ecosystems in and around the 
Great Lakes which we share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freshwater is the glue that sustains the health of the 
environment, and if we change conditions in the water we risk 
irreversible damage to our North American ecosystems. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the federal government has chosen an environmental 
approach to deal with this issue. It has to be a cautious 
approach based on objective scientific principles and an 
integrated response, taking into account the fact that it is a 
shared resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, we must ask ourselves some important 
questions regarding the long term effects of bulk water removal, 
particularly in light of the cumulative impact of such a practice 
and the potential changes in the distribution and abundance of 
water as a result of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for better quality information brings me to the second 
component of the Canadian strategy on bulk water removals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We requested, with the United States, to have the International 
Joint Commission study how water consumption, removal and 
diversions could affect the Great Lakes.  Our objective here is 
to provide a basis for ensuring a consistent management regime 
for water shared with our American friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 the International Joint Commission presented its 
final report to the Canadian-U.S. governments entitled 
“Protection of the waters of the Great Lakes”.  The report is 
entirely consistent with and reinforces the federal strategy to 
prohibit bulk water removals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission concluded that international 
trade law does not prevent Canada and the United States from 
taking measures to protect their water resources and preserve the 
integrity of the Great Lakes.  To those watching or to those in 
Canada concerned about the issue of the exportation of water, I 
urge them to read the International Joint Commission report. They 
will find material there of great interest with respect to trade 
law and water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the third element of our strategy which is the 
development of an accord with the provinces and territories to 
prohibit the bulk removal of water from major drainage basins of 
our watershed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every province and territory supports our goal to 
prohibit bulk removals of surface water and groundwater. Most of 
the provinces and territories felt that the agreement was the 
best way to protect our resources and that is why they ratified 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I am pleased to say that all of the provinces have 
passed or are about to pass legislation and regulations 
prohibiting bulk water removals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a high level of commitment guarantees that no bulk water 
removal or export project will be carried out in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, Canada's environmental approach, which is to prohibit 
the bulk removal or transfer of water from its watersheds, is 
the best way to protect Canadian water resources.

not international trade tribunals, will be able to decide how 
our waters should be managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is running out, I will not go on with the speech I 
have prepared, but I do want to emphasize that Bill C-6 must 
come into effect as soon as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law is for Canadians a major indication of our commitment 
as a parliament and of the commitment of the government as the 
government of the country in the direction that we wish to go to 
protect our waters.

of donors and potential recipients.  Third, it needs to implement 
mandatory reporting of all brain deaths.  Fourth, all living 
donors must have access to EI.  Fifth, donor co-ordinators are 
needed in all hospitals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, this 
is National Organ Donor Awareness Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Becoming a tissue or organ donor is an important personal 
decision we need to discuss with family and friends.  What we 
need to keep in mind during that process is that by agreeing to 
be an organ donor, we can one day provide the gift of life to 
someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organ donation has not, unfortunately, always been a tradition 
here in Canada as it has in most other industrialized western 
countries. 
That is why 150 of the 3,500 or so people on waiting lists for 
organ transplants die every day for lack of an organ.  Yet in 
this country we have access to the best transplantation 
technologies in the world, and to top-flight surgeons.  What we 
lack is the needed organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National Organ Donor Awareness Week is a time for each of us to 
think about becoming a donor, to learn more about it, and to 
make a decision—

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this syndrome is incurable but preventable, and 
therefore it is timely that today the Government of Canada 
launched a new tool in the fight to prevent fetal alcohol

officials so that they may better understand the dangerous 
consequences of drinking during pregnancy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to make this statement during Organ Donor Awareness Week. 
I have the longest living kidney transplant recipient living in 
my hometown and have seen the lifelong benefits of organ 
donation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 3,700 Canadians are awaiting organ transplants.  Last 
year alone 147 Canadians died while waiting for organs.  Canada 
has one of the lowest organ donation rates among industrialized 
nations, with fewer than 14 donors per million people in this 
country compared to more than 31 in Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national organ donor awareness program would hopefully 
increase donations in Canada, but a national organ donor registry 
would be a further lifesaving measure for those awaiting 
transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventing disease and injury is important.  Quality treatment 
of illness and injury is important.  Organ donors and a registry 
are the key to life for those less fortunate.  I urge Canadians 
to become donors.  I urge the government to bring forth a 
national tissue and organ donor registry program.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas 1997 statistics show that 59% of single women aged 65

supplement;

men and whereas there are therefore more senior women than 
senior men living in poverty; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas the income of these senior women living in poverty 
barely covers their basic living needs; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cercles de fermières du Québec recommend to the Department

million litres of raw sewage flow into the St. John's harbour

Canada”.

economic growth.

minister has consistently said that the government will do the 
right thing at the right time.  We have the largest stimulus in 
Canadian history working its way through the economy.   If we 
look at the Canadian tax cuts and the provincial tax cuts, it is 
almost 2% of GDP.  Let us give that a chance to go through the 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the astronomical profits of oil companies continue to soar, 
Quebecers are paying too much for their gasoline. On Friday, the 
price of gas even climbed to 89.9 cents in Montreal, because the 
federal government refuses to take its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of being satisfied with the pro-oil company study which 
the conference board was commissioned to produce, will the

the Competition Act to help consumers?

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, both the federal government and indeed many of the 
provincial governments all across Canada have, at one time or 
another, conducted investigations into gas pricing in Canada. 
Almost all these investigations have come to the conclusion that 
there is no collusion in the setting of prices of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member has any evidence of that or wants to suggest that 
to the House, I would ask that he refer that information to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister may be the only one who does not see the collusion. If 
the minister thinks it is a coincidence when prices for a litre 
suddenly jump from 80 cents to 89 cents, he must still believe 
in Cinderella. There is a minor problem: it is not a 
coincidence, it is collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister realize that the time has come to review the 
Competition Act to give it more teeth? If they cannot find 
evidence of collusion, it is not because there is no collusion, 
it is because the act is not adequate to prove that there is.

who are doubly penalized.

proper marketplace forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any indication at all of improper collusion, then of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  It has to do 
with the Prime Minister's commitment to President Bush with 
respect to the development of the tar sands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment will know that the development 
of the tar sands itself produces emissions.  It is not just 
emissions produced from burning the product of the tar sands but 
developing the tar sands itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that all Canadian governments have been committed 
ever since the Brundtland report to doing environmental 
assessment of major policy announcements, has there been an 
environmental assessment done of the emissions that would be 
created by the development of the tar sands?  If there has not, 
will the government commit to doing such an environmental 
assessment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can confirm for the hon. member that we have, 
since the beginning of the development of the tar sands, had 
ongoing analysis of environmental issues including, of course, 
emission of greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member though that the Prime Minister 
has made no commitment with respect to any particular energy 
source.  It may be that Canada will be providing low emission 
Canadian gas which might in the United States substitute for high 
emission American coal, which would be very beneficial for 
climate change purposes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the Minister of the Environment would be 
willing to make a commitment that should development of the tar 
sands proceed that there will be just such an environmental 
assessment, that is to say, of all the greenhouse gas emissions 
that would be created by the development of the tar sands itself. 
Some people have estimated it would be the equivalent of putting 
millions of extra cars on the streets so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister could make the commitment that kind of 
environmental assessment would be done not only for its own sake 
but in keeping with our commitment to the Kyoto protocol. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I can confirm for the hon. member that 
we do studies of that type whenever there is a proposal to 
increase production from any area.  It will take place if there 
are proposals put forward by industry to develop tar sands to a 
greater degree than they are currently developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply point out to the hon. member that we are simply 
following the existing law of the land with respect to impacts, 
which I believe is adequate.  I certainly have heard nothing from 
him to suggest it is inadequate.  I thank him, however, for his 
concern and representation that the law of Canada should be

Canada's steel industry from the impact of illegal dumping, 
thousands of jobs at Algoma Steel in Ontario and other Canadian

I just sent over a newspaper article to the Minister of Health 
that reads “Hepatitis `C' victim dying in red tape”.  There is 
a quote that says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe we will all be dead by the time this goes 
through unless a miracle happens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quote is by Charles McLean who contracted hep C through a 
blood transfusion while undergoing prostate surgery in 1987.  He 
is a class 5 victim.  He was approved for $125,000.  A year later 
he still has not received a cent and has lost his health, his 
career and his money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to tell us today that he will take 
whatever action is necessary—

I thank the hon. member for his courtesy in raising this with my 
office and with me in advance of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that this program is not administered by Health 
Canada.  The court has appointed an arm's length administrator 
who is responsible.  However, I share the frustration of the hon. 
member.  I share the frustration of those who are entitled to 
money and who are not getting it.  I have already written to the 
joint committee to express that frustration.  I am working with 
that office and with the member's office to see what information 
we can get about this and other cases.  We will continue to work 
to make sure these people get the money they are due.

the debate after the speech from our colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any time, we will commence the second reading of 
Bill C-25, the farm credit amendments bill.  It would be my 
intention as well to adjourn the debate after the lead off speech 
from either the government minister or parliamentary secretary, 
as the case may be.  We would then propose to move immediately to 
private members' business this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Friday we will debate second reading of Bill C-26, the tobacco 
tax legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday we will return to Bill C-6, which will not be 
completed this afternoon.  We will then continue with Bill C-25 
for the same reason, and then, if necessary, to Bill C-26, the 
tobacco tax legislation, if we do not complete it tomorrow.  If 
we have any time left, it will be spent on Bill C-10, the marine 
parks bill, as I previously indicated to my colleagues at the 
House leaders meeting earlier this week.  In the afternoon we 
will debate Bill C-16, the charities bill.  I wish to give notice 
pursuant to Standing Order 73(1) that the government will propose 
that this bill will be referred to committee before second 
reading.  This should, in essence, take roughly the time between 
3.00 p.m. and the adjournment later in the afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuesday shall be an allotted day.  In the evening it is my 
intention to seek the usual co-operation to hold the second of 
the take note debates on the modernization of House rules.  It 
would be pursuant to consultation with others.  My intention is 
to see if we want to have this debate using the forum we used 
very successfully earlier this week, but, as I said, I intend to 
consult with other House leaders on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday I would propose that we continue with any 
unfinished business from the previous days, adding thereto Bill 
S-16 which was introduced in the House earlier this day.  Should 
we be ready to do so, and should time permit, I would then 
commence the report stage and third reading of Bill C-22, the 
income tax amendments bill.

place among all parties and I believe you would find consent for 
that if a recorded division is requested Monday, April 30 on a 
motion to refer Bill C-16 to committee before second reading, 
pursuant to Standing Order 73(1) it shall be deemed deferred 
until the end of government orders on Tuesday, May 1.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of the Environment spoke on the bill this 
afternoon he came out very strongly and proudly, with his thumbs 
pounding, stating that his government has acted decisively to 
address the concerns of Canadians in reference to the export of 
water.  He proudly said that the bill would stop the export of 
water and fulfill the commitment made to Canadians about the 
export of water.  He went on to say that his government was 
putting a tremendous amount of priority on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised.  I would like explain to those who are 
listening to my speech today what the bill amounts to and what 
the Liberal government has not done for our water.  It is still 
hanging out in limbo because of the inability of the government 
to address the issue seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that it put a priority on the bill.  I spoke 
to the bill in the 36th parliament.  It was the last bill that 
was presented to parliament.  I made a speech and thereafter the 
bill was off the table because the government had another agenda. 
It did not care about that agenda.  It wanted to get re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, because the government has no vision for the next three 
or four years and needs to do some housekeeping, it brings back 
this bill because there is nothing else on its agenda.  Now it is 
saying that it is committed to stopping the export of water and 
that it is committed to this bill.   What a contradictory 
statement and action that has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15, as the water bill was called in the 36th parliament, 
came up for debate during one of the final days leading up to the 
election, as I mentioned.  The bill was debated only for one day 
and then disappeared.  I think that shows the importance the 
government places on protecting Canada's waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, water is an issue that touches the lives of all 
Canadians as it is part of our Canadian heritage.  Canadians are 
very concerned by the thought of losing control of our freshwater 
resources.  It is a legitimate concern because a thirsty world 
will sooner or later turn its attention to our lost freshwater 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, water export was never supposed to be an issue in 
Canada.  A number of federal politicians in the early 1990s 
claimed that Canada had a sovereign right to manage its own water 
and that water would never be challenged under any international 
agreement.  Unfortunately, this has proven to be false and the 
water issue is back on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is on the record as saying that NAFTA 
should be amended to prohibit bulk water exports.  Had the 
Liberals kept their promise, Canadians would not have to worry 
about the issue of bulk water export and we would certainly not 
be discussing this matter today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of its promise, this government signed the NAFTA deal 
without a side agreement on water.  Raw logs and unprocessed fish 
were exempted from NAFTA but the best arrangement Canada could 
get on water was the following side deal signed on December 2, 
1993, by Canada, the U.S.A. and Mexico.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of any 
party of the agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, this side deal is of little legal value because 
unless water in any form has entered into commerce and become a 
good or product it is not covered by the provisions of any trade 
agreement, including NAFTA. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in NAFTA obliges any NAFTA party to either exploit its 
water for commercial use or to begin exporting water in any form. 
Water in its natural state in lakes, reservoirs, water basins and 
the like is not a good or a product.  It is not traded and 
therefore is not and never has been subject to the terms of any 
trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This side agreement worked as long as Canada never allowed water 
to enter into commerce and become a good or a product.  Let me 
repeat that:  this side agreement worked as long as Canada never 
allowed water to enter into commerce and become a good or a 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with the exception of international boundary waters, 
the vast majority of water in its natural state is owned and 
managed by the province.  It is a provincial responsibility to 
manage the resource carefully, just as a province manages its 
forests and its oil and gas.  If one of the provinces enters the 
business of tendering contracts to export bulk water, it must, 
according to chapter 11 of NAFTA, treat Canadian, American and 
Mexican companies in a similar fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National treatment provisions give the right to all corporations 
of our NAFTA partners to help themselves to our water the moment 
any Canadian company is given an export permit.  If any Canadian 
company is given an export permit by a province, because it is a 
provincial resource, then it falls under NAFTA where we have to 
treat the Americans and the Mexicans in the same manner.  Now 
that we are going into FTAA agreements which will be coming up in 
the next five years, I hope that the government will have water 
exempted.  Otherwise we will be facing the same difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact water is not exempt from NAFTA, as I said.  Once water 
starts being shipped, either the government is powerless to stop 
it or, if it does, the government would have to compensate for 
the lost income under the investor state provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not have the foresight to think that some 
provinces might one day look into the possibility of licensing 
the export of water, but recent examples show us the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the province of Newfoundland granted an export permit to 
McCurdy Enterprises Ltd. to export water from Gisborne Lake. 
Second, in Ontario the Nova Group received a licence to extract 
water from Lake Superior.  Finally, in British Columbia, Sun 
Belt, a Californian company that wanted to export water from 
B.C., is now demanding up to $10.5 billion in damages from the 
federal and B.C. governments alleging that its rights under NAFTA 
have been violated.  Sun Belt is demanding restoration of a water 
export licence that the B.C. government cancelled in 1991 as well 
as compensation for lost business opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the provinces eventually pulled out of these proposals, 
they renewed the fears about water export and the impact of our 
trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, having failed to protect Canadian sovereignty 
over water during the NAFTA negotiations, is now proposing a 
backup solution.  Bill C-6 proposes to prohibit bulk water 
removal out of the boundary waters between Canada and the U.S.A., 
which covers only 15% of Canada's water resources.  The provinces 
manage the remaining 85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I meant when I said I do not understand the 
Minister of the Environment when he talks about stopping bulk 
water export.  His bill would cover only 15% of Canada's water 
resources.  That is fine.  I hope he will tell Canadians that it 
would cover only 15%. 
The government should not say that the bill would address the 
issue about water resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, 85% of the water resource is held by the provinces. 
They control it.  It is their natural resource.  It is not 
controlled by the federal government.  If any province so desires 
to sell water from its basins, from its lakes, then suddenly we 
have a federal government that is powerless.  It can run to the 
provinces but the provinces can tell the federal government no. 
They can say they want to sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right.  It is theirs.  Canadians demand that 
right.  However, the government failed to remove water from NAFTA 
as it had promised in the election platform, because it failed to 
renegotiate NAFTA and get water out of NAFTA and have it 
exempted.  It was the right only of Canadians to say yes if they 
wanted to export water.  Now we have this jurisdictional problem 
with the federal government practically unable to have any teeth 
to stop bulk water export for 85% of our water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to have a Canada wide accord to 
prohibit bulk water removal.  It has recognized this problem so 
it is trying to get a Canada wide accord to prohibit the removal 
of bulk water.  The problem is, as I have just mentioned, that 
five provinces have refused to endorse the accord, leaving the 
country's water vulnerable to exportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal strategy was designed in the belief that all 
provinces would agree on a national ban.  It is quite obvious, 
after the two day debate in Kananaskis in Alberta in November 
1999, that the government has failed to achieve this goal.  The 
parties could not come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to note that the bill deliberately avoids 
the term export.  With good reason, the Liberals fear that the 
term export will imply that water is a commercial good.  What the 
absence of the term export really means is that water was in fact 
part of the negotiations during the NAFTA talks and nothing was 
done.  That is one thing the government should admit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now we can say yes or no, but we have lost the 
right for only Canadians to say yes.  What I mean by that is what 
I just emphasized, that is, under NAFTA if water is exported 
because it is not exempted that gives the opportunity to allow 
opening up the doors to American and Mexican companies to come 
and export our water.  This is the real fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have lost the right to say yes to this precious 
resource.  Whether they want to export or do not want to export, 
this should be a right that should remain with Canadians.  They 
can decide whether they wish to export water.  They can decide 
whether they want or do not want to export water as a natural 
resource, or whether under certain conditions they want to or do 
not want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many options we can use.  Some small communities may 
want to do it as part of an economic reason and we can do so if 
it does not damage the environment.  However, this right should 
be the right of Canadians.  We have lost that right because the 
government failed in its election promise to remove water from 
NAFTA.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 while the government was busy signing away our 
sovereignty over water, the Canadian Alliance made a specific 
statement on the protection of our freshwater.  The Canadian 
Alliance stated that exclusive and unrestricted control of water 
in all its forms should be maintained by and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada possess about 9% of the world's renewable resources and 
20% of the world's total freshwater resources.  This includes 
water captured in glaciers and polar ice caps.  Protection of our 
sovereignty over this valuable resource is critical to Canadians 
and to our national identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that Canadians should retain 
control over our water resources and supports exempting water 
from our international agreements, including NAFTA.  An outright 
ban on water exports could run contrary to our NAFTA commitment 
because water was not exempt from that agreement.  Therefore, a 
side agreement would have to be negotiated which would exempt 
water from NAFTA before a ban on water exports could even be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until an exemption is achieved, we encourage the provinces to 
place a moratorium on commercial water licensing so that water in 
bulk form never becomes a good governed by NAFTA rules.  Once an 
exemption from NAFTA is in place, the decision to export water in 
bulk should rest with the provinces who own the resources.  That 
means once the decision is given to the provinces, which are 
elected governments, it is up to Canadians to decide what to do 
with water.  They can decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize again that we are heading into an FTAA 
agreement.  The Quebec summit chose that path and the Alliance 
supports it.  We think that if it is handled correctly, free 
trade will bring prosperity.  However, there are always dangers 
when we sign blindly, as we have found out now with this water 
issue.  No long term thought was given to this.  When it was 
signed, no thought was given to what would happen if the 
provinces said no.  No thought was given to the fact that the 
government was signing an international agreement on one of the 
most important resources we have, a resource controlled by the 
provinces.  Its strategy, which was to have a total ban by 
convincing the provinces to do so, has failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the 1999 Kananaskis meeting clearly showed that 
the provinces were not on board with the federal government on 
this issue.  They wanted the right to do whatever they wanted to 
with a natural resource that they feel is their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of exempting water from NAFTA, the Canadian 
Alliance will support the bill.  We will support it because it 
represents the only viable approach the federal government can 
take and the only constitutionally valid NAFTA compatible ban on 
bulk water export that can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has indicated quite clearly that it 
favours a ban on water export.  All export of water should be 
done by Canadians only.  Since the ban is not there, the Canadian 
Alliance feels that the bill would in some degree ensure that 
water is not taken away from the international boundaries basins, 
and it is a NAFTA compatible ban on bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to see the government propose real answers 
to this issue and show some leadership in exempting water from 
our trade agreements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hoping today that the Minister of the Environment or the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, when they presented the bill and 
talked about the commitment of the government not to export 
water, would listen to Canadians.  In reality they failed to say 
that the bill was only dealing with 15% of the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government takes the initiative and try to get water 
exempted from other trade agreements.  It would have been 
preferable to exempt water from NAFTA but, failing that, Bill C-6 
will have to do as second best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should realize that we no longer have sovereignty over 
our water.  We have that threat over our heads because of our 
international trade agreement called NAFTA and the failure of the 
government to take water out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Future generations would also lose sovereignty over water if 
something is not done to change this.  That is why the government 
should do something.  Bill C-6 or not, the bottom line is that 
Canada's water resources are vulnerable to exportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am a strong supporter of free trade, I believe it should 
not come at the expense of our sovereignty over water.  Perhaps 
one day Canada will decide to export water if it is proven 
environmentally sound.  If that ever happens, and I strongly 
stress if, the tap should belong to Canadians only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will be supporting Bill C-6.  However I 
re-emphasize that the federal government should work with the 
provinces now to ensure that water does not become an export 
commodity.  It should try to get water exempted from our 
international trade agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first I 
will say that the Bloc Quebecois will not support Bill C-6 as 
introduced, not because we are opposed to the basic principle of 
the bill, which is to prohibit bulk water exports to other 
countries as well as bulk water transfers within the country, 
but for a very simple reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural resource management is the provinces' responsibility. 
Each province is responsible for managing its own water 
resources, which belong to its residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about a lot of things with regard to Bill C-6. For 
example, we can talk about groundwater. We already know that the 
drawing of water by certain companies in some regions of Canada 
creates problems for agriculture with soils and wells, as well 
as problems for residents of the area where underground water is 
being drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we had problems in some regions in Quebec. People 
complained and some companies had to stop drawing water in 
certain areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other major element for us in Quebec is that when we are 
talking about boundary waters we are obviously talking about 
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The St. Lawrence 
River flows across Quebec and its importance is well known. For 
the past several years, especially in certain areas such as Lake 
Champlain and the lakes around the St. Lawrence, water levels 
have dropped so dramatically that shipping may be at risk. 
Therefore it is extremely important for us to be able to 
conserve and manage as we see fit this resource which belongs to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue. 
When we talk about bulk water exports we should remember that 
it might involve not small quantities, but huge quantities of 
water. Currently there is no treaty to really protect us 
against bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, in view of the problems that were occurring 
especially in the southern United States, there was already talk 
here in Canada about the possibility of exporting water in bulk 
through a pipeline carrying water from the north, namely Canada, 
to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major point and I am not sure that as a country we 
would be better protected by Bill C-6. I am not sure that in the 
future Bill C-6 will make it impossible to export bulk water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision this government should have for the future in 
agreement with the provinces and while staying out of their 
areas of jurisdiction should be to legislate a true ban 
supported by international treaties, which would provide us with 
a real protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pressure to export water will increase in the future. The 
pressure will increase in view of the water shortage in some 
countries, especially the United States, our southern 
neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the danger if water is misused or if we try to export 
it is that it will result in the desertification of certain 
areas and harm crops and agriculture in a big way. As we know, 
some western provinces are already experiencing problems with 
soil erosion and desertification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely 15 or 20 years ago a Senate committee published a report 
on this. 
It dealt with desertification of soils in the western provinces, 
particularly due to a lack of water, a lack of rain and climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important element that has an impact on the 
quantity and quality of our water resources is the gradual 
disappearance of our forests. They play a role in terms of water 
retention, cleaning the rain so to speak, and they are essential 
to the health of our lakes and rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the dangers of shipping. In Canada we do 
not have any real protection with regard to shipping, including 
on the St. Lawrence River, and we should not pretend that we do. 
We could be the victims of a major disaster considering the 
number of ships that go up the St. Lawrence River every day and 
the type of products some of them carry. 
Once they have reached the Great Lakes these products are then 
delivered to major industrial centres in the United States such 
as Detroit and Chicago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that Quebec has always been a leader in 
the area of water treatment. I remember that in 1978, 
Marcel Léger, then minister of the environment, proposed to 
the government of Quebec a water cleanup program in which the 
government invested some $12 billion over the years. We were very 
much ahead of our time; we were visionaries so to speak.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1980s, when I was mayor of my home town and we were 
looking at cleaning up our waters, we figured that it would cost 
us about $2.8 million. People thought we were crazy  because we 
wanted to clean up our waters, protect our drinking water and 
clean the water before we would send it back into nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time we were concerned about the pollution of our 
municipal sources of drinking water and even private sources of 
drinking water in some areas. It was a serious problem and still 
is, as we have seen recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our drinking water supply is still in danger. We still have a 
lot of work to do to ensure that municipalities can provide 
quality drinking water to all Quebecers and Canadians. Consumer 
confidence is not what it used to be. That is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the bottled water industry is expanding and people no 
longer trust their own drinking water supply systems. They would 
rather drink bottled water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an expanding market that some businesses would like to 
take over. We are talking about bottled water and not 
bulk water removal, but still bottled water export could set a 
precedent that would eventually open the door to bulk water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When bulk water exports are involved consideration must also be 
given to the effects on our ecosystems, the economy and people's 
lives.  Water, we will all agree, is vital to life and essential 
for humans, for all ecosystems, for animals, for nature and for 
our environment.  It is an essential element.  It is a resource 
that belongs to the community, and the community therefore needs 
assurance that we are protecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely vital that bulk water exports be banned, as the 
bill states.  However agreement would first have to be reached 
on the principle of the bill, and we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
not in agreement with it.  Although the protection of water 
resources is vitally important, as it stands Bill C-6 strikes 
us as risky and contrary to the way jurisdictions are divided 
between the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it has considerable potential of encroachment onto 
provincial areas of jurisdiction while not providing any 
additional protection against major water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just experienced the Quebec city summit where 
negotiations were hidden, closed to the public, and civil 
society was denied access.  This same type of negotiation could 
very easily take place in future on water exports, given the 
future needs that are going to develop, particularly with our 
neighbours to the south who as we know are far bigger and far 
stronger economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned the risks to navigation.  This is very 
important to me. The federal government ought to address 
this matter since it is its responsibility, particularly in the 
St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we are not disaster-proof. 
It is entirely possible that one day or other in the St. 
Lawrence catastrophes will occur such as we have seen in Europe, 
especially in northern Spain and northern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would really be a major catastrophe and could affect an 
entire population, nearly 7 million people in Quebec, living in 
large part on the shores of the St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water represents an inestimable resource for humans. It is 
commonplace, as I said earlier, to want to protect its export. We 
have to remember that water has great potential in export terms 
and the demand will increase.  It is vital to prevent its export.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced in early 2000 that it intended 
to intervene more directly in the matter of water export and 
introduced a three pronged strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy follows from a motion passed in the House of 
Commons on water protection, which was introduced on February 9, 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three parts to the strategy: changes to the 
International Boundary Waters Treaty Act in order to give the 
federal government regulatory powers over bulk removal of 
boundary waters; a joint reference with the United States to 
the International Joint Commission to investigate the effects of 
consumption, diversions and removals including those for export 
purposes in boundary waters; and a proposal to develop, in 
co-operation with the provinces and territories, a Canada-wide 
accord on bulk water removal so as to protect Canadian water 
basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 10, 1999, Canada and the United States appointed the 
International Joint Commission. 
After noting a growing number of proposals to export water from 
the Great Lakes and other areas of the U.S. and Canada, the two 
countries agreed to ask the commission to study the question and 
make recommendations within the next year. An interim report was 
presented on August 18, 1999, and the commission presented its 
final report on February 22, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In it's interim report the International Joint Commission 
recommended that during the six months it would need to 
complete its study the federal and provincial governments and 
the American states not authorize any removal or large scale 
sale of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It pointed out a number of things that warrant mentioning. 
It indicated that there was no surplus in the Great Lakes 
system, that large scale removal of water could limit the 
resilience of the system and that information on the removal of 
underground water was inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point causes problems because, as I said earlier, 
underground waters can have a considerable effect on the 
integrity and quality of ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report pointed out as well that we do not know what the 
demand will be for water in the future. Also, because of the 
possible climate change and other natural considerations, it is 
impossible to assess with any degree of certainty what the level 
and the flow of the Great Lakes will be in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final report, released in February 2000 and entitled 
“Protection of the Waters of the Great Lakes”, the commission 
concluded that we must protect the Great Lakes, particularly in 
light of the cumulative uncertainties, pressures and 
repercussions from water removal and use, demographic and 
economic growth, and climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report includes the following conclusions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water of the Great Lakes is a critical resource. 
On an average annual basis 
less than 1% of the water in the Great Lakes system is 
renewable, which says a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all interests in the basin are considered, there is never a 
surplus of water in the Great Lakes system; every drop of 
water has several potential uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International trade law obligations, including the provisions of 
the Canada—United States Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, WTO 
agreements and the GATT do not prevent Canada and the United 
States from taking measures to protect their water resources and 
preserve the integrity of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that decision makers do not discriminate against 
individuals from other countries in implementing these measures, 
Canada and the United States cannot be forced by trade laws to 
jeopardize the waters of the Great Lakes ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us note, however, as I mentioned earlier, that no such 
agreement may override international treaties.  It will 
therefore be possible to challenge such a measure, i.e. the one 
we have before us, under the treaties which have been signed, 
and these obviously include the FTAA, NAFTA and so forth.  These 
are overriding treaties with respect to this sort of measure to 
protect drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final report the BAPE sums up its conclusions as 
follows.  The overall diagnosis is relatively clear.  The 
current approach to water and aquatic ecosystem management is 
sector based, poorly integrated and not concerned enough with 
protecting the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shift must be made to integrated management practices that 
are more harmonized at the government level, balanced protection 
and enhancement objectives, and be purposely implemented at the 
river basin level. 
Furthermore, action can and must be taken now 
along the lines of the coming policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BAPE's recommendations indicate that the Quebec government 
should approve the proposed policies for protecting and 
conserving groundwater and pass the related regulations, 
provided that projects involving the removal of more than 75 
cubic metres of groundwater a day are subject to the 
environmental impact assessment and review procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 4 explains in particular that the Quebec 
government should make the Water Resources Preservation Act, 
which bans bulk exports of groundwater and surface water, 
permanent legislation.  The commission is of the opinion that 
bulk exports need to be forbidden by law and no chances taken, 
with the uncertainties of international trade agreements such 
as NAFTA, WTO and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In chapter 1.1 of the BAPE report reference is made to the 
federal government's position that NAFTA does not apply to water 
and bulk exports, which is being strongly disputed by a number 
of environmental groups, as the commission points out in its 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>BAPE also explains its position because, before bowing to such a 
request which at first blush is certainly appealing, it feels 
it would be best to examine NAFTA as a whole to determine what 
Canada has to gain and what it has to lose by renegotiating it. 
This goes beyond the mandate of the present commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, what BAPE wants us to understand is that it is very 
risky at this time to undertake a procedure such as the one the 
federal government is embarking on, given the fact that 
international agreements may take precedence over a bill such as 
this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as I have already said, the Bloc Quebecois will 
not be in favour of Bill C-6 for a number of reasons, including 
one major one: the bill encroaches on provincial areas of 
jurisdiction.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FARM CREDIT CORPORATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK190">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-25, an act to amend the Farm Credit 
Corporation Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to begin debate today on 
Bill C-25, an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act.  I am 
proud to introduce the bill as it is important legislation that 
would position the Farm Credit Corporation to meet the needs of 
the agricultural industry today and well into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind anyone in the House that agriculture is 
the backbone of most rural economies in Canada.  Bill C-25 builds 
on the existing Farm Credit Corporation Act of 1993.  It expands 
the depth and scope of services that the corporation is able to 
offer farm families and farm related businesses across rural 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the legislation, the Farm Credit Corporation would help 
more farm families achieve their long term goals.  The 
corporation would assist a greater number of agricultural 
enterprises in creating jobs and economic growth in rural Canada. 
It would have a new name, Farm Credit Canada-Financement agricole 
Canada, to better reflect its federal identity.  FCC would be 
better positioned to contribute to the long term sustainability 
and prosperity of rural communities where farmers live and work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation has a long tradition of anticipating the needs 
of agriculture.  Since 1959 FCC has worked with the industry to 
introduce services to meet its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few years FCC has introduced many new financial 
options that lead the way in meeting emerging requirements. 
It is estimated that up to 120,000 farmers would be retiring over 
the next decade, and that $50 billion in farm assets would change 
hands.  There is a definite need for services that help farm 
families make the transition from one generation to the next, 
just as beginning farmers need help in getting a solid start.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why FCC introduced the agri-start loans in 1998.  These 
loans recognize the marketplace realities young farm families 
face today.  They provide flexible payment options to help young 
farms and young farmers grow their operations through the initial 
development phase.  These options also assist existing farmers to 
pass the farm to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the corporation developed flexi-hog loans.  These 
loans offer flexible payment options to help hog producers 
through the cyclical downturns in their industry.  Earlier this 
year FCC introduced the enviro-loan.  It enables producers to 
upgrade or expand their operations according to the latest 
environmental standards.  FCC has its ear to the ground, 
listening to the needs of producers in the agricultural industry. 
It has its eye on the horizon, anticipating the industry's needs 
in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Farm Credit Corporation Act has served the 
agricultural industry in good stead for nearly a decade.  However 
the marketplace has changed considerably in the past eight years. 
Producers are venturing into new crops and livestock production. 
They are entering into more long term contracts with suppliers 
and buyers.  They are forming alliances with other farmers to 
increase their purchasing and selling power.  Some producers are 
exploring new generation co-operatives.  Others are expanding 
into value added manufacturing to diversify their revenue source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average agricultural operation requires a more complex range 
of financial and business services than could not have been 
foreseen when the act was last amended in 1993.  FCC has played a 
leadership role in meeting these needs.  The corporation is the 
only national financial institution totally dedicated to 
agriculture.  Its slogan “Agriculture, it's all we do” is more 
than a marketing strategy.  It is a statement of fact.  The 
corporation's 900 employees are well recognized for their 
agricultural expertise and most of them come from farming 
backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its network of 100 offices the FCC is able to reach 
producers throughout rural Canada.  All these qualities enable 
the corporation to play an even greater leadership role in 
building the agricultural industry of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first met with the FCC senior executives two years ago to 
explore updating the 1993 act.  I asked the corporation to 
consult with the agricultural and financial associations across 
the country on whether the act should be adjusted to meet 
emerging industry needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the winter 2000, FCC staff met with more than 100 national 
and regional organizations to discuss proposed changes to the 
existing legislation.  The majority of agricultural organizations 
were supportive of the proposals.  They recognized the necessity 
of updating the act to meet the needs of their members and 
producers in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major concern expressed by some farm groups was that the FCC 
keep its focus on family farms and primary production.  Let me 
state without qualification that farming would continue to be the 
main focus and driving force of the corporation.  This commitment 
is built right into the new legislation.  Currently 94% of FCC's 
lending is directed to primary producers.  To demonstrate FCC's 
ongoing commitment to producers, we have included an amendment to 
the act that requires farming operations to be the main focus of 
the corporation's activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their meetings with financial industry groups, FCC 
representatives went to considerable lengths to demonstrate that 
the corporation is seeking expanding opportunities to partner, 
not compete, with the private sector and other government 
agencies.  There is a definite need for increased financial 
options in rural Canada that could be effectively addressed 
through partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation is actively seeking partnerships with other 
financial institutions and government agencies that combine its 
agricultural expertise and rural reach with their specialized 
services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the FCC has 27 partnerships across the country and 
plans to grow this number in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the valuable feedback and suggestions gained from these 
consultations, the federal government has created amendments to 
ensure the continued relevancy of this act.  The amendments were 
based on three guiding principles: the need to offer agricultural 
operators a greater range of options and financial and business 
services; the need to offer farm related businesses increased 
access to capital in support of primary producers; and the FCC's 
need for greater structural flexibility to offer more services 
through partnerships and to remain viable to serve producers for 
the long run and the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly review the major amendments.  The first amendment 
demonstrates the federal government's continued commitment to 
Canadian agriculture.  We seek to change the name of Farm Credit 
Corporation to Farm Credit Canada.  In French it will change from 
Société du crédit agricole to Financement agricole Canada.  This 
change reflects the corporation's public mandate to serve rural 
Canada as a federal crown.  Adding the word Canada to the 
corporation's name sends a clear and visible message that the 
federal government plays an active role in rural communities. The 
name change also supports the new federal identity guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key amendment allows the Farm Credit Corporation to 
offer business services to producers either directly or through 
partnerships.  As I mentioned, the average producer needs access 
to a broad range of business management services to succeed.  It 
could be business planning, succession planning or land 
management.  Yes, these services currently exist in some parts of 
rural Canada, but the FCC can provide the network to make these 
services accessible throughout all rural Canada.  Agricultural 
operators are running businesses just as complex as any urban 
based small business.  They deserve the same access to services 
as their urban counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use the Kaeding family from Churchbridge, Saskatchewan, 
to illustrate this.  If the Kaedings are an example of an average 
farm family, it is easy to see why the need for more complex 
business and financing services has grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kaedings are FCC customers who, in the past decade, have 
diversified their grain operation to include a pedigree seed 
business.  That seed business includes 50 varieties of grain 
crops plus specialized crops of grass and forage seed.  They say 
they have stayed with the Farm Credit Corporation because of the 
corporation's flexibility in meeting their emerging financial 
needs.  Through these new amendments, the FCC will have greater 
flexibility to keep pace with the changing demands of farm 
families like the Kaedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation clarifies the FCC's ability to offer lease 
financing to agricultural operators.  While the act as it 
currently reads does not prevent the corporation from offering 
lease financing, the scope of these services needs to be more 
clearly defined.  Leasing is a growing financing option for 
producers who want more flexibility to manage their cash flow. 
This especially applies to new producers starting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will enable Farm Credit Corporation to offer 
equity financing to producers and farm related businesses.  Many 
farming and farm related operations need access to equity as well 
as term financing.  In fact, rural communities cannot develop 
local value added agricultural industries without venture and 
equity capital.  The Farm Credit Corporation will not only be 
able to make direct equity investments in local agricultural 
enterprises, it will also be able to leverage this investment to 
attract other equity providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important amendment to the act will allow the Farm Credit 
Corporation to provide financial services to farm related 
businesses that benefit agriculture.  Currently the corporation 
can lend only to businesses that are farmer owned.  If we step 
back for a moment to look at agriculture as a whole, we will see 
it is no longer divided into neat categories of suppliers, 
farmers and processors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the industry becomes more integrated, interdependencies grow. 
The farmer who has diversified from wheat, for example, into 
chickpeas might depend on a local processor to purchase his or 
her crop. 
Increasing investment and farm related businesses from fertilizer 
plants to food processors will greatly benefit producers directly 
not to mention contribute to the rural communities as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of primary production is linked to the growth of farm 
related businesses, both those owned by farmers and those owned 
by business people in rural communities.  The FCC has provided 
lending services to farm related operations since the act was 
last amended in 1993.  The corporation will continue to focus on 
small and medium sized operations that are directly linked to 
producers and contribute to local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the financial structure of the corporation will 
give it added flexibility to seek new partnerships and offer 
expanded services.  The FCC will be able to create subsidiaries 
to enter partnerships offering new services arm's length from the 
existing portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation will have access to a broader range of financial 
management instruments to fund services it provides to producers. 
These amendments help the corporation provide new services that 
meet emerging needs while protecting its long term ability to 
serve agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past four decades, the FCC has served producers and 
agriculture through all commodity cycles and through good times 
and bad.  The corporation has shown great flexibility in working 
with producers to see them through market downturns and climactic 
disasters.  When times get tough this commitment is especially 
evident.  The FCC employees sit down with customers and work out 
solutions to address their particular situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the FCC was there to help Quebec and Ontario producers 
affected by the ice storm.  The corporation has worked with 
prairie producers through the downturn in cereal crops and 
oilseeds.  In the past year the FCC has helped farmers in 
southern Alberta weather a severe drought.  It has worked with 
potato growers in Prince Edward Island through the market 
upheaval caused by the potato wart, which we settled today.  The 
FCC employees work with producers in any commodity group to 
develop flexible options to see them through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the president of a British Columbia cranberry 
company recently sent me a letter and through me thanked the Farm 
Credit Corporation for its continuing support through the recent 
downturn in the cranberry sector.  Through the proposed 
amendments the Farm Credit Corporation will help producers 
achieve long term success in decades to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just explained the reasons driving our pursuit for 
amendments to the Farm Credit Corporation Act.  As well, I have 
outlined the key amendments and their benefit to Canadian 
producers in the agricultural industry.  I would ask members of 
the House to support this important piece of legislation as it 
goes forward in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK197">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should table 
emergency legislation regarding operating assistance for gold 
mines in Canada, in order to help gold mine operators cope with 
the rapid increase in production costs, and at the same time 
guaranteeing a fixed price for the gold they produce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Liberal member 
for Shefford, a resource region, for supporting my motion which 
aims to help gold mines in resource regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion I am presenting arises primarily from the people at 
home, in the mining sector and the heads of a number of gold 
mines in Abitibi—Témiscamingue, mainly in regions such as Chapais 
and Chibougamau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember that in 1948 a debate was held in the 
House of Commons on the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.  A 
number of members will be intervening, but they should address 
this emergency measure in their remarks.  At home people are 
asking for help operating gold mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to the 1948 bill people will say it dates from 
way back, but I have here the text of the law explaining how it 
worked, including the part on payments as assistance. 
It is important that people know what it is.  I will therefore 
quote section 3, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.(1) The Minister may pay to a person engaged in operating a 
gold mine a sum not exceeding an amount calculated in the manner 
prescribed in this section with respect to gold that is produced 
from the mine during a designated year and that, during the 
designated year, is sold to Her Majesty at the Royal Canadian 
Mint or at a branch thereof, or is exported from Canada and 
sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The sum that may be paid under this section in respect of 
gold produced from a mine and sold in a designated year that 
does not include any part of the first year of production, is an 
amount equal to the product of 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the rate of assistance for the mine for that designated year 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>multiplied by 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the number of ounces of gold by which the number produced 
from the mine and sold in that designated year exceeds two-thirds 
of the number produced from the mine during the base year. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we keep going in that vein, a gold vein particularly for 
Canada's mines, the marginal note for subsection 3(3) specifies 
that includes a part or all of the first year of production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1, 1947, a motion was brought before the House 
which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That it is appropriate to propose a measure to provide emergency 
payments, by the Minister of Mines and Resources, to help face 
the increase in production costs of gold produced from gold 
mines over the past three years, beginning on December 1, 1947. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says thanks to improvements in terms of the 
supply of workers and the help with costs provided under the 
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act. We can also go back to 
another year, 1953, but it is important for people to understand 
why we are asking for emergency legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for emergency legislation to help gold mine 
operators. 
Over the last several years Canada has passed 
emergency legislation to help farmers in the west and in the 
rest of Canada. Emergency legislation was passed to help the 
fisheries. There has been no emergency legislation to help gold 
mining since 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1953 amendment to the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act 
raised the price paid to eligible miners by one dollar an ounce 
produced as compared to 1952. These are all elements we saw and 
we will see again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1960 about half of the gold produced in Canada was sold on 
the free market and the rest was sold to the Royal Canadian Mint 
under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act. Gold production 
in Canada reached the highest levels since the second world war, 
or 4,628,911 ounces of gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that in 1948 when the Emergency Gold 
Mining Assistance Act came into force the production of gold 
rose by 14% as compared to 1947, thanks to these improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at 1964. People will think that the mining 
industry got money every year. In 1964 under the Emergency Gold 
Mining Assistance Act 44 out of 48 gold mines got help to cover 
their costs. Those that did not get help had not asked for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968 Canadian miners were still selling on the free market 
or were receiving assistance under the Emergency Gold Mining 
Assistance Act if they were eligible for this assistance. They 
were then selling their gold to the Royal Canadian Mint for the 
Canadian equivalent of $35 U.S. an ounce. The gold bought by the 
Royal Canadian Mint was in turn sold on the free market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people to understand why gold miners must be 
given assistance through emergency legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, 35 gold mines were eligible for assistance under the 
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act. Amendments were proposed. 
In 1972 no mine applied for the assistance available under the 
emergency legislation because the price of gold on the market 
was higher than the total of the official price set by the Royal 
Canadian Mint plus the maximum amount of $48 an ounce provided 
under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in June 1976—we are getting closer to the present—the 
IMF auctioned off 121.3 tonnes of gold from its reserves. This 
was the first portion of the 777.6 tonnes or 25 million ounces 
of gold it intended to sell over a four year period. 
The net proceeds were deposited in a trust fund used by the IMF 
to help developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act was no longer 
invoked as of June 30, 1976. The conditions set out in the 
legislation no longer applied to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened between 1948 and 1976? Under the emergency act 
passed in 1948 the amounts paid up to gold mine operators 
while the legislation was in effect totalled $303,104,402 for 
1,922.6 tonnes of gold. This means that 61,813,545 ounces of gold 
were produced and sold in accordance with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening now? In the last two years we have seen a 
sharp decline in the mining industry, particularly in the gold 
mines in the Abitibi. 
We know that things have not been easy for the mining industry, 
especially in the last two years. Last year low gold prices had 
a negative impact on the Beaufor gold mine, the McWatters mine, 
which is called the McWatters Company, and several northern 
communities. McWatters is developing what is known as the 
Sigma-Lamaque mine in Val-d'Or. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, hon. members would like to have a debate on 
this emergency bill like the one that was held some time in the 
last few months on disaster relief for western farmers because 
it is important to find a way to help out the mining industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, there are many policies supporting the mining 
industry. We also know that since 1980 Canada's policy has 
been to sell some of its official gold holdings. 
The government has opted for progressive and controlled sales in 
order to reduce as much as possible the impact on the markets. 
Since gold is not as liquid as other assets and has a low yield 
our policy has been to increase the yield of Canadian holdings 
and their liquidity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People tell us “You are selling gold but that does not help 
us”. I did a little research which shows that Canada's overall 
annual sales of gold, which represented 800,000 ounces of gold 
in 1999 and 600,000 ounces in 2000, are far from significant and 
important compared to all the transactions conducted on the 
international markets, where 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold are 
sold daily. The sale of Canada's gold has been to the federal 
government's advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am deeply concerned by the slump in the gold market 
and its negative impact on Canadian gold mining communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Canadian government strategy was to invest in 
research, innovation, the infrastructure and the improvement of 
human resources development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that until March of this year there has been no 
sale of gold and that as of March 31 Canadian gold holdings 
were at 1.2 million ounces. This evaluation is based on the 
March 31, 2001, London afternoon fixing at $257.70 U.S. an ounce. 
Today it is about $263. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the trend continues and if we do not enact emergency 
legislation to help the gold mining industry in the next 2 to 5 
years, mines will close and 13 of the 15 that will be affected 
in Quebec are in the Abitibi. That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the mining industry in Val-d'Or, Rouyn-Noranda and La 
Sarre where the Casa Berardi mine is located need help. Mines 
are now closed, mainly because of gold prices.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price of gold went up to $300 and then to $400.  Now it is holding 
at $260 or $265. This is why, with the present serious downturn 
in this sector, I tell the Government of Canada that it is 
important that it become involved.  If it does not 
become involved, we are leaving people to sit at home.  People 
are unemployed.  If we want to lower costs for the family, 
leaving workers to sit at home is not going to help matters 
financially.  Neither is it going to help matters socially. 
People want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a good emergency legislation program like what 
was done in 1948. 
The government needs to look at production costs, the price per 
ounce of gold, and find a way to come to their assistance. 
People are not asking for millions of dollars.  People are 
asking for help.  Action is required.  The federal government 
says that it will not become involved.  The infrastructures come 
under provincial jurisdiction, but Quebec, Ontario and the 
other provinces in Canada are helping the mining sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that there are transfers but I will not play the 
transfer game. I will not play along with the provinces.  They 
are getting involved.  We should get involved directly with our 
provincial friends, regardless of party lines, regardless of 
which government is in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is miners, their families and the children now 
caught up in this nightmare.  The economy has been in decline 
for the past two years. 
A way must be found to help. I believe that the Government of 
Canada should do something.  It already stepped in between 1948 
and 1976. The legislation was passed.  I do not understand why 
it has not taken action before now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers, both the Minister responsible for Economic 
Development and the Minister of Natural Resources, are working 
very hard.  They are finding all sorts of ways of helping with 
research and development, but there has to be a direct approach 
with the province.  Solutions must be found.  Our senior 
officials in Ottawa, in their ivory towers, do not 
understand what is now going on in the northern resource 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are senior officials in Ottawa or in Canada who are 
like hermits in a monastery.  They do not know what is going on 
in the outside world.  That is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These officials must come and see for themselves. 
Officials of Economic Development Canada from Montreal do come 
to our region. When a message is sent from Montreal to 
Ottawa, to our excellent Liberal ministers who try hard to find 
solutions, it often happens that senior officials do not pass it 
on. I have a message for them tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to help the mining industry. Let us 
forget about flag wars. That kind of war can be waged during the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, we are in a deep crisis. It is possible to 
reach an agreement with the Quebec government and the other 
governments. We did it for agricultural programs. We did it for 
the fisheries. Right now, in this great capital, Ottawa, 
many people should wake up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not know we have gold mines in the Abitibi. They do not 
know we have gold mines in Val-d'Or and that the mines in 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue, Chapais and Chibougamau create 7,000 jobs 
in the Montreal area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present we do not perform secondary or tertiary processing 
because everything is moved out to the big cities. We have 
nothing against this. About 3,000 or 4,000 jobs are created in 
the Quebec City area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to take action right now. We have to find short 
term solutions. We have to help these workers who have 
outstanding experience in the gold mines of Val-d'Or, of the 
Abitibi, of northern Ontario or elsewhere in Canada. We urgently 
need assistance and direct action just like the farmers and the 
fishers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural 
Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of 
Natural Resources and the government I am pleased to speak to 
the motion of the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member proposes that the government table emergency 
legislation in order to help gold mine operators and guarantee a 
fixed price for gold produced in Canada. I am aware that the 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik works very hard  to help the 
mining industry, especially gold mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion illustrates his commitment to the 
region he represents so well and which depends in part on the 
development of natural resources. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of members, I will briefly review the history of 
metal prices.  From the end of the second world war until the 
late seventies, the mining industry enjoyed strong and steadily 
rising demand.  Producers, few in number, went along as a group 
with the price charged by the industry leaders.  The economic 
prices of the eighties, triggered in part by two factors, that 
is, the emergence of independent third world countries wanting 
ownership of their own resources and the first oil price shock, 
put an abrupt end to rising metal consumption in industrialized 
countries.  On the metals market, the tariff price system 
implemented by major producers gave way to world prices quoted on 
commodity exchanges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reaction to the new price regulation system, the end of the 
eighties ushered in an era of mining industries whose strength 
lay in the quality of their deposits, their energy supply and 
their ability to develop those resources. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just described characteristics unique to our country. 
Besides being one of the world's major producers of minerals and 
metals, Canada has an unequalled expertise in the mining sector. 
Mining exports, worth $44 billion a year, represent 13% of our 
total exports. This sector employs directly 400,000 Canadians 
from coast to coast. Our mineral resources are without a doubt 
essential to our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must admit like my colleague from 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik that the low prices for metals and gold 
we have been seeing these past few years are a concern. 
Indeed, as members know, the depressed gold market is due to the 
fact that the supply remains the same despite low prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply of gold depends on mining production but also on the 
sale of gold by central banks, recycled gold, protection 
programs for mining producers, and on the net sales of 
investors who believe it is not worth keeping gold as assets. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several factors that affect commodity prices, factors 
which are completely outside the control of government.  To 
counter fluctuations in those factors, mining companies need to 
exploit rich deposits at low cost and need to know how to manage 
the risks that could put them at the mercy of the next stock 
market crisis.  I am pleased to report that our country is in a 
good position relative to the other major gold producing 
countries, ranking second in terms of production costs.  It is as 
a result not only of the ingenuity of our producers but also the 
enlightened policies of our provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, in his response to the Speech from the 
Throne, focused on our mandate: to bring the best of Canada into 
the 21st century by building an innovative economy, fostering 
innovation and know-how and ensuring social inclusion.  Natural 
Resources Canada is in a good position to solidly support the key 
objectives stated by our Prime Minister and that reflect the 
minister's priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will demonstrate how the government works unceasingly to 
strengthen our foundations in terms of the mining industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about sound economic foundations. A healthy 
financial climate is not an end in itself but rather the 
prerequisite without which the government would not be able to 
make all the socio-economic investments it must make in 
co-operation with its partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the natural resource sector this prerequisite was reflected 
in the last mini budget through a 15% tax credit for flow through 
share investment in mineral exploration projects in Canada. This 
measure was put it place as a result of a grassroots campaign 
led by the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Drilling Association and several members, including the 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik and myself. All have 
understood the benefits of exploration in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that generally flow through shares meet federal 
policy objectives in an appropriate, effective and economical 
way by stimulating exploration activities in Canada, promoting 
the purchase of stocks in mining companies and helping small 
exploration companies. In that regard PDAC announced that 
flow through financing coupled with tax credits and totalling 
about $30 million was confirmed just before the end of the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minerals and metals sector, like the Canadian economy as a 
whole, can conduct its activities in a sounder context, and it 
is among the leaders in the race for capital money on 
international markets.

from the national scientific research institute of the 
Université du Québec on various earth science projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The targeted geoscience initiative is one of the programs 
administered by the QGC. The purpose of the TGI is to develop 
the social and economic potential of our natural resources by 
increasing the scope and efficiency of the mineral exploration 
work done in the private sector. Five million dollars will be 
spent on this initiative over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three projects are currently under way in Quebec: one on ice 
dynamics; one on exploration for diamonds in northern Quebec; and 
one on metallogeny at the 
Doyon-Bousquet-Laronde mining camp in Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mine laboratory in Val-d'Or is known throughout the world for 
its innovative research on mechanization and automation 
technologies for the mining industry. Established in 1991 right 
where a gold mine used to be, the Val-d'Or experimental mine is a 
unique facility for on site testing and research in a realistic 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amount of $1.8 million is spent every year on the 
mechanization program alone, while the vein deposit program was 
granted a $2.5 million budget for a period of three years. 
Almost $5.7 million of the money invested by the CanMet partners 
will benefit various companies in Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show that the Government of Canada recognizes the 
significance of our resource areas and believes in them. I have 
mentioned some figures, but what about the projects themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the current natural resources minister has been appointed, 
close to 50 projects have been carried out or are under way in 
the Val-d'Or mine laboratory alone. These projects are 
wide-ranging, covering anything from health and security in the 
mines, research and development on new development techniques 
for vein deposits, training programs for miners to productivity 
and innovation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few examples.  CanMet formed a consortium to improve 
the performance of gold cyanidation plants.  Eight plants, 
including five in Abitibi, participated in the consortium.  The 
goal was to achieve a better understanding of the interaction of 
cyanide, lead nitrate and oxygen, and optimize the use of those 
reagents, as well as gold recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two participants in the study were asked to assess the impacts 
of the project.  They estimate that their operating costs have 
been reduced by $3.2 million per year and that gold recovery has 
increased by $1.3 million, for a total annual impact of $4.5 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mine automation program is a consortium of privately owned 
businesses and includes CanMet.  The project, which is setting 
the tone for the future of the mining industry, uses mining 
robots to detonate explosives from the surface and machines to 
bring the ore to the surface without direct human intervention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be amiss if I did not mention, before I conclude, how 
important community involvement is. Strong and confident 
communities are a vital part of our social fabric.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying that for all the good 
intentions of the motion brought by my colleague from Abitibi, 
the government cannot support it.  In the context of 
globalization and global markets it is inconceivable to set the 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this morning I received a call from the Mining 
Association of Canada, the most important mining association in 
Canada, expressing some very serious doubts about the motion and 
asking the government not to support it.  The association does 
not support it.  The association wants a free market economy and 
so do we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows:  the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Employment 
Insurance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
private member's motion No. 295.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should table 
emergency legislation regarding operating assistance for gold 
mines in Canada, in order to help gold mine operators cope with 
the rapid increase in production costs, and at the same time 
guaranteeing a fixed price for the gold they produce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing his concerns about 
Canada's gold mine industry and his region to the floor of the 
House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after carefully listening to the hon. member I am still 
having great difficulty understanding where the emergency is in 
the gold mining industry.  It is no surprise that the 
parliamentary secretary refused consent or that the government is 
unwilling to adopt this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the motion the hon. member is exonerating himself in the 
eyes of his gold mining constituency.  I guess we can regret that 
he could not satisfy the concerns of his gold mine constituency 
in his talks with cabinet colleagues.  It seems that they have 
told him to take his concern to private members' business because 
as a government his own party will not implement the motion.  The 
parliamentary secretary was quite articulate and very blunt in 
refusing to adopt the motion.  I am not sure that this is the 
case, but I do not know what else could have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks for subsidies for gold mining in Canada and a 
fixed price for the gold these mines produce.  In British 
Columbia we do not like unfair subsidies from this weak Liberal 
government that lacks vision.  The government subsidizes 
industries destined to fail or which have already failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberals have destroyed our health care system and 
are not addressing Canada's $640 billion debt, but they will 
spend taxpayer dollars anywhere they think they can buy votes. 
Canadians do not want the Liberals' subsidies, extra regulations, 
trade restrictions, price fixing or anything else of that nature. 
Businesses want the government off their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at British Columbia's mining industry and gold 
mining.  That will give me an opportunity to discuss mining in 
British Columbia and gold mining as whole.  Mining is a major 
contributor to the British Columbian and Canadian economies in 
the form of employment, taxes and exports.  Across Canada it 
generates 60% of rail revenue and accounts for 70% of total port 
volume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia mining generates over $4 billion in revenue 
and $1 billion in government taxes per year.  Mining is a leading 
employer in British Columbia, with substantial potential to do 
more.  It has 10,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mining is a world leading source of expertise and venture 
capital.  British Columbian companies fund mining projects 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mining pays the highest wages and benefits of any industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an environmentally and socially responsible industry. 
Mining lands are reclaimed and at the end of a mine's life the 
land can be put to other uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia's mineral potential is considered to be among 
the leaders in the world.  British Columbia has over 14,000 known 
mineral occurrences and untold mineral potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actual land usage for a mine is extremely small relative to the 
area explored, with less than 28,000 hectares currently being 
used by mining, which is less than 0.03% of British Columbia's 
land base.  Mining's value in terms of use of land is $150,000 
per hectare compared to forestry at $5,700 per hectare, 
agriculture at $1,400 per hectare, and parks at $42 per hectare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other benefits.  There were 103 kilometres of 
roads or trails built for mineral exploration in 1993.  At the 
same time there were 11,400 kilometres of road built for 
forestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 exploration expenditures totalled $25 million or less 
than 10% of 1990 levels.  In the past 10 years, two mines closed 
for every one that opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia we are against this motion.  How can we 
support subsidizing gold mines and leave out other mines and 
other industries?  At least those industries provide a national 
purpose. 
Conversely, the health of the gold mining industry, other than 
preserving jobs, serves little public interest.  Consequently, 
public dollars should not be spent subsidizing the industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one gold mine in British Columbia, the Eskay Creek 
mine, which produces gold at a production cost of less than $100 
an ounce.  In Canada it is second in cost production for gold. 
This is excellent work.  There is no subsidy needed.  Why should 
that mine's good work be confounded by a fixed price when it 
comes time for it to sell its products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the second largest country in the world in area and we 
are very rich in our natural resources.  These natural resources, 
including minerals, oil and gas, are important sources for a 
brighter future for our country.  Unfortunately the federal 
Liberal government lacks vision and strategic planning in 
developing, exploring and utilizing these resources.  It lacks a 
balanced approach between resource development and environmental 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have more resource based industries in Canada.  For 
example, at the Vancouver port we can see lot of sulphur being 
exported from Canada.  It can be seen from quite a distance.  I 
wonder if we are exporting these raw resources and then importing 
finished products made from these resources in other countries. 
Why are we not able to encourage investors and manufacturers who 
will boost our economy and create jobs in Canada?  It is a 
tragedy under this weak, arrogant Liberal government that rules 
rather than governs the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story of the mining industry in Canada is a tragedy.  The 
amount of regulation and red tape is unbelievable.  The federal 
and provincial jurisdictions are either overlapping or absolutely 
unclear.  Federal and provincial taxes are way too high.  This 
weak government has a confrontational approach to the provinces 
rather than a co-operative approach.  Mining operations require 
investing a lot of time and energy as well as the investment of 
other kinds of resources.  It is a long term process to explore 
for minerals.  Adverse government policies have driven miners 
from all kinds of mines, including gold mines, south of the 
border.  In Chile, for example, we have a $12 billion U.S. 
investment, mostly in the mining industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Surrey in my constituency there are a number of 
companies that deal with the mining industry.  I am very proud to 
mention RAS Industries.  It manufactures the largest pulleys in 
the world for mining operations and exports them around the 
world.  There are many other organizations of international 
repute in Surrey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than fixing the price for gold, what the weak Liberal 
government should fix is the infrastructure, the regulations and 
the taxation policies.  It should at least make a feeble attempt 
to fix these things rather than fixing the price of gold, which 
is in the hands of the global market anyway.  The price of gold 
is fixed through the commodity market exchanges or through the 
intervention of the central banks, the national banks or the 
reserve banks of various countries.  It is a global phenomenon. 
Canada does not have the jurisdiction, the authority, the power 
or the resources to fix the price of gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should listen to our resource based communities 
and should accommodate the input from them in the policy 
formulation for natural resources.  Simply mentioning in the 
throne speech of 1996 the need to sustain our natural resources 
is just not enough.  Where is the action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural resources contribute about 15% to our GDP.  The 
government must develop a vision and make policies and 
regulations conducive to sustainable development, benefiting the 
economy, creating jobs, benefiting communities and, on the whole, 
protecting our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is a private member's motion, I have been very kind 
in my remarks.  If it had been a government bill or motion, I 
would have been quite brutal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I believe today you have created an 
interesting precedent. Through a series of circumstances, we 
received right away the parliamentary secretary's answer to the 
motion moved by the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. Finally 
this will allow us to look at both sides of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rising today to speak to this bill because since private 
members business was moved up the member for Témiscamingue, who 
was supposed to be here, was unfortunately not able to free 
himself. I believe my speech will be a faithful rendition of his 
own. I was particularly inspired by his vision which reflects 
regional needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I was saying earlier that the fact the 
parliamentary secretary answered the motion moved by the member 
was very instructive. Even if he comes from a mining area he 
seems to have put his interest as a parliamentary secretary, as 
a representative of the government, ahead of his interest as a 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important in the motion is not necessarily every comma. 
I am going to read it, but it should be understood that it is 
really a cry for help, because in one area of Quebec and in 
northern Ontario there is one industry which is facing major 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the mining industry as a whole is going through a 
major crisis, especially gold mining, a mineral ore which has 
gone through ups and downs. 
Transactions regarding the sale of this product have been very 
active over the past decades due to the way its price was set, 
the importance it was given and the fact that some countries had 
pegged their currency on gold. There has been a lot of changes 
which eventually lead to the situation which is denounced by the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now going to read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should table 
emergency legislation regarding operating assistance for gold 
mines in Canada, in order to help gold mine operators cope with 
the rapid increase in production costs, and at the same time 
guaranteeing a fixed price for the gold they produce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may not agree with the wording of the motion. I find it 
difficult to understand the government's position because, after 
all, that industry is in a state of crisis. There is a need for 
some kind of emergency response plan in that sector, and the 
government must respond. It must do more than talk; it must take 
positive action. The government is not only responding with 
words but also extremely negatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a member of parliament who presented a motion to 
get things moving to help an industry that is experiencing 
difficulties, but the government shuts the door tight, saying 
“let us simply let the market do its thing”. As previous 
speakers have said, in two, five or ten years we will count the 
number of gold mines that will have shut down in a given year. 
That will be due in part to the federal government's failure to 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot invoke the fact that there are 
international agreements not to do anything. It must show some 
imagination and innovation. Why could the federal government not 
promote research in that sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this industry is already highly productive. It is 
in our best interest to make sure that it can continue to be 
productive and competitive, but that industry needs help to 
continue to be productive. There is always room for 
improvement in the research sector. This may include the use 
that is made of the product. In any case, the government must be 
proactive and not have a defensive attitude, or even be closed 
to any suggestion, as is the case right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also promote exploration, identify reserves and try to 
find ways to diversify the market. 
If new discoveries are made, these people who are working in 
mines could possibly work in other sectors. There may be ways to 
diversify measures, but one should certainly not remain passive 
like the government is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can invoke the position of the Canadian Mining 
Association, which says “We do not agree with the motion that 
was put forward”, but this does not solve the problem at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some communities are faced with major problems. When the mining 
market was flourishing, the government never 
contacted them to say “Your taxes are too high. We will wait a 
bit and ask less of you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the industry is on a roll and these people are giving the 
government money, it gladly takes it. Now that the situation 
is difficult for them, they probably need help. These regions, 
especially the northern parts of Quebec and Ontario, deserve 
some attention. They deserve innovative solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is disappointing. I was also listening 
to the debate and to what the Alliance member said. 
Taken literally, we can certainly find fault with certain 
aspects of the proposition, but what I would like people to 
remember today is that there is a region faced with a serious 
problem, that there is an industry faced with a serious problem 
and that the government, through its parliamentary secretary, 
is telling us there is nothing it can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that totally unacceptable because there is an example to 
follow. The Quebec government just gave regions $800 million in 
assistance funds, $250 million of which will go to the mining 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree 
with the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik on this, and 
not out of any kind of rivalry or one-upmanship. Could the federal 
government not, in one way or another, take a look at 
this initiative and see if there is not something that it could 
do in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were $500 million in assistance to the mining industry 
instead of $250 million, I think the fund would be worth while 
and could give positive results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I say again that the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue finds that something does indeed need to be done 
in this industry.  It is important for there to be some action. 
The situation is urgent. 
The federal government has to get moving. We have made proposals 
on this. Studies need to be carried out. The minister 
concerned must be ordered to take steps to stimulate research, 
to stimulate exploration, to be proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free competition does not exclude proactivity.  Free competition 
does not mean that when an industry is affected by difficult 
international conditions it absolutely must be allowed to go 
under. Once mines have been closed, it will not necessarily be 
easy to get them open again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the communities that will be affected when the social 
cost of these mine closures has to be assumed, perhaps the 
government will realize that the cost will be greater than what 
it would have cost initially to help out the industries 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that after the government members have done some thinking 
we will hear something different from them than what we have 
heard today.  I also hope that as far as the conclusion reached 
by the hon. member making the proposal is concerned we will be 
able to look into the possibility of other approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my fondest wish that the federal government will address 
this urgent matter.  The lives of communities depends on it, the 
lives of families, and we have no right to abandon people who 
have long contributed to the productivity of the country and can 
be considered important factors in the vitality of their area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise to speak today to Motion No. 295 put forward 
by the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik.  It reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should table 
emergency legislation regarding operating assistance for gold 
mines in Canada, in order to help gold mine operators cope with

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should tell the hon. member who put forward the motion that 
this is not a motion the Progressive Conservative Party would 
tend to support.  However it certainly needs to be noted that the 
member put the motion forth in good conscience.  He put it forth 
with the intention of trying to help a beleaguered industry which 
needs some type of assistance and perhaps some innovative 
policies from the government that do not seem to be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with the member on a number of committees.  I have 
always found him to be a progressive and forward thinking member 
of parliament.  Therefore I will speak to his motion, although I 
am disappointed to say I cannot agree with him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mining is an extremely important industry in Canada, 
specifically gold mining.  Canada is the fourth largest gold 
producer in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gold is mined in six provinces and three territories.  In the 
previous parliament I had the opportunity to travel to many of 
those areas, specifically Timmins, Ontario, the largest gold 
mining municipality in Canada.  As part of my visit I spoke with 
gold mining representatives.  Gold prices were low at that time 
due to the general decline in prices since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average price of gold has gone from $294 in 1998 to $274 in 
1999, with a slight rebound to $279 in 2000.  It hovered between 
$257 and $262 an ounce for the early part of this year.  This was 
after an average of $385 an ounce from 1993 to 1996.  Those were 
certainly good days for the gold mining industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason to believe the price will recover.  The gold 
industry has always faced cyclical variations in price.  Although 
the recent downturn has been significant, the CEO and president 
of Placer Dome, the fifth or sixth largest gold mining company in 
the world, was quoted in today's newspapers as saying current 
market conditions are making gold an attractive long term 
alternative to investors who are tired of weakening foreign 
currencies and plummeting high tech stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Mr. Taylor has said he does not expect the price of gold 
to advance beyond $300 in the next five years, that is the 
benchmark at which most gold mining companies can operate 
productively and profitably.  One Canadian gold mining company, 
Goldcorp Inc., has indicated that by mining very rich grades of 
gold it can produce gold at $90 an ounce and provide a 66% profit 
margin even at today's low prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that some companies have adapted to current 
market prices and conditions and that it is therefore unnecessary 
to table emergency legislation to provide operating assistance to 
Canada's gold mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize this places a strain on a number of gold mining 
companies.  However as Ed Huebert of the Mining Association of 
Manitoba has pointed out, most mining operations are facing tough 
times.  Only in specific resources such as platinum, which is 
currently trading at $660 U.S. per ounce, are prices soaring and 
attracting new investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons mining companies are experiencing high 
production costs is the rising price of energy, an issue which 
has been discussed in recent weeks.  U.S. President Bush has made 
it clear that one of his priorities is to establish an 
international energy plan involving Canada, the United States and 
Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Bush has been vocal about his desire to see more 
energy flow from Canada to the United States.  He has encouraged 
Canada to develop the resources of its high north, east coast and 
Alberta tar sands.  That could be good news not only for the 
exploration, development and processing of oil and gas reserves 
but for the provision of cheap energy to more remote areas of the 
country for exploration, mining and mineral processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it raises fundamental questions about renewable 
energy development and the environment.  Renewable energy sources 
such as hydro electric power are being considered because of the 
decline of fossil fuels.  While the cost of many renewable energy 
sources makes them less attractive than traditional fossil fuels, 
all sources should be examined closely with an eye to both their 
short term and long term consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental issues have a role to play in decisions about 
energy use.  Sometimes the total cost of production, when taking 
environmental factors into consideration, is much more attractive 
and comparable at first appearance.  The point is that high 
energy costs are a fact of doing business and they affect 
everyone in some way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not justify financial assistance for one sector of the 
mining industry any more than another sector, whether it be in 
coal, zinc, copper, platinum or any of the diverse range of 
minerals found and mined in Canada.  That is why it is difficult 
to single out one sector of the mining industry and offer 
financial aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has faced tough economic times as the downturn in 
gold prices continues, and it has done so for the past few years. 
It is particularly evident when we compare gold prices to what 
they were in the late 1970s and 1980s when gold averaged 
somewhere in the $400 range and even went as high as $800. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of direct financial assistance for gold mines, we need 
to look at other means of increasing value and investment in the 
mining industry.  Value added initiatives would be one way of 
helping mining companies improve profit.  That is evident in the 
gold industry where intermediate gold stocks have performed well 
while gold bullion has declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barrick Gold Corporation, the world's leading gold producer and 
Canada's number one gold mining company, had high quality gold 
reserves that in combination with low production costs resulted 
in record production and cash flow in 2000.  This was despite low 
gold prices.  Barrick's first quarter report issued today states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we have shown we can generate strong earnings and 
cash flow...in a low gold price environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time Placer Dome, Canada's second largest gold 
mining company, reported reduced profits as a result of 
diminished sales and poor gold prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows that some gold mining companies are posting smaller 
financial profits as a result of low gold prices.  However, to 
offer across the board financial assistance to all gold mine 
operators is clearly out of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other means of helping mining companies, and that is 
through flow through shares.  Gold mining companies, like any 
type of mining operation, need to search for new resources. Flow 
through shares represent one of the most cost effective aspects 
of the industry.  With flow through shares people investing in 
companies for exploration purposes can realize a tax deduction 
while the company reaps the benefits from its investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recently introduced flow through shares, 
providing a 15% tax deduction for individuals on top of the 
current 100% tax write-off, making investment in junior mining 
companies attractive for investors.  This is something that 
should assist gold mining companies in Canada, and it is a type 
of assistance that the PC Party of Canada supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives such as flow through shares and different ways of 
doing business, along with issues of recognizing the additional 
cost put upon exploration companies, mining companies and 
processing companies as a result of energy costs, are the types 
of issues we need to deal with.  Those are the types of issues 
the government should be dealing with on a one at a time basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government took a look at the macro picture and solved 
some of the micro problems in it, it would soon find that the 
macro picture was a lot smaller and perhaps much more manageable 
for not only the mining sector but for all other sectors in the 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will avail myself of my right to respond. Tonight I see that 
things are not looking good for miners in the Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the comments made by the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques who is, I must 
add, replacing the member for Témiscamingue who is attending a 
committee meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply I have to say that I am not at all amused by the 
government's reaction to my motion. 
Before and after my speech when the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Natural Resources, who is from northern Ontario, 
was speaking, I made a short visit to the government lobby. A 
note from the minister regarding Motion No. 295, my motion aimed at 
helping miners and their families in my region, said that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that resource regions are 
going through tough times because of a drop in the price of 
metals and that they are facing many challenges. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The note also mentioned what the government had done so far, 
namely a 15% tax credit for mines. However, that measure came 
from the Department of Finance, not from the Department of 
Natural Resources. 
The note talked about research and development, but this is not 
the responsibility of the Minister of Natural Resources. It is 
the responsibility of the Economic Development Canada, headed by 
the member for Outremont, who often visits our region. 
I know that the Department of Natural Resources is involved in 
CanMet, but this was implemented by the Conservatives in the 
1980s.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Minister of Natural Resources is this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not support this motion for the reasons I have 
mentioned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the minister for not coming in the House and 
opposing the motion himself. However, mine workers have made a 
contribution to Canada. Moreover, they pay federal and 
provincial taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1948 and 1976 the Canadian government had emergency 
legislation to support the gold mining industry. I can 
understand why the Alliance member is against this motion. 
British Columbia has only 10% of the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our region people are out of work. If we can count on the 
federal government, they can work. We are asking for help. We 
are in a serious crisis. I could use certain words and I could 
get angry, but I am trying to find a solution for workers and 
their families. They have to go back to work. We are asking for 
urgent action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know where the Canadian government stands. However the 
Alliance did not say a word. Conservative members said nothing 
when assistance was provided to farmers and fishers. We have to 
find a way to help workers in the mining industry in our area. I 
was a miner in the Sigma mine. Assistance is needed right now. 
Let the ministers come and see us. Let them try to find a 
solution so these workers can have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Liberal member for Outremont does a good job of 
trying to come up with solutions.  However the Minister of 
Natural Resources has to wake up.  Let him come to the Abitibi 
and meet the workers.  Things are truly going badly.  It is too 
bad that Réal Caouette is not in this House now.  He would get 
the message across.  He would go and wake them up in the 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solutions have to be found.  If I am to believe the minister 
responsible for economic development in Quebec he understands 
the problem, but his colleagues have to do something.  It really 
is going badly.  They did something for agriculture in the west. 
They did something for fishing.  However, for the northern 
regions,  resource regions, an understanding would have to be 
reached with the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario things are going very badly.  When the mine closed 
in Cape Breton we all agreed in the House to pour millions into 
it.  The mine workers are now at home.  They are not working. 
They have been there for months.  There is a real difficult 
slump. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance did help with the 15% on flow through 
shares.  That was a good move, but what has happened since 
these shares?  There is a real slump.  They talk about helping 
other countries, as was the case during the gulf war.  They sent 
in an F-18. In 18 seconds they push a button and they are 
there. However it costs $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cost only $303 million for the emergency measures between 
1948 and 1976 to help the community of Canadian miners.  The 
mining association called the parliamentary secretary to say it 
was opposed.  I understand.  These associations are headed by 
the big companies working outside Canada, the multimillionaires 
as we call them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mine workers in small companies such as McWatters and the Beaufor mine 
are currently unemployed.  They say 
“We must not intervene because of the world price”.  They do 
not care a whit for the world issues in the Abitibi at the 
moment.  People want to work.  They want to be able to put food 
on the table now.  That is what counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will meet members, but I want to say that we will keep on 
rattling the cage.  Things have to start happening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the 
order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to 
have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today on the 
adjournment motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 23, 2001, I asked a question regarding Bill C-2. This 
bill was aimed at amending the Employment Insurance Act and had 
not been passed at the time. I asked if the government was 
willing to withdraw clause 9, which now allows the government to 
set the premium rate without having to take into account the 
advice of the Employment Insurance Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answered that even if the auditor general had said 
that, he had also said something else. However she did not 
mention the very comments of the auditor general who said that 
he preferred the status quo in the Employment Insurance Act to 
Bill C-2 because it created additional uncertainty regarding the 
use of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that Bill C-2 has become law we are faced with a situation 
where the government has simply created a payroll tax, a 
regressive tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who contribute to the employment insurance plan pay 
premiums on their income of up to $39,000 a year. However someone 
earning $48,000 pays no premium on $9,000 of it, whereas people 
earning $25,000 pay premiums on 100% of their salary. It is a 
regressive payroll tax, especially since some people do not pay 
any premium at all. Foremost among those are we members of the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that now that the government has decided that the 
money it contributes to the employment insurance plan will 
legally be used to cover government expenses as a whole, we will 
not be doing our share. We will not be doing our share in this 
regard. I agree that for people who do not earn a lot of money 
the situation is rather offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am asking the government if it would not be possible 
to hold a debate as soon as possible on the issue of this 
payroll tax, because this is becoming a new form of taxation. 
This is a third way of financing the government's general 
operations on top of income taxes and the GST. As it is, I find 
this unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they wanted to use it as a payroll tax it should be a fair 
tax. Will everyone contribute? Will the cap be raised so that 
everyone contributes on the basis of his or her income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for 
EI contributions used for debt financing those who earn $30,000 
a year contribute on 100% of their earnings. 
Yet those earning $50,000 a year pay premiums on only 75% of 
their income. As for us, we are contributing absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted we pay income tax. EI contributions should be used for 
employment insurance purposes. For several years the government 
has been raking in $18 billion a year in contributions and gives 
back only $12 billion in benefits. Now it has legalized the 
fact such surpluses should not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to see the government keep its election 
promise. 
During the election campaign, the Prime Minister, the member for 
Bourassa who is responsible for amateur sport, and the minister 
responsible for Quebec all said there would be a parliamentary 
committee to bring about a true reform of the employment 
insurance plan, not just what we found in Bill C-2—like the 
elimination of the intensity rule for which we had been calling 
for a long time, but a true reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government make the commitment to follow up on the 
results of the negotiations and the work of the committee, 
especially if there are unanimous 
recommendations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to wait two months, three months, six months or a 
year for the government to deal with this issue, because there 
are women, young people and seasonal workers who still find 
themselves in an unacceptable situation today. 
Until measures are taken to correct the fact that a young person 
who just entered the workforce is required to work 910 hours to 
be eligible, the situation will remain unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am waiting for an answer from the government. Now that it has 
realized that EI contributions are a payroll tax and has 
promised changes, will the government keep its word and 
starting in June give people an employment insurance plan that 
enables them to have sufficient income while they are unemployed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural 
Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the government is following the 
implementation of EI reforms very closely and, where necessary, 
is making the required changes to maintain the effectiveness of 
the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamental changes introduced in 1996 continue to produce 
results and to help Canadians.  Recently we proposed amendments 
to Bill C-2 in light of the recommendations made by the auditor 
general who feels that the process for setting premiums is not 
sufficiently transparent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22 the auditor general told the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts that over the next two years work would be 
done on how the rates should be set in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore think that the bill buys time so that we can find a 
better way of calculating the rates paid by employees and 
employers.  The Standing Committee on Finance has also indicated 
that the process should be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances the government felt it was 
inappropriate to ask the commission to continue to set the 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure stability and predictability the government 
will be suspending the commission's authority to set rates for a 
period of two years so that a thorough review of the process 
used can be conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
