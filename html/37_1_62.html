Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I have a petition signed 
by any number of people in Edmonton, Cold Lake, Bonnyville and 
the Northwest Territories. These people are very concerned.  They 
are asking that practitioners of Falun Gong, also known as Falun

discriminated against and persecuted in China by government 
officials and around the world through agents of the Chinese 
government.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORT ACT, 1987 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK27">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand (for Minister of Transport)</B> moved 
that Bill S-3, an act to amend the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 
1987 and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to open the 
second reading debate on the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 focuses motor carrier regulation on safety and 
specifically on the federal-provincial national safety code for 
motor carriers.  The bill is one of several initiatives to 
further improve road safety with the overall goal of making 
Canada's roads the safest in the world by the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada currently ranks ninth in the world when measured by the 
number of people killed per 10,000 registered motor vehicles; a 
stark statistic.  That is why the council of ministers 
responsible for transport and highway safety have announced an 
extension of the national road safety vision initiative to the 
year 2010.  Included in the vision is a national target calling 
for a 30% decrease in the average number of road users killed and 
seriously injured during the 2008-10 period compared to the five 
years from 1996 to 2001. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those countries at the top of the league, notably Norway, the 
U.K. and Sweden, are themselves still working hard to improve 
road safety.  There is a lot of work to be done to ensure that 
Canadians enjoy the safest roads in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To focus this work, the minister and his provincial colleagues 
have identified nine subtargets.  One of these subtargets is a 
20% decrease in the number of road users killed or seriously 
injured in crashes involving commercial vehicles, a toll which 
currently stands at 500 killed and 11,000 injured each year.  It 
is this subtarget to which Bill S-3 will contribute directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The target for deaths and injuries involving commercial vehicles 
is 20% and not the same 30% as the overall target.  Why should 
this be?  The reason is a very important one.  According to the 
best information we have, in collisions involving commercial 
vehicles it is much more often the non-truck vehicle involved 
that is found to be at fault.  For example, drivers of vehicles 
other than commercial vehicles are found to have committed a 
violation in 45% of such collisions.  Drivers of commercial 
vehicles are found to have committed a violation in 20% of those 
same types of collisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important because there is often a perception that 
heavy trucks are the cause of all accidents when in fact the 
problems which need to be tackled frequently lie elsewhere. 
Therefore the major opportunity to reduce fatal and injury 
producing collisions with commercial vehicles is in the hands of 
the operators of other vehicles, mostly private cars, sport 
utility vehicles, light trucks and vans.  It is a shared 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not in any way meant to minimize the importance of 
ensuring that commercial vehicle transport is as safe as it can 
be.  Bill S-3 is a major goal for the federal and provincial 
governments.  This is what the amendments to the Motor Vehicle 
Transport Act are about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important realities is the undoubted success of 
trucking as a means of transporting goods in our economy.  The 
preference for road transport is pervasive.  It is consistent 
with other developed countries and very likely will continue into 
the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last decade domestic truck tonne kilometres increased 
by 60% and even more impressively international activity, that is 
north-south traffic, has tripled.  These figures support the 
observation by many Canadians that there are ever more heavy 
vehicles on our roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that the House will recognize the 
importance of truck transport to the Canadian economy and will 
fully support the goal of ensuring that it is carried out in the 
safest possible manner.  With this background I will talk in more 
detail about Bill S-3 and the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 updates the federal government's longstanding 
involvement in road transport regulation.  This is founded on 
federal delegation to the provinces and territories of federal 
constitutional responsibility for certain parts of the road 
transport industry, those parts that cross provincial and 
international boundaries.  There is a shared jurisdiction which 
will be respected in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Motor Vehicle Transport Act supports provincial 
regulation and specifically safety regulation of motor carriers. 
By so doing it provides a national framework for provincial 
regulations and enables provincial governments to co-operate in 
regulating motor carriers that operate from one province to 
another.  The act governs the tens of thousands of truck and bus 
companies that fall under federal jurisdiction.  These are known 
as extraprovincial motor carriers or federal carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extraprovincial motor carriers are those that operate beyond the 
boundaries of a single province.  This is a large and 
increasingly important proportion of all truck and bus operators. 
Regulation of extraprovincial motor carriers is the 
constitutional responsibility of the federal government. 
Provincial governments are responsible for carriers that operate 
solely within a province, which are known as intraprovincial or 
local carriers.  Provinces are also responsible for licensing 
drivers and vehicles and for traffic enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the prominent provincial role, the federal 
government has historically delegated the implementation of its 
authority for federal motor carriers to provincial 
administrators.  The Motor Vehicle Transport Act provides the 
mechanism by which provincial and territorial governments are 
empowered to regulate federal carriers.  The legislation is 
therefore an essential component of a shared responsibility for 
national motor carrier safety regulation.  It is also important 
for the policy direction it provides to the national regulatory 
framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already indicated, the trucking industry regulated by 
this act is a vital part of our economy and is a significant 
engine of growth.  The value of trucking activity in Canada as 
measured by freight revenue is $40 billion annually. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trucking accounts for 84% of all Canadian surface freight 
revenues and about three-quarters of this activity is by federal 
carriers.  The trucking industry is diverse.  It features a 
number of large international companies, many intermediate and 
small businesses, and a great number of individuals who drive 
their own trucks.  There are over 700,000 heavy vehicles in 
Canada and nearly 250,000 fleet operators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian intercity bus industry is much smaller but also 
meets an essential transportation need.  Intercity and charter 
buses generate a half billion dollars in annual revenues.  Buses 
account for about one-third of all intercity passenger travel 
that is not made by private passenger car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in all our interests that buses can continue to provide 
Canadians with economical and safe transportation.  Buses have a 
continuing impressive record of safely transporting passengers. 
In fact there are years when there are no bus passenger 
fatalities at all.  There is however the occasional tragic 
accident and any collision involving a school bus rightly creates 
significant public concern.  Bus safety must remain a priority, 
just as heavy truck safety is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year the minister released a report on 
cross-country consultations on bus safety recently conducted by 
Transport Canada.  The recommendations are currently being 
considered by the department, the provinces and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word about a related act administered by 
Transport Canada.  The Motor Vehicle Safety Act prescribes safety 
standards for new trucks and buses.  This is an important part of 
ensuring that all vehicles on the road are manufactured to be as 
safe as modern technology can reasonably make them.  Recent 
advances in the standards for commercial vehicles include 
anti-lock brake systems, automatic brake adjusters and reflective 
markings to increase visibility.  The House can be confident that 
by virtue of these standards new heavy vehicles coming on to the 
road incorporate appropriate safety technology as it becomes 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a vehicle is registered for use on the road its operation 
and maintenance falls under provincial jurisdiction.  As 
indicated earlier, each province has laws and regulations 
governing the operation of commercial vehicles.  These provincial 
safety regimes are patterned after a set of national standards 
called the national safety code for motor carriers.  There are 15 
national safety code standards covering all aspects of safe 
commercial vehicle operation.  The standards address the driver, 
the vehicle and motor carrier management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years federal, provincial and territorial 
governments in consultation with industry and public interest 
groups have made a major effort to develop an umbrella standard 
based on real on road safety performance.  This effort recently 
culminated in new national safety code standard No. 14 under the 
category of safety rating.  This safety rating standard provides 
a framework for provincial government to assess and rate motor 
carriers, that is commercial vehicle operators, based on their 
actual on road safety performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on this knowledge governments are able to take appropriate 
enforcement action.  Carriers know where they stand relative to 
the industry and shippers are able to choose a carrier in a more 
informed way.  The safety rating process will ensure that all 
involved parties will have important real world information on 
motor carrier safety.  At the same time the safety rating 
standard places primary responsibility for safe vehicle operation 
clearly where it should be, with the motor carrier itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new standard No. 14 safety rating regime means that records 
of collisions, traffic offences and violations of safety 
standards will be collected for each motor carrier.  This 
information will be gathered from every jurisdiction where a 
motor carrier operates.  The province in Canada or the U.S. state 
where a motor carrier safety incident occurs will transmit the 
information to the province where the carrier is registered. 
Based on a compilation of all those records the home jurisdiction 
creates a safety rating for each motor carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be a useful juncture to mention the matter of 
commercial vehicle driver hours of service.  The hours of service 
regime in Canada is implemented by federal and provincial 
regulations, all of which are based on national safety code 
standard No. 9.  Drivers' hours of service performance is one of 
the several elements which contribute to the calculation of a 
carrier's safety rating. 
I want to make clear that the specific issue of hours of service 
is not however the subject of Bill S-3. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may know that on April 30 the minister requested the 
Standing Committee on Transport and Government Operations to 
examine the rules governing commercial drivers' hours of service. 
The matter is therefore the subject of a separate examination, 
one that is distinct from the bill before us today.  I understand 
the committee has already started those hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated earlier, the federal government has the 
constitutional authority to regulate extraprovincial motor 
carrier undertakings.  The amendments being debated today will 
enable provincial and territorial governments to apply the new 
national safety rating regime to federally regulated motor 
carriers as well as to local carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practical terms this means that a province will be authorized 
to issue safety fitness certificates to all motor carriers 
registered in that province.  Clearly in a national program it is 
important that carriers are rated in a similar fashion in every 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A carrier has the right to receive the same safety rating in 
every province or territory for comparable safety performance. 
For this reason the bill establishes a framework for nationally 
consistent safety ratings.  The certificate will be the carrier's 
permission to operate anywhere in Canada: one stop shopping at 
its best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The volume of Canada-U.S. motor carrier traffic has increased 
dramatically, threefold since 1991.  Bill S-3 recognizes that 
fact and contains provisions to encourage reciprocal recognition 
of motor carrier safety supervision in other countries, 
particularly our immediate neighbour, the U.S. and our next 
closest continental trading partner, Mexico.  In this way motor 
carriers can look forward to seamless treatment from safety 
regulators north to south on the North American continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by drawing the attention of the House to the 
partnership and co-operation that exists among governments and 
stakeholders in the area of motor carrier safety.  The national 
safety code for motor carriers is the product of a 
federal-provincial-territorial memorandum of understanding signed 
in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National safety code standards are developed and maintained by 
federal-provincial committees that also comprise industry, labour 
and public interest groups.  Since the inception of the code all 
governments have made a strong effort to develop national 
approaches to motor carrier regulation, including vehicle and 
driver licensing training and enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today reflects the resulting progress.  Since 
1987 we have moved from a patchwork of local regulations toward 
consistent national safety regulations.  This process is not 
necessarily completely to the satisfaction of all safety interest 
groups or the national and international motor carrier industry. 
However there is serious interest by all governments and other 
participants to see it progress and keep progressing to achieve 
maximum safety results with efficient implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard the Canadian Council of Ministers of Transport is 
preparing a memorandum to update the original 1987 document to 
re-energize the national commitment to harmonization of safety 
regimes.  The minister expects the council of ministers 
responsible for transport and highway safety will consider this 
document at its meeting in September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes a framework for a program founded on the 
national safety code and administered by provincial governments 
in a consistent manner toward all motor carriers.  We believe 
that this co-operative arrangement is the best way to achieve the 
highest feasible level of safety for commercial vehicle operation 
throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, road fatalities in Canada are at their lowest 
level in history.  In spite of this, road accidents still kill 
nearly 3,000 Canadians a year and cost Canadian society over $10 
billion annually.  The toll in human suffering cannot be 
measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments need to keep road safety a priority.  The bill 
to amend the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987, is one of several 
important steps toward improving highway safety in Canada.  The 
bill is a product of consultation and consensus and is founded on 
partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of the bill will provide an important impetus for a 
continuing co-operative process among governments, industry and 
public interest groups, building on work that has already been 
accomplished.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would apply safety regulation based on real life

America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and 
with the provincial ministers, together with the motor carrier 
industry, to further the improvement of highway safety in Canada 
as provided for in this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will indicate at the outset that the Canadian 
Alliance is supportive of the bill.  That does not mean the bill 
is perfect.  We feel that the bill is a half measure.  The bill 
deals with the important issue of highway safety in the country 
and that is a worthwhile area for public policy and for 
government to be involved with.  I will spend some time talking 
about the role of the private sector in this whole area and also 
about the areas the bill missed the boat on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the improvements I have seen in 
highway safety because of innovation by the private sector.  My 
learned colleague mentioned anti-lock brakes.  Anti-lock brakes 
were developed in the private sector.  The government was very 
quick to pick up on that, take credit for it and make a 
regulation.  However, anti-lock brakes were developed by the 
industry before government even thought of them.  The area of 
airbags is another area where the industry was away ahead of 
government.  As well, the reliability of motor vehicles on our 
roads today is far superior to that of the vehicles we had 20, 30 
or 40 years ago and there are more innovations on the way.  Fuel 
economy has improved tremendously and from an environmental 
standpoint that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has industry been able to improve the safety and quality of 
motor vehicles?  Is it because of government regulation and bills 
such as this one?  I think not.  It has more to do with a 
competitive global market in which industry cannot stand still. 
Industry has to constantly improve its products.  Improvements 
also have a lot to do with something called ISO, the 
international standard that assures quality in parts and in the 
system of putting products together.  ISO probably has a lot more 
to do with safety than any bill that this House could pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise these issues to acknowledge the private sector's 
contributions to improved safety on our highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My learned colleague pointed out that there has been a massive 
move into truck transportation in Canada.  For the most part, the 
reason we have had a massive movement into truck transportation 
in the country is the government's failure to move on modernizing 
our rail transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had two excellent reports on rail 
transportation, the Estey commission and the Kroeger report, but 
has been very slow to respond to those reports and modernize the 
rail system.  A lot of shippers are being forced to use the 
highways and to use trucks.  From a safety standpoint I would 
suggest that there are a lot of products being moved by truck 
that should be moved by rail.  There are hazardous products out 
on congested highways such as the 401 highway and if there is an 
accident there is a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rail is a much more suitable means of transporting a lot of 
these goods, but because of our reluctance to modernize our rail 
system a lot of shippers are forced into shipping by highways 
whether they like it or not.  In that respect government is the 
problem, not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to another point.  I am sure that if you asked 
truckers or people who are on our highways a lot what their 
single biggest safety concern is today, they would say it is the 
highway system, the roads they have to drive on.  The roads are 
falling apart.  They are full of holes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone from my part of the country who wants to take a summer 
trip to visit relatives in Ontario or Quebec, unless they have 
their heads screwed on wrong, will find the first interstate in 
the United States and drive through the U.S. to get to Ontario or 
Quebec.  They do not use our national highway system because the 
roads are just not that good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises a point.  The bill misses a very important angle. 
The government collects $4.5 billion in fuel taxes. Approximately 
5% of that goes back into our highway system.  That is not the 
policy in other countries.  Other countries have policies whereby 
fuel taxes are reinvested in infrastructure and highway systems. 
The U.S. is a good example.  That is why it has its interstate 
system and a good highway system.  However this government 
refuses to deal with that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise another point.  There is a philosophy that is 
far too prevalent in the government, which is that the solution 
to a problem is more government, more laws, more regulation and 
more bureaucracy.  The government thinks that is the way to get 
results.  It has been my experience and the experience of many 
other people that if we want results we need a plan, teamwork, 
co-operation, vision, management and enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is too quick to create more bureaucracy, more 
laws and more regulations.  It forgets about all the other 
components that make for good public policy.  The government's 
attitude is that if we wanted a Canadian team to win the Stanley 
Cup next year we would pass a law saying it is the Montreal 
Canadiens' turn to win the Stanley Cup.  It would pass a law in 
the House of Commons and dictate that result.  We know that is 
not how the world works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want a result we have to manage that result.  Passing laws 
will not solve a problem.  Last week there was a good case in 
point.  Everyone in the House basically got up in support of the 
feel good motion about safe water in Canada, but no one in the 
House addressed the real question, which is how we are going to 
get modern water treatment systems into all the communities 
across the country.  The assumption of course is that if the 
federal government passes a law, we will solve the problem. If we 
look at the fisheries, we see that we have more people in the 
fisheries department than we have fishermen, I think, and look at 
what has happened to our fisheries.  If the federal government is 
so darned good at water, why are most people, even aboriginals on 
their reserves, reluctant to drink tap water? Reserves are an 
area that federal government has had jurisdiction over for 125 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is the government's approach:  more government, 
more regulation and more bureaucracy.  The government thinks that 
if we get enough of that sort of thing in place somehow through 
the vast weight of the state we will get some results.  I think 
there is a better way of doing things and I wish the government 
would start to look at it.  The auditor general has been pointing 
out for eight or nine years now that the government just does not 
get results.  It comes up with these feel good bills and laws, 
passes more laws and regulations and hires more bureaucrats, but 
the results are not there.  In fact, sometimes they are 
counterproductive, but I guess it makes my colleagues on the 
other side of the House feel good at night because they say all 
these warm, fuzzy things in the House about safety and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would say that the bill is a half measure.  If 
we expect government to have regulations, laws and bureaucracy in 
place, the Liberal government is strong in those areas.  It knows 
how to do that and thinks that the more laws, regulations and 
bureaucracy we have, the better things are.  However, in a lot of 
the other areas the government is deficient.  The biggest single 
deficiency in the bill is the biggest safety issue we have in 
highway transportation in the country:  the state of our roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the government side pointed out that there has 
been a massive movement of transportation on our highways, 
especially extraprovincial. 
That is a federal area, if I understand my law correctly.  When 
we move into extra-provincial issues, that is federal 
jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the government's commitment to building our highway 
system and getting it up to high standards?  In the bill there 
are high standards for motor vehicles, the operators and 
everything else, but it completely misses the roads on which 
these vehicles have to drive.  It has not done a darned thing 
about them.  It runs away from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the water safety bill ever becomes law, I am sure the real 
omission in that area will be that the federal government will 
just not put the money into it.  I recall the government moving 
into the health area, which is a provincial jurisdiction, with 
the five principles of the Canada Health Act and all the rest of 
it.  However, how much funding does it provide?  It provides 
something like 13% of the health care budget.  This is a bad 
habit of the federal government.  It intrudes into an area, 
passes laws and then does not provide sufficient funding to make 
the plan work.  The thing then falls off the rails, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill but we are not enthusiastic supporters.  It 
is a typical Liberal half measure.  The Liberals always lean 
toward more regulation, more government and more bureaucracy and 
forget the other things that are required to really manage a 
result.  If we do not have those ingredients, we will have 
limited results from the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since I became the transport critic, at the beginning 
of the session, the Bloc Quebecois has supported with 
reservation the bills dealing with transport put forward by the 
government, because a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
This time, however, the Bloc will oppose Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill concerns the safety of motor vehicle transport. 
Theoretically, that is a bill designed to say it all, which ends 
up saying nothing. Why? Simply because the government is basing 
the whole bill on the National Safety Code for Motor Carriers, 
which is already in force. 
For many years, the provinces have been trying to harmonize a 
series of measures to ensure that road safety standards are 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well for the government to put on kid gloves and 
say “Today we are tabling a bill on road safety”, go on about 
the number of road accidents and claim to be this great advocate 
of safety in this country, but there remains a harsh reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety is not only a matter of quality of the work done by 
truckers. It is also a matter of road conditions. We do not see 
federal money getting into provincial treasuries to help the 
provinces put in place an effective highway network in Canada, a 
network safe not only for trucking users but also for all those 
who share the road with these huge vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This safety component, which was intended as a true highway 
renovation program across Canada, does not originate with this 
government.  I was present at the last meeting of the Standing 
Committee on Transport when the President of the Treasury Board 
presented the allocation figures.  There is still the same good 
old figure of $600 million hanging around in the federal 
government's coffers for the next five years for all highway 
projects throughout Canada.  In the last election campaign, in 
Quebec alone, the federal government promised $3.220 billion in 
investments, whereas the total figure allocated for the next 
five years is a mere $600 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A true policy, a true bill on highway safety could have involved 
the industry but needed to involve government as well, in order 
to ensure significant investment in the quality of the highways 
across Canada and, of course and above all, across Quebec. 
A true highway safety program, a true highway safety bill, 
should have included a whole chapter, a whole component, on 
highway renovations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to this bill, there must also be an understanding of 
the desire for a Canadian highway safety code, saying “We will 
harmonize our efforts with the provinces”.  A little realism is 
required about all the work the provinces are trying to do to 
harmonize their legislation.  We are not telling all those 
listening to us, all the people of Quebec, anything new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be an understanding of the provinces, who have the 
responsibility for highway safety.  Besides, the bill states 
that safety is a provincial jurisdiction, and declares that all 
highway safety legislation in each of the provinces is valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand that the provinces are working together to 
harmonize their extraprovincial transportation standards. As we 
speak, they still have not managed to agree on a procedure, a 
modus operandi, that would satisfy all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduces Bill S-3 and says “Here, we are 
dealing with road safety throughout Canada”. It says in this 
bill that safety is a provincial responsibility. What it fails 
to say is that, as we speak, there is still no harmonization 
between the provinces, between the governments, with respect to 
a safety system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we, in the Bloc Quebecois, can support such a bill, 
efforts will have to be made in the field. 
Mere wishful thinking, introducing legislation and claiming to 
be the champion of road and highway safety throughout Canada is 
not enough. The government must at least be sensible and 
realistic about the implementation problems in the territories 
and about the will to have a Canadian-wide safety standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what we have to consider, before such a bill is voted 
on, is harmonizing the definition of basic jurisdiction using as 
models—and these are only suggestions—the International Fuel Tax 
Agreement and the International Registration Plan, to state that 
the basic jurisdiction must be the Canadian place of residence 
of the carrier or the place where he carries out the most part 
of his activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus a base of operations must be designated if carriers are to 
be held accountable under some legislation. To begin with, we 
must agree on a definition, which we do not at the moment. In 
none of the provinces throughout Canada is there agreement on a 
base of operations for which each administration could be held 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also establish, in each administration, rating systems 
with compatible ratings. It is all very well to say that 
throughout Canada we have a road safety system. But, to some 
extent, we must be able to monitor the trucker, the 
extraprovincial trucker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have an rating system to monitor him in order to rate 
his behaviour, and this system must be consistent throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in this regard, the federal government does not have the 
authority to implement a road safety regime. 
This authority rests with each of the provinces. So we must have 
an acceptable rating system approved by each province before 
introducing a bill on road safety and saying to good Quebecers 
and Canadians that we are dealing with road safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be able to rate the drivers, those who make a living 
from the system and the industry. We must be able to rate them 
to ensure that they perform adequately and, ultimately, to make 
them accountable, and to rate them through a system that is 
consistent throughout Canada, which is not the case now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government is saying to citizens of Quebec “Look, the 
federal government is dealing with road safety”.  The problem is 
that there is no rating system, no way to find out if a driver 
is really reliable.  There is no process in place by which we 
could track him, monitor his activities in each of the provinces 
and set standards that would make it possible for the industry 
to know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough for the industry to be accountable.  The 
industry must also be able to know what is going on in each of 
the provinces where some extraprovincial activity is occurring, 
and that is not the case at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must develop a tool to assess each and all of the behaviour 
elements referred to in standard No. 14. 
They implement a standard, standard No. 14, which the government 
member praised earlier, but that standard is based on the 
national safety code for motor carriers and we should be in a 
position to assess it, at least to some extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must check all the regulations adopted by each of the 
provincial administrations to be able to follow the carriers and 
the industries, to be able to rate them, to reprimand them if 
needed, with some consistency, and that is not provided for in 
this legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there is still no agreement among the 
provinces, which are responsible for road safety.  They are 
doing a very good job within their territorial limits, but what 
they have to do is harmonize with each other, which is plainly 
admitted in this bill.  Each province is being given authority 
for enforcement.  This bill gives official recognition to the 
road safety standards of each of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that, before introducing this bill and telling 
the Canadians and Quebecers who are listening that there will be 
one trucking safety code, the government did not look into 
whether it would be feasible and whether it would be possible to 
monitor the industry throughout Canada, so that carriers are 
given the fines they deserve and, if things go well, good 
behaviour is recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for comparable monitoring from one 
administration to another.  Our goal is to have standards that 
are similar to within about 5%, and to monitor carriers and 
administrations Canada-wide.  In this country, we should always 
be able to monitor between point A and point B, or between one 
ocean and the other. 
We should be able to monitor effectively and have standards that 
are understandable and understood by the industry in each of the 
provinces, which is not now the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is introducing a bill and telling the public 
“After this bill is passed, there will be one Canadian safety 
code enforced across Canada”.  The problem is that, when it 
comes right down to it, this is still wishful thinking.  This 
bill will not be enforceable, because this is an area that comes 
under provincial jurisdiction and the provinces have not yet 
managed to reach an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for lack of trying.  On the contrary.  But there are 
important industry lobbies in each of the provinces and they are 
trying to maintain the existing systems. 
We should give provincial and territorial authorities, and 
agencies in charge of road safety a chance to set up standards, 
have discussions and reach an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have called a meeting of all relevant 
provincial agencies before introducing such an important bill 
and stating “We now have a safety code in effect throughout 
Canada; do not worry, we are taking care of you”. The problem is 
we do not know how this code will be working in each 
jurisdiction, for the simple reason that harmonization is 
lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to develop in each jurisdiction a penalty system 
setting out the action that will be taken against carriers who 
do not comply, and keep reducing ratings until their permits are 
eventually cancelled. 
We need a process to do this. If we want to have a follow up and 
to ensure the safety of the transport network, we must be able 
to monitor the industry and the carriers, record their offences 
and deduct merit points and eventually revoke their permit. That 
is the way to get a national safety code that will work in all 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find a way to evaluate the efficiency of the assessment 
mechanism based on the results. If we are to have a national 
code in effect throughout Canada, we should make sure the 
provincial agencies in charge have a common harmonized standard, 
a follow-up plan to monitor the carriers, a penalty system that 
is complementary and easily accessible for all agencies through 
electronic means or otherwise, and an evaluation plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough to say “We are putting a plan in place”. 
We must do a follow up, determine whether the carriers did 
something wrong, list these wrongdoings and even cancel 
licences, if need be. And all the provincial authorities must 
have easy access to the registry of cancelled licences, because, 
as I said, they have to enforce the Canadian code, under the 
terms of the bill. The provinces have the responsibility ,but 
they do not have a common rating system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, it will be very difficult for the industry to 
organize, because the provinces do not yet have a common system 
to follow up on the carrier and enforce safety standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could use a conformity registry, a negative points system or 
another similar system that would make the carrier understand 
that, over a certain number of infractions, he could lose his 
licence. There is no such system and it is not the federal 
government's responsibility to implement one. It is the 
provinces' jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, there is no harmonization. The Quebec government did 
not harmonize its standards, but it is holding very serious 
discussions with the neighbouring provinces. There are almost 
daily exchanges between governments on the harmonization of road 
safety standards, to protect the public. 
The industry must understand these laws, there must be a 
carryover from one province to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, the provincial governments have no objection. 
They all agree on the need for a uniform standard across Canada 
that each of them may apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that they have not managed to select a standard 
and to agree on a way to harmonize it between provinces.  The 
systems must be effective so statistics may be compiled on the 
carriers, their progress followed, infractions revealed, 
potentially resulting in the cancellation of their 
extraprovincial licences.  Once again, these licences are given 
by the provinces and followed by them.  So the whole system of 
harmonization must be in place before such a bill is voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, this bill was meant to provide for everything, but, in 
the end, it provides for nothing.  This is another example of a 
government trying to make political hay over highway transport 
safety.  This is a very complex area, and all the provinces 
daily face the problems that highway transport on the roads of 
Quebec and Canada can cause.  In Quebec, this is a daily 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone wants greater safety.  It takes a modicum of ability to 
get it to happen, to ensure it is respected, to ensure it is 
applied uniformly across Canada, something that is not the case 
at the moment.  Once again, our Liberal federal government has 
decided to introduce prematurely a bill intended to say it all 
and, in the end, says nothing.  We oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A harmonization table between the provincial governments should 
have been created, so that the result of its work could have 
been communicated before the introduction of this bill, whose 
purpose is to tell Quebecers and Canadians “Look, we have a 
Canadian road transportation safety code. We just passed an act 
giving it effect”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will not be possible to implement this code, because 
there is no harmonization between the provincial administrations 
responsible for road safety, which is a provincial jurisdiction. 
The only positive thing about this bill is that it states that 
road safety is a provincial jurisdiction. 
If it is a provincial jurisdiction, then the government should 
wait until the provinces harmonize their systems to be able to 
closely follow a carrier who does not comply with the standards 
or breaks the law and, if possible, cancel his licence if he is 
responsible for too many accidents, or if he commits too many 
offences under that safety program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message that the Bloc Quebecois wants to convey. I 
will conclude by saying that Quebecers, and surely all 
Canadians, would have appreciated finding in this bill a part 
dealing with the upgrading of Canada's highways. This 
infrastructure deserves a lot more than the $600 million the 
federal government has earmarked for the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amount of $600 million to be spent through partnerships 
across Canada, on a 50-50 basis with the provinces, means that if 
we only relied on federal investments for highway transportation 
across Canada, a mere $1.2 billion would be spent over the next 
five years on a very extensive highway system that deserves a 
lot more funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that Liberal members knew this very well because, 
during the election campaign, they promised to invest $3.2 
billion in Quebec alone. These investments were to made rapidly. 
They promised bridges and roads. Finally, they promised to 
improve the whole system throughout Quebec. Imagine, an election 
promise of $3.2 billion for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in terms of appropriations, the federal government only 
set aside $600 million for 50/50 agreements with some provinces, 
agreements totalling $1.2 billion of work throughout Canada, 
despite promises of $3.2 billion in Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means once again that the government can still fool some of 
the people to win an election. But with this bill, the Bloc 
Quebecois will not be fooled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot introduce a bill that purports to be the 
champion of people's safety, when it knows full well that this 
bill is not applicable in any of the administrations at this 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today on behalf of the New Democratic Party on 
second reading of Bill S-3, an act to amend the Motor Vehicle 
Transport Act, 1987 and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are going to be supporting this bill.  It 
certainly is not perfect, as many other people have said earlier 
in this debate but it is a start, and we need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes a framework for harmonizing the way 
different provinces administer parts of the national safety code 
for motor carriers.  The national safety code pertains to both 
buses and transport trucks and is administered at the provincial 
level.  It was introduced by the Mulroney government in 1987 in 
response to safety concerns that arose due to the deregulation of 
the trucking industry.  However federal government left the 
provinces to adopt and administer the code themselves.  So far 
none have fully adopted it.  In essence the national safety code, 
therefore is nothing more than a set of suggestions which is a 
major concern for New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework established in this bill would allow provinces and 
territories whose safety compliance regimes are compatible with 
the national safety code to give extra provincial bus 
undertakings a safety rating and issue safety certificates.  This 
is a nice idea but functionally useless unless all or most of the 
provinces adopt the code.  This does not appear likely to happen 
in the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the Canadian Truckers Alliance, the safety code 
harmonization framework is “putting the cart before the horse”. 
Regardless of what administrative framework the federal 
government comes up with, the national safety code will remain 
toothless unless the provinces adopt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has the constitutional authority to 
impose the national safety code on the provinces but is not doing 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Road safety, as was mentioned several times earlier, is the 
central concern of everyone in the House.  We can write all the 
bills we want, but quite frankly we all know the highways that we 
drive on are in many cases treacherous at this time of year. They 
have potholes, cracks and great divides.  These are very damaging 
to our cars and very often cause accidents between trucks and 
cars on our highways.  I am sure Nova Scotia is right up there 
with Churchill, Manitoba and with many other parts of our 
Trans-Canada Highway as being a national disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what is the Liberal government doing about road 
safety?  It is one thing to have this bill but the real question 
is one of road safety.  We need safe highways.  We need a real 
road infrastructure program that is going to at the end of the 
day make it safe to drive from one end of the country to the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For starters, I would suggest in this respect that we need to 
see some real investment in improving our highways.  Every year 
over 200 Canadians are killed because of bad roads and 16,000 
more are injured. 
These statistics are of accidents caused by bad roads, not by 
driver error, bad weather, drunk drivers or problems with 
vehicles.  They are accidents caused by problems with the road. 
Again it has to do with improving the infrastructure and putting 
money into our roads.  These accidents alone kill hundreds of 
Canadians and injure tens of thousands each year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies have shown that if the government would spend $1 billion 
a year improving our highways for the next 20 years, the roadwork 
would pay for itself in the form of lower health care costs 
because of fewer accidents.  It would pay for itself in terms of 
disability payments and the many additional costs involved in 
road accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that because it is a remarkable fact.  Fixing our 
highways could actually save the government more money in health 
care costs than it would cost to fix the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the bill.  It is not perfect, but it 
would be useful some day when we have a federal government with 
the conviction and the determination to make the safety of 
Canadian highways a priority and turn the national safety code 
into something relevant, instead of just a set of suggestions 
that none of the provinces follow.  We will support the bill at 
this stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the intent of Bill C-10 without a doubt is a very 
laudable intent.  In taking a look at the condition of our oceans 
and waterways, not only in Canada but indeed around the world, 
the environment has to be protected.  There can be absolutely no 
question about that.  There are many areas of degradation which 
have occurred and continue to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is a good one.  Coming as it does though 
under the auspices of the heritage department, we have some idea 
of what the heritage department is capable of doing, particularly 
with respect to preservation in parks.  We therefore have an idea 
of some of the challenges that face the department, indeed some 
of the challenges that have been created by the department for 
people who also have the laudable intent to protect the 
environment under parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should briefly take a look at the template or pattern we 
have.  We know Canada's oldest national park, Banff National 
Park, is under a tremendous amount of pressure, created in no 
small part by human beings.  The resulting pressure, which has 
been created to the changes of the flora and the fauna, has 
impacted the wildlife in the area.  What has been the response of 
the park and what is some of the history relative to Banff and 
indeed the four mountain parks?

and a whole tourist infrastructure over a period of time.  If we 
look at Banff Park as an example, believe it or not the town site 
generates almost three quarters of a billion dollars a year in 
gross domestic product.  It is a gigantic amount of money which 
comes into Canada, and in no small part from Europe and 
particularly from the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the projects around the park, care was taken over 
a period of time to get a proper balance to ensure that the park 
would be preserved for future generations of Canadians.  What has 
occurred though, and it has become clear, is that some of the 
provisions to take into account the pressure which this would 
create on the environment within the park have some distinct 
deficiencies.  As a consequence, some gapping holes have been 
left in what was formerly the very pristine wilderness area, not 
the least of which of course is the location of the town site of 
Banff itself.  This has a direct bearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-10, Parks Canada would be responsible for the 
enactment for the use of the legislation. As a consequence, if we 
look at the way it has its work historically on land, what would 
the results be in terms of marine conservation area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is a fact that, if we were to take a species like the 
grizzly within the confines of Banff Park, clearly the habitat of 
the grizzly has been very seriously negatively impacted.  As a 
consequence there are fewer and fewer grizzlies in that area. 
Furthermore, with the number of visitors going into Banff Park it 
is undesirable that there would be an increased amount of 
interaction between grizzlies and human beings.  The two are 
simply not compatible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean relative to Bill C-10?  If we look at the 
number of interests with respect to ocean and Great Lakes areas, 
we will find that commercial and recreational interests are 
already in place in many of these situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to come to an accommodation of the environment, the 
flora, fauna and the animals contained within a park, it strikes 
me that Parks Canada has swung the pendulum absolutely to the 
opposite end of the spectrum.  Instead of now saying we have 
created the situation where human beings, tourists, from all five 
continents can come and enjoy what we have, because of these 
experiences there will be a cost to the wildlife in the area. 
There is a very strong swing to the entire idea of absolute 
conservation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a movement to ban any human interaction into the 
back country within the four mountain parks of Banff, Jasper, 
Yoho and Kootenay.  Yoho and Kootenay are parks that are in my 
constituency.  These back country areas basically account for 90% 
of the park.  If we look at it through a very simplistic lens, it 
is probably a commendable thing to do, but it really is not 
because it does a couple of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that there is far more pressure brought into the 
remaining 10% of the park with far more wear and tear.  I will 
give an example.  Many of us have carpets in our homes or we have 
seen carpets in commercial areas.  If we had people walking over 
the entire carpet it may last for many years, even 50, 60 or 70 
years.  Theoretically a carpet could last that long even with a 
great number of people walking over the entire area.  The problem 
is if we confine them to only 10% of that area we have wear marks 
and have to replace the entire carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may be a weak analogy, but it presents a picture of what is 
currently happening within our park structure.  With the correct 
intention of not wanting interaction in the back country human 
interaction in over 90% of the area would be excluded.  That is a 
very laudable objective, but it has not been fully thought out 
because of the wear and tear on the last 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to learn from what we are doing on land within 
Parks Canada to see how we might apply these things when it comes 
to lakes, rivers and oceans.  The difficulty is that under the 
legislation there is a sufficient amount of discretion on the 
part of the government.  We may see government whims gaining 
speed and decisions swinging back and forth like a pendulum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have some very legitimate concerns and a commitment to 
preserving what we have in terms of aquifer, species, flora and 
fauna that exist below the surface of the water.  These people 
share the concern of Parks Canada and governments.  They are 
saying that if we have not learned how to correctly do what we 
need to do on land, what will we be doing with respect to the 
parks or the water area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for Edmonton North. 
Taking a look at intent is one thing, but we should also keep in 
mind the legislation and history.  For example, we created a 
situation in Kootenay National Park, which is in my constituency, 
that does not make any sense.   At one point there was no road 
there.  The road I am referring to is now called Banff-Windermere 
Highway 93-97.  It ends up circling its way down from Lake 
Louise, up over Storm Mountain, down into the Kootenay River, up 
over the top and into Windermere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bottleneck at Sinclair Canyon, which is right between 
Radium Hot Springs and the town of Radium itself.  Sinclair 
Canyon is exceptionally narrow and only wide enough for a two 
lane highway.  As a matter of fact a river went through the 
canyon that has rock going about 200 to 300 feet straight up in 
the air.  We put in a two lane highway at that particular point 
and had to dig the river underneath the highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the national parks built Radium Hot Springs, it encouraged 
service providers and private industry to build chalets, 
bungalows and tourist accommodations so people could enjoy the 
hot springs.  These people have ended up having a constant, 
neverending battle that has been increasing in noise to the point 
where they are now talking about removing those facilities at a 
cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayers.  Why?  They say it 
is because it is a wildlife corridor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not have been a wildlife corridor in the past, 
particularly for the larger animals, without the highway there. 
Putting in the highway meant that the animals could now, at very 
low traffic times, walk back and forth through Sinclair Canyon 
while dodging the 18-wheelers and the ore trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be spending $4 million to $6 million to buy out the 
tourist service providers.  These service providers are people 
who have been paying taxes and fees to Parks Canada.  Not only 
will we spend $4 million to $6 million to remove those facilities 
but in addition we will lose the revenue from the facilities once 
we have removed them.  This is the concern that I have with Bill 
C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize this will be the fifth or sixth time that I have said 
this but I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that the 
Canadian Alliance is in favour of the intent of Bill C-10. The 
difficulty is that once the bill is enacted it would be under the 
control of Parks Canada which has a history of not managing its 
assets very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are people on the Queen Charlotte Islands who 
have seen the establishment of a park on the islands.  They have 
also seen the husbandry of the Department of Canadian Heritage 
with respect to the west coast trail and all these things. Parks 
Canada's track record makes people concerned and nervous about 
the commercial access to the Pacific Ocean, and I understand 
their nervousness.  It does not have a good track record of 
consistency and of following through on a prescribed course of 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consistently accused Parks Canada of using the word 
consultation as a noun instead of a verb.  It says that it had 
consultation.  No, it did not.  It came out and let people talk 
but it had already made up its mind.  Consultation is a noun, not 
a verb.  It is not a form of action.  On the basis of the history 
of Parks Canada, it is with a tremendous amount of trepidation 
and concern that we look at Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are literally hundreds of examples but I would like to 
present one or two more. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba has an area with a lot 
of natural grasses.  Back in 1910 someone decided to plant some 
spruce trees.  Those spruce trees did very well and grew to be 
very tall, straight, clear spruce.  This wood is almost 
priceless. Each tree is counted in the thousands of dollars. Then 
some people from Parks Canada said that the trees did not really 
belong there, that we should get rid of them.  Not only did they 
chop them down and uproot them, they burned them.  Does that make 
sense?  Hundreds of thousands of dollars in trees were chopped up 
for firewood so the grasslands could be restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume that the Creator did not intend there to be trees 
there and that someone planted them. By the same token, we could 
go to Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland, which is an 
absolute wonder.  It is a wonderful place to go and I recommend 
it to all Canadians if they want to see something absolutely 
spectacular and be treated wonderfully by the people in Rocky 
Harbour and Corner Brook.  The park has moose like we have never 
seen before.  Mr. Speaker, I know you have very large moose in 
your constituency but we could have a contest with these moose. 
They are that big and there are about 7,000 moose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gros Morne is kind of interesting.  It is like the top of a 
mountain that has been taken off.  It is perfect moose country 
full of marshland.  In its brilliance, in the same way that 
someone planted the spruce trees, Parks Canada decided to import 
moose to Newfoundland, a place they should never have been.  As a 
consequence, Gros Morne is literally being eaten into extinction 
by the moose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone said that there should be a culling of the moose. Heaven 
forbid, we could never do that.  Parks Canada can chop down the 
trees and burn up invaluable wood, but it cannot have anything to 
do with the management of that area because moose are animals 
that walk on the earth.  The inconsistency of Parks Canada in its 
management, as I stated, gives us great pause for concern with 
respect to Bill C-10.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to 
speak to Bill C-10 to create national marine conservation areas 
in Canada. This bill comes back to us under a different form 
that during the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must say that the Bloc is in favour of measures aimed 
at protecting the environment. Speaking of that, we can all 
recall how successful the creation of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park was. 
It ought to have served as a model for this bill to ensure that 
the necessary consultations were carried out so that, in the 
end, the measures taken and the management of the marine 
conservation areas respect the various jurisdictions and the 
initiatives taken by the various governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples of this, such as Vision 2000 and other projects 
where the jurisdictions were taken into account and where some 
interesting results have been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, is it because it is a more general bill, a kind of 
umbrella act, which will establish a general framework for the 
management of marine conservation areas, that the consultations 
do not seem to have been carried out appropriately and to 
respect what we would like to seeas the bottom line? 
To those of us on this side, the consultations do not seem to 
have been carried out properly and do not seem to respect what 
we would like to see as the bottom line.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, instead of focusing on collaborative efforts, 
as was the case for the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, with 
this bill the federal government will have the right to create 
marine conservation areas without regard for Quebec's 
jurisdiction over its territory and its environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to having a problem with the provinces as far as 
jurisdiction is concerned, there are also areas within the bill 
that are not very clear as far as the future relationship 
between Heritage Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada is 
concerned.  We have experienced certain rather patent examples 
of difficulties with Heritage Canada, in connection with 
management of the ecosystem.  This does not necessarily strike 
us as being very promising for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is the overlap and duplication of Fisheries 
and Oceans-protected and Environment Canada-protected zones.  This 
means that, even within the federal government, there is no 
clear vision of marine area management, because several 
departments are involved.  The wording of this bill does not 
seem to reflect what we might have expected in terms of 
qualifying the situation.  What we have instead is something 
that requires more time and more work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois considers this bill 
unacceptable in its present form.  It does not respect the 
territorial integrity of Quebec.  For example, one of the 
conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
area is to be established.   One of the clauses relating to this 
states that the minister cannot establish a marine conservation 
area, unless, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Governor in Council is satisfied that Her Majesty in right 
of Canada has clear title to or an unencumbered right of 
ownership in the lands to be included in the marine conservation 
area, other than such lands situated within the exclusive 
economic zone of Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in this, therefore, an approach very different from that 
used, as I was saying earlier, in the case of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park, where the government agreed to respect 
provincial ownership of the riverbed and, thus, build a model 
that was unique and that respected the jurisdictions of each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
the management and sale of crown lands are matters of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.  The bill before us does not totally 
respect this jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the same Constitution Act provides that Quebec 
cannot transfer its lands to the federal government and can only 
authorize the federal government, by order, to use them under 
its federal jurisdiction.  Finally, the protection of habitats 
and fauna is a matter of joint federal and provincial 
jurisdiction, and the Government of Quebec plans to establish a 
framework for the protection of marine areas in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, in the context of the consultations, it would have 
been a good idea to take this plan into consideration, in order 
to achieve a successful outcome in the end.  We spoke of 
examples of the right of way of doing things.  I mentioned the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, but there is the third phase 
of the St. Lawrence action plan, another example to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the federal and Quebec ministers of the environment 
announced the third phase of the St. Lawrence action plan, 
representing a total bill of $230 million to be shared equally 
by both levels of government.  One of the objectives of this 
action plan is to increase the area of protected habitats by 
100% from 12,000 hectares to 120,000 hectares.  The third phase 
follows on the first two phases, in which both governments 
invested over $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This co-operation we find in specific projects such as the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park and the third phase of the St. 
Lawrence action plan, we would also liked to find it in the 
present bill.  On reading it, we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important consideration is the fact that jurisdiction 
over the environment is shared, and so both the provinces and 
the federal government have responsibilities for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, section 91 of the Constitution Act provides that 
“the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada 
extends to all Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects 
next herein-after enumerated; that is to say,—...Navigation and 
Shipping...Quarantine and the Establishment and Maintenance of 
Marine Hospitals...Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries...Ferries 
between a Province and any British or Foreign Country or between 
Two Provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This basically sums up the content of the Constitution Act, 
1867, as regards the federal government's responsibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's jurisdiction is also recognized in certain sections of 
the British North America Act, including section 92, which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in 
relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next 
herein-after enumerated; that is to say—...The Management and Sale 
of the Public Lands belonging to the Province and of the Timber 
and Wood thereon...Property and Civil Rights in the 
Province...Generally all Matters of a merely local or private 
Nature in the Province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, some co-ordination is required to ensure that the federal 
acts respect this jurisdiction. The Constitution Act, 1867, also 
states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each province, the legislature may exclusively make laws in 
relation to 
(<I>a</I>) exploration for non-renewable natural resources in the 
province; 
(<I>b</I>) development, conservation and management of non-renewable 
natural resources and forestry resources in the province, 
including laws in relation to the rate of primary production 
therefrom— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, this bill should involve some kind of partnership that 
does not currently exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park could have 
been followed as an essential condition to the creation of 
marine conservation areas, as far as land ownership is concerned. 
If the bill is passed as it now stands, the federal government 
could set up marine conservation areas on the seabed that it 
claims as its property and ignore Quebec's jurisdiction over the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not satisfactory for the Bloc Quebecois and it also 
breaks a tradition I referred to earlier, a tradition of 
co-operation, which could have led to the establishment of 
interesting programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all the more frustrating and questionable, because this is 
framework legislation, which will define the way the federal 
government will act in this field. The government is proposing 
new principles as far as respect of mutual jurisdictions is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the federal government intends to create marine 
conservation areas under the responsibility of Heritage Canada, 
marine protection areas under the responsibility of Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada and marine wildlife areas under the 
responsibility of Environment Canada. This covers a lot of 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could for example end up with one site with several zonings, 
each one of these departments considering that there is, 
according to its own criteria, a marine reserve or marine 
protection area for Fisheries and Ocean Canada, a marine reserve 
for Environment Canada or a marine conservation area for 
Heritage Canada. Then, in each of these cases, there would be 
three monitoring levels, three jurisdictions for three different 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could give an example. 
If Heritage Canada felt that certain wrecks in the St. Lawrence 
River had a historic role that deserved to be recognized and the 
environment was part of the conservation area, but Environment 
Canada wanted this same location recognized as a marine reserve 
for fauna, and there were a contradiction between the two, it is 
clear that the bill does not contain the desired logic to settle 
the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not fair to wonder today whether, ultimately, this bill 
will not create even more confusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it will. 
We believe that the fact that the bill allows each of the 
federal departments to maintain its jurisdiction over marine 
conservation areas may end up creating total confusion.  As we 
explained earlier, with three departments having jurisdiction 
and being able to define marine conservation areas according to 
their own different objectives, the final results might not be 
consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that, when the Department of Canadian 
Heritage deems it appropriate, it may, in co-operation with the 
minister concerned, pass regulations, in respect of a marine 
conservation area, which differ from the existing provisions. 
In such a case, the amendment arrived at between Heritage Canada 
and the minister concerned takes precedence over the other 
regulations passed under the Fisheries Act, the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Arctic 
Waters Pollution Prevention Act, the Navigable Waters Protection 
Act, and the Aeronautics Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, despite the fact that this is framework 
legislation, there is provision for the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, through its minister, to negotiate a piecemeal 
situation such as this, when it deems appropriate, and for the 
results to take precedence over all the legislation mentioned.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discretion should be controlled very differently to make 
sure that it will not lead to squabbles between departments. It 
would also be subject to a change in ministers. If a minister 
from the Atlantic or the Pacific region has his own priorities 
in that area, he could use his powers under the act to put 
pressure on the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans or another 
minister, to demand some kind of acknowledgment of marine 
conservation areas not included in the planning by existing 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of the bill provides for a fourth way to create 
marine conservation areas, very specifically, on a case by case 
basis. 
I do not believe that framework legislation should provide for 
something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all the more concerned by this situation that in the past 
there has been very severe criticism from the auditor general, 
among others, about the inability of Heritage Canada to protect 
ecosystems in existing national parks. Now that they want to get 
involved in marine conservation areas, are we going to be faced 
with the same kind of situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very concrete examples can be found in chapter 31 of the auditor 
general's report, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the six national parks we reviewed, Parks Canada's 
biophysical information was out-of-date or incomplete. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report states further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although monitoring the ecological integrity of the ecosystems 
in national parks is a high priority according to Parks Canada 
policies and guidelines, in many national parks the Department 
has not monitored ecological conditions on a regular, continuing 
basis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust a department that was the subject of such 
comments in relation to existing parks, when there are plans to 
establish new parks in an even more unclear situation, where the 
government will not be accountable for its actions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another comment, the auditor general said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In almost all of the parks visited by the auditor general, there 
was no link between business plans and management plans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, it meant a lack of co-ordination in the activities 
listed in the business plans to make the parks better known and 
help them reach their public, as well as in day to day 
management, to make sure the services that are in demand and 
that are offered to the public can be provided. If park visitors 
do not get this kind of service, it is inappropriate to give 
this responsibility to a department which has had big problems 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring, the panel on the ecological integrity of Canada's 
national parks made its report public and urged the government 
to put ecological integrity back in the centre of its missions. 
The panel found that the integrity of ecosystems was at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the panel found that, in some national parks, the 
stress on the resource was so great that some species were 
disappearing. All the more so in marine areas, where we can have 
this type of situation if they are is not properly managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Fundy park, in New Brunswick, three species have disappeared 
since the park was created, in the 1940s. Only one of the 39 
national parks of Canada does not experience this stress. The 
situation is worse than what the panel of scientists expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all this information, one really has to wonder how Parks 
Canada will manage to preserve the marine areas of conservation, 
when it does not seem to have the wherewithal to protect 
existing parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more reasons to oppose this bill. Consultations before 
the introduction of the bill have been more or less a failure. 
A consultation paper was made public and sent to 3,000 groups 
across Canada, but unfortunately there has been no real 
consultation on the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Bloc Quebecois had asked for a copy of the 
300-page report, which was really only 73 pages long, the large 
majority of which constituted the reply-coupon joined to the 
consultation paper. That was very succinct as a consultation 
result. We could hardly use it to improve the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also realize that the decision concerns the fishing 
industry, which is in turmoil. In the past, we have witnessed 
tremendous failures in the federal policy dealing with stock 
management. Entire areas of Quebec and Canada saw their regional 
economy suffer badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10(1) of the bill states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>10.(1) The Minister shall provide opportunities for consultation 
with relevant federal and provincial ministers and agencies ... 
in the development of marine conservation area policy— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are they going to ensure that there will be consultation in 
the fisheries area in order to avoid an unacceptable outcome, 
when we are already aware of the failure of the federal fisheries 
stock management policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this bill is worded, the information given does not 
provide assurance, despite reassurances by departmental 
officials, that the objective will be attained, i.e. that marine 
conservation areas will be better protected.  We have no 
assurance that Quebec's jurisdiction will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the application of this bill is reviewed in another five, 
ten or fifteen years, we will probably find it was just one more 
failure. This review will probably show that the Bloc Quebecois 
was justified in what it has said about the bill being passed 
within a context of insufficient consultation of the provinces 
and insufficient co-ordination by the various federal departments 
involved.  By then, we will have one or two examples available in 
which the discretionary power conferred upon the minister will 
have been used to solve problems in a specific region, not 
necessarily within the spirit of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all these facts, the Bloc Quebecois invites the House to 
vote against the bill.  We do not feel it is acceptable at this 
stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise again on Bill C-10, which is going 
through another life cycle.  At the beginning of the 36th 
parliament it was Bill C-48 and at the end of the 36th parliament 
it became Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to be critic at the time for Canadian heritage and 
I spent some time on the bill.  However it now rises again. These 
things seem to die on the order paper fairly regularly. The bill 
originated in 1988 when the Mulroney government introduced the 
National Parks Act that would permit the establishment of marine 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go through all the details but I will hit a few high 
points about the intent of the legislation.  I do not think 
anyone in the House or across the country would disagree that 
environmental protection and sustainability are paramount. 
Whether they pertain to national parks, marine areas or 
regulating the pollution of large companies, environmental 
protection and sustainable development are very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However these issues do not fall specifically within the 
jurisdictional power of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  We 
talk about ecosystems, fish, aquaculture and so on.  It would be 
wise to place some of the responsibility for these issues with 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  We could then talk about 
the Department of the Environment and how important it is to look 
at environmental sustainability in the whole area of marine 
conservation parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also sense frustration with the amount of input parliament 
would have.  I am not sure if this place is becoming more and 
more irrelevant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 would pare down anything parliament would have to say 
on the issue.  It would limit parliamentary input by giving 
cabinet the authority to create marine conservation areas on 
crown land without going through the normal legislative process. 
The question is, why bother with this place at all?  Cabinet 
might as well get together, have coffee, bring up an order in 
council and throw a dart and pick a marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people and advisory committees have done an incredible 
amount of work on this issue.  I have seen the maps and the areas 
and they seem well thought out.  However the whole idea of going 
to cabinet and just zipping something through in a morning 
session, or maybe not even that long, maybe even before coffee, 
is no good.  The House of Commons is where such debate should 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know in the years we have been here that the amount of 
discussion and the power of parliament itself has been pared 
down.  Members have also witnessed incredible growth in 
government.  Budgets have ballooned.  The debt has certainly 
ballooned and hopefully we are starting to control that.  The 
annual deficit is somewhat under control.  That is probably a 
good start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the amount of governing that would occur under 
marine conservations areas.  Once a marine conservation area is 
established the minister may maintain and operate the facilities, 
conduct scientific research and monitor and carry out studies 
based on traditional ecological knowledge of the areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a nice tidy sentence.  We can all guess where it may 
lead.  It could lead to mushrooming bureaucracies, advisory 
committees and all kinds of studies and scientific research. Such 
things are essential but if they are not monitored they could fly 
loose.  The legislation could be an entity unto itself.  When 
members see the mushroom cloud it places under the government, a 
cloud with no checks or balances that will only get bigger and 
bigger, they should be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole area unnecessarily expands the minister's domain to 
areas that fall outside her ministerial responsibility.  The 
minister talks about marine conservation areas, which is again a 
nice thought and something that perhaps needs to happen sooner or 
later to a degree, but it is by order in council and should be 
under DFO control as much as anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Minister of the Environment?  The bill would 
require the heritage minister to establish a management plan for 
marine conservation, ecosystem protection, human use and zoning. 
Somewhere in there surely the Minister of the Environment and his 
department should be involved.  We then start saying that it is 
this department or that department and the whole thing blows 
loose because it gets bigger and bigger rather than adopting 
tighter checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, each marine conservation area would require the 
establishment of a management advisory committee to review and 
implement management plans.  For every marine park or 
conservation area there needs to be a whole advisory committee. I 
am not necessarily questioning the wisdom of that.  A lot of 
people have a lot of expertise in the area and I do not.  I 
certainly respect the ability of advisory committees to review 
and implement plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However where does it stop?  That is the question.  This thing 
will get bigger and bigger.  There must be rules and regulations 
and the government needs to come forward with them. Unfortunately 
we see no checks and balances in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers have all kinds of power, which we have certainly seen. 
I could digress and talk about Bill C-15, the enormous omnibus 
justice bill, but there is no point in getting into that right 
now.  It is certainly before the House.  It is an unbelievable 
piece of legislation and an example of phenomenal ministerial 
power.  I hope it gets chunked down into bite size pieces so we 
can deal with each section on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding ministerial powers and perhaps overuse of powers, the 
minister states that commercial fishing and shipping would be 
appropriate in conservation areas.  I would like an expert to 
tell us those things rather than the minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last bill we talked about whether the minister would be 
able to curtail or eliminate commercial flights over marine 
conservation areas.  What would that do to small charter 
companies that fly over the ocean three-quarters of their lives 
on the B.C. straits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clauses would allow commercial fishing according to the 
minister's will.  All aquaculture fisheries management, marine 
navigation and marine safety plans would then be subject to the 
approval of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister 
of Heritage.  Do we not see the thing getting bigger and bigger? 
It looks like mushrooming to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of putting regulations into place is essential. 
However, how do we enforce them?  We have seen all kinds of 
legislation over the years where regulations were put in place 
and not enforced.  How do we enforce regulations?  That is the 
frustration we see with the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about Kootenay Park, Banff, Jasper and Yoho. 
The parallel is that the National Parks Act does not give park 
wardens sufficient authority to enforce the law.  Park wardens 
drive around in their brown trucks.  We see them all the time.  I 
live very close to Elk Island National Park.  It is 45 minutes 
east of my home in Edmonton.  Lew and I ride out there a lot.  We 
see park wardens and we know they are people we ought to respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a law-abiding citizen.  When I see the rangers' authority I 
do not try to pull anything on them.  We have gone around and 
around the block in the House about sidearms for park rangers. If 
a person is up to no good or wants to poach moose, elk or bison, 
they know park wardens are fairly powerless.  The government is 
very irresponsible in terms of the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parallel can then be drawn:  What would the government do 
with the marine conservation act?  The director of Parks Canada 
has suggested allowing the RCMP to get involved.  That is good, 
but there are lots of parks where the RCMP is more than a 12 
minute drive away.  Park wardens should have all the power and 
authority vested in them by the government and the minister to 
protect both wildlife and public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For marine conservation acts the record is not stellar.  We must 
ask what would happen.  Would people be chased around in boats? 
Is that what enforcing the regulations would come to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the history of the legislation.  This is the 
third swing around.  Who knows when it might get passed?  Is the 
government really committed to the legislation?  It has died on 
the order paper a couple of times, as I mentioned.  Will we put 
regulations in place that the minister will live by, or is this a 
grandiose plan that will not be enforced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many think parliament is irrelevant.  A proposed amendment 
structure in the legislation would allow 20 days for amendments 
and a three hour debate on them.  Such amendments may affect 
shipping lanes, commercial fishing, sport fishing, aquaculture, 
commercial flights, and who knows what.  Recreational boating may 
not be allowed in some areas.  If an amendment is put forward 
there would be only three hours to debate it.  That is almost an 
admission that parliament is irrelevant and does not matter. 
Decisions would be made around the cabinet table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would severely limit the ability of 
parliamentarians to consider all options when new marine areas 
are set up.  The bill would give the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage free rein to create unlimited advisory committees for 
each marine conservation area.  We know where that could go when 
people are absolutely unchecked.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Limitations on the size and structure of each committee must be 
established in the legislation.  We need to make sure the 
parameters are in place.  If we get an unlimited number of people 
with unlimited amounts of salary, and it looks like a big pot out 
of which we can draw cash, we all know that it could go on for a 
very long time.  It may need to be studied for a little longer 
and, because it is important, we may need to bring in 15 experts. 
The thing needs some parameters in place but unfortunately we 
are not seeing that at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up by drawing a parallel with the land national 
parks and some of the things going on there.  The parks of Banff 
and Jasper are absolutely glorious.  They have a lot of building 
projects going on.  The minister took her first swing out to 
those parks last summer or the summer before and was able to see 
first hand how fabulous these parks are and how important it is 
that we balance economic and sustainable development with 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure there is a balance in nature.  We may not 
be able to please both sides of the equation but if I want to go 
to a park or spend money on a hotel or in a restaurant, I want to 
be able to do that.  If I have the money to go camping in Jasper 
Park, I want to be able to go there and enjoy the pristine 
wilderness, have a campfire outside my camper and enjoy the 
campground.  I am not sure that anyone ought to be telling me 
that I cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be the same if we were talking about a marine 
conservation area.  It is important that I am able to make use of 
that area but at the same time I do not want heavyhanded 
regulations. I want wisdom, not advisory committees.  This may 
sound foolish, coming around in boats, but there needs to be 
absolute common sense from the government.  I do not think we see 
that to this extent with some of the things I have discussed.  I 
hope the government takes into account, when it swings through 
the legislation again, that too many rules and regulations 
certainly are unwise.  At the same time, this just cannot be an 
open can or basket for people to help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really nervous about the fact that the minister would have 
far too much power and that it would be essential for joint 
ministries to work together.  If we look at heritage we see that 
we have a marvellous heritage.  We can also look at the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of the 
Environment. I certainly hope that no one is just trying to make 
a legacy for themselves.  That would surely be unwise and people 
would be able to see right through that.

national marine conservation areas of Canada.  I understand 
that, in the context of nation building and the great and 
beautiful Canada, national means Canada.  The proof that there 
is some authority there is that all provincial legislatures are 
called legislative assemblies, with the exception of Quebec's, 
which is called the National Assembly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinon, the bill before us today can be summed up in three 
words: centralization, centralization, centralization. If some 
are pleased with this type of legislation, it is most certainly 
officials from the Queen's Privy Council or from the Council for 
Canadian Unity. For these people, this type of legislation 
promotes nation building. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I talked about centralization. 
I think we all agree that, when Canada takes part in treaties 
such as the FTAA, other types of international agreements or 
international forums, such as a forum on the environment where 
the topic may be marine areas, it must often deal with the fact 
that there may be two levels of jurisdiction involved, and 
sometimes even three, when municipalities have a say. The 
federal government often speaks on behalf of the provinces, and 
this is where the problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years, Canada has undertaken a major 
centralizing operation. When it speaks at these international 
forums, Canada wants to do it on behalf of everyone, but it 
knows full well that it is not that simple. In Quebec, there is 
a national assembly, just like there are legislative assemblies 
across Canada, and these bodies have their own jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government told itself “In the coming years, we will 
have to centralize as much as possible”. How? By intruding in 
the provinces' jurisdictions, with or without their agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is an invasion of a provincial jurisdiction, 
particularly in Quebec, since we have jurisdiction over, among 
other things, the river, the estuary and the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. Quebec has jurisdiction over the bed of these 
waters. But through its centralization process, the federal 
government is taking over part of that jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the government going about this? Not just through bills, 
but also with its spending power. If conservation areas are 
strictly federal entities, the government will use its money to 
do it, as it does in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the case of young offenders, the government will 
use its money to do this.  In the health sector, where it is 
more and more tempted, the government is using its spending 
power, a ploy which has been approved by the highest court, the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  The government has the right to spend, 
even in jurisdictions that are not its own.  It does this all 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet is the way in which it has managed to arrange things 
so that it can invade the jurisdictions of Quebec and of the 
other provinces.  First, as everyone agrees, it did this on the 
backs of unemployed workers, but it also did it through transfer 
payments.  The government decided, using an analytical grid 
based on the capacity to generate wealth, that it would reduce 
its contribution to postsecondary education, health and social 
programs and that it would send a little less money to the 
provinces, and much less to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It rakes in the money and then turns around and uses its 
spending authority to invade provincial jurisdictions. 
That is what the bill before us today is all about.  It is the 
same logic that was used with respect to the issue of young 
offenders, where Quebec has excellent legislation which has 
proven its worth.  The consensus in Quebec is that the federal 
government should not invade this jurisdiction, that 
rehabilitation is working in Quebec and has done so for some 
time.  But the government is obsessed with centralization and 
keeps on invading provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is parental leave.  The Government of Quebec is 
saying that it is capable of providing better parental leave for 
young Quebec mothers.  The federal government disagrees and says 
that this should come under the employment insurance plan and 
that that is where it will put the money. 
It is not interested in hearing about our plans to improve our 
parental leave plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for privacy.  The government has introduced a 
privacy bill, even though we already have privacy legislation in 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that the federal government, with the money it has 
managed to extract from the provinces by decreasing transfer 
payments, is encroaching on Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of them.  As I have said, it is one because as far 
as jurisdiction is concerned, the beds of rivers, the bed of the 
St. Lawrence, the bed of the estuary, the bed of the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, are all a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is telling us “We are going to establish 
a new area of jurisdiction, a marine conservation area”.  This 
will likely be against the wishes of the Government of Quebec, 
which has not been consulted in any way whatsoever. 
The notes on partnership I have before me indicate that it was a 
very simple matter to put paid to partnership, and to say “Here 
we are, and this is what we are going to impose”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally deplorable, which is why it is important for me 
to ask all these questions.  The Quebec National Assembly would 
surely object to a law of this kind.  When I say object, this 
would likely be by consensus.  Even the federalists in the 
Quebec National Assembly understand that Quebecers have a 
different way of thinking than the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nation building mentality of Canada does not make any 
differentiation, however.  To it, there is but one nation in 
Canada: the Canadians.  It renounces and closes its eyes to the 
nation of Quebec.  This is totally deplorable. 
This is the type of bill which, if presented to the Quebec 
National Assembly, would most likely be rejected by the Quebec 
Liberals, because they would realize that their jurisdictions 
are being eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is a consensus elsewhere in Canada. Social union 
is perhaps another example where the rest of Canada agrees with 
what is proposed and says “Fine, let us go ahead with the social 
union. We need the federal government's money, so we are 
prepared to relinquish part of our sovereignty over 
jurisdictions such as health”. Whether it is homecare or 
daycare, the government is always trying to intrude further in 
these provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the bill before us does. 
Quebecers feel that the integrity of their territory is 
jeopardized. Canadians should know what a threat to the 
integrity of a territory is. They are making every possible 
effort to protect their territorial integrity, including in the 
context of issues concerning national defence—I am my party's 
critic in the matter—such as patrols in Canada's far north, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of the Canadian territory must be respected. 
However, when it comes to the integrity of the Quebec territory, 
the federal government does not seem to really care. It 
constantly uses themes such as “Quebec's separation” or 
“Quebec's partition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that the Government of Canada, in its obsessive 
nation building, completely forgets the importance of its 
partners, of Quebec in particular, when it comes to areas of 
jurisdiction, marine conservation areas and other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that things are pretty clear with regard to the 
integrity of Quebec territory.  The government has no say with 
respect to the floor of the St. Lawrence, the river, the estuary 
or the gulf.  And yet, it shows up with a bill that says “Well, 
I will do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no shortage of good examples.  In the case of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal government acted 
properly.  It announced its intention to the Government of 
Quebec and they held consultations and agreed on it. 
They wondered whether they were capable of doing the job while 
respecting each other's jurisdictions, and they reached an 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But with this bill, there is nothing about consultation.  The 
government's aim is to impose once again, to intrude into 
Quebec's jurisdiction, the environment, river beds, and the 
floor of the St. Lawrence, the estuary and the gulf.  Clearly we 
must object to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, there are other more internal reasons, which include 
overlap within federal jurisdiction even.  Because there are 
other departments in this great government, including Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada, each of which has its 
protection areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this to be a typical example, within the big federal 
machine, of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is 
doing. Some say they will create marine conservation areas, but 
others say that such areas already exist, which means that there 
is a possibility of duplication between different departments 
within the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to be dealing with this issue hastily. It 
prefers to cut corners, so to speak. It does not care about what 
goes on at Fisheries and Oceans Canada or at Environment Canada. 
National parks are the responsibility of Canadian Heritage. 
There are some forty national parks in Canada, but only a few in 
Quebec, which is another issue. Quebec often criticizes the fact 
that there are very few national parks in that province compared 
to the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is that Canadian Heritage is totally 
incapable of protecting ecosystems in national parks. Now it 
wants to interfere with provincial jurisdictions and create 
whatever it wants without looking at what goes on at Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada or at Environment Canada. Canadian Heritage is 
not even looking at what goes on in its own department with 
regard to national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain parameters require that Canada conduct studies every 
five years. In certain parks, these studies have not been 
conducted for 12, 13 or 14 years. 
Some species of flora and fauna are disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be understood that, when a national park is created, 
people visit it.  It is a place where people can go.  There is a 
real danger for the flora and fauna in the park.  A way must be 
found for nature and humankind to co-exist.  When human visitors 
are numerous, when they do not stay on the paths, this can 
endanger certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should do this follow-up.  I think that the 
government is in a poor position to push this sort of bill 
through.  When people are not reaching their own objectives 
within a department, they should not be asking for even more 
work so that they can make an even worse job of it.  People 
should start with getting it right in their own jurisdiction and 
then they can think about extending their reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government could be more respectful of jurisdictions, I 
think that the Bloc Quebecois would be more inclined to support 
this type of bill.  But this is not what has happened: quite the 
contrary.  There is overlap.  Heritage Canada is not able to do 
its job with its existing responsibilities, and it is looking 
for more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst thing for the Bloc Quebecois is that there is a lack 
of respect for what is going on in Quebec and in the provinces. 
The National Assembly of Quebec would oppose this kind of bill 
because it is an intrusion in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, it is clear that, unless major changes 
are made to the bill, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose it.  I 
appeal to my Canadian colleagues. 
When they introduce bills, they should bear in mind that there 
is a National Assembly in Quebec, that there is a second people, 
a second nation, the one in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they want to take things away from that nation, the Bloc 
Quebecois, whose main purpose is to defend Quebec's interests, 
can be counted on to oppose such bills, and will be opposing 
this one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central, I am 
pleased to participate in the second reading debate on Bill C-10, 
the Liberal government's attempt to create national marine 
conservation areas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of establishing marine conservation areas is to 
protect and conserve marine ecosystems found in the ocean 
environments of Canada and in the Great Lakes.  The purpose of 
the bill is to establish rules that would allow the creation of 
national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is actually unfinished business from the last Mulroney 
government.  It took the weak Liberal government more than 13 
years to tinker with the idea of creating marine conservation 
areas.  It is still at step one after feeble attempts to 
introduce legislation in previous parliaments, namely Bill C-48 
and Bill C-8.  It shows the lack of commitment of the Liberals to 
protecting and conserving our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to preserving marine areas for the benefit and 
enjoyment of Canadians, the bill strives to establish a framework 
for regulating marine ecosystems and maintaining biological 
diversity.  It is important to note that while environmental 
protection and sustainable development are important issues, they 
do not fall within the administrative responsibility of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes provision for two schedules that are intended to 
include the names of marine conservations areas and reserves. The 
minister has identified 29 marine conservation areas and the 
intent to create new national parks, but in Bill C-10 the two 
schedules are blank.  The actual locations of all 29 parks have 
not been identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a past co-chair of the scrutiny of regulations committee I 
would imagine these lists could be filled in by regulation and we 
would find the 29 locations somewhere in the thousands of pages 
of regulations that no doubt accompany the bill.  That is 
governing through the back door, not through the front door and 
not through the voices of elected members in the Chamber.  The 
bill should describe the location of each park and that 
information should be inserted in the two schedules.  I hope the 
matter is fleshed out during the committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 would limit parliamentary input by giving cabinet the 
authority to create a new marine conservation area on crown land 
without going through the normal legislative process.  Currently 
the government is required to come before parliament any time a 
new national park is to be established or an existing park is to 
be changed.  The legislation would remove the power from 
parliament and would allow parks to be created or changed by 
order in council.  That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister states that activities such as commercial fishing 
and shipping would be appropriate in conservation areas.  However 
all fishing, aquaculture, fisheries management, marine navigation 
and marine safety plans are subject to the approval of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly regulations affecting navigation or safety rules under 
the responsibility of the Minister of Transport must be made on 
the recommendation of both the Minister of Canadian Heritage and 
the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disposal regulations pertaining to sections 127 and 128 of the 
Environmental Protection Act require the joint approval of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is to be done about these contradictions and overlapping 
responsibilities?  Clause 13 of the bill would limit or prohibit 
the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, minerals, 
aggregates or any other inorganic material in all marine 
conservation areas.  I anticipate hearing from stakeholders about 
this clause at the committee hearings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are considerations with respect to private property and 
reasonable search and seizure.  Clause 22 of the bill states 
that, in the discharge of their duties, marine conservation area 
wardens, enforcement officers and persons accompanying them may 
enter and pass through private property.  This is an invasion of 
the property rights of law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak and arrogant Liberal government has shown its pattern 
of disrespect for privacy rights and interference with personal 
property.  We have seen that in Bill C-5, the endangered species 
legislation, where the arrogant Liberal government refused to 
offer fair compensation to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcing regulations is a serious issue and it is not addressed 
in the bill.  In reference to Parks Canada, the director of the 
organization suggested that the RCMP be allowed to be involved in 
enforcement activities.  Currently Parks Canada is involved in a 
labour dispute with its park wardens over personal safety.  The 
bill contains the same deficiencies as the National Parks Act. It 
does not give park wardens sufficient authority to enforce the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 there have been three separate reports recommending 
that sidearms be issued to wardens in order to fulfil their 
responsibilities.  With park wardens off the job and other law 
enforcement agencies overburdened with enforcing criminal code 
violations, wildlife is being slaughtered in our national parks. 
The bill does not address any of these situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance affirms the federal government's role in 
the preservation of Canada's natural and historical heritage such 
as national parks.  It supports sustaining and developing 
national parks and marine conservation areas that exist for the 
benefit and enjoyment of everyone.  It also supports sustainable 
development and environmental protection regulations that have 
been fully debated by parliamentarians, not through the back door 
but through this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would strengthen the power of cabinet while diminishing 
the effectiveness of elected representatives.  The bill is 
virtually unnecessary because the regulatory framework already 
exists to accomplish what the bill purports to achieve.  It is 
just a power grab by a department that understands that it has a 
weak minister who does not understand that the new regulations 
are not required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would clearly limit the ability of 
parliamentarians to consider all options when new marine areas 
are introduced or existing areas are expanded, with no input 
whatsoever when new parks are being created.  The weak and 
arrogant Liberal government, time and again, abuses the Chamber 
and uses elected members as a rubber stamp.  It does not give 
enough opportunity for debate by elected officials.  There is no 
reason for this tight fisted form of control and undemocratic 
manner of proceeding.  Like the bogus changes the government is 
proposing to Bill C-9, the Elections Act, Bill C-10 is also 
virtually anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of the bill, as it relates to fishing, aquaculture and 
transportation, is such that changes to any schedule should 
require an act of parliament.  Affected communities would be at 
the whim of the minister.  The bill would give the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage a free reign to create unlimited advisory 
committees for each marine conservation area.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Limitations on the size and structure of each committee should 
have been established in the legislation.  Will the committee 
that hears the bill allow these limits and rules to be 
established?  I doubt it very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These advisory committees would give the government an 
opportunity for patronage in the way membership is composed and 
would serve no other purpose than that of a rubber stamp under 
the guise of public consultation.  What we have here is yet 
another job creation program for failed Liberal election 
candidates and their supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If marine wildlife and ecosystems are to be protected, park 
wardens should have exclusive jurisdiction in the enforcement of 
laws and regulations relating to each conservation area. 
Unfortunately, wardens are increasingly finding that they cannot 
do a proper job due to interference from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision by Parks Canada management to transfer 
responsibilities from park wardens to law enforcement agencies 
like the RCMP is Ottawa's way of centralizing tight fisted 
control away from the frontline officers who have the practical 
experience to know what does and does not work in Canada's 
national parks.  What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a mess.  It is as much an assault on our environment 
as an assault on the stakeholders in the regions that will be 
affected by it.  My heart goes out to my colleague the Canadian 
Alliance heritage critic because I cannot see how the bill can be 
fixed or amended during committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the bill is not required because everything it 
does can already be done under regulations.  On the other hand, it 
is a power grab by the minister and should be stopped 100%.  Those 
concerned about preserving the environment can see that after 13 
years of trying to bring the bill forward for debate in the House 
the government does not care about the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the bill looks significantly different when it comes back 
before the House following committee hearings.  However, knowing 
the government's record, I doubt it.  I hope the minister's secret 
agenda of power grabbing is exposed.  I hope Canadians see 
clearly how little the government cares about the environment.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK42">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand (for the Minister of the Environment)</B> 
moved that Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the 
House on the second reading of Bill C-19, an act to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by congratulating the Minister of the Environment 
for bringing the legislation before the House.  Bill C-19 is a 
continuation of an important effort that dates back 25 years in 
Canada's history.  It would bring environmental factors to the 
table when government decisions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation is based on the results of a national 
consultation completed last year as part of a five year review of 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.   It is also based on 
the Minister of the Environment's personal commitment to improve 
the federal environmental assessment process so that it can 
continue to be the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be clear on what we are proposing.  Although Bill C-19 is 
not a major rewrite of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 
it would strengthen the act, an act that has served its purpose 
well over the past five years and has resulted in notable 
environment assessment success stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act has had a positive effect on projects ranging from the 
creation of an inland navigation channel in New Brunswick to the 
protection of Pukawska National Park in my home province of 
Ontario.  In British Columbia it enabled the Government of 
Canada, in collaboration with the province, to ensure that the 
construction of a new road to end the isolation of a first 
nations community did not have a significant impact on the 
sensitive grizzly bear population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just three of the many environmental assessment 
successes Canadians have achieved over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, proclaimed by the 
Liberal government in 1995, has had a positive and lasting effect 
on ecosystems and development projects from coast to coast to 
coast.  It has helped integrate Canada's environmental goals with 
its economic, social and cultural values.  In other words, it has 
moved us down the road toward sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our experiences over the past five years have identified 
concerns that need to be addressed to make the federal 
environmental assessment process even stronger, more certain and 
more accessible.  In short, the current process is effective but 
imperfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coincident with other environmental initiatives, the revised and 
strengthened Canadian Environmental Assessment Act would help 
protect and preserve Canada's diverse and sometimes fragile 
environment.  It would assure Canadians of the clean air and 
clean water they have a right to expect.  It would allow 
Canadians to benefit economically from responsible development in 
the use of our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-19 is to establish a more predictable, 
consistent and timely process, to improve the quality of 
environmental assessment in Canada and to strengthen 
opportunities for public participation.  The amendments would 
ensure that the federal environmental assessment process better 
serves the interests of all participants in the years ahead, not 
the least of whom is the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everyone may be familiar with the goals and intent of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  I will therefore take a 
few moments to provide some context for the proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As already noted, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act was 
brought into force in 1995 with the goal of promoting a healthy 
environment and economy through sustainable development.  The act 
requires federal departments and agencies to undertake an 
environmental assessment if they intend to develop projects 
themselves.  It requires them to provide funding or land for such 
projects and to issue licences or permits for the projects such 
as might be issued under the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine the scope of such activity.  Last year alone 30 
federal departments conducted about 6,000 environmental 
assessments.  Many of the projects had the potential to affect 
the health of local and regional ecosystems for decades to come. 
The act also touches on billions of dollars of potential 
investment in Canada each year.  For environmental and economic 
reasons it is important that we get the process right. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying principle and main strength of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act is that a project's environmental 
effects receive careful consideration before development begins. 
The act is also built on the premise that the Canadian public 
should participate in the review of development proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the findings of an environmental assessment, the 
government must decide whether to proceed or to withdraw its 
support for a project.  Depending on the scale of the activity 
and the type of assessment, the decision may be made at 
department level or by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental assessments often result in recommendations on 
actions that should be taken to protect the environment or 
improve benefits to affected people and communities before the 
project goes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Used as a planning tool for sustainable development rather than 
a barrier to growth and development, environmental assessment 
allows projects to be designed in ways that are economically 
efficient and rewarding but which are also compatible with a 
healthy environment and a healthy society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear on this.  The government, through the leadership 
of the Prime Minister, views environmental assessment as a 
cornerstone of its commitment to protect our tremendous 
environmental heritage, our air, water and natural spaces, for 
the benefit and use of current and future generations of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a central theme of January's Speech from the Throne. 
Our government recognizes, and I quote from the Speech from the 
Throne, that “A healthy environment is an essential part of a 
sustainable economy and our quality of life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental assessment has been and will continue to be an 
indispensable tool for pursuing the government's environmental 
priorities.  Within this context, our approach to environmental 
management is being driven by three emerging global trends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, human activity is placing unsustainable burdens on the 
ecosphere, particularly on natural habitat and on our landscapes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a resurgence in public concern about 
environmental issues and a shift in public values in favour of 
increased environmental action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, businesses and the marketplace are learning that 
unsustainable business practices are bad business and 
unacceptable to consumers.  The old tradeoff of the environment 
versus the economy is ringing more hollow with every passing 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those three trends offer an enormous opportunity for change. 
They call for environmental management which builds on 
partnerships, promotes incentives and is based on science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental assessment is an essential part of our efforts to 
ensure clear air, clean water and the protection of Canada's 
natural spaces.  Project by project and step by step, 
environmental assessment helps avoid the adverse effects of 
development.  That is why it is important to improve the process 
by making it more predicable, consistent and timely and by 
strengthening opportunities for public participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were our goals when the Minister of the Environment 
launched a public review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act in December 1999.  At that time the discussion paper served 
as a launching pad for an open, comprehensive and public dialogue 
about how to improve the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To convey the scope of our consultation I will share with the 
House that almost 1,200 people in 19 cities participated in the 
public meetings and regional workshops.  A website to inform 
Canadians about the review and give them an opportunity to have 
their say received over 14,000 visits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have received more than 200 written submissions about 
possible changes to the act and the environmental assessment 
process.  The Minister of the Environment received a report and 
recommendations from a multisectoral regulatory advisory 
committee established some time ago to provide input on 
environmental assessment regulations and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee brings a unique perspective to issues.  It 
includes representatives of industry, the federal government, 
provincial governments, environmental and aboriginal groups.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Staff of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency have 
consulted their provincial counterparts and colleagues from other 
federal departments.  We have received input from several 
processes, including aboriginal people who have been deeply 
involved in some of the more high profile and successful 
environmental assessments undertaken in Canada to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process has been exhaustive.  By using 
electronic means of communication like the Internet we have been 
able to reach Canadians from all walks of life, in all cities, 
rural areas, and remote parts of the country.  These amendments 
are the product of one of the most open and thorough public 
reviews that I have witnessed in my time in government.  They 
represent the consensus view of diverse groups in their intent to 
move us forward toward the goal of sustainable development, which 
has been embraced by all elements of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always room for argument when developers and 
environmentalists come together at the same table, but our 
consultations reveal a remarkable level of agreement on the 
merits of the existing act and how it can be improved.  After 
hearing from literally hundreds of Canadian businesses, 
communities, associations and individuals, there is strong 
national support for an effective and efficient environmental 
assessment process at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking to the federal government for leadership 
in ensuring that environmental assessment remains an important 
tool for making decisions in support of sustainable development. 
I assure hon. members that we intend to provide that leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our review of the act has confirmed that many strengths of the 
current environmental assessment process do exist.  Canadians 
have endorsed the fundamental process and the principles of the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  They have endorsed the 
basic structure of the process and the factors that must be 
addressed when dealing with an environmental assessment.  They 
have given their blessings to the role of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These features of the act would be retained under a revitalized 
federal environmental assessment process, but we also heard 
strong messages about the need for change.  I do not intend to 
review these concerns in detail.  They are addressed in the 
report of the Minister of the Environment to parliament which was 
tabled on March 20, 2001.  Instead I will spend the rest of my 
time explaining how we intend to address them through the 
proposed amendments to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first goal in bringing forward the legislation is to 
establish a more certain, predictable and timely federal 
environmental assessment process.  This would not only save time, 
money and effort for all affected parties, but it would build on 
confidence in the process and improve the climate for investment 
in Canada.  Bill C-19 proposes amendments to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act that would provide for a focus on 
the appropriate projects and would move away from assessments of 
insignificant matters like window replacements and erecting road 
signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the number of assessments of small, routine projects 
would free up time and resources that could be put to better use 
assessing projects that are likely to produce adverse 
environmental effects.  This would be achieved through a new use 
for class screening reports as a replacement for project specific 
assessments when accepted design standards and mitigation 
measures are used on small and routine projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-19 the scope of the act would also be expanded to 
include federally funded projects on reserve lands and would 
allow regulations to be developed for federal lands leased or 
managed by a third party such as local airport authorities. These 
are important gaps in the current legislation that need to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 also includes measures that would improve 
co-ordination among federal departments involved in environmental 
assessment.  Our goal is to reduce delays in project planning and 
to assure proponents that information requirements and timing of 
decisions would be more consistent from project to project.  The 
act would be amended to provide for the appointment of a federal 
co-ordinator for screenings and comprehensive studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-ordinator's job would be to bring together appropriate 
federal authorities when necessary and to consolidate the 
information required for an assessment.  For projects subject to 
the assessment process of another jurisdiction and for large 
projects requiring a comprehensive study, the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency would take the role of

</I></B></P><P align=left>To increase certainty in the process, which in turn would 
promote more effective project planning and reduce project delays 
and costs, Bill C-19 would amend the act to eliminate the 
possibility that a project may be referred to a panel review even 
after undergoing a comprehensive study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised comprehensive study process would provide the 
Minister of the Environment with new powers to set conditions for 
mitigation measures and follow-up programs, to require more 
information to bring a comprehensive study report up to standard 
and to direct that action be taken to address public concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would promote greater use of mediation in dispute 
resolution and would clarify the powers of federal departments to 
impose conditions on a project.  Another overriding goal of Bill 
C-19 would be to improve the quality of environmental 
assessments. High quality assessments contribute to better 
decisions in support of sustainable development and help build a 
more accountable planning process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill C-19 would establish a clear 
role for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to promote 
and monitor compliance with the act.  Specifically the agency 
would be given authority to lead a quality assurance program for 
assessments across federal departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes would also be made to ensure more and better follow-up 
of projects after an environmental assessment.  Bill C-19 would 
also propose that the results of regional studies, studies of the 
effects of several future projects in a region, would be 
recognized and used in the consideration of cumulative 
environmental effects; in other words the combined effects of 
many projects in a region over a long period of time.  Finally, 
it is our intention through Bill C-19 to ensure meaningful public 
participation in assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental assessment process of the Government of Canada 
must remain worthy of the trust and involvement of all Canadians. 
The fundamental value of meaningful public participation in 
environmental assessments was one of the strongest measures 
emerging from the review of the existing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would propose to strengthen public participation 
in three ways.  First, Bill C-19 would establish a single, 
government-wide Internet based registry to provide public access 
to relevant information.  The registry would be administered by 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and would replace 
the existing system in which a seldom used separate paper based 
registry had been established for each environmental assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we wish to better incorporate the knowledge and 
perspectives of aboriginal people in the assessment process, 
particularly where assessments involve reserve lands, traditional 
territories, or treaty and land management areas.  Amendments 
proposed in Bill C-19 would formally recognize the value and use 
of traditional knowledge in conducting environmental assessments. 
An aboriginal advisory committee would also be established to 
offer advice on assessment issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, specific opportunities for public participation in 
assessments would be expanded under Bill C-19.  These amendments 
would clarify that a responsible authority may establish 
opportunities for public participation at any stage during the 
screening of a project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of comprehensive studies, two new opportunities for 
public participation would be built into the legislation early in 
the scoping phase of the assessment and during the comprehensive 
study itself.  In addition, the participant funding program now 
in place for panel reviews would be extended to the comprehensive 
study review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a broad overview of the changes proposed in Bill C-19. 
They are practical, fair and realistic.  Bill C-19 would build on 
the core values of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act as 
it exists today.  These include the notion that environmental 
assessment should be applied as a planning tool as early as 
possible in the development process.  We are also maintaining the 
principle of self-assessment by responsible authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of public participation is not only retained, but 
greatly strengthened under Bill C-19.  We are reaffirming the 
principle of one project, one assessment.  The co-operative model 
of working with other jurisdictions has served us well in the 
past and would continue to do so in the years ahead. 
At the same time I assure the House that the federal decision 
making authority would not be delegated to other jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of developing these amendments to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act was launched more than a year. 
Through the dedicated efforts of many people we have come to a 
consensus on both the need for change and the nature of the 
change.  I ask members of the House to do their part by 
supporting Bill C-19. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a privilege to be able to speak to the amendments in Bill 
C-19 as proposed by the Minister of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the environment critic for the official opposition I have 
spoken on numerous occasions in the House of my experiences and 
concerns relating to environmental issues.  I have also learned 
that there is one very important thing to pay attention to when 
dealing with environmental issues, and that is co-operation. 
There has to be co-operation with all levels of government and 
industry as well as with people who are interested in the kind of 
legislation we are passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is in a unique position to act as a 
leader in the area of co-operation and to bring all stakeholders 
together when we talk about the environment.  Environmental 
issues are consistently found at the top of the list when we talk 
with various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often heard people of all ages ask what they can do to 
help the environment.  They then go on to describe their feeling 
of helplessness and of being overwhelmed by the issues.  The 
federal government has a real lead role to play in co-operation. 
It should empower Canadians so that they feel active in their 
communities and can improve their health as well as the 
ecological system in their areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must also work to provide for the 
public's best interest and must provide objective knowledge 
concerning many of these issues.  It can act as a facilitator of 
information and provide venues for the public to engage in the 
issues.  The public must be consulted as often as it possibly 
can.  An informed and empowered citizen is the best friend of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have witnessed in the last few years amazing discussions with 
public groups.  We have examples of environmental groups working 
with industry to bring their joint concerns about endangered 
species before the environment committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own community I was part of the parks board for about 10 
years.  We looked at building a trail system and how that would 
impact on the potential development of our river escarpment and 
valleys.  The fact that people, industry and real estate people 
would get involved and work together with city council on that 
scale made it happen.  We are very proud of a parks system which 
is a selling feature of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter where we look, whether it is at endangered species, 
pollution or water resources, involving people is important. We 
must get away from the concept that big government runs 
everything, that it knows best and does not need to consult with 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians sometimes forget that they can work with industry. 
They sometimes feel alienated from government and industry.  It 
is incumbent on us, and I believe the bill goes a long way in 
accomplishing that empowerment and making people feel part of the 
whole system.  Empowerment is an important part of the fabric of 
a country, a province or a community.  Many environmental issues 
demand government co-operation.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many think this is only an issue for the federal 
government and the provinces, we must show people that the bill 
goes a long way in showing they can be involved.  That 
co-operation is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also work on the relationships people have with their 
government, and I apply that at all levels.  The provinces and 
the federal government must work together to develop initiatives 
and programs which understand and address the concerns and the 
very health of people.  Whether we talk about the water 
situation, which we had a lot of discussion on lately, or sewage 
or whatever, this involvement is so critical and affects people's 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe growing co-operation at all levels is a sign of our 
observations of the patterns discovered in nature, which we call 
biodiversity.  While competition and combat have an important 
role in our interactions with each other, humans and nature 
cannot be reduced to these elements alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation and construction are also integral to the system of 
nature of which we are all a part.  We recognize that we must 
have both competition and co-operation.  Our end goal is what is 
best for both people and for the natural world that people 
participate in.  With a recognition of the transforming power of 
both competition and co-operation, the solutions to our concerns 
are made more apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to Bill C-19 specifically, the amendments to the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will talk about some of the bad news, the competition 
side of things.  Then I will talk about the good news in the 
bill, which is the areas of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government continues to have a serious problem when 
it comes to environmental commitment.  It has been said by a 
number of people that the government is very long on promises and 
relatively short on action, sort of chameleon-like in approach, 
constantly changing its colour to fit the surroundings.  It 
betrays the trust of Canadians who once believed that Liberal 
means environmentally friendly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the environment critic for the official opposition, the 
Alliance Party, it will be my job to show Canadians that we have 
an environmental conscience and that we care about the 
environment and the kinds of changes it needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD, the Organisation on Economic Co-operation and 
Development, reported several weeks ago that we were the second 
worst in the ranking of those 29 countries in terms of 
environmental progress.  That is a rather serious indictment for 
a country that prides itself in our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his final report released several months 
ago argued that the current government had significant problems 
putting words into actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have toxic waste sites around this country numbering in 
thousands.  We have someone sitting on a hunger strike outside 
here who is saying that something has to be done about the Sydney 
tar ponds, the most graphic example of where promises have been 
made but nothing has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raw sewage which is being dumped into St. John's Harbour 
and into the Halifax and Victoria harbours by a G-8 country, an 
advanced industrial country.  That is not an environmentally good 
record to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The far reaching implications of Kyoto promises and endangered 
species legislation, if implemented without the proper 
consideration of costs and benefits by the government, are not 
the way things should be done by a government.  We should know 
what it is going to cost.  We should consider the socio-economic 
impacts.  We should look at the whole picture and work with 
Canadians to solve those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important detailed information on voluntary and co-operative 
programs, said to be the emphasis of the new endangered species 
act, is not there and creates an uncertainty for landowners. When 
someone is told that some of their land will be taken out of 
production, where their family is going to suffer, and 
compensation is not provided for in the legislation, that is a 
serious lack of co-operation with the people, the people who we 
must co-operate with if we want to save something.  That is the 
bad news.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is the co-operation.  The federal government, 
under the PCs, developed this tool for environmental impact 
assessment in co-operation with government, industry and other 
levels of government.  It was soon entrenched in law as the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  Its regulations were a 
provision for a five year review of the act.  This was undertaken 
last year by the current government with direction from the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review was close to what a public review can be and should 
be.  It involved the participation of thousands of Canadians from 
many different walks of life, those involved in non-governmental 
organizations, the provinces, industry and aboriginals.  We 
called many of them to ask them what they thought about Bill 
C-19.  Many came back and said they had looked at it and listened 
to us.  They sounded somewhat shocked that the bill included what 
they had said.  I compliment the government for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were consultations and workshops across the country. 
There were and continue to be regular meetings with the 
regulatory advisory committee, a stakeholder group made up of 
industry, environmentalists, aboriginals and government 
representatives. The process began with background studies, a 
government discussion document and ended with a draft bill.  This 
was good business practice and these were good consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the amendments in Bill C-19 addressed the various 
weaknesses in the original act.  That is exactly what should 
happen when we do a review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some infamous cases of environmental assessment that 
did not work very well, such as the Oldman River case in my 
province.  There was duplication of effort between provincial and 
federal governments.  There were late interventions.  There was a 
lack of consultation and some rather foolish decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the winter I had a bridge put in to haul lumber out for 
Sunpine Forest Products.  The bridge was put a way up on the 
banks so it would in in any way touch the river.  Yet, through an 
environmental assessment called by a small group, the company had 
to lay off 100 people and the project did not go ahead because 
the bridge would shade the fish.  The problem was that it was 
only there to be used in the winter.  The fish were not swimming 
or breeding at that time.  There was ice and snow on the river. 
That is the kind of foolish decisions that are sometimes made. 
Hopefully, these amendments will stop that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would increase the ability for the public, 
industry and government to work effectively and efficiently on 
environmental assessments, saving time and money for all 
involved, increasing public participation in many cases and 
aiding in protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly interested in the environmental assessment 
co-ordinator assigned to each federal assessment and the 
possibility of having this co-ordinator there.  Often what 
happens is the public does not know who to talk to and are 
shifted from one level of government to the other.  Having an 
environmental co-ordinator assigned to a project should end this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest several changes as well to make the bill even 
better.  Public participation is essential to quality 
environmental assessment.  There are three improvements that 
should be made to improve this even further and I will just touch 
on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the public and industry want to work together on this 
issue.  Early public involvement means less long term suspicion 
and delays.  The scoping determination must be open to public 
scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, while the government is keen on going electronic, and I 
applaud this effort, it must not forget that many Canadians are 
still not plugged in.  Rather than an immediate switch to an 
electronic public registry system for access to information on 
project assessment, this government should go a little bit 
slower.  I have been told that there have been significant 
problems in the past with an electronic format.  Therefore, 
instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, I suggest 
working on a new one while keeping the old and relatively 
reliable format for the time being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it is essential that there be another review of the act 
and the effectiveness of these amendments in the next five to ten 
years. 
This would be to everyone's benefit and I believe would interest 
all stakeholders.  Co-operation between government departments 
and other levels of government is critical for the success of 
environmental assessment in Canada and outside Canada.  We must 
stop the duplication between different levels of government.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is natural for people to be suspicious of new changes, 
especially when these changes significantly alter the way they 
must think about how things have been done for so long.  The 
environmental assessment has been around for some time now and it 
is time for all federal departments to act in co-operation 
through the leadership of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Agency, so that environmental assessment can be done well and 
with a strong public input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations in particular have been very slow to rise to 
the challenge of environmental assessment.  While there are 
provisions in these amendments for developing environmental 
assessment regulations for some of these corporations, the public 
must have input into these regulations and have an opportunity to 
respond to drafts.  There must be assurances that Canadian 
standards are not different in some places or for some 
departments or corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation with the provinces, I repeat, is critical.  While 
the amendments to Bill C-19 reflect several suggestions made by 
the provinces, there is still significant discretion on the part 
of the responsible minister regarding key elements of decision 
making.  Turf wars are one of the most serious problems between 
the two levels of government.  I would like to see the provinces 
consulted before the minister's discretionary powers are invoked 
in sections 25 and 28 of the act.  This would demonstrate to the 
provinces that the federal government is truly working with them 
and not against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of the Environment and the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency for their work.  I also sincerely 
congratulate all those who have spent much precious time on 
developing these amendments, those in the public who gave their 
time in public consultations and workshops and those who have 
given their time to work on the regulatory advisory committee. 
All of them deserve many thanks for their commitment to this 
process and this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started this speech by talking about how environmental 
legislation best works.  It is first through co-operation with 
the citizens and all levels of governments.  It is through 
empowering people with information, with venues for dialogue, 
with support for dialogue, involvement and action.  It is through 
the federal government taking the lead, setting the example and 
co-ordinating the efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often the government has failed in keeping its many words 
regarding action on the environment.  It has failed many times to 
consult Canadians, has failed in some basic business practices 
and has said “just trust us”.  However suspicion wins when 
government fails to be up front.  The health of Canadians, the 
economy and the environment suffer if we are not up front with 
this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, while certainly not perfect, was a successful exercise in 
consulting with Canadians.  Such success means better 
environmental assessment, better co-operation, better government, 
and the government, industry and citizens will protect the 
environment better.  It means time saved, money saved and human 
health and the environment saved.  Environmental assessment is a 
good tool to work toward sustainability.  There is still much 
room for improvement, but I have indicated where some of that can 
come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I suggest that the government use the five year 
review as a model of what can be achieved with other 
environmental issues such as global warming, species at risk, 
space preservation and other environmental issues.  Taking the 
lead through co-operation first with all of the citizens of 
Canada is the very best way to guarantee human health, 
environmental health and protection for now and the future for 
all of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed 
to the bill before us, Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. Being opposed to Bill C-19 is in 
line with the position traditionally taken by representatives 
from Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 and even before that, the federal government has been 
trying to get involved in environmental assessment, an area that 
falls under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction and in which the 
province is doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, 
which does environmental assessments based on criteria that were 
accepted and approved by successive legislatures in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we must speak up in the House. 
It is not an easy task, but it is not easy either for all those 
who are watching us, particularly Quebecers, who do not often 
have the chance to see the kind of duplication that a bill 
dealing with environmental assessment can create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always been and still is at the forefront in the area 
of environmental assessment. What the bill before us says is 
that, whenever the federal government invests money in the form 
of loans, loan guarantees or direct grants, or whenever it leads 
a project, an environmental assessment will necessarily be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that in spite of the fact that Quebec has its own Bureau 
d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, a concept that is 
totally independent from political decision makers. We saw the 
BAPE in action recently with regard to major projects by 
Hydro-Québec. 
The BAPE went against the major orientations of the agency. 
This is a system that works well in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, here we have federal duplication.  If there was no 
representation by Quebec at the public hearings that were held, 
there was a good reason for it.  There has been none since 1992 
purely and simply because, that year, the government of Robert 
Bourassa had passed a unanimous resolution in the National 
Assembly, stating as follows, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly strongly disapproves of the federal 
government bill— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dropped the number. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—, an act to establish a federal environmental assessment process— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an act identical to the one introduced today.  The 
resolution continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—, because it is contrary to the higher interests of Quebec, and 
that the National Assembly opposes its passage by the federal 
Parliament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a resolution unanimously passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly in 1992, under the Liberal government of Robert 
Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, therefore, a matter of integrity and honesty for all 
Quebecers in this House, to defend the interests of their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is too quick to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions for all kinds of political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that should guide a government when adopting a 
legislation is the protection of the interests of the citizens. 
In this case, the interests of the citizens are well protected 
by the Quebec government's Bureau d'audiences publiques sur 
l'environnement which, I repeat, is a non political, arm's 
length organization. Historically, it has had a very good record 
and rendered very good decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to understand how Liberals representing Quebec 
can defend a bill which constitutes a direct interference into 
Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has so much money that it could invest to 
help develop road infrastructure. We have an infrastructure 
program in which the federal government, the Quebec government 
and municipal governments pay one third each. This program was 
announced with great pump by the federal government, and 
received the support of the provinces, the Quebec government and 
the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, that infrastructure program will cover projects in 
this area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government is contributing one third, through 
subsidies, to several of these projects, environmental 
assessments will be made by it, even though Quebec has its own 
environmental assessment service, namely the Bureau d'audiences 
publiques sur l'environnement. This is a striking example of 
duplication that is extremely costly to Quebec taxpayers because 
we already have a good service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in 1992, the National Assembly, under the leadership 
of Robert Bourassa, unanimously adopted a motion rejecting a 
similar bill, which was to be passed in the House of Commons at 
the time. That motion was adopted unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the public hearings on this bill, no one came to 
represent Quebec, for the simple reason that we have our own 
environmental assessment service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of examples like this one that an increasing 
number of Quebecers are fed up with the federal government. It 
interferes in jurisdictions in which it has no business. The 
federal government should let Quebecers do their own thing, since 
they have an environmental assessment system that reflects their 
needs and that has proven successful. The Bureau d'audiences 
publiques sur l'environnement, or BAPE, is very helpful because 
it conducts environmental assessments for many projects. It is a 
Quebec agency that works well and that Canada is trying to copy 
for the benefit of the other Canadian provinces. That is fine 
with us, but leave Quebec alone with its own resources and 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have something that works well, namely the BAPE. Why impose a 
new level of assessments that will generate additional costs? 
Instead, the government should put that money in the tripartite 
infrastructure programs involving the municipalities, the Quebec 
government and the federal government. 
Or let them invest more than the mere $600 million they said they 
would invest in highways throughout Canada.  In the election 
campaign, this Liberal government promised Quebec alone over $3 
billion in investment, when there is only $600 million in the 
federal budget.  We have just looked at the votes in the Standing 
Committee on Transport, and only $600 million is available for 
the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than waste energy and money and spend resources on adding 
another service to the one that is very well operated in Quebec, 
the government should keep this money, invest it in municipal 
infrastructure projects, and government highway infrastructure 
projects in Quebec and Canada.  It should leave the organizations 
and institutions that work well in Quebec. The Bureau d'audiences 
publiques sur l'environnement is one Quebec institution that 
works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for the public, for Quebecers watching us, to hear us 
discuss a bill that has a pleasing title, the act to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, except that it pleases the 
Canadian provinces that do not have environmental assessment 
procedures in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec do have one.  We are proud of it.  I repeat, in 
1992, the government of Robert Bourassa, unanimously called on 
the federal government to withdraw from this area of 
jurisdiction, environmental assessment, because it is a 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is good reason no Quebec organization appeared before the 
various committees studying this bill. 
The Bloc Quebecois cannot support this bill, which is a blatant 
example of interference. It is because of measures like this one 
that an increasing number of Quebecers no longer believe in this 
Canada. The federal government is only investing in an attempt to 
gain political popularity. It is trying to achieve that by 
duplicating services that are already provided by Quebec 
agencies. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why Liberal members in this House, who are 
aware of the problems associated with infrastructure programs and 
the constant needs of municipalities and of Quebec's road 
network, support a bill that will create a new level of 
environmental assessments.

are such aberrations in this Canada. I hope people will remember 
that, and the sooner the better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Churchill.  It is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-19, an act to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, at second reading.  For 
the record, the New Democratic Party will be opposing the bill 
and will be voting against it at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act does not go 
far enough to protect our environment.  The changes proposed in 
Bill C-19, unfortunately, would only further weaken the 
legislation.  The bill is an attempt to streamline and speed up 
the environmental assessment and review process to benefit 
developers and industry instead of protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would implement the results of the statutory 
review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act conducted by 
the Minister of the Environment.  It would establish a federal 
environmental assessment co-ordinator for projects that undergo 
screening or comprehensive study level assessments.  It would 
modify the comprehensive study process to prevent a second 
environmental assessment of a project by a review panel while 
extending the participant funding program to comprehensive 
studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would expand existing regulations, making 
authority for projects on federal lands, provide the new use for 
class screening reports as a replacement for project specific 
assessments and makes follow up programs mandatory for projects 
after a comprehensive study or review panel.  These amendments 
would provide Canadians with access to information about the 
environmental assessment of a specific project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would create the Canadian environmental 
assessment registry.  It would require that the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency establish and lead a quality 
assurance program, promote and monitor compliance and assist 
relevant parties in building consensus and resolving disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats believe that we need measures to strengthen and 
improve safeguards to protect the environment and this bill 
unfortunately does not go nearly far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are increasingly concerned about the state of the 
environment in their communities and around the globe.  They 
worry about the quality of the air they breathe and the safety of 
the water they drink.  They are deeply concerned about the kind 
of ecological legacy they will be leaving their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  What kind of measures are we talking about? 
At the present time outside the House of Commons we have a 
demonstrator from the Sierra Club, Elizabeth May, who is on her 
14th day of a hunger strike.  She is trying to force the federal 
government into taking action on the environmental travesty at 
the Sydney tar ponds.  She wants to force the government to 
permanently relocate the many people who are living in the area 
directly around the tar ponds who have experienced colossal 
health problems for decades because of the pollution in their 
environment.  This is a very concrete example of a measure that 
the government could take right now to ensure the environmental 
and health safety of many Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important measure in my mind is the Halifax harbour 
clean up.  I come from a community that has been dumping raw 
sewage into the harbour for many decades.  The only benefit is 
that we have ocean currents that continue to move the sewage 
around at quite a pace, but we have a huge job ahead of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Halifax regional municipality has worked very hard to get 
both the provincial and the federal government on side to work on 
that essential infrastructure project.  Something of that size 
has to be done on a three way split.  Each level of government 
has to be involved because of the cost and the scope of the 
project.  At this point in time the federal government is nowhere 
near offering the kind of money that is required from its side of 
the equation.  That is another measure the government could take 
right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is time that Canada implement comprehensive, 
enforceable and understandable standards for water and air 
quality and food safety.  The government should be investing in 
services that clean up the water and the air, stimulate green 
investment and expand public transit.  It should also take action 
to make work places safer.  The government's record on the 
environment is a litany of neglect, delay and broken promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that we should protect the environment in some 
very specific ways.  I will put forward suggestions for the 
government to take into account when it is doing further work on 
the act.  We need to assert a strong federal presence in both 
environmental monitoring and regulatory enforcement.  We need to 
implement comprehensive, enforceable and understandable standards 
for water and air quality and food safety.  We need to develop 
and implement a national water strategy including development of 
national safe drinking water standards and a ban on bulk water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we institute agreements that give environmental 
protection precedence over trade agreements in transboundary 
movements of hazardous wastes and other environmentally dangerous 
goods.  We need to ensure that a green screen integrates 
environmental criteria into all federal government decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we implement endangered species and habitat 
protection legislation developed in co-operation with other 
governments, affected communities and labour, making use of 
traditional aboriginal knowledge and vesting identification of 
species at risk with independent scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to expand marine protected areas and the national parks 
system and protect the parks system from commercial development 
that threatens its integrity.  We need to introduce tough 
punishment for polluters including criminal charges for corporate 
owners, directors and managers that break the law.  We need to 
develop the environmental bill of rights to ensure the legally 
enforceable right of all Canadians to a safe and healthy 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I repeat that we will be opposing the bill.  We 
will be voting against it at second reading.  We believe that the 
environmental assessment act does not go nearly far enough.  It 
needs to be strengthened.  We need the federal government to 
invest and commit immediately and generously to an environmental 
cleanup that will protect our children for generations to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to emphasize, as the hon. member for Dartmouth mentioned, that 
the New Democratic Party is opposed to the bill and intends to 
vote against it.  Hopefully there can be some improvements to the 
bill somewhere along the line, even though it is becoming clearer 
to most of us that the Liberal government does not follow through 
on its talk of being there to protect the environment and to do 
what is best for Canada.  I doubt we will see those changes and 
certainly there need to be changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow on what my hon. colleague said, public services like 
clean water, effective waste disposal, diversion, good roads and 
accessible public transit are essential to strong, healthy 
communities.  By the 1990s Canada was investing just 2.1% of its 
gross domestic product in public infrastructure.  That was about 
half of what was spent throughout the 1960s and 1970s.  We have 
had two decades of neglect.  This has meant poorer public 
services resulting in major problems like poor water quality, 
pollution, and a $75 billion deficit in municipal and 
environmental infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one group has suffered more from the neglect than Canada's 
first nations people.  We heard of the situations with water in 
Walkerton and North Battleford.  There was little emphasis on the 
number of first nations communities that have boil water mandates 
in place on an ongoing basis.  Many Canadians do not know that 
although there were standards in place for water treatment in 
communities throughout Canada, the government and the first 
nations communities never bypassed the bare minimum standard for 
anything in first nations communities. 
Whether it be water, sewer or housing, bar none the bare minimum 
standard was met.  We know what happens when only the bare 
minimum standard is met.  That is exactly what they get.  As a 
result, with little money going into the infrastructure we have 
seen even greater problems in those communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The occurrences of stomach and gastrointestinal problems that we 
hear about in non-aboriginal communities are ongoing issues in 
first nation communities.  They struggle and fight with the 
government to put in place ongoing funding for these programs so 
they do not have to go to the government.  I hate to say it, but 
often immediately before an election the government says it will 
do something and then right after the election we see many 
communities having to go on bended knees begging the government 
for what should be rightfully theirs in the first place, which is 
quality water and sewer infrastructure and quality housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ecologists warn that without major new investment and a national 
approach to water quality, access to freshwater will soon become 
Canada's worst environmental crisis.  Significant public and 
private investments are also needed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, improve energy efficiency and cut back the release of 
waste into the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many corporations have opposed efforts to deal with these 
pressing issues.  The Liberals have listened to corporate Canada, 
ignoring the fact that no economy or society can exist 
independently of the environment.  The Liberals have made no 
progress in developing a sustainable economy for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberals have listened to corporate Canada.  We also 
know and fear the fact that our Prime Minister is now listening 
to the American president and vice-president saying they want 
more energy resources from Canada instead of the U.S. addressing 
its problems of overconsumption, greed and misusing energy when 
it should be putting into place conservation processes.  We see 
our government buckling under to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all wants jobs and economic prosperity, but we also want to 
protect the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we 
eat.  With leadership from the federal government working 
families can have both environmental and economic security.  New 
Democrats believe Canada needs a new commitment to rebuilding our 
publicly owned and operated infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has called for a multi-year national environmental 
infrastructure investment program to channel investment into 
pressing environmental concerns like water and air quality, toxic 
waste disposal, energy efficiency and the clean up of 
environmental hot spots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national environmental investment and infrastructure program 
could be used for the set up of a clean water fund to upgrade 
municipal water and waste water treatment plants to improve water 
quality, water conservation and effluent management.  We cannot 
have another Walkerton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could clean up toxic hot spots like the Sydney tar ponds and 
the sites of the Great Lakes.  I know my colleague mentioned this 
as well, but a number of colleagues from that area of the country 
over the past three or four years have constantly pushed and 
fought for the clean up of the Sydney tar ponds.  This has made 
me realize just how terrible are the Sydney tar ponds.  When 
hearing about it on a daily basis and getting all the background 
on it, we realize that this is a government-company sponsored 
environmental wasteland with no serious effort to clean it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad part is there is real concern it cannot even be cleaned 
up now.  The least we should be doing is getting the people whose 
health is at risk out of that area.  That is why Elizabeth May 
has been on a hunger strike for the past two weeks.  The 
government has failed to address the issue of getting those 
families out of there.  Instead it puts their health at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national environmental investment infrastructure program 
could renew efforts to achieve short term reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions in the wake of the Liberals' abandonment 
of commitments it made at Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could set up a clean air fund to back community based 
initiatives that reconcile job creation with the challenge posted 
by climate change.  The fund would be used for tree planting, 
alternative energy and transition programs for workers displaced 
by actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
We could support expansion and encourage greater use of public 
transit.  We could put mandatory limits on sulphur content in 
gasoline.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could change the federal tax system to ensure that tax 
policies encourage a more sustainable economy.  Taxes should be 
reduced on sustainable activities, particularly those that 
involve a greater investment in labour and an increase in 
non-sustainable activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could create a jobs fund to provide loan security for the 
cost of retrofitting residential, commercial and industrial 
buildings to meet higher standards of energy efficiency and make 
greater use of energy from alternative sources, resulting in 
reduced greenhouse emissions and lower costs.  We could improve 
recycling, composting and recovery systems to improve the 
diversion of household and commercial industrial waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund could encourage dynamic environmental industries and 
the development of new environmental technology.  We could invest 
as a partner in integrated and co-ordinated affordable public 
transit and commuter rail service in and around major urban 
centres.  This would be part of a national transportation 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we are criticized as New Democrats for thinking about the 
environment too much, for not considering the cost.  I say we can 
never think about the environment too much.  We can never put too 
much into the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have shown today that the cost savings are there.  This is an 
economical opportunity for Canada.  It is an opportunity for 
jobs, but even more so it is an opportunity to continue having 
the country we have now with a relatively decent environment and 
relatively clean air.  We have some bad spots, but we have a 
country of which to be proud, a country to which people from all 
over the world want to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young woman from Mexico attending university in Ottawa 
commented to me that it was nice to have her children go outside 
and play and not have to worry about their health because of the 
air.  We have a clean environment to offer people of the world. 
Let us continue to offer it to them by making sure that we 
protect it.  Let us fix the legislation and toughen it up instead 
of watering it down like the Liberals have done.

aboriginal people and the quality of their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 20 years ago I was living in Kenora, Ontario, where two 
reserves, White Dog and Grassy Narrow, were tragically affected 
by mercury poison in the Grassy River system.  The irony is that 
we see pristine wilderness that is completely polluted by 
external forces, by pulp and paper mills or by other industries 
such as mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the member for Churchill tackle that problem in her 
area, which is certainly a home to many native communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to respond.  Within the Churchill riding in Manitoba 
I actually have more than half the first nations in Manitoba.  I 
have been to all 31 of their communities.  Over my years living 
in northern Manitoba I knew many of the problems those 
communities faced.  As their member of parliament I have had the 
opportunity to view firsthand the situations they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear members of the House criticize why first nations 
live in such conditions.  The people in those communities do not 
want to live like that.  That was not the bargain they made with 
the Government of Canada when they made a decision to share the 
land and in return receive certain benefits from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not get specific funding to ensure that they have water 
and sewer services in every house.  They do not get specific 
funding to ensure that they will have fire hydrants in their 
communities.  The amount of funding for housing for all first 
nation members is so limited that we see literally a third of 
their populations leaving their communities because they do not 
have houses to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we will hear great criticism of why first nations 
people live like they do, the criticism should be directed at the 
governments of Canada which over past number of years have not 
sufficiently supported first nations people.

mentioned the Sydney tar ponds.  I had an opportunity to view 
that disgraceful mess and I would sure like to see something 
started there to clean it up and get the people living nearby who 
have been exposed to it away from it.

questions in the House that were specifically on the issue the

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were listening to the answers from the government we would 
say yes, there was a commitment that it would clean up these 
areas.  My understanding is that very few of those areas have 
been cleaned up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the situation in first nations communities, there 
were diesel powered generators in a lot of the communities for 
the nursing stations and schools.  Over the years there were huge 
diesel spills in those areas that affected the health of the 
first nations people.  In some cases schools or nursing stations 
were moved.  In other cases they were not.  In most cases areas 
affected by diesel spills were not cleaned up.  The hazards are 
still within the first nations communities.  There are affected 
communities in my riding.  They are attempting to continue their 
fight with the federal government to get it to pay for the 
cleanups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the federal government has not been strong in 
following through on its comments about cleaning up its 
environmental messes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
opposed to the proverbial comment we hear in the House that it is 
a pleasure to participate in such a debate on Bill C-19, I might 
actually say that every time I have had an opportunity to speak 
on issues pertaining to the environment I usually preface my 
comments by saying that it is with great sadness that I have a 
chance to participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am referring to is Bill C-19, which is the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act.  It was first brought forth as a 
very progressive piece of legislation by the Conservatives in 
June 1992 when the Progressive Conservative Party was in 
government.  Those governments have been described by individuals 
such as Elizabeth May of the Sierra Club, who is outside fighting 
the environmental degradation at the Sydney tar ponds, in this 
way:  the Conservative governments were the most environmentally 
progressive governments in the industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives actually developed the omnibus bill on the 
control and use of toxins in the environment, known as the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  It was a Progressive 
Conservative government that led the international community in 
1987 with respect to developing a protocol known as the Montreal 
protocol.  That challenged the industrialized world to eliminate 
or drastically reduce ozone depleting gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that same era, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will recall 
that the prime minister and the minister of environment of the 
day, Jean J. Charest, led a delegation in which Canada was a 
world leader by bringing the world together with respect to 
climate change and biodiversity.  In contrast we now have a 
government that has been in office for nearly eight years and has 
yet to pass a single piece of environmental legislation of note. 
That is the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just my comments.  I can even refer to Stewart 
Elgie, who is the executive director of the Sierra Legal Defence 
Fund.  These are his words, not just mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking at is a mandatory review, which was put in 
place by the Progressive Conservative government in 1992 in the 
first piece of legislation and which shows the understanding that 
what we do today with respect to environmental management will be 
drastically different in the very near future. 
That is why it is incumbent upon the government to review 
legislation of this sort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this initiative, we should be doing what the 
minister of the day, Lucien Bouchard, said in 1990.  He found 
three legislative gaps with respect to the environment.  First, 
Canada essentially has a pesticide act that is over 30 years old. 
Second, we really do not have a framework to establish 
legislation to ensure safe drinking water in Canada.  Last, at 
the time he was advocating that we have legislation in place to 
protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are a decade later, after eight years of Liberal 
government, still waiting for those three initiatives to be 
brought forth to the Canadian public.  However we do have some 
housekeeping, in that the minister has tabled in a timely manner 
the mandatory review of the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act.  According to the minister's press release, the purpose of 
the act is essentially tenfold.  I will list the ten points very 
briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One purpose is to focus the act on projects with a greater 
likelihood of adverse environmental effects as opposed to having 
only broad screenings of issues that have less or a minor impact 
and could be managed more effectively and exclusively by the 
provinces.  The Progressive Conservative Party has a proud 
tradition of being respectful of jurisdictional issues with 
respect to the provincial governments and the federal government. 
That is why we support the idea of harmonization, not to the 
lowest common denominator but to ensure that this is done in the 
most cost effective, time effective and environmentally effective 
manner possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this list with respect to this new review the minister 
advocates:  improving co-ordination among federal departments and 
agencies when several are involved in the same assessment, which 
I think is a good initiative; reaffirming and enhancing 
co-operation with other governments in conducting environmental 
assessments where jurisdictional overlaps and duplications occur, 
which the Progressive Conservative Party indeed embraces; and 
increasing certainty in the process in order to reduce the 
potential for project delays and cost increases.  Industry will 
play by the rules.  We can develop faster and that will help our 
economy grow, but industry and the provincial governments that 
want to take initiatives of this sort have to know what the rules 
are.  The certainty in reducing overlap and duplication is a key 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill the minister advocates strengthening the role of 
follow-ups to ensure that sound environmental protection measures 
are in place for the project as well as improving consideration 
of what the cumulative effects of the project might be.  One 
project on its own may not have an impact that would 
significantly degrade the environment in any way, shape or form, 
but the cumulative effect may come into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth point the minister advocates is that of providing 
convenient and timely access to reports and other information 
about assessments.  As well, he advocates strengthening the 
incorporation of aboriginal perspectives in the federal process, 
an initiative I strongly applaud, along with expanding public 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may be aware that within the last year a task force 
led by the federal government was struck to study issues with 
respect to environmental assessment.  A myriad of items was 
tabled in that report.  The sad thing is that in going through 
the legislation at first blush it seems that only a few were 
acted on in this revision of the act.  When this gets to 
committee the Progressive Conservative Party wants to ensure that 
we have a full vetting of the committee's report. 
It is a report that I have not gone through in any detail, but 
through our research we have discovered that only a couple of the 
items were touched upon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are dealing with a mandatory review of a piece of 
legislation which the government is compelled to actually 
perform.  We will do our process, but what Canadians want is 
environmental leadership across the board.  As the former 
minister of the environment, Lucien Bouchard, said in 1990, we 
need new pesticide legislation.  It is 30 years old.  The 
Minister of Health said he would table it quite soon.  I remember 
Claire Franklin, the executive director of the Pest Management 
Regulatory Agency, saying that framework legislation or draft 
legislation has essentially been in place for three years.  Yet 
the government has not acted and does not table the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still waiting for a species at risk bill that will work. 
The Progressive Conservative Party will not support that piece of 
legislation for four reasons, primarily because it does not 
include migratory birds and it still contains the belief that 
politicians rather than scientists are a better fit to determine 
whether or not a species is at risk.  It is also extremely 
intrusive in one regard, and very hypocritical, I might add.  The 
species at risk legislation says that it has the capacity to 
force a private landowner to engage in recovery plans and the 
capacity to force a province to participate, but it is permissive 
with respect to habitat protection within its own backyard, on 
federal land.  We will have a chance to address that bill later 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a long way from being able to give a definitive answer 
about whether we will support this legislation in its compulsory 
review.  We will let the committee do its job, but ultimately the 
Government of Canada should take up the myriad of recommendations 
made by the task force that studied this issue.  We will do our 
work in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today marks the beginning of National 
Mining Week which is celebrated annually to increase public 
awareness of the importance of mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How often do Canadians think about mining, minerals and metals 
and the crucial role they play?  About 400,000 Canadians think 
about it every day because their livelihood depends on mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minerals and metal exports represent 13% of total Canadian 
exports, 70% of the total volume handled at Canadian ports, and 
more than half of all total rail freight revenue.  Canadian 
mining is a global leader.  It is a productive and innovative 
sector closely linked to the knowledge based technology driven 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all Canadians to reflect on our mining heritage and 
to recognize mining's contribution to our prosperity and to our 
international reputation as a centre of mining excellence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one economist after another is saying 
that the government's budget numbers simply do not add up. For 
instance, we have the former assistant deputy minister to the 
finance minister on record as saying that the government just 
never added those numbers together, so we are in the whole by 
$1.5 billion.  This confirms what others are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the evidence is mounting, will the finance minister 
admit that we are headed to a planning deficit by at least the 
year 2004? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are in the fifth year of a surplus, something that 
has never been seen in Canada in many years.  We remember very 
well that for months and months they were telling us that we were 
always too prudent in our analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the big problem they face is that yes, we predicted a 
surplus of $10 billion and it will be $15 billion.  We are not 
going in the direction of having a deficit.  We are doing exactly 
the contrary at this moment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  He avoided the question, Mr. Speaker.  I can 
assure him that I have never accused a Liberal spender of being 
too prudent.  I have never said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have worked too hard to see the deficit eliminated. 
They are still working hard, too hard, to see it squandered 
because of poor planning on behalf of and on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister commit to and charge his finance 
minister with tabling a five year update, as the finance minister 
has done in the past, to try to give assurance?  Now he is 
talking about a two year update as if there is something to hide 
in year three.  Will he tell his finance minister to table a five 
year update as he has in the past? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell the Minister of Finance to do exactly what 
he has done in the last eight years, and that is to be a good 
Minister of Finance and produce more surpluses in the years to 
come.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that this government is going to take the 
contingency reserve and use it to pay for its election promises.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister tell us here and now that he will not 
dip into the reserve, except in the event of an emergency? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the word contingency reserve means for use in the event of an 
emergency.  That is why we have a contingency reserve.  Why? 
Because emergencies sometimes arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we will not use the reserve if there is no emergency and, if 
there is no emergency, we will once again use the contingency 
reserve to pay down the debt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is in fact wrong.  All economists are telling 
us that we are looking at a planning deficit that will lead into 
the contingency reserve by the fourth year of this fiscal plan. 
We are also told that the finance minister will only give us a 
two year projection.  Last October before the election he gave us 
a five year projection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he changing it?  What will happen in those three ensuing 
years, like the planning deficit which he is afraid to admit to 
this House and to Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
new facts support the statement made by a senior federal 
official to the effect that Canada is about to give its support 
to the U.S. missile defence shield program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Department of National Defence has confirmed that a 
Canadian lieutenant-colonel will soon be at the Pentagon to act 
as liaison officer under the missile defence shield program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government finally be upfront, stop fooling the 
public and the parliamentarians, whom it has not yet seen fit to 
consult, and admit that it will support the missile defence 
shield program of the Bush administration? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
told President Bush that we wanted a dialogue on this issue. He 
agreed to have a dialogue with us, with the NATO allies, with 
Russia and with China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are keeping an eye on what is going on and we are waiting for 
the President of the U.S. to make proposals and to discuss the 
issue with us. We want to be involved in the discussions. Once 
we have all the information, we will be in a position to make a 
decision. But we cannot make a decision on a project that the 
Americans themselves are not sure they can implement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today, at the end of the meeting with the U.S. envoys, the 
federal government will hold a briefing for the media. However, 
the government has not planned anything for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so intent on not having parliamentarians 
involved in this issue? Is it to put members of parliament 
before a fait accompli and thus avoid a true debate in the House 
before the government adopts its position and makes it public? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we talk to the media, we generally assume that some members 
of this House will read the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are House committees that review these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, nothing prevents the Bloc Quebecois leader from calling 
public officials and asking them to provide him with the same 
information that they are giving to the media. This is public 
information. Therefore, it is available to all. I do not 
understand why they are moaning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a week ago the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois asked the Prime Minister for a 
meeting with the two U.S. envoys who are today in Ottawa to 
provide the Canadian government with more information on the 
missile defence shield project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister intend to respond favourably, and what 
is more important immediately, to the request by the Bloc 
Quebecois to meet with the U.S. envoys.  This is a decision that 
can be taken readily.  All the Prime Minister has to do is say 
“right away”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is not a political visit, but a briefing for 
departmental officials, a technical briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes us to prepare a briefing, we can get 
the appropriate departmental officials to prepare it.  That is 
not a problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government 
seems to be up to its old tricks once again.  It is informing us 
that it is going to brief the journalists and departmental 
officials, while all parliamentarians are kept uninformed. 
I find that this government is absolutely arrogant in making 
decisions like this one.

House on this matter, and that he will assure us that Canada 
will not take an official position until there has been a debate 
and vote here in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs has just offered the hon. member 
a briefing on the matter.  We have therefore just said yes to 
him, yet he is rising to tell us that we are being arrogant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, yes, there will be a debate in the House of Commons.  I 
hope hon. members will also discuss it in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not prepared to reach a decision.  We want to know 
everyone's position, not just the position of the hon. members

question is for the Prime Minister.  CMHC has estimated that $4

safe water and water waste management systems.  That is $4 
billion annually that is needed urgently from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister indicate whether such a clean water fund

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the municipalities that money would be available for their water 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact almost 50% of the money in the infrastructure program is 
for what we call for green infrastructure.  We are already doing 
that, and I hope this will satisfy the leader of the NDP Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
point is it will not satisfy the need.  It is a drop in the 
bucket compared to what is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water experts and ecologists like David Schindler have been 
screaming for a national water strategy from the government since 
the day it took office.  What do we have eight years later? We 
have Walkerton.  We have North Battleford.  We have up to 100 
aboriginal reserves and over 700 other communities that are faced 
with contaminated drinking water.

said our priority was to help the municipalities with the green 
infrastructure.

agree to disagree on certain issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the member that with respect to this matter of

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-27, an act respecting the long-term management of 
nuclear fuel waste, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to present Bill 
C-27 for second reading.  This is an act respecting the long term 
management of nuclear fuel waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nuclear energy option has been part of Canada's energy 
supply mix for over a quarter of a century.  Canada and, in 
particular, Ontario have benefited from this production.  With 
these benefits, however, comes the responsibility of properly 
managing the resulting waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The waste in question is solid fuel bundles discharged from 
reactors built with our own Canadian Candu technology. Existing 
waste is currently stored safely at the reactor sites and await a 
long term management strategy.  The development and control of 
the nuclear energy option falls under federal jurisdiction and 
the Government of Canada has a duty to assume its 
responsibilities in this area, which includes the very critical 
matter of oversight functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation in Bill C-27 is a major step forward in 
dealing with the management of nuclear fuel waste in Canada over 
the long term.  The bill is the culmination of many years of 
research, environmental assessment and extensive consultations 
with stakeholders, including waste owners, the provinces, the 
public and aboriginal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a solution to this issue and are looking to the 
Government of Canada to establish a clear, fair and comprehensive 
strategy to make effective progress.  Bill C-27 provides a legal 
framework for such a strategy and sets the course for years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal initiative builds on the government response to the 
nuclear fuel waste and disposal environmental assessment panel. 
The panel, also known, for short, as the Seaborn panel, carried 
out a comprehensive, decade long review while consulting with 
Canadians from Saskatchewan to New Brunswick.  I commend the 
panel on its efforts to come to grips with this very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998, the panel submitted its recommendations to the 
Government of Canada.  In December 1998, the Government of Canada 
provided its response.  In the response, the government agreed 
with the large majority of the panel's recommendations.  In 
particular, the government agreed that federal oversight was 
needed to proceed with the long term management of nuclear fuel 
waste, and we stated three policy objectives for that oversight: 
first, that it must ensure that a segregated fund be established 
by waste owners; second, that it must ensure a reporting 
relationship between the Government of Canada and a waste 
management organization to be set up by the waste owners 
themselves; and third, that it must ensure a federal review and 
approval mechanism, including the issue of access to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Government of Canada announced a policy framework 
for radioactive waste which highlighted that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will ensure that radioactive waste 
disposal is carried out in a safe, environmentally sound, 
comprehensive, cost-effective and integrated manner.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has already provided oversight to 
ensure that the safety and environment of Canadians are not 
unduly affected by the nuclear energy option.  This has mainly 
been carried out pursuant to the 1945 Atomic Energy Control Act 
which was replaced in 2000 by the new Nuclear Safety and Control 
Act. The proposed nuclear fuel waste act is now needed to 
complete the fulfilment of government responsibilities by 
ensuring that long term waste management activities are carried 
out in a comprehensive, cost effective and integrated manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 ensures: that all nuclear fuel waste to be managed in 
Canada is addressed under a consistent and unified approach; that 
all nuclear fuel waste owners fall within the same legal 
framework;  that waste owners will start setting aside funds to 
fulfill all their financial responsibilities over the long term; 
and that waste owners will work together in complying with all 
relevant Government of Canada policies considering technical, 
socioeconomic and ethical aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed nuclear fuel waste act and the existing Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act would be complementary.  Together they set 
the foundation for fulfilling federal jurisdictional oversight 
responsibilities for the long term management of nuclear fuel 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the main requirements of Bill C-27?  First, the bill 
requires the establishment of a waste management organization by 
the main waste owners in Canada, which includes primarily the 
operating nuclear utilities.  The organization would be 
responsible for carrying out government approved waste management 
operations.  This is consistent with the regulatory philosophy 
adopted in Canada which places the primary responsibility for 
safety within the nuclear industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety record of our Canadian nuclear utilities is 
unparalleled.  It is recognized internationally.  These utilities 
understand the need for excellent performance and they understand 
the need and desirability of public participation in the decision 
making process.  They must, in short, earn the public's trust. 
The proposed legislation would ensure activities of the waste 
owners and of the waste management organization are subject to 
public scrutiny and reviewed annually by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill requires the waste management organization to 
submit to the federal government options for the long term 
management of nuclear fuel waste.  It is important to understand, 
and I underline this point very clearly, that no decision has yet 
been made on which management method will ultimately be adopted. 
The Government of Canada agreed with the Seaborn panel that more 
work needed to be done in this area before any decisions could be 
made.  Bill C-27 provides a legal framework to carry out that 
work.  The bill requires that the waste management organization 
examine three options: deep geological disposal, onsite storage 
or central long term storage.  In addition, the waste management 
organization can propose any other option as well.  The bill 
makes clear that the government will make the final decision on 
an approach to be adopted for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill requires the main waste owners to put aside real 
money in a segregated trust fund managed by a third party. 
Canadians want to be assured that when the time comes, money will 
be available to fund all long term waste management activities 
and the Canadian taxpayers will not be called upon to shoulder 
that financial burden.  This is entirely consistent with the 
polluter pay principle.  Therefore, upon entry into force of this 
legislation, it is expected that deposits as prescribed in the 
proposed nuclear fuel waste act would start the accumulation of 
the money that is needed in the trust fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge for the government in developing this legislation 
was to be fair to all of the stakeholders and to strike an 
effective balance in the public interest. I firmly believe that 
the proposed legislation fully meets that challenge and it is 
supported by initial reactions that have been received on Bill 
C-27.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main owners of nuclear fuel waste have conveyed to me that 
they welcome the increased regulatory certainty provided by the 
legislation, that it provides them with a clear framework to 
fulfil their public responsibilities and that it does not create 
an unmanageable financial burden.  Small waste owners will note 
that the new waste management organization would be required to 
provide them, that is, the small owners, with long term 
management services at reasonable cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing this legislation the Government of Canada of 
course consulted with the affected provinces, that is, Ontario, 
Quebec and New Brunswick.  We addressed many of their concerns 
and showed as much flexibility as possible without compromising 
that fundamental point about federal oversight.  The provinces 
recognize that the development and control of nuclear energy is 
indeed within federal jurisdiction and they are supportive of the 
direction that we are taking in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government oversight in the legislative scheme provides for 
mandatory transparency.  This was recommended by the Seaborn 
panel and agreed to by the Government of Canada for increasing 
public confidence.  For example, all waste management 
organization reports submitted to the Minister of Natural 
Resources are to be made public.  The waste management 
organization must carry out public consultations at every stage 
of its process.  An advisory council must be established by the 
waste management organization, whose comments on the 
organization's activities would also be made public.  In 
addition, over the life of the project the government would 
exercise additional oversight as required through the Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Care was taken in putting all of this together to avoid overlap 
and duplication while ensuring that all requirements are fully 
met.  Therefore, as recommended by the Seaborn panel, there are 
multiple government oversight mechanisms at play here which would 
ensure that the process proceeds effectively and democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people have shown considerable interest in this 
important initiative.  I have sought their active participation 
in decision making on the long term management of nuclear fuel 
waste.  They participated extensively in the Seaborn hearings.  I 
have met with a number of aboriginal leaders to discuss how they 
wish to be further consulted on next steps.  This active 
involvement of aboriginal people has been recognized and ensured 
in Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the government will continue to carry out related 
activities pursuant to its fiduciary responsibility toward 
aboriginal people and recognizes the valuable perspectives and 
insights of aboriginal peoples which can usefully inform and 
influence all future steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would make the point that in any of the dialogue that I have 
had with aboriginal leaders, whether verbally or in writing, 
whenever we have discussed this matter we have not discussed the 
issue of where any particular future disposal sight might 
hypothetically be located.  That has not been the topic on the 
agenda.  What we have talked about is how they wish to be 
consulted in the process, how they wish to have influence on and 
input into the process.  It has not been any form of negotiation. 
It has been a respectful solicitation of their advice and their 
insights, because they do have a great deal to offer in this 
decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the administration of the nuclear fuel waste act?  Under 
the proposed legislation the main decisions would be made by the 
governor in council.  The designated minister for the 
administration of the legislation would be the Minister of 
Natural Resources.  As such, the Department of Natural Resources 
would be charged with carrying out ministerial responsibilities 
under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department would provide the focal point for 
interdepartmental, technical, financial, social and ethical 
reviews and for any independent reviews that might be necessary. 
The department would provide the government's direct and regular 
liaison with the waste management organization, the public, the 
provinces, aboriginal peoples and other interested parties. 
The department would ensure that the nuclear fuel waste act is 
complied with and thus would manage all auditing, verification, 
inspection and enforcement measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 was not established in a contextual vacuum.  The 
evolution of policy was guided by consultations with stakeholders 
and by experienced gained in other countries, together with the 
invaluable work that was done by the Seaborn panel.  The bill 
adopts a phased, step-wise approach allowing for all planned and 
executed waste management activities to be reviewed and for the 
public to participate effectively at every step along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process would take many years to complete and would possibly 
affect future generations.  The legislation focuses on this 
generation's responsibilities but is flexible in allowing 
decision making by future generations if that turns out to be the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can now move ahead effectively toward an appropriate 
solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste which 
takes into consideration not only technical safety matters but 
incorporates, in a very integral way, the social and ethical 
values of Canadians.  I commend the legislation to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, pursuant to Standing

their constituents, which is what I am doing.  However, as I say, 
the beauty of this one is that I think it is an issue of 
importance to all Canadians and all members of parliament trying 
to represent them at the national level.  Today I want to raise 
the issue in the House with this motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, pursuant to Standing Order 68(4)(b), a legislative 
committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill that would 
create the position of ombudsman to oversee private disability

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a terrible injustice being inflicted upon some Canadian 
citizens by private insurance companies that are refusing to 
honour their policies and pay benefits to people who suffer with 
long term disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these cases involve Canadians who have put their own 
lives at risk in careers with the armed forces, the RCMP and the 
peacekeepers.  Others are what we would call ordinary Canadians 
who have worked hard at their jobs as nurses, teachers and 
loggers to provide for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, the problem is that Canadians in the workplace 
who find themselves with severe illnesses or disabilities which 
prevent them from performing their duties of employment and who 
then turn to their insurance companies, under which they believe 
they have insurance to assist them in such unfortunate 
circumstances, suddenly find the support is not there.  Thus, the 
stress and anxiety they are under from their illnesses or 
accidents, along with the reality that they can no longer work to 
provide for themselves and their families, is multiplied by the 
process of and treatment by their insurance company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course one must preface this by saying that it is not true of 
all claimants and not true of all insurance companies, but surely 
all members who are listening would agree with me that two, three 
and four times a week in every one of our constituency offices it 
happens that people are having difficulty with their disability 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what my constituents have told me about processing their 
claims.  First they are informed that their only option is to go 
on short term disability, from 26 to 52 weeks, only after they 
can prove with medical evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that 
they are severely disabled and unable to perform their duties at 
their present employment.  At the end of the short term 
disability period, their insurance benefits are cut off and they 
are again required to go through the process to prove that they 
are still disabled.  At that point they may be allowed to go on 
long term disability or be granted another short term period, but 
even if they are granted long term disability they will be 
subject to a review, usually every year.  That means their 
benefits will again be cut off and they are required to go 
through the whole process over and over again with the same 
insurance company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the past month I was made aware of two cases of 
constituents of mine who have received foreclosure notices on 
their homes from their banks due to cancellation of disability 
insurance benefits.  These were on applications that had been 
completed at the bank, the lending institution, on behalf of the 
insurance company.  They have led to disqualification of 
benefits, resulting in the foreclosure action by the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the insurance company nor the bank in these cases would 
take responsibility for the intent of the insurance.  In other 
words, in these cases the bank had the customer sign documents 
insuring the mortgage but later the insurance company claimed it 
was the wrong document or application and refused to accept it 
and process the benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank's response in these cases has been to discipline the 
employees to satisfy the insurance company.  However, the banks 
have failed their customers, who in these cases have paid the 
premiums attached to the mortgage for years and believed the 
coverage was in place should they require it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the insurance company and the bank to provide this 
coverage needs to be addressed.  Do they intentionally provide 
wrong applications to their customers?  I think not, but do the 
insurance companies not provide proper training to the bank 
employees?  Perhaps.  Do the insurance companies not review these 
applications and advise the banks that they have not processed 
the correct application and that their clients may not be 
entitled to benefits as a result?  With the banks and insurance 
companies happily accepting their clients' insurance premiums 
each month, does it not obligate them to pay out benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if the funds are flowing through to the insurance company 
there is an expectation, an intent.  If the paperwork is 
incorrect that is where an ombudsman would come in, because the 
banks and insurance companies end up working on and detailing 
only the words that are on a piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the fact that people are paying their premiums does 
not really make that much difference.  The question is:  What can 
we do about it? 
What recourse do average Canadians have against banks and 
insurance companies when they find themselves faced with the 
circumstances that I have just described?  Their insurance 
benefits denied, their only option is to accept it or hire a 
lawyer and fight for their rights.  Talk about David and Goliath.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of interest to all Canadians at this point is, if the claim is 
approved at this point, the insurance companies require the 
employee or victim to apply for early Canada pension benefits 
thus reducing the insurance companies benefit payable.  In other 
words, the insurance company is downloading onto the reserves 
Canadians have paid into for their retirement pensions.  Also of 
interest is that at one time all pension benefits received from 
an insurance company were in addition to any other pensions 
received such as the CPP and WCB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insurance companies will review each stage and suggest other 
employment opportunities that can be pursued so they can lower 
their benefit.  Quoting from an insurance group's policy, it 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Totally disabled” shall mean, for the first 30 months of a 
total disability, an employee is wholly and continuously disabled 
by illness or accidental bodily injury which prevents him from 
performing the essential duties of his normal occupation.  After 
the first 30 months of total disability, “totally disabled” 
shall mean he is unable to perform the essential duties of any 
occupation for which he is reasonably fitted by education, 
training or experience.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note that when the insured obtained the insurance it was insured 
at his present job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tactics of periodically discontinuing benefits or taking 
away our financial support mechanism and requiring one to 
continually prove he or she is incapable of working is in itself 
questionable.  We are aware of cases where the insurance company 
has hired private investigators or sent their investigators out 
to spy on and record all activities of their clients for extended 
periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from letters from my constituents who, 
according to their doctors and medical specialists, were disabled 
but were unable to convince the bureaucrats working for the Canada 
Pension Act.  The insurance providers look for any unfavourable 
decision from CPP so they can suspend or deny benefits.  The 
letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had been on Long Term Disability—for over two years, at which 
point (the company) informed me that I had to apply for Canada 
Disability.  This upset me at the time as I didn't consider my 
disability to be permanent.  I am doing everything in my power to 
get better.  It was explained to me that this is a necessary step 
in my health care management, and that I would qualify for 
benefits until such time as I was well.  I was told (the company) 
would “top up” the benefits from CPP to my present level, if in 
effect, I qualified for disability pensions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next letter said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both companies denied my benefits, and I had to go through the 
appeal process.  CPP has since denied my appeal, and I am 
awaiting (the company's) decision.  I highly suspect (the 
company) is waiting to hear CPP's decision so that it can be used 
against me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking at here is the fact that there is a 
patchwork quilt with which our constituents are faced.  Much of 
the law that covers this particular activity in our society is 
federal law yet its administration is at the provincial level. 
Yet when we go to the provincial level, there is no ombudsman 
function on the part of any of the provincial governments.  This 
unfortunately ends up falling between the cracks of federal and 
provincial jurisdiction.  We recognize that getting an ombudsman 
is not the full answer because in effect we can still end up with 
fighting and delays and things getting in the way of the 
ombudsman to go ahead and work on behalf of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line to the exercise is this, if people find 
themselves disabled and at that particular point no longer able 
to be gainfully employed, they now has a number of concerns. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern is obviously their physical or mental 
incapacity to be able to perform at an ordinary level.  That is a 
concern that would relate to everyone around them, particularly 
within their family unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they will not have any income.  Therefore, all their 
assets will be threatened and their ability to provide for 
themselves and their families will be threatened.  It is a highly 
stressful situation because the two things work together in a 
symbiotic relationship to make both of those issues work.  Then, 
if they are denied the benefits that they were fully anticipating 
by paying into a benefits program, there is a third compounding 
effect to their very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure, Madam Speaker, as I said to the previous gentleman in 
that chair, that even in your office and in all our offices we 
deal with these things on a weekly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of my motion is to tell the federal government that we 
have a problem and that there is no solution to the problem. The 
people who no longer have a job or the resources, and in many 
cases do not have the emotions to be able to handle the 
situation, require some help.  To ask them to put down a $1,000, 
$5,000 or $10,000 retainer for a lawyer to represent them is 
absolutely facetious.  It simply cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, with the motion I am simply asking the government 
take a look at this gaping hole between the federal jurisdiction 
of legislation, the provincial enactment that relates to the 
legislation and find some way to help our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for all of us in the House, on a totally 
non-partisan basis, to bring a balance to the people of Canada 
which balance the rights of the individual against the rights of 
these very large corporations that are all, I am sure, obeying 
the law but nonetheless represent a very formidable force in the 
face of ordinary citizens.  I say that collectively, on a 
non-partisan basis, we should be working together to represent 
individual Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia, Transportation; the hon. 
member for Cumberland—Colchester, Lumber Industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate 
the member for Kootenay—Columbia for bringing forward the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many members on both sides of the House, I too am sometimes 
visited by people who have had some difficulties with disability 
plans, whether they be private or the Canada pension plan 
disability program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand his sense of frustration, but I would submit that 
the motion is flawed for two reasons.  One has to do with 
jurisdiction, and he touched on that point, and the other has to 
do with the fact that it would run counter to a number of 
initiatives under way right now at the federal-provincial level. 
I would like to discuss that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would create the position of an ombudsman to oversee 
private disability insurers in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that it is important for consumers of financial services 
providers to have access to an impartial and fair complaints 
resolution mechanism that handles complaints about their dealings 
with financial institutions in a fair and impartial manner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I say, for two reasons I am not able to support this 
motion and I will explain why in more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is it has to do with jurisdictional 
considerations.  The second concerns conflicts with initiatives 
already under way at the federal and provincial levels to enhance 
and harmonize existing complaint handling mechanisms.  In other 
words, the motion could lead to duplication and overlap. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the property and civil rights power in the 
Constitution gives provinces the jurisdiction to regulate the day 
to day business activity of federally and provincially 
incorporated non-bank financial institutions, including life and 
health insurers.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the federal government cannot designate a 
particular dispute resolution system for non-banks.  Provinces 
have the power to require insurers to be members of particular 
dispute resolution mechanisms and specify the design of such 
schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, for example, has established an insurance ombudsman 
office to deal with complaints from Ontario policyholders, 
including Ontario disability claimants.  All insurers in Ontario 
are subject to this regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other provinces, provincial regulators respond to consumer 
complaints about insurance providers either directly or by 
referring consumers to an appropriate industry redress mechanism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, as hon. members know, the marketplace in which 
financial services operate today is characterized by convergence, 
competition and increasingly complex products delivered through 
multiple channels. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this environment, provincial regulators recognize that 
financial services providers should be able to assure their 
customers that complaints and disputes will be handled promptly 
fairly and impartially through a mechanism that provides a 
uniform level of easily accessible service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, a task force on consumer dispute resolution has 
recently been established by the joint forum of provincial 
financial market regulators.  The task force is comprised of 
representatives from several stakeholder groups, including the 
financial services industry and consumer groups, as well as 
officials from the federal Department of Finance.  The task force 
on consumer dispute resolution is investigating the possibility 
of a single ombudsman system for Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that there are potential 
advantages for consumers in having a single point of contact for 
dispute resolution for all financial services complaints.  As a 
result, we are committed to working with the joint forum and 
other task force members towards this end. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the federal government is working 
with the industry to establish a new Canadian financial services 
ombudsman, often referred to as CFSO, as mandated by Bill C-8, 
which is currently under review in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the task force I referred to earlier is still in its early 
stages and its ultimate outcomes are unknown, we believe that it 
is essential to press ahead with the CFSO to ensure that 
consumers will have the benefit of a fair and impartial 
complaints resolution mechanism at the earliest possible date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two points about the Canadian financial services ombudsman are 
particularly relevant to today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the CFSO would operate independently from government and 
the financial services industry, with a board of directors that 
would have a majority of non-financial institution 
representatives.  It would replace the existing Canadian banking 
ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the new ombudsman would reflect the preferences of 
consumer and small business groups for a cross-sectoral ombudsman 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To facilitate the creation of a single ombudsman for customers 
of all financial institutions, the Canadian financial services 
ombudsman would be capable of accepting all financial 
institutions as members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks will be required to join.  Other federally incorporated 
financial institutions will be required to be subject to a third 
party dispute resolution system and, along with provincially 
incorporated institutions, will be eligible to join the CFSO if 
they wish to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian financial services ombudsman would have the power 
to recommend awards to aggrieved customers and while its rulings 
would not be binding, it would also have the authority to 
publicize the names of institutions that did not comply with its 
recommendations.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the Canadian financial services ombudsman would provide 
the Minister of Finance an annual report on the number of 
complaints received and the results achieved in addressing 
consumer and small business complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government hopes to have the Canadian financial services 
ombudsman in place as soon as possible after Bill C-8 comes into 
force.  In addition, the government would explore ways for the 
Canadian financial services ombudsman to interact with 
initiatives that may ultimately be launched from the provincial 
dispute resolution initiative I discussed earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has put forth a worthy proposal.  However in 
light of the other initiatives and jurisdictional conflicts I 
have outlined, the need for an ombudsman to oversee private 
disability insurers has been overtaken by other measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I am unable to support the motion put forward 
by the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure to speak today to the motion that reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, pursuant to Standing Order 68(4)(b), a legislative 
committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill that would 
create the position of ombudsman to oversee private disability 
insurers in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support any initiatives which help Canadians with 
disabilities, including this one.  I hope members of the House do 
not see the creation of an ombudsperson to deal with the 
difficult and sometimes discriminatory practices of private 
insurers as the complete solution to the problems our friends, 
families, neighbours and community members with disabilities face 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate must be broader.  An ombudsman must not only be a 
mediator who helps people fill out forms.  He or she must act on 
behalf of people denied benefits by insurance companies.  An 
ombudsman should also investigate employers who try to keep down 
their benefit costs by getting rid of disabled employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason to believe that insurance companies encourage 
this practice.  The most shocking example is the way the Canadian 
government, through the Treasury Board and its insurer, Sun Life 
Assurance Company of Canada, has dealt with long term disability 
cases.  The most common complaint brought to my attention 
concerns the difficulties disabled government employees face when 
they try to access short term or long term disability insurance 
through work benefit plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize how the system for the hundreds of thousands of 
federal government employees is supposed to work.  Employees who 
develop a disability which prevents them from working must first 
use up their sick days.  They stay on the government payroll at 
full pay for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However many employees who develop an illness have few remaining 
sick days by the time they apply for disability leave.  They then 
go off the government payroll on leave without pay and the 
insurer takes over.  Sick employees must then apply and be 
accepted for EI sick benefits for up to 15 weeks at 55% of their 
pay.  With a maximum income gap in force the tax system could 
reduce their income below the 55% level if they were well paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They then apply to their insurer, Sun Life or National Life, for 
the disability benefit which is 70% of their salary.  For the 
first two years of disability benefit, which is called short 
term, employees must show medical proof that they are unable to 
perform all their job duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two years they are classified as long term and receive 66% 
of their salary as income.  They must then prove to the insurer 
that they are unable to do any work at all.  That is how the 
system is supposed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all enamoured by this model. 
It puts responsibility on the sick to prove their inability to 
work.  It calls for complex forms to be filled out by doctors, a 
process often not covered by medicare.  It causes the largest 
drop in income to take place at the same time the disability 
takes place, which is usually when the costs of having a 
disability are greatest.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bad system by design, but the biggest problem is that it 
does not work as it is supposed to.  I will refer to information 
I received, and which I believe other members of the House 
received, in May 2000 from government employees represented by 
the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sent my party a brief entitled “Victimising Disabled 
Employees in a deal to Save Insurance Companies Money!”.  I have 
the document here if anyone is interested in seeing it.  They 
document the following problems with the current system, which 
they say are caused by treasury board policies, to minimize 
insurance claims to employees with disabilities.  Some of the 
problems are simple.  There is not enough space on the disability 
insurance application forms for medical evidence.  It is a simple 
problem but it causes high numbers of rejections due to 
insufficient medical information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Applicants then wait a very long time before receiving benefits, 
in some cases up to two years.  This is a hideous circumstance if 
we think about it.  If one is sick or disabled or facing the 
trauma of being disabled, the bills are not dropping.  They are 
probably increasing and yet one is forced off the payroll to wait 
up to two years for a claim to be accepted or rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If applicants finally get approved for short term disability 
after two years, they are forced into the catch-22 of the long 
term disability policies of the company and the government before 
they see a nickel from the insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The catch-22 works as follows.  After 24 months the company 
forces the employee to show that no other work can be done which 
would pay up to two-thirds of the former employer's salary. 
Because the burden of proof is on the sick person the benefit is 
generally cut off after 24 months.  The person must go to court 
to appeal.  The company has a policy to not deal with anyone who 
starts legal action against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only part of the problem facing the sick person.  The 
government has taken an even more odious approach.  It terminates 
the person's employment after two years, even though the person 
is on leave without pay, so that it and the insurance company no 
longer need to pay benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the brief I have referred to, after 24 months of 
medical leave without pay letters are sent to sick employees 
giving them four options:  first, return to work; second, take 
medical retirement, which means no union representation or status 
as an employee and being at the mercy of the insurance company, 
which may cut off benefits and force employees to take it to 
court; third, quit with no benefits at all; and fourth, be fired 
for cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is supposed to be a model for society in 
accommodating persons with disabilities.  It instead puts 
pressure on the sick to get out or be fired so that it and its 
insurer can save a buck.  On top of this, according to the union, 
the names of employees on medical leave for 24 months are given 
to the insurance companies.  It is hard to see any reason for 
that unless the companies review the files in order to cut people 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me wonder why we call it insurance.  Insurance against 
what?  Is it insurance against being picked on by an employer, 
the government, because one has a disability?  Is it insurance 
for those who might be discriminated against by the people who 
have a duty to protect them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need solid insurance against such behaviour by the 
government.  This is another example of how the government has 
good public relations regarding persons with disabilities but 
fails when it comes to action.  Now is the time to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should be a model for accommodating 
persons with disabilities.  The federal government should make 
the accommodation of employees with disabilities a condition in 
awarding contracts.  The federal government should work toward 
real income support so that poverty is no longer the biggest 
problem facing Canadians with disabilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member from B.C. for bringing forward this 
important idea for a disability ombudsman.  It is one measure in 
regard to tackling an enormous systemic problem that starts right 
here at the federal government level with the treasury board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to private member's Motion M-244. Since we 
will be finishing early and since everybody here, including me, 
feels very energetic, I will try to make my presentation in 
Canada's other official language, English. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill is to create an ombudsman to oversee 
private disability insurers in Canada.  While the intent is to 
protect those who use this type of insurance, I do not think this 
is necessarily the correct way to go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that some provinces have set up their own 
ombudsmen to deal with these issues.  Ontario, for example, has 
an insurance ombudsman.  That ombudsman's role is to offer 
consumers an informal, last stop forum for resolving complaints 
about the business practices of insurance companies in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this up while debating the member's motion because I 
think it is important that before we create yet another 
government agency we are satisfied it will not play a duplicate 
role in regard to what is already occurring in the industry and 
also, I might add, in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of imposing government on everyone and everything, we 
should allow the private sector to take the lead on these issues 
and have parliamentarians here to ensure that the sector acts in 
a way that is ethical, lawful and in the best interests of 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again want to focus specifically on the member's motion.  As I 
said before, the intent comes from a desire to ensure that 
consumers are protected, and it is a great intent.  The problem 
is that the current industry is full of provincial and federal 
overlap and private and public overlap and the last thing we need 
to do is add to that congestion and overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with a very specific type of insurance and calls 
for an ombudsman with a very limited role in this large industry. 
If we were to create this agency which is very narrow in scope, 
the logical next step would be to create a similar ombudsman for 
each specific type of insurance.  Would we create one 
specifically for car insurance, one for homeowners' insurance and 
so on?  I think my point is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that as we speak provincial and federal 
officials are engaged in discussions over the creation of a 
national organization to deal with consumer complaints.  This 
ombudsman's office would be different from a federal office in 
that it would be created by the provinces and so would deal with 
the jurisdictional issues that often arise when a federal agency 
is imposed on the provinces.  This ombudsman would be one of 
national scope, but would not be limited by the constitutional 
restrictions that arise when the agency is a federal initiative. 
This may surprise members, but it is another example of how we in 
Ottawa do not always need to impose on the private sector or, in 
this case, the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial services sector is evolving and changing rapidly. 
In response to that, the private sector has adapted and will 
continue to do so.  The private sector has the skills, knowledge 
and desire to keep its consumers happy and recognizes the benefit 
of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are also taking a step in conjunction with the 
federal government to address consumer protection in this 
industry.  As a federal government we should allow this to occur, 
not muddy the waters any more and only interject when and as 
needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I noted with interest the comments of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance and I 
understand that there are efforts currently under way to address 
this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I am having on behalf of my constituents is that 
it is grinding.  People are losing their homes. I am sure my 
constituency is no different than that of any other member. 
People in our constituencies are losing their homes after 
entering into contracts in good faith at a financial institution. 
In many instances, they enter into large borrowing contracts on 
their residence.  A mortgage is likely the largest contract in 
which they will ever be involved in their lifetime.  They sign 
the documents at an institution that, by the way, also happens to 
have a majority share or sole ownership of the insurance company 
with which they are also contracting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, upon a cataclysmic event in their lifetime, they no longer 
are able to make mortgage payments because they are truly 
disabled.  We then have one of the twins turning around and 
saying that they did not sign the right paper.  My office does 
not have the ability to help these people.  It is from this sense 
of frustration that I have brought the motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary knows that I have a great deal of 
respect for him as an individual.  This is not at all a partisan 
issue.  I do recognize that there is duplication and overlap, and 
that Ontario has an ombudsman.  I do recognize that there are 
financial services provided for the people in my province of 
British Columbia.  However, when we talk about the marketplace, 
about convergence and about task forces, we are not talking about 
the people who are currently being removed from their homes 
through no fault of their own.  I find that frustrating beyond 
belief.  It is a human tragedy that is happening far too often in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having a lot of difficulty with the comment made by my 
respected friend from the Progressive Conservative Party who said 
that the private sector would take care of it.  Perhaps the 
parliamentary secretary might find it a tad amusing, not 
laughable but amusing, that a member of a party who believes so 
strongly that the government should get out of the faces of 
Canadians would be a minimalist and would be advocating the role 
of an ombudsman.  Well I am and I am doing it without any shame 
because there are people in Canada who are presently not being 
treated fairly or equitably.  It is from that sense of 
frustration that I have brought the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the fact that the committee which selects these 
private members' motions and bills has determined that this will 
not be a votable bill.  I will not go through the charade of 
asking for unanimous consent to make it votable but I do hope the 
government will see the sense of urgency that I have attempted to 
bring to the debate.  It is my hope that the government will 
indeed put some fire and energy behind the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the

<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a result of a question that I 
asked the transport minister a number of weeks ago with respect 
to the Trans-Canada Highway. 
I am concerned primarily about the stretch of road that goes 
through my constituency from Revelstoke to Field.  For the most 
part the highway is not a divided highway. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that this is a national issue, I have an immediate 
local perspective.  Of the 15 million vehicle movements on the 
Trans-Canada Highway in the area of which I am speaking of, there 
were 150 fatalities.  By comparison, on the Coquihalla Highway, 
which was constructed in 1986, 25 million vehicle movements had 
unfortunately 66 fatalities.  One fatality is too many, but the 
point is that 15 million movements have 150 fatalities for a two 
lane road while 25 million movements have only 66 fatalities for 
a divided highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility here because it 
enacted a policy over a period of time that had a direct impact 
on the number of vehicles on the road.  When the highway was 
first built in the sixties there were only 1,500 vehicle 
movements a day.  Today, on an average day, there are up to 
10,000 vehicle movements per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this government, much of the freight that used to be on 
rails is now on trucks.  As a consequence, the number of 
18-wheelers using that road has multiplied tenfold.  This has 
equaled a ramp up in revenue to the government.  The government 
presently takes $700 million a year from the province of British 
Columbia in federal excise tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tells us that it does not believe in designated 
spending but it seems to me that the finance minister believes in 
designated collection.  When he increased the federal excise tax 
by 1.5 cents he said that he needed to collect more money to help 
do away with the deficit.  There is a little bit of a dichotomy 
here where he says on one hand that he does not believe in 
designated spending but that he does believe in designated 
collection.  I wonder about the sincerity of that statement 
because now that the deficit has gone why has the extra 1.5 cents 
per litre not gone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the excise tax is simply a cash cow that is collected 
from the trucking companies, automobile companies and, 
ironically, also from the rail companies for the freight going 
back and forth through the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to do a reality check on what we are looking at in 
my constituency.  In the Kicking Horse Canyon, which is just east 
of the town of Golden, it would cost $5 million to straighten out 
a 200 metre stretch of road.  One million rock bolts would need 
to be put into Heather Hill, which is west of Golden, because 
there is an unstable mountain.  There is already an ongoing slide 
occurring on that mountain.  In spite of the fact that the slides 
have already started to come down this year, there is still no 
medium or long term plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a federal responsibility here that was recognized back 
in the 1960s when the Trans-Canada Highway was initially 
constructed.  The average cost of constructing the highway across 
Canada in 1960 was $100,000.  The cost was $1 million through 
British Columbia, ten times as much money.  As a consequence, the 
funding arrangements were taken into account at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Revelstoke, the people of my constituency and the 
people of Canada are demanding that the federal government come 
to talk about this issue with a big fat wallet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate 
in the late show.  I appreciate the comments made by the member 
for Kootenay—Columbia.  While his B.C. riding is a long way from 
my own northern Ontario riding, it is not unlike mine in a lot of 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably have the longest stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway 
of any riding in the country, which would be about eight or nine 
hours driving at 100 kilometres an hour, so I appreciate the 
importance of the Trans-Canada Highway.  Some of the rocky 
terrain north of the Soo up toward Wawa would be reminiscent of 
some of the smaller hills in his riding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that highways are the responsibility of 
provincial and territorial governments.  Nevertheless the federal 
government is concerned with the condition of Canada's highways. 
That is why Transport Canada has provided funding for provincial 
highways over the years through a series of cost shared 
contribution agreements.  For example, the strategic highway 
improvement program, in effect from 1993-94 to 1999-2000, 
provided $30 million for highway projects in British Columbia 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to clarify the funding allocated for 
highway infrastructure.  Of the $2.65 billion announced in budget 
2000, over $2 billion was earmarked for municipal infrastructure 
and $600 million for strategic highway infrastructure. Agreements 
for the municipal component called Infrastructure Canada have 
been signed with all the provinces and funds would be available 
over a six year period starting from last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the primary focus of Infrastructure Canada is on 
so-called green infrastructure, funds would also be available for 
local transportation needs.  Funding for the highway component 
would be available beginning in fiscal year 2001-02. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada initiated negotiations last month with its 
provincial and territorial counterparts to identify those 
segments of the national highway system where a need for highway 
infrastructure improvement is the greatest.  Given their 
jurisdiction over highways it is within the purview of the 
provinces and territories to propose highway projects for 
funding.  I hope the member would encourage the government in 
B.C. to priorize the stretch of highway through his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is well aware that B.C. has made a priority 
improvements to the Trans-Canada Highway and I am sure he would 
make that case with the province.  Every attempt will be made to 
expedite the establishment of a list of eligible projects and the 
signing of the federal-provincial cost sharing agreement.  The 
first negotiation session on the establishment of a list was on 
May 3, 2001.
