</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-211.  I would 
like to compliment my colleague, the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford, for putting this bill together in 
conjunction with the police.  This member also, in the last 
Parliament, put together a victims bill of rights which 
unfortunately was held up in this House even though the police, 
victims and Canadian society desperately wanted the bill to go 
forward in an effort to protect innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Bill C-211, which is supported by the police and the 
public, will not languish in committee and in the House.  I hope 
members from across party lines will see this as a bill for the 
general public.  It will make our streets safer for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be wise for us to look at the contents of Bill C-211. 
The bill establishes that a police officer may arrest without 
warrant, detain and bring before a justice a person the officer 
reasonably believes is in breach of a condition of bail, a 
probation order, a conditional sentence or a statutory release, 
parole or unescorted temporary absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill states is that if a person who has been convicted 
of an offence and is out on bail, is being released with 
conditions or is on parole and is a threat to society, he or she 
can be arrested without a warrant.  For example, if a pedophile 
is released on condition and is out wandering around a park with 
children, the current situation, believe it or not, is that a 
police officer has to get a warrant in order to apprehend that 
person who may be wandering around and threatening those 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the system does not allow police officers to apprehend 
a person who may be in violation of his or her parole or release 
conditions.  We have created a system that forces police officers 
to go to a judge to get a warrant.  By that time the individual, 
for example the pedophile, would have left.  This is another 
example of the system hamstringing the ability of police officers 
to do their job of protecting innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 gets to the heart of the matter.  It enables police 
officers to carry out their duty to serve and protect innocent 
people.  It is a common sense bill.  It is a bill that should 
never have come to this House because one would have thought this 
government would have put it forth.  But it did not.  That is why 
the member for Langley—Abbotsford has put forth this bill. 
It is a necessary bill which I ask the government to support 
without condition.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that this bill was supported by 
the police.  The police worked very closely with the member to 
put this bill forward.  The police now have no authority to 
arrest an offender for breach of parole.  That is why a policeman 
has to look at a situation and ask whether he has to arrest a 
person or not.  If he does, he then has to run to a judge to do 
something about it.  By that time it is too late.  A pedophile in 
breach of parole running around a park perhaps might commit an 
act too heinous for us to comprehend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various conditions may be placed on a person on probation. 
Section 495 of the conditional release act permits the arrest of 
a person without warrant when a peace officer finds the person in 
breach of any of the conditions of probation.  However, an 
offender who is convicted and sentenced to a term of 
incarceration in a penitentiary may subsequently be released into 
the community with conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those conditions can be violated but as it stands right now, if 
a police officer sees the person violating those conditions he 
has to get a warrant from a judge for the person's arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 will enable police officers to carry out their 
duties, use their judgment and discretion and arrest people who 
have already been convicted of similar offences or of offences 
related to those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice critic has been speaking for a long time about 
issues related to revamping the Young Offenders Act.  He has 
continually asked the justice minister to do something about the 
Young Offenders Act.  He has asked her to modify it, to add an 
element of fairness that would ensure that the Young Offenders 
Act gives the courts and the police the ability to protect 
innocent civilians. It is important to realize that the bulk of 
innocent civilians who are victims of youth crime are youth 
themselves. In many ways the Young Offenders Act does not do 
justice to our ideal of protecting innocent people.  As such it 
should be revamped.  My colleague has continually asked the 
Minister of Justice what her plan is, yet we have come up against 
a brick wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward a private member's motion which has had an hour of 
debate.  It seeks to address the prevention of crime.  If we are 
to prevent crime we have to look at the origins of crime.  There 
is much talk about this now because of the recent situation in 
Arkansas where an 11-year old and a 13-year old boy slaughtered a 
group of students in their school.  There is a terrible situation 
of youth crime in our community, in particular violent youth 
crime.  It has been on the rise for some time but it has 
flattened out over this past year.  Nonetheless it is a situation 
that the public finds distasteful, in particular the Canadian 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with this?  There is a two pronged approach.  My 
colleagues have spoken very eloquently about how to deal with 
those who are committing the offences but we must also deal with 
prevention.  Prevention does not deal with addressing a 13-year 
old or a 14-year old who has already been incarcerated. 
Prevention deals with time zero when a person is pregnant.  In 
that way we can deal with issues like substance abuse and the 
epidemic of fetal alcohol syndrome which contributes to the 
criminal element in our society.  We can deal with child abuse. 
We can deal with improper parenting skills.  The Reform Party has 
given the government many ways to strengthen the family that 
would ensure parents have the ability to take care of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion deals with that and it is in sync with that. My motion 
enables us to identify families at risk, to identify situations 
in which parents may not have learned to be good parents 
themselves.  We can thereby introduce programs that would teach 
them what proper discipline is, what substance abuse does to them 
and their children.  They can be taught about proper parenting 
skills and proper nutrition.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things are critically important if children are to be 
able to have their basic needs met from time zero so they can 
build the pillars of a normal psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many children who are in jail have their psyches damages quite 
significantly as a result of situations that have taken place. 
While that does not exonerate them from the acts that they commit 
later, it does make us understand that if we are to prevent crime 
we have to address the origins which start in many cases at time 
zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of model plans in place.  For example, the 
Perry preschool program in Michigan showed that there was a $6 
savings for every $1 invested.  It decreased the amount of youth 
crime by 50% and the amount of teen pregnancies by 60%.  Children 
stayed in school longer.  It is an example of a program that has 
been in existence for 35 years which has been analysed 
scientifically and shows what works to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Moncton was a leader in developing the Moncton 
head start program which has been very effective in decreasing 
youth crime.  What is conditional is that parents are involved in 
the situation.  If only the children are involved it does not 
work.  The parents have to be involved too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Bill C-211 by my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford 
is a bill that the House should support.  It is another example 
of a bill put forth by the member in the interest of public 
safety.  It will protect innocent civilians.  It will enable the 
police to do their job.  It is absolutely imperative the 
government listen to the bill, support the bill and push the bill 
forward for the safety of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased for the opportunity to join in the discussion on Private 
Member's Bill C-211 respecting corrections, condition of release 
and police powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I interpret the focus of these proposals as being on the 
addition of safeguards to the conditional release program for 
offenders.  The bill does not raise the question of when release 
should occur or if release should ever be granted to some types 
of offenders but simply addresses the method by which such 
releases may be terminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Bill C-211 proposes additional police powers, it follows 
it would apply further restrictions to offenders in the 
community.  Would these measures enhance public protection, 
prevent crime or even save lives?  Would there be measurable 
improvement in the supervision and control of offenders?   In 
answer to these questions I would like to devote my allocated 
time today to sharing with the House and with all Canadians some 
thoughts about public safety, the criminal justice system and 
conditional release as it now exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should think that the decision to release an offender to 
the community is made lightly.  The decision making process is 
careful and extensive.  It is quite obvious that any release 
conditions are framed by court imposed sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last dozen years parliament has pursued a series of 
measures that have increased penalties and restricted releases. 
On the sentencing end of things it is sufficient to say that 
there has been considerable movement toward the punitive end of 
the scale.  This being said, it may be helpful for members to 
know something about the conditional release process and the 
roles and responsibilities of the correctional agencies of the 
Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Correctional Services 
Board of Canada and the National Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these agencies this ministry, as part of our criminal 
justice system, deals with two fundamental issues which lie at 
the very heart of what defines the quality and the nature of the 
culture of the country.  The first of these is public safety, an 
issue of paramount importance.  Passage by parliament of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act in 1992 enshrined in law 
the principle that the protection of society should be foremost 
in the minds of those entrusted with the administration of court 
imposed sentences in the federal corrections system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is human freedom in all its dimensions:  the 
deprivation of freedom, the respect for freedom and the quality 
and dignity of freedom.  This is an important consideration given 
that the most extreme sanction the state is able to impose on its 
citizens is carried out by the Ministry of the Solicitor General. 
The Ministry of the Solicitor General, through the National 
Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada, is responsible for 
ensuring the safety of the public.  Its employees, both in 
federal institutions and the community, deal with more than 
20,000 offenders under its charge each day of the year. 
It must carry out this responsibility in a society which places 
an enormous importance on the rights and freedoms of all its 
citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How the correctional service and parole board go about their 
business is a matter of concern not to only a small minority but 
to all Canadians.  They are equally concerned about powers 
granted to police forces and, I would guess, would have questions 
about how much power is necessary to provide protection without 
approaching the possibility for oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have to keep in mind today the fact that over 99% 
of temporary absences are successful and that roughly nine out of 
ten offenders in the community on full parole and on statutory 
release complete their sentences without reoffending.  That being 
said, I also believe that the bill has good intentions and that 
the ideas for enhancing the protection of the public are good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that earlier in the debate in the House the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough talked about the effects on 
rural Canada.   He talked about the fact that he supported the 
change with some reservation and was concerned about the 
arbitrariness of it.  He talked about what happens in small 
communities in rural parts of the country.  That is where I come 
from as well today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately how the bill protects the public may be flawed. It 
could be subject to a serious challenge in a court of law under 
the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concerns me because I know and I understand the effects in 
rural Canada.  I recognize that often there are one or two police 
officers on duty and that although the parole board does its best 
to ensure that warrants are issued as quickly as possible, it is 
not always possible for police officers to go back or to have 
someone at the station let them know that it indeed has been 
faxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues that need to be dealt with, but I believe the 
member who put forward the bill today is aware that there is a 
possibility of a charter challenge.  That is my concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that laws we put forward are good laws and 
that laws that go forward meet all purposes.  This law in my own 
opinion has a purpose that is necessary.  However it needs to be 
narrower in scope.  It needs to ensure that there is not a 
charter challenge.  It needs to ensure that we go forward so that 
Canadians know they have that possibility.  One of the ways we 
can choose to narrow the scope of the bill, even in the words of 
the researcher for the hon. member, is to limit its application 
to certain offenders or specific behaviours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the research that was done, limiting the offence 
of breaching parole or release conditions for offenders serving 
time for a scheduled offence should target the more dangerous 
offenders.  Alternatively, the bill could limit the definition of 
offences to breaches involving particularly high risk behaviours 
such as possession of weapons or illegal drugs.  Either step 
could go a long way to adjusting the charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned for public safety.  I am very concerned for 
the citizens in my community.  I have had many discussions with 
Ian Russell, who is now the chief of police in one of my 
communities, the town of LaSalle, one of the gentleman of whom 
members of the Reform Party speak often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discussed that there are issues which need to be dealt 
with as we go forward and as we propose law.  I go back to the 
earlier comments about this of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  There may need to be some 
changes in the wording.  Early in the debate he embraced the bill 
even though he thought there should be some changes.  I also 
embrace the concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about rural communities, about small communities, 
but as we move forward together we have to ensure that all 
Canadians are entitled to be not only protected but to the rights 
under the charter.  We have to ensure that our laws will not be 
subject to charter challenges as soon as they become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, again I talk about the fact that the principle 
in the bill is not new.  It has been introduced in the House four 
times since 1993.  It came out of the standing committee on 
justice that it be amended to allow police arrest without 
warrant.  That recommendation in my opinion was to respond to the 
deficiencies in the law that could slow police response times. 
These are things that we still have to do and we still have to 
meet on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The will of the people, police officers and many members of the 
House is there, but there must be a law that works and does not 
breach any other laws in the process. That is why I cannot 
support the bill at this stage.  I believe it is flawed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I say as a member of Parliament 
that we have to find a way to give police powers which will allow 
them to do their job without violating the charter.  I believe it 
is what we were elected to do.  The concept is right and in my 
opinion the end is right.  However, in this case I do not believe 
that the bill can achieve this end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is always interesting and entertaining to listen to the 
Liberal backbenchers explain to Canadians on behalf of 
bureaucrats and deputy ministers of the government why a good 
idea cannot go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the constituents of Okanagan—Coquihalla to 
speak to Bill C-211, an act to amend the Criminal Code as it 
applies to the arresting and detaining of individuals who breach 
their condition of parole or statutory or temporary release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say I do this because my constituents have asked 
me to do it.  Indeed Canadians from coast to coast to coast have 
witnessed problems with the parole system in their areas.  This 
is a serious problem and the Government of Canada insists on 
saying that the status quo is fine and everything is okay.  I am 
here to say that it is not fine.  It is not okay.  Things have to 
be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member from Langley—Abbotsford for 
introducing to the House this very important piece of 
legislation.  The bill does what the parole system fails to do. 
It takes steps to ensure the safety and security of all 
Canadians.  I would like to ask government members and people 
watching today who the parole system is for.  We will hear the 
government argue today that it is for people who commit crimes, 
people who have violated our codes and our laws.  I will put 
forward a different argument today.  I will put forward the view 
of grassroots average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of Parliament it is our duty to provide citizens with 
a safe environment for them to raise a family, to feel secure 
when their children are playing at a local playground, to have 
them go to school, to walk the dog at night, to go to a grocery 
store or to visit a shopping mall.  This is what Canadians want 
from the government.  This is the reason behind such legislation 
as the Criminal Code, Corrections and Conditional Release Act and 
government agencies like Correctional Service Canada and the 
National Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 will do two things.  First, it will amend the 
Criminal Code by making a breach of condition of parole or 
statutory or temporary release an indictable offence.  This means 
that the police will have the ability to arrest without warrant a 
parolee who the police believe on reasonable grounds—that is 
very important—to be in breach or about to breach conditions of 
parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill will amend the Criminal Code by giving the 
parole board the power, following the arrest of an offender, to 
release him or to ask a judge to keep him in custody until a 
warrant is issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost weekly Canadians are subjected to news concerning 
parolees who commit unspeakable acts of violence.  In my home 
town of Summerland, British Columbia, just this past year there 
was a tragic murder of a mother and a grandmother which sent 
shockwaves through a community that had not had a murder in over 
a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kevin Machell, on September 5 of last year, was on day parole 
and failed to report to his Calgary halfway house.  Authorities 
of Correctional Service Canada did not issue a warrant until some 
24 hours after his failure to report.  The normal policy of 
Correctional Service Canada on such tardiness with respect to 
halfway houses is that action be taken within 10 minutes to one 
hour.  No one will deny, even Correctional Service Canada, that 
was not done.  Why?  We do not know.  The system is broken and 
has to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inaction by officials of Correctional Service Canada gave 
Machell the time he needed to drive to Summerland, British 
Columbia, and allegedly murder his estranged wife and her mother 
in front of their two preschool children aged 2 and 4, witnesses 
to this heinous crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The event is made even worse by the fact that the victim had 
obtained a restraining order against Machell and had written the 
National Parole Board asking to be told of a change in status for 
Kevin William Machell.  The victim was not notified and remained 
unaware of Machell's escape until it was too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events leading up to this horrific event call into question 
the entire parole system, Correctional Service Canada and its 
policy toward parolee violations and the failure of the National 
Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada to inform the victim 
of Machell's escape.  Correctional Service Canada failed the 
victim in this case and it has failed Canadians time and time 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Machell had in the past made threats on the victim's life. 
These threats of violence had been taken seriously enough by the 
B.C. supreme court that it issued a restraining order against 
Machell, yet Correctional Service Canada made no attempt to 
inform the potential victims, who turned out to be the murder 
victims, of Machell's disappearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this potentially violent criminal given the opportunity 
to even be out on parole?  This heinous crime could have been 
prevented in so many ways.  The lines of communication were 
obviously blurred or flawed between Alberta and British Columbia 
and of course the third link, Correctional Service Canada.  The 
victim should have been notified and she was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Machell was on the loose for 24 hours before a warrant was 
issued for his arrest.  Under the current law, even if Machell 
would have been stopped in Alberta, maybe on just a routine check 
by police officers, the police could not have detained him.  What 
kind of parole system do we have when even if he was an absentee, 
he was tardy from his half-way house, and stopped in the province 
of Alberta on the highway, they could not have detained him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 would change that.  It should be changed.  There is 
no reason for this not to go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals defend the justice system time and time again.  They 
pretend it is working just fine the way it is.  They want the 
status quo.  They say it is their priority to protect citizens, 
yet they are ignoring Canadians who want tougher justice laws and 
rules and they are ignoring the facts.  They ignore the fact that 
30% of federal inmates reoffend with a significant proportion of 
those offences being violent.  They ignore the fact that 
convicted criminals seldom serve the prison time they are given. 
According to the National Parole Board even the most violent 
offenders serve on average only about half their time.  They 
ignore the fact that in the past 35 years violent crime has 
increased 350%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are sick and tired of the government's lack of action 
toward criminals and toward crime.  They want a justice system 
that puts their rights ahead of the criminals.  They want a 
system that will ensure parole is limited, earned and tightly 
monitored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September I introduced a motion in the House that instructs 
the government to adopt a zero tolerance policy concerning 
parolees' unexplained tardiness in reporting to their half-way 
houses.  This motion will instruct Correctional Service Canada to 
automatically issue a Canada-wide warrant for parolees who are 
more than 10 minutes late to their half-way houses and will make 
it a priority of the correctional service to immediately notify 
those who are in danger due to a parolee's absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of this intervention I asked the House, and I asked 
Canadians, who is the parole system for?  The government and the 
bureaucrats would stand to defend it and say it is for the likes 
of Kevin Machell who violated his parole.  The answer that my 
constituents and all Canadians are telling the government today 
is that is not the case, that the parole system should put the 
victims of crime first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cecilia and Tammy Grono were murdered.  Two pre-school children 
now do not have a mother or a grandmother.  The system should be 
for law-abiding citizens of this country, not for those people 
who have violated the laws of this country and have shown that 
they have disdain for the laws and good order.  This bill will 
accomplish that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a good piece of legislation that should go forward 
today and I urge all members of the House to support my friend 
and colleague from Langley—Abbotsford in passing Bill C-211. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Before recognizing 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, it is my duty to tell 
the House that his will be the last intervention on this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, since this is the last intervention I think it is only 
fair that I summarize what I have seen and heard in this House 
about Bill C-211. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not me as an individual member of Parliament who decided 
to sit down one day to write a bill and develop a piece of 
legislation for this House which would prevent individuals on 
parole from preying on our communities by way of giving the 
police the empowerment to arrest them, it was the police 
themselves who approached me, gave me this idea and said there 
was something sadly lacking in the Criminal Code of Canada.  They 
asked if we could fix it.  I said “Yes, we will do that for you. 
We will take this to the House.  It all seems fairly 
reasonable”.  Then we hit the usual brick wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hit the brick wall of mediocrity.  We hit the brick wall of 
liberalism.  We hit the brick wall of a lack of intelligence with 
members on the other side saying “We think you have a good idea 
here.  Maybe we should pursue it, but, gee whiz, there could be a 
charter challenge.  We must never challenge the charter”.  That 
is the Liberal mentality that we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in this country the prisoners have the right to vote. Why? 
Because a judge in his wisdom, I think it was Howard Wetston in 
Manitoba, said that under the charter of rights and freedoms 
prisoners should have the right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came back to this House what did the government say? 
Yes, the charter of rights and freedoms should apply to them. 
After all, we do not want to challenge that.  So today prisoners 
have the right to vote.  I disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have criminals today distributing obscene material on young 
people.  A judge in this country not too long ago said “It is 
their unfettered right to distribute it because the charter of 
rights and freedoms gives them that right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have government members on the other side, sitting back 
like they are today, saying “That must be acceptable because 
some judge made that decision under the charter of rights and 
freedoms”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of society are we going to end up with in this country 
when the government says, according to some judge, that if it is 
in the charter of rights and freedoms then it is free for all to 
do whatever they want?  In fact, the legislators of this country 
are the ones who make the decisions.  It is not the judges and 
the lawyers who are out there for personal gain, it is the 
legislators.  Unfortunately this government's feeling is that 
legislators are merely to take the decisions of the court system 
and apply them.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 was developed to protect the public, to protect young 
people so that when a pedophile is out on parole sitting in a 
playground and police recognize the individual, they can whip him 
up like that, and scoot him back off into prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from the other side arguments like “We don't want to 
give the police extra authority.  We don't want to give the 
police the ability to arrest somebody without getting a warrant, 
do we?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe where this government comes from at times.  I 
am ashamed at times to listen to the debate from the other side.

good politicians at all.  Politicians who leave the court system 
to make their decisions for them are worse than poor politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not why this party is in the House of Commons.  This 
party came here, largely, on several very important agendas.  The 
criminal justice system was one of them.  It is now a legal 
industry in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we repeat ourselves.  What is more important 
in this country, criminal rights or the rights of victims?  What 
is more important, the rights of criminals or the safety and 
security of the people in this country?  That is what these kinds 
of issues are about.  A member opposite is shaking his head.  He 
thinks this is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of a situation which happened recently in British 
Columbia concerning Howie Slaunwhite.  He is an individual I have 
spoken with a number of times.   He said a fellow came into his 
life who sexually molested his daughter.  Howie took a bat to 
him, which I think was a darn good idea and I am not ashamed to 
say so.  The criminal went to prison.  He hired a lawyer, for a 
fee of course, and they got a conviction.  Howie broke the law. 
The judge charged him $42,000 which he cannot afford to pay.  He 
has to pay another $15,000 on top of that in legal fees.  I do 
not think the government sees the consequences of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day I hear people say that if someone gets into their 
house and molests their wife or daughter they will take the law 
into their own hands because the law is not doing a good enough 
job.  Perhaps that is wrong.  Perhaps they should wait for the 
police or wait to see if the lawyers or judges can do a better 
job.  Howie, as a father, said no to this.  He thought the 
intruder deserved a few whacks and he gave them to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is that this person was guilty of breaking the 
law.  But why does a judge turn around and bilk a person who 
cannot afford $42,000?  Why is the charter of rights and freedoms 
all for fairness to the individual criminal?  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that Bill C-211 is going to be defeated because the 
majority government has spoken against it.  I know there is not 
much individuality on the other side.  They were told to vote 
against it.  They are afraid of a charter challenge.  The police 
and victims say they want it, but that is not good enough.  There 
has to be another kind of profound influence.  The charter of 
rights and freedoms may challenge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel sad that a country like this, which once had a great 
criminal justice system, now has a legal industry.  I feel sad 
for the victims of crime who watch every day as prisoners get 
overtime pay, the right to vote, the right to sue— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Free medical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  —free medical, dental and television. 
The list goes on.  The prisoners are provided free bleach to 
sterilize their needles so they do not get HIV when they inject 
cocaine.  Free condoms are supplied, even though having sex with 
each other in prison is a violation of the commissioner's 
directives.  All of this indicates that we have a justice system 
in decay.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 19 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-25, an act to to amend the National Defence Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am quite pleased to rise today to debate Bill C-25, an act to 
amend the National Defence Act.  I can only say I am pleased to 
contribute to this debate in the sense that it has been 50 years 
since this act first made it through Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we get down to some of the very basic needs 
in our military.  It has been kicked around for so many years for 
the most part by Liberal governments.  I find it unsettling that 
the Liberal government of today wants to look at itself as being 
the saviour of the military when in fact it has been the 
opposite; it has been the destroyer of the military. We in this 
country are paying the price now for what was done some 20 years 
ago under another Liberal regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is supposed to be a response by this government to the 
Dickson report and the Somalia inquiry report.  As far as I am 
concerned it does not adequately respond to all of the needs of 
the military.  This was the government's chance.  The government 
had a chance to amend the act with this bill.  Unfortunately, it 
made a mockery of much of the commission's final report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the National Defence Act at this time represents a rare 
opportunity to address many of the concerns which have been 
voiced regarding the military justice system and the manner in 
which the Canadian forces interacts with and responds to its 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a real eye opener to travel this country, to speak 
with military personnel at the various base locations and to hear 
what they think of the government, the treatment of the forces 
and how it has impacted the communities in which they live.  For 
the most part it is a shame.   What has happened to the military 
community at the hands of the government is it is a disgusting 
mess.  We have not been their protector, even though they lose 
many rights by joining the military forces. They have had an 
extremely difficult struggle during these past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events in Somalia opened up a Pandora's box of issues which 
set the stage for a great deal of investigation, criticism and 
self-examination.  The excessive budget cuts the government has 
delivered to the defence department have dealt a serious blow to 
the forces' operational capabilities, their procurement plans and 
among other things, their morale.  Particularly serious is the 
diminishing state of the living standards of the lower ranks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many had hoped that the government would seize this opportunity 
to put in place the reforms which have been proposed by those who 
have closely examined the state of the Canadian Armed Forces, not 
the least of which was the Somalia commission of inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-25 is a step in the right direction, it 
unfortunately does not go nearly far enough.  C-25 is full of 
half measures which on the surface appear to address many of the 
concerns which have been raised.  However, underneath the surface 
the measures are clearly not going to get to the heart of the 
troubles within DND. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into a more specific examination of the bill, I 
think it would be appropriate for me to remind the House of some 
of my party's wish-list for reforms to the defence department, 
particularly with respect to military justice matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition would like to see three qualities built 
into the National Defence Act.  In particular, we would like to 
see the military justice system reflect the following qualities. 
We feel very strongly that unless these qualities are included, 
there can be no substantive reform.  The first quality is 
accountability, the second is openness and the third is 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the military justice system. The government 
refuses to address any of these qualities in any serious way.  I 
think we can all agree that the military justice system is in 
serious need of repair.  That is presumably why the government 
commissioned both the Dickson report and the Somalia commission. 
I would suggest that is at least what most people were led to 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it became clear that the government was going to come under 
fire for some of its friends' handling of the events in Somalia, 
the Liberals shut down the inquiry.  This unprecedented move 
placed a permanent blight on the history of apparently 
independent government sponsored inquiries in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks about the ramifications of that closure, this 
should never happen on an independent inquiry which was 
commissioned to search out the truth.  This government is a 
leader, if one wants to call it that, in actually shutting down 
an inquiry for the first time in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the government's best efforts, the Somalia inquiry 
commissioners did produce a comprehensive report. Among other 
things the report provided an extensive recommendation on how the 
military justice system could best be reformed to provide 
openness, accountability and independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of course made every effort to ignore the 
commissioners' report. The government downplayed it, mocked it 
and the defence minister denounced it. Now we see in Bill C-25 
that the government has rejected it. In fact, Bill C-25 is 
largely the government's attempt to pay lip service to the 
commissioners' recommendations while escaping its obligation to 
provide the kind of comprehensive, meaningful change that would 
be required to properly bring justice to the defence department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of Bill C-25 is smoke and mirrors.  Of the hundreds of 
recommendations the Somalia inquiry report made, three of them 
were most important.  Each remains unfulfilled in the amendments 
proposed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation that remains unfulfilled is that the 
military police be taken out of the chain of command and be given 
greater independence and that they should report to the solicitor 
general in matters relating to the investigations of major 
disciplinary offences and criminal misconduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation is in regard to the judge advocate 
general.  The Somalia inquiry recommended the creation of the 
office of the chief military judge as well as the separation of 
the judge advocate general's office into the defence and 
prosecutorial roles.  Again this was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation that is unfulfilled is the creation of 
the office of inspector general which would among other things 
create more accountability in the Canadian forces.  In other 
words, when a complaint would be filed it would be acted upon 
independently and not subject to the whims of the commander or 
someone else in DND. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The above three recommendations are entirely consistent with 
what my party has been saying in this House since 1993.  Surely a 
primary goal of any justice system should be the creation of a 
system whereby all participants are treated fairly, equally, 
openly, and where all participants are held accountable for their 
actions.  Such a system would also be able to act independently 
and impartially.  As evidence has shown, that is not the case 
with the military justice system.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What changes have been made are superficial at best.  We will 
see how much accountability will be registered in those 
superficial changes.  In the absence of those qualities being 
fulfilled, there can be no justice. Bill C-25 fails these tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness, the bill takes several steps in the right 
direction.  Bill C-25 clarifies the roles and responsibilities of 
the various players in the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the base commander calling in the military police for 
an investigation, the provost marshal will have direct influence 
in handling that investigation.  That may prove beneficial in 
some cases but the provost marshal is still in the chain of 
command, still subject to influence from the top.  That is a 
concern to us and it should be a concern for the military.  If it 
is looking for independence and fairness in the system, it should 
take that out of the chain of command and give it to an inspector 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 separates on an institutional basis the military 
justice system's investigative, prosecutorial and judicial 
functions.  That is certainly warranted.  It tends to go in the 
right direction as far as having a little independence but there 
is still not enough.  It still falls within the chain of command, 
is still subject to influence, even political influence nowadays. 
It seems to be very much directed in that fashion and we object 
to that.  We want to see greater independence. It can be achieved 
if it is taken right out of the chain of command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Complete summary trial reform is the third point.  The fourth is 
to establish two oversight bodies that are apparently external to 
the defence department and the Canadian forces, namely a Canadian 
forces grievance board and a military police complaints 
commission.  How much teeth they will have remains to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires those two new bodies and the judge advocate 
general to file annual reports with the minister who in turn 
would have to table them in Parliament.  There is a little more 
openness and a little more accountability.  If the reports are 
scrutinized and they are not sanitized before they reach this 
House, then fine.  At least we can look at what is going on in 
that fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires the chief of the defence staff, the new 
provost marshal and the ombudsman to file annual reports.  It 
requires the Minister of National Defence to report to Parliament 
after five years with a review of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments have been subject to scrutiny.  A group of 
individuals will oversee the implementation of the amendments. It 
is unfortunate that this group will be subject to two years of 
scrutiny to ensure the amendments are introduced in an adequate 
fashion and then it will be disbanded.  There will be no 
oversight agency.  Most of the implementation of the amendments 
will be over a five-year period. The board will be disbanded 
after two years and to what end?  What is the value of the board 
in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these amendments are good ideas.  It is about time the 
roles and responsibilities of the players within the military 
justice system were established.  It is hard to imagine that the 
system has functioned for as long as it has without such 
definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time the judge advocate general's responsibilities 
were further defined and divided.  This is one of the major areas 
of concern for the Somalia commissioners, although they 
recommended total reform of the JAG's office.  We argue that it 
would be much more advisable to formally separate these functions 
into separate offices and to do away with the judge advocate 
general's office in its present form altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only makes sense to have the investigative, prosecutorial, 
defence and judicial functions separate.  The creation of the 
Canadian forces grievance board and the military police 
complaints commission are two of the most often noted amendments 
in this act. 
Both cause me some concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these new organizations will exist within the chain of 
command and therefore will remain vulnerable to influence from 
within the department.  This will be of little comfort to many 
members of the Canadian forces who have had to deal with the 
military justice system in the past or who will come in contact 
with it in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the ombudsman is frankly a joke and a poor one 
at that.  This is a half hearted attempt at satisfying the 
Somalia commission's call for an inspector general.  The 
ombudsman will be a paper tiger.  It will have no teeth and will 
likely provide more frustration than good.  Many provinces have 
ombudsman offices and we can see how much influence they really 
have in resolving the concerns that are delivered, little or 
none.  They certainly do not have any influence or power to 
change anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is the Canadian forces need an inspector 
general.  The most obvious omission in Bill C-25 is the absence 
of the creation of that office.  America, Germany and Britain 
have inspectors general.  The Reform Party has called for one. 
The Somalia commissioners have called for one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone outside this government for the most part thinks Canada 
should have an inspector general.  Why is it that Canada has 
independent investigators in the civilian justice system but does 
not allow the same to apply in the military justice system? What 
is it that this government is so afraid of happening if an 
individual outside the chain of command and independent of rank 
structure were able to investigate allegations of wrongdoing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can relate to one that should have been thoroughly 
investigated. This situation impacted on the security of this 
country.  I am talking about the problem of personnel at CFB 
Leitrim using drugs. Leitrim is probably the highest security 
area we have in the military involving the collection of data 
pertinent to the security of this country. Yet at CFB Leitrim 
there were individuals using drugs.  Where do drugs come from? 
Ultimately from organized crime.  They were associating with such 
suppliers. Some individuals even had questionable personnel 
backgrounds yet they were sitting in a seat of high security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is acceptable.  It should not be acceptable 
in this country.  The information the military often involves 
itself in deals with what?  Organized crime.  Who deals with 
drugs?  Organized crime.  Information on terrorism, terrorists 
and aid to civil power comes through CFB Leitrim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find it acceptable that a commander can have control 
but cannot investigate in an adequate sense a situation that 
involves the security of this country.  This is exactly what has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these investigations definitely have to be outside the 
realm of DND. If a complaint is laid it should be handled in a 
very professional and appropriate manner, always with the 
security intent in mind and always with the intent to convict the 
wrongdoer, not to warn him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry commissioners went into great detail regarding 
the need for an inspector general.  Yet this government chooses 
to ignore the recommendation.  It seems to be more intent, 
happier I guess, to appoint committees and ombudsmans and boards 
but is really not willing to have a definite line drawn to create 
a genuine independent structure or infrastructure that would name 
names and hold individuals accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the matter of the Somalia inquiry might not have 
happened if there had been an inspector general willing to pick 
up the investigation and make sure it was carried through and 
handled properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the independence we are looking for.  Ultimately it 
frightens the Liberals. They do not want independence.  They do 
not want an investigation to be conducted in a thorough manner 
even if it means selecting those at the top who were not 
accountable, who were responsible, and removing them or having 
them disciplined in some fashion.  That should be happening. 
Unfortunately that inquiry was cut short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there should be a culture of secrecy, cover-up, 
intimidation to exist unchecked.  It was evident some of that 
took place during the whole Somalia affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is an opportunity for this government to correct the 
wrong.  It refuses to do it.  As a result we in the Reform Party 
will not be supporting the bill without substantial amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my question relates to the amendments to the National Defence Act 
which would remove the death penalty from the act.  As I am sure 
the hon. member knows in terms of the history of this penalty, 
about 25 Canadian soldiers were executed during the first world 
war and I think there was only one during the second world war 
for crimes ranging from showing cowardice in the face of the 
enemy to murdering a superior officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian situation actually is juxtaposed against the 
Australians who are also a Commonwealth force. No member of their 
forces was executed during the first world war and I think the 
same applied to the second world war. As we have seen, more and 
more since the beginning of the 1990s Canadians are being placed 
in combat situations, as we saw in 1993 with the action at the 
Medak pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform Party support the removal of the death penalty 
from the National Defence Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member.  We made very little mention of that amendment 
to the act in our proposal.  In part it deals with the fact that 
we will be addressing that issue in a substantive way in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is something again that should go to the people of 
the country.  Do they want the death penalty or not?  That is a 
very simple question to ask in the form of a referendum.  It 
would be fantastic feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to the fact that there were some 
soldiers in the first and second world wars executed as a result 
of their actions or lack thereof, perhaps treasonous actions. 
When it comes to the security of the nation there are offences 
that could very well warrant the death penalty.  I am talking 
from a personal point of view.  If it means a loss of life over 
the treasonous action of a member in the military, but not 
necessarily in a war like situation, by withholding information, 
by failing to act, by failing to protect, and people lose their 
lives or the security of the country is jeopardized, what do we 
do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those are good questions that should be put to the 
people in the country. When it comes to the issue of the death 
penalty overall that is what the Reform Party's position is, to 
see what kind of feedback we get from those in our nation on that 
issue, yes or no, are they in favour of reinstating the death 
penalty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we 
have heard the debate today on Bill C-25 I could not help but 
think of several things that touch on the whole issue of the 
military in this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently had a base closure in the city of Calgary, 
something with which we have had a long tradition.  Indeed 
Calgary has been a fine recruiting centre for the Canadian armed 
forces. It is the only city of its size in this country that does 
not have a base any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all sorts of rumours going on now with regard to the 
land deals that will be happening and who will get a sweet deal 
out of the sale of the lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other cities that have had similar base closures have actually 
received money from the federal government, some form of 
compensation. In this case the federal government is looking to 
max out the value of the lands that Calgarians have already paid 
for in their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Calgary Northeast what 
his feelings are on the idea of closing CFB Calgary and the 
military institution, the traditions that we had in that city 
with little or no compensation.  It is certainly not commensurate 
with what other Canadian cities have received.  Perhaps it was 
political retribution for Calgarians not electing Liberals in the 
last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for Calgary West for his question because I think it is a 
very important one to Calgary.  It is pertinent to Calgarians and 
to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The base has been moved.  One thousand acres of prime real 
estate are sitting in the heart of Calgary. What is that worth? 
Just the raw land itself is worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the only city.  Edmonton has a sizeable chunk of 
land in its centre, 640 acres of prime real estate, and Griesbach 
barracks that will be turned over to whom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will that money go?  There is a squabble going on right 
now regarding what is going to happen to the land in Calgary. The 
member for Calgary West knows full well what is happening there 
because it sits right in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is going to be taking all those luscious dollars that are 
going to come from the sale of that land?  Where will they go? 
There is no legislation anywhere that shows what will happen to 
the land to be dispersed.  It will have to go up for development 
in some fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it a political move to get rid of the military?  Absolutely. 
I do not see any other reason for moving the base out of Calgary 
to Edmonton.  The infrastructure in Edmonton was a disaster and 
it still is a disaster.  In fact, our soldiers are living in 
squalor for the most part, those taking part in the program for 
military housing.  It is disgusting.  Sewage is backing up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no excuse to move the Calgary military base to 
Edmonton.  There was no advantage whatsoever. It was a political 
move and it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars, much more 
than the $65 million that the government put on the price tag for 
making the move.  We have not seen the end of it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the land in Calgary, there has been no 
compensation offered to Calgary for the move in the first place 
and the land is still up for dispute regarding what will happen. 
I think it will be worth looking into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My intent is to further examine the agreement between the city 
of Calgary which is a major player in this affair and DND or 
whoever is looking after that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem like there is a whole lot of consideration on 
the part of the Liberal government to pay any attention to what 
it meant to move the base from Calgary to Edmonton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the bottom line on that move, there were only 
four Liberal seats in the province of Alberta before that move 
was made.  They moved the base from Calgary to Edmonton because 
Edmonton was where the four seats were. Lo and behold, now there 
are only two Liberal seats left in the entire province of 
Alberta.  Hopefully at the next election there will be no seats. 
I am sure members would be pleased to hear that. 
It would sort of solidify Reform's position in western Canada for 
good reason because of the abuse we have been suffering at the 
hands of the Liberals over the last several years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the amendments being proposed to the National Defence 
Act, and especially the code of service discipline, relates to 
the abolition of the death penalty as a punishment and 
substitutes it with life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little unclear from the member opposite with respect to 
the position of the Reform Party on the matter relating to the 
death penalty.  I listened to the hon. member's response to a 
previous question, but I would still seek clarification if I 
might is as it relates to Bill C-25.  As I have already stated, 
the death penalty is being taken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Reform Party be introducing an amendment as it relates 
to the death penalty, or is it satisfied that what is in Bill 
C-25 is appropriate and will proceed accordingly?  I would like 
the hon. member's response to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will not be introducing 
an amendment.  I thought I made that clear when I spoke the last 
time in reference to the death penalty.  The matter was 
previously covered in the Criminal Code as far as treason is 
concerned and those issues dealing with actions of citizens and 
the military.  If they violated those sections they were subject 
to the death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the issue of the death penalty let me make 
clear that this matter will be put before the people of the 
country.  I understand the majority of people would like to see 
the death penalty for murder.  It certainly can be extended into 
treasonous actions by the military if the public so desires.  I 
do not see any reason they should not be consulted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Esquimalt base is in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
Marine Pacific command is in my riding and as such provides me 
with an enormous amount of information and insight into what is 
taking place within the military today.  As the No. 1 employer in 
my riding, the number of constituents dependent upon the military 
is vast.  Therefore the bill is exceedingly important to the 
constituents of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are disappointed because Bill C-25 had an enormous 
opportunity to make some substantive changes within the military 
that would enable men and women in our fighting force to be able 
once again to do the best they can in an institution that 
traditionally has served our country exceptionally well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament as an institution has not served the military well. 
We have not provided the military with the tools to be able to do 
its job.  Bill C-25 was an opportunity to enable us to give the 
military the tools to do its job, to strengthen the faith it has 
within its own institution, but unfortunately again we failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ignored the recommendations of the $30 million plus Somalia 
inquiry.  We ignored the recommendations of many learned people 
within and without the military to build a stronger Canadian 
fighting force.  This cannot be a witch-hunt.  We must focus on 
the constructive solutions that would enable the Canadian 
military to be the best that it can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward a number of constructive suggestions 
regarding the military police.  We suggested that it be taken out 
of the chain of command and be given more independence.  It 
should report directly to the military attorney general.  This 
was ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked that the office of the judge advocate general be split 
into defence and prosecutorial roles.  Judges should not come 
from the same office and probably should come from the federal 
court trial division.  Removing the judicial role of the judge 
advocate general would allow for the offices to be renamed the 
attorney general with the responsibilities of policing and 
prosecuting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry recommended the creation of an independent 
inspector general.  We believe this was ignored because the 
inspector general would be independent.  If we believe in 
transparency, if we believe that we should have independence and 
the ability to investigate potential problems within the 
military, as in any other organization we should give this group 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry recommended numerous things.  It recommended 
that the Minister of National Defence report to parliament by 
June 30, 1998 on all actions taken in response to the 
recommendations by the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Somalia inquiry to be just another study that is tossed 
under the table and forgotten?  We repeatedly do this, be it the 
inquiry into aboriginal affairs, the Somalia inquiry or committee 
reports.  After they get their day of media attention the vast 
majority of committee reports, which contain superb ideas and 
suggestions, are merely tossed under the carpet and forgotten. 
This is an enormous waste of opportunity.  It is also an enormous 
waste of taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also failed to address the suggestion that action be 
taken regarding witnesses who lied or broke officers trust or 
oath.  It ignored twelve recommendations addressing the creation 
of the office of the inspector general.   It ignored five 
recommendations charging the CDS with clarifying and 
strengthening the change of command.  It ignored eight 
recommendations charging the CDS with more effective screening 
with respect to promotions, self-discipline and how personnel 
impose discipline on others.  Bill C-25 ignored twelve 
recommendations charging the CDS with applying merit as the prime 
factor in promotion through improving the performance and 
evaluating reporting system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the military, as in other organizations, people are not 
necessarily promoted on the basis of merit but on the basis of 
some other characteristic.  That is not fair.  It erodes the very 
essence of any organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people, regardless of where they happen to be from, say 
that they cannot ascend through the ranks of an organization on 
the basis of merit, why should they improve themselves?  Why 
should they give the best performance?  Why should they be the 
best they can become? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not being promoted on the basis of merit.  They are 
being promoted on the basis of some other characteristic.  That 
erodes the very heart and soul of the system and what we get is 
an organization that is far less than what it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has ignored numerous recommendations.  I will not go 
through the rest of them because my colleague has eloquently 
spoken about them.  There are numerous other things that the 
military has failed to deal with.  One particularly important 
situation is what has been occurring in my riding on the dockyard 
and in the depot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago military personnel heard through the grapevine 
that roughly 18,000 jobs were to be lost.  Can we imagine being 
people in the military and hearing that our jobs might be lost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told the Minister of National Defence that these rumours were 
flying around.  The NDP asked questions, as well they should and 
should be commended for doing so.  When we asked these questions 
of the minister he said that they were just rumours, that they 
would not really lose 18,000 jobs.  I then asked the minister to 
tell the personnel on these bases what would or would not happen. 
Have we heard anything?  No, we have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Union of National Defence Employees have 
asked the minister what is going on.  There might be some 
reallocation of jobs through the alternative service delivery 
plan.  How many jobs will it be?  Who will have to do this?  Will 
personnel be allowed to bid for their jobs on a fair and level 
playing field?  These are important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out the backdrop against which this takes 
place. 
In my riding men and women at the base service depot have gone 
through the downsizing.  In fact they are a model of downsizing 
in the country.  They have cut where they have needed to cut. 
They streamlined where they needed to streamline.  They improved 
their efficiency where they needed to improve their efficiency, 
so much so that they are a model of downsizing.  They have been 
held up as a model of downsizing.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 10 years many of those personnel have been working at a 
wage level with no raises that is less than they would make on 
welfare.  Some people for 12 of their 14 years in the military 
have been working at a wage less than they would make on welfare. 
They stuck out the job because they felt it was the right thing 
to do.  They felt committed to the institution.  They wanted to 
make a contribution.  They liked their job.  They felt strongly 
about the military.  They felt the military was a part of Canada. 
They felt it was a duty and responsibility to the country to 
support the institution even though they could have made more 
money not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against this backdrop the ministry said to them that their jobs 
may be cut.  They have also not said to them that they could 
apply for their jobs if it is under the ASD or bid for their jobs 
in a fair and equitable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a situation do we have?  What kind of a minister do 
we have?  What kind of a ministry do we have that will kick 
hard-working men and women in the teeth who have done their jobs 
faithfully?  What kind of a government kicks its employees in the 
teeth when they are down, when they have given more honour, more 
credibility, more faithfulness to the institution than perhaps 
the government has? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not asking for miracles.  They just want a fair 
shake.  The Union of Defence Employees wants a fair shake.  They 
want to be able to bid for their jobs on a level playing field. 
They want to be treated fairly.  They understand that cuts have 
to be made.  They understand that streamlining has to occur but 
they do not understand that when they have done this and have 
done it very well they are kicked in the teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the minister to speak to the employees in the 
military, tell them the truth, tell them what is going on, treat 
them fairly and enable them to compete for their jobs on a level 
and fair playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If cuts are to take place it would do the taxpayer and the 
military an enormous disservice if the reorganization is to make 
the military less effective than it is today.  That is also a 
concern of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an ASD is to be used, will the people this is being given to 
be able to do a better job?  There are concerns that the people 
who will be getting these jobs might be friends of the military, 
friends of the people in power.  Will these hard working people 
who have been working for years for the military be tossed aside 
because the contract will be awarded to somebody who knows 
somebody in the ministry or in the defence department?  Is that 
fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth has to come out and it is the minister's 
responsibility to do that.  There have been no responses to my 
questions so far.  I want those answers and I want them now.  The 
employees of the defence department, members of the UNDE, who 
live in my riding want and deserve answers.  They want them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the soldiers in our defence department, they 
have been labouring under an egregious situation for years.  In a 
presentation at the defence committee over a year ago to General 
Roméo Dallaire who was there, along with the assistant deputy 
minister, I pointed out some constructive solutions from the men 
and women at the base in Esquimalt.  They were solutions that 
would have enabled them to provide a better standard of living 
and to improve the situation within the military without costing 
the military more money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have been a win-win situation.  We could have made the 
accommodation assistance allowance applicable to all members in 
the military.  When someone in the military is moved from an area 
where accommodation is cheap to an area where it is very 
expensive, such as Victoria or Vancouver, the person has to bear 
the cost. There is very little accommodation for that 
particularly if the person lives off base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the military understand that they can be moved around 
and that they have no say in where they go.  However, these 
people want to have some fairness built into the system. People 
who work in an embassy and who are moved to another country where 
the standard of living is much higher and more expensive are 
accommodated for that.  Our military men and women should have 
the same consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do this by making sure that the accommodation assistance 
allowance applies to everybody and that the AAA is tax free.  It 
is not much but it would provide them with some money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The raises the military personnel received were an absolute 
disgrace.  As we have said before, the military has to live 
within its budget but for heaven's sake, when we are sending 
people out to fight for our country, we should provide them with 
enough money to feed their children back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now a soldier can make $800 a month and an extra $400 a 
month if he or she goes away.  It is clearly to the soldier's 
advantage to go away.  But what does that do to the family?  When 
those soldiers are away they worry about their spouses and 
children.  There has to be some fairness built in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of our military personnel travel half a world 
away to fight in areas such as Iraq and they worry whether there 
is enough food on the table to provide for their children. Our 
military people are not looking to get rich but they are looking 
for fairness.  If they are going to put their lives on the line, 
they want fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing which is eroding our military is the inability of 
our soldiers to move up the ranks based on merit.  I and my 
colleague have addressed this issue before.  There is the 
perception, and I would argue the reality, that members in our 
military are not moving through the ranks on the basis of merit. 
Other factors extraneous to merit are taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is discrimination if someone is not able to move up the ranks 
because they are not of the right category. A level playing field 
must exist within the military as in every organization.  A 
person must be able to ascend the ranks of an organization on the 
basis of merit, competence, experience, on the basis of their 
qualities, not on whether they fit within a certain demographic 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our armed forces demand and deserve a game plan.  What is their 
role in the world?  They do not know.  The military personnel 
will do the job they are tasked to do if we task them with it. 
They will do it with honour and they will do it well. We have to 
give them direction.  Are they going to be a peacekeeping force? 
Are they going to be a military force that intervenes in active 
combat?  Are they going to be a force that is going to live up to 
our obligations as a country under NATO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our individual security as a nation is intimately 
entwined with the security of other nations.  In this era of 
globalization we have to live up to our obligations in 
international organizations such as NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have security, we have to provide our 
military personnel with the tools to do their job.  There is no 
compromise on that.  We must give them the required tools. This 
means the equipment and direction.  We are not doing that in 
spite of repeated white papers, commissions and studies that have 
called for just that. 
Give our military personnel a game plan.  Give them the tools to 
do their job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this era of cutting, efficiency can be put into the military. 
By giving base commanders the ability to manage their affairs 
more closely without the intervention of the Treasury Board there 
will be more money, more flexibility and better bases for the 
Canadian men and women in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board repeatedly meddles in the affairs of the 
military.  It ties the hands of the military.  Base commanders 
cannot actively try to provide support nor can they use their 
intelligence and abilities to ensure their bases are as good as 
they can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that in the past the minister and the government have 
done some good things to try to give base commanders some 
flexibility.  It is a significant departure from what occurred 
before.  They can do more.  A lot more could be done to give base 
commanders the flexibility and the ability to improve the social 
and economic conditions among our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The armed forces need our help.  Their social and economic 
situation needs improvement.  The government needs to listen to 
the solutions we have put forward, solutions which have been 
given by our military, the men and women in uniform and their 
families. The government needs to listen to our critic.  It needs 
to work with members across party lines. It needs to work for our 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not accept the subterfuge that has taken place for so 
long.  We will not accept the military being ignored.  We will 
not accept that it has not been listened to.  The government must 
be held accountable.  It must act on the solutions and 
suggestions it has on its plate.  We will work with the 
government to help our military become the best it can become.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will comment on something recently brought to my attention which 
got under my skin.  I would like the comments of the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soldiers in Calgary and people who have worked with the U.S. 
embassy in Ottawa have informed me that our government was 
offered the Abrams tanks that the U.S. military was going to 
mothball in Arizona.  It was cheaper for the U.S. military to 
offer these tanks to the Canadian forces.  It was also cheaper 
for the U.S. to pay for the maintenance of the tanks than it 
would be for it to mothball the machines in Arizona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could possibly turn down the opportunity to use world class 
equipment when somebody else was willing to pay the maintenance 
and when our own forces are not able to purchase that type of 
machine?  Lo and behold, our fine Liberal government turned down 
the opportunity to use the Abrams tanks which would be provided 
with paid maintenance by the American military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very difficult time understanding why our forces were 
deprived of the opportunity to learn how to use Abrams tanks and 
to have the maintenance charges picked up.  When somebody is such 
a staunch defender and friend of Canadian interests in terms of 
our geopolitical situation, to not take up this opportunity 
smacks against our friendship with our American neighbours.  It 
also deprives our Canadian forces of the opportunity to utilize 
the machines. I encourage the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca to comment on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
for his question, which hits the heart of two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the role of our military?  There is no clear description 
of the military's role.  If it has a role as a fighting force 
with ground forces and if we need tanks to fulfil our NATO 
obligations or for our peacekeeping roles, then this would make 
absolute sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague illustrated the important issue of why we do not 
hear whether or not we are accepting those tanks. It is like the 
submarine situation. 
We do not know why the submarines were rejected.  We do not even 
know if they were considered properly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what the minister of defence is thinking, be it 
regarding submarines or tanks because a direction for the 
military has not been articulated.  The government waffles all 
over the spectrum.  It is as if it goes with the breeze. We do 
not know what the government's plan is for the military.  If we 
knew what the plan was, then we would know whether or not we 
should buy the Abrams tanks or the submarines. First should be 
the role.  The government has been sitting here for five years 
and has not articulated a strong clear position on what the role 
of the military should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second issue is that of the U.S. military.  The U.S. military, 
as much as some people in our country like to criticize it, has 
been an enormous friend to Canada.  We cannot do our job without 
its help.  In many cases the U.S. military relies on our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operation that exists between both countries on a 
military level is astounding, be it in the use of military 
satellites, communications skills, or our frigates protecting 
their ships against submarines.  There is an intimate 
relationship between the U.S. and Canadian militaries which 
serves us both well. Our ability to protect ourselves would not 
be nearly as good if the U.S. military did not have such a 
co-operative relationship with our men and women in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we do not treat Bill C-25 or this 
discussion as a witch-hunt against the military.  There have been 
criticisms against the leadership in the military.  As in any 
organization there are good eggs and bad eggs.  It is the 
minister's role to separate them.  Get rid of the bad eggs and 
keep the good eggs. Enable the many good people in the military 
to percolate up to the top, to strengthen our military to be the 
best that it can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much dissatisfaction with the military personnel in 
their ability to advance. As a result huge numbers of 
extraordinarily talented people in the prime of their lives, in 
their thirties, forties and fifties have been lost to early 
retirement.  They do not have the faith in the military to 
contribute to the organization they originally went into because 
they believed in it with their hearts and souls.  Many of them 
came from families who gave their lives to the military for our 
country.  What a sad reflection of our country that we cannot 
support an institution which has served our country and the world 
so well for so long.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have one question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Reform member spoke about our friendly relations with 
the Americans.  Would he agree that sometimes that relationship 
gets a little too friendly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the used MOX fuel we are importing from the 
United States along our rails and roads into our Chalk River 
facility.  Most Canadians were unaware that this was happening. 
The member may be aware that a lot of environmentalists and 
groups are very concerned about a possible accident which may 
occur and what it could mean to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that we should stop these shipments of used 
plutonium and MOX fuels into Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not as well versed 
as the hon. member on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our relationship with the American military, it 
is co-operative.  It is not incestuous.  We do retain our 
autonomy.  Our friends in the United States military understand 
that our soldiers are Canadian soldiers and not American soldiers 
in Canadian uniforms. That has always been very clear.  Perhaps 
the hon member would be very interested to know of the enormous 
respect Canadian soldiers have in the United States when they 
help our friends in that country with their military initiatives.

would certainly appreciate the member's giving me some 
information on this so I would be able to read about it and give 
him my opinion on it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I know the member speaks from experience.  He has had very close 
liaison with the military bases in his riding. He has spent a 
number of days examining their situation and listening carefully. 
The defence committee has travelled to Esquimalt and we have 
seen firsthand the problems that have arisen.  I say problems 
because those problems need not be there had the government been 
paying attention to the military, its needs and acting on those 
needs a long time ago. But it chose not to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Morale plays a big role in the military.  The government makes 
wonderful announcements about the pay raises it has given the 
military, 3.2% the most recent, 2.2% previously and 1.5% going 
back to 1996 and .6%.  Yet I am going to ask the member what kind 
of pay is the military going to actually realize when it looks at 
all the clawbacks in Canada pension, in tax, employment insurance 
and will it be all that much better off with what it has now or 
does it need something better like tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, tax relief, tax relief, 
tax relief is what the military needs, as all Canadians need.  I 
thank my friend from Calgary Northeast, our defence critic. He 
has done an enormous job of trying to be the advocate for our 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board hacks away at our defence department personnel's 
accommodation.  It has raised their rents repeatedly while 
freezing their pay.  That is the kind of situation we have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak today to Bill C-25, an act 
to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. The purpose of this act is to make 
substantial changes to the military justice system in the 
Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the impetus or a lot of this dates back to October 1995 
when the Liberal government issued an order in council to 
establish what became known as the Somalia commission of inquiry. 
Later that commission by order in council was prematurely shut 
down. This is the first time in Canadian history that an order in 
council has been used to shut down a commission of inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that happened was the commission was about to 
investigate the involvement of the Liberal government in the 
Somalia affair.  Allegations of murder, the cover-up of murder, 
the failure of the general staff and the government to hold 
anyone accountable for their actions or omissions, the culture of 
secrecy at the Department of National Defence and the double 
standards of the military justice system all bubbled up during 
the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Liberal government is no friend to the 
Canadian Armed Forces.  It has done no favours for our armed 
forces by allowing a cloud to hang over them by shutting down the 
Somalia inquiry.  It has not given them a clear mandate to fulfil 
and it has failed to adequately equip them for their tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the term of this government the Canadian military has 
never been asked to do more with less resources.  The government 
has failed to provide openness, accountability and independence 
for the Canadian Armed Forces.  There were three important 
recommendations that came out of the Somalia inquiry.  They 
continue to be ignored by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the military police, they should be taken out of the 
chain of command and given more independence. 
Judge Marin was commissioned to report on the military police. 
He recommended that they not have the power in Canada to conduct 
criminal investigations.  This recommendation is totally ignored 
in the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was recommended that the office of the judge advocate general 
be split into defence and prosecutorial roles.  It was also 
recommended that the judge not come from the same office and 
probably should not come from the federal court, trials division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry recommended the creation of an inspector 
general.  The government continues to ignore this recommendation. 
It ignores this request because an inspector general would be 
independent.  The Liberals continuously ignore the role of 
Parliament with respect to national defence.  The government has 
forgotten that deployment decisions of our troops should be taken 
by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians are justifiably proud of our military. But we 
are also very concerned that this government has denuded British 
Columbia of part of our military.  It decimated Chilliwack.  We 
still have Esquimalt and we still have Comox.  It would be very 
difficult indeed for this government to remove the naval presence 
from British Columbia.  Otherwise it would have done so by now, 
there is no doubt about that.  All the west coast coverage for 
the air force comes from Comox, which is essential.  It is bad 
news for British Columbia that we no longer have an armed forces 
base in Chilliwack.  We no longer have the army presence that we 
look for in national or international emergencies, ice storms, 
Bosnia, Kosovo or Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have an earthquake on the west coast who are we going to 
look to?  We are going to look to our military.  Ottawa has let 
British Columbia down very badly indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have put politics before principle.  They have put 
politics before what is good for the nation and good for society. 
The Liberals are no friends of the military.  They are continuing 
to ask our personnel to fly unsafe helicopters. We had another 
helicopter crash last week. As my colleague said, it is a good 
thing they float better than they fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have to remember out of all this is that people 
in uniform are ordinary Canadians. They come from our communities 
and they are trying to do a job for our country. Yes, they are 
trained to an extraordinary degree in many disciplines and they 
are often extremely responsive and responsible.  Let us be very 
thankful that we have them. This is not the treatment the 
military has received from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In downtown Ottawa and in other cities we have military 
personnel in uniform being mistaken for security guards or 
parking lot attendants.  That is how far our military has 
plummeted in terms of public perception in this country because 
our government is doing nothing to maintain, restore and give 
Canadians pride in our military tradition, a very important 
military tradition.  It is crucial that we go beyond Liberal lip 
service and live off the legacy which is this government's way of 
dealing with our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently at the APEC conference we received a slap in the face. 
The Seaforth Highlanders were not considered Canadian enough for 
APEC. 
The Seaforth Highlanders from British Columbia, that proud group, 
were replaced by the Van Doos because of a decision by the Prime 
Minister's office.  I wanted to ask a question but unfortunately 
I already know the answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a political decision to fly those people to Vancouver 
from the province of Quebec at a cost of $210,000.  Who pays for 
a political decision?  The Prime Minister's office?  No. The 
Department of National Defence paid that $210,000.  A hard 
pressed department of government paid for that political 
decision.  That is the ultimate slap in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the government the military has lost pay comparability 
with the public service.  This is what our Liberal administration 
told us on Friday.  Non-commissioned officer pay had a 6.7% 
shortfall compared to the public service and our general service 
officers had a 14.7% shortfall compared to our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This displays Liberal mindset.  First of all, our military 
personnel should not be compared with the public service.  They 
are not the public service.  They do not resemble the public 
service. Our personnel should be compared with military personnel 
on a world scale.  I would suggest we start with other 
Commonwealth forces and U.S. forces.  More on that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on this government for allowing our military personnel and 
our police personnel, by the way, to fall even shorter than our 
public service.  Why was this allowed to happen?  Talk about 
demoralizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see it right up front.  I do not think I explained but within 
my riding is Comox armed forces base.  I have a fairly good feel 
for what is going on with personnel. The problems all rest with 
this frontbench.  Shame on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, Comox armed forces base is in my riding. The 
stress of low pay and extended absences on individuals and 
families is tremendous. Moonlighting is rampant and essential for 
many of the young members.  A news release from government on 
Friday states that economic increases for Canadian forces 
personnel were intended to mirror similar pay increases expected 
to be awarded to all federal employees, including members of the 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes no sense.  They are not doing the same job and there 
is no comparability.  We should be tying our military to 
Commonwealth forces, to U.S. forces.  We can look at the pay.  We 
can look at the perks.  We can look at the tax treatments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had looked at all this we would not have a scramble from 
over here trying to deal with catch-up for our pilots.  They are 
losing pilots one after the other.  We will have a shortfall. 
There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instituting a measure that favourably treats pilots is 
demoralizing for the rest of the personnel.  Why in heaven's name 
we got ourself into this.  There is no vision over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces personnel travelling in the United States have 
more perks than in our own country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this reciprocity is there is a little beyond me because 
there is a lack of any substantive favourable treatment shown to 
U.S. personnel travelling in Canada.  They are not extended the 
courtesy that our personnel are extended there.  Once again, this 
is shameful.  It is something that needs to be addressed, but all 
we get is lip service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay of the military has been frozen since 1991.  We started 
to see some increases in an attempt to catch up with the public 
service, as I described earlier.  However, a four year phase-in 
period is totally inappropriate.  The morale within the armed 
forces is not only down because of the pay, it is down because 
there is no clear indication from government when the cuts are 
going to stop, when their organization is going to stop being 
downsized, when their organization is going to be equipped in the 
way that it needs to be equipped.  There is nothing but 
uncertainty and concern that it is so far down the priority list 
in the pecking order of this government that it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to keep people in the military, especially 
our best and our brightest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the government's vision?  The only conclusion that I am 
able to come to, after observing this place for four years, is 
that there is none.  If we read the documents, all the fine 
words are there, but it is lip service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is contributing to problems with morale in 
the Department of National Defence is that the organization is 
always getting smaller and there are obviously very few 
opportunities for advancement.  People are having to stay in 
their job classifications or job categories.  Those are valuable 
people.  We want to keep them.  We also want to compensate them 
in a way that they deserve.  That is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is great at pitting one group against another. 
It is starting to split the military into groups.  I have already 
talked about this favourable treatment to pilots and how that is 
going to be viewed and is viewed by some personnel.  This is just 
not the way to operate.  We cannot constantly be ad libbing about 
how we are going to manage a major department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something we should all be very proud of is Canada's long 
military tradition.  In many respects what makes and defines 
Canada as a nation started back at Vimy Ridge and continues to 
this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever there has been a military engagement, peacekeeping or 
otherwise, since I came here in 1993, the impression I have had 
is that the government is making up the rules as it goes along. 
It does not have any sense of creating stability in the armed 
forces, creating combat capability or high morale within the 
voluntary military to represent Canada's interests and to fulfill 
what we deservedly should represent given our strong military 
tradition and history.  All we have seen is the death of 1,000 
cuts and a lack of commitment from Liberal administrations.  We 
have actually never had a Liberal administration which has been 
supportive of the military beyond lip service and living off a 
legacy.

on the leading edge of many endeavours.  It can be rather 
humbling at times for anyone in that environment to recognize 
that one has met someone who is more than one's intellectual

with me is that some of the brightest and best in American 
society have their roots in the U.S. military.  They say that the 
U.S. military has many of the nation's best and brightest.  It is 
all because of this legacy and tradition and devotion to country

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that we carry that tradition in this country.

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I agree with the fact that military personnel in this 
country are severely underpaid.  My riding of Sackville—Eastern 
Shore has a large military air base and naval base called 
Shearwater.  I was at a dinner the other day with the commander 
of the base.  We were discussing the very same concern about the 
lack of attention that previous governments and current 
governments have given with respect to the pay for all ranks 
within the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one question I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Vancouver Island North.  Would he not agree that the military 
within Canada and the United States have a large attachment of 
civilian workers who work with them?  I have yet to hear 
anyone from the Reform Party talk about the very serious cuts, 
not only to the civilian workers, but to the alternate service 
delivery and the effect they have on the workers who are 
currently there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many workers are losing their jobs.  Goose Bay-Labrador is a 
prime example where people who have worked with the military for 
many years on a civilian basis are now being asked to take 
a 60% cut in pay and a different job classification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like either the hon. member's personal comments or his 
party's comments on how they view alternate service delivery and 
the effect it has not only on civilian workers but on the 
military as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, regarding the member's 
question about alternate service delivery, I do understand from 
my visits to Comox air force base that there has been a lot of 
alternate service delivery which has been brought into the 
military and to that base over the last several years.  I think 
much of it makes sense, so far.  However, there comes a point at 
which some of the essential things, especially those things 
that military personnel need to carry with them into combat, 
should be retained by the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question about personnel being asked to take a 60% 
pay cut concerns me greatly.  It tells me that somebody else 
has become the new employer and they want to retain the same 
employees but pay them less.  If that is the circumstance, it is 
not one that I am aware of on the home front.  I cannot say that 
it is something I would subscribe to.  If there is alternate 
service delivery I would assume that the reason it is being done 
is because efficiencies are going to be achieved in some other 
way, through scheduling, through economies of scale or 
inventory.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to make one's cost savings by offloading onto employees 
does not make sense to me.  I am with the member in terms of that 
part of his question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member opposite 
and was astounded by some of the comments he made with respect to 
the military and some of the jingoistic statements he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that the government has moved 
on a number of fronts with respect to our military, certainly on 
issues relating to housing, across the board pay increases and 
capital equipment acquisition.  We are in fact positioned in a 
way that will meet not only our obligations here in Canada but 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recently came to my attention that the defence committee is 
working very well in trying to address some of the issues raised 
and the problems that are identified in a very collegial fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat amazed when one of the members from the Reform 
Party, the member for Lakeland, was chided for trying to turn the 
committee into a political side show.  Talk about turning people 
against people and region against region.  I guess the Reform 
Party is obviously very good at that in all cases and in all 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is:  Why does the Reform Party, 
in its usual extreme manner, always insist on trying to turn the 
military into a political football?  Maybe the Reform member 
could answer that for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I consider that comment 
an insult.  If the member thinks that way about me it is because 
he has not listened to me very much.  That is the last thing I am 
doing here.  This is a Liberal apologist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that I made jingoistic statements.  I suggest the member 
look up jingoistic in the dictionary.  Somehow he tied that to 
housing and pay increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Jingle bells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  I heard that comment, too.  That is 
highly inappropriate when we are trying to have a constructive 
debate.  That is the ultimate in lip service to a Liberal 
apologist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to the defence committee addressing 
some of the problems in the military.  That points out a 
fundamental flaw in the way this administration operates.  Those 
problems did not originate this year.  Those problems have been 
brewing and the lid is just bubbling.  We have people who have to 
moonlight.  We have members of the military going to food banks 
and collecting welfare supplements because of structural problems 
in the military.  This has been front page news in Esquimalt, 
Victoria, Edmonton and other locations.  We do not need a defence 
committee to tell us how to address these problems.  The 
government has known full well about these problems for a long 
time and has chosen to ignore them because it places the 
interests of the military at the bottom of the totem pole and not 
where they rightfully belong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is always interesting to hear the Liberal viewpoint on the 
military and to see how quickly they point the finger elsewhere, 
blaming others for the problems they have created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning the Liberals have hated the military, 
all the way back to the Trudeau era, and have cut it apart. Under 
Hellyer, Trudeau wanted to unify the military, which was the most 
destructive force that ever could have happened to destroy the 
military.  It was done under Trudeau and it continues to this 
day.  They then turn around and say they are going to fix the 
problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks a lot about morale.  The morale problem is the 
result of Liberal action and inaction. Morale is a major issue. 
It is equated to pay, to equipment, to purpose and to honour and 
courage in their leadership.  That is what morale deals with.  I 
would like the member to talk about honour and courage in the 
leadership and in the ministry of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B> Madam Speaker, the frontbench of the 
Liberals is a place where Canadians should think that they can 
look for leadership and for profound demonstrated 
progressiveness. What do we see instead?  We see a caretaker 
status quo, protect their behind attitude from the frontbench and 
it starts at the top.

interdependence is the cornerstone of our democratic society, a 
principle clearly reflected in and protected by sections 96 to 
100 of the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada recently reiterated that financial 
security for judges is a constitutional requirement established 
to ensure public confidence in the independence and impartiality 
of the judiciary. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1997, in the reference on the independence of 
provincial court judges in Prince Edward Island, the Supreme 
Court of Canada reiterated that financial security for judges is 
a constitutional requirement established to ensure public 
confidence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, in recognition of the importance of judicial 
interdependence and the unique constitutional role of the 
judiciary, Parliament provided for an independent commission to 
examine the adequacy of judges' salaries and benefits.  In its 
recent decision, the supreme court underscored the importance and 
necessity of the role played by such independent commissions in 
ensuring public confidence in the independence and impartiality 
of the Canadian judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key part of that decision is to require public justification 
by government for a decision not to implement or to only 
partially implement the recommendation of such a commission. The 
most recent commission on judges' salaries and benefits, chaired 
by Mr. David Scott, reported on September 30, 1996 and the 
commission's report was tabled in Parliament on October 11, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continues to support the principles that led 
Parliament to institute the judicial salary commission process 17 
years ago.  In light of those principles and the enhanced 
constitutional role of independent salary commissions following 
the supreme court decision, we have given serious consideration 
to the recommendations of the Scott commission. Bill C-37 would 
implement those recommendations which the government is prepared 
to accept. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding judicial remuneration, the Scott commission 
recommended that judges' salaries be gradually increased by 8.3% 
from the date when the salary freeze was lifted: April 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By proposing only prospective increases, the Scott report 
reflects a position endorsed by the government and according to 
which it would be unreasonable for the judiciary not to be 
affected by the necessary budget restraints that were imposed 
from 1992 until just recently on all  Canadians paid by the 
federal government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government agrees with Chief Justice Dickson of the Supreme 
Court of Canada when he stated in Beauregard v. Canada: 
“Canadian judges are Canadian citizens and must bear their fair 
share of the financial burden of administering the country”. 
This view is echoed in the recent decision of the Supreme Court 
of Canada where the chief justice of Canada observed:  “Nothing 
could be more damaging to the reputation of the judiciary and the 
administration of justice than a perception that judges were not 
shouldering their share of the burden in difficult economic 
times”.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, in deciding what was reasonable the Scott 
commission recognized that a complex range of factors must be 
considered in establishing an appropriate level of remuneration, 
including the need to ensure levels of compensation that attract 
and keep the most qualified candidates for judicial office. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also aware that a number of provincial 
governments across Canada reacted to the recent supreme court 
decision by increasing their judges' salaries and that, in some 
cases, retroactive adjustments were also made to remedy previous 
salary cuts or freezes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government proposed to amend the Judges Act to 
increase judges' salaries by 4.1% per year for two years, as of 
April 1, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 would also implement certain pension related 
amendments to the Judges Act, including the rule of 80 which will 
permit retirement when a judge has served on the bench for a 
minimum of 15 years and the sum of age and years of service 
equals at least 80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees with this recommendation which responds in 
an important way to the changing democratic profile of the 
judiciary.  More and more judges are being appointed at a younger 
age and many of these younger judges are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provision, although based on the rule of 80, 
requires the minimum age of 65.  A judge who retires before 65 
has no right to a pension at all. Therefore a judge appointed at 
the age of 50 can retire with a pension at 65 with 15 years of 
service but a judge who is appointed at 40 must serve 25 years, a 
situation that is increasingly considered unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is even more unacceptable when we consider that 
it has a particular impact on women judges, who constitute the 
majority of those appointed at an early age.   The rule of 80 
would allow older, longer serving judges to retire when they feel 
they no longer wish to continue in that role.  Permitting this 
would be good for them and for the court as an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scott commission has proposed a different retirement option 
for the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada who would be 
permitted to retire with a full pension after serving a minimum 
of 10 years on the bench.  The government agrees with the 
commission that the immense workload and heavy responsibility 
inherent in membership on that court justifies the proposed 
retirement provision.  However, the government proposes to limit 
it to those judges who have reached age 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also make a couple of other changes to judges' 
pensions in the interest of fairness.  It would allow common law 
spouses to receive surviving spouses' annuities and it would give 
a judge who marries after retirement the option of receiving an 
actuarially reduced pension which continues until the judge and 
the spouse have both died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are both common features of other pension plans.  The 
common law provision in particular is an equality issue which 
recent jurisprudence suggests is overdue for inclusion in the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that while the government has given serious 
consideration to the Scott commission recommendations, we are not 
prepared to accept them all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scott commission recommended that the judges' life insurance 
coverage paid by the government be more in line with that of 
deputy ministers. However, before responding to the proposals 
made by the Scott commission, complex and serious matters must 
first be considered, including the equity issue arising from the 
potential diverse impact on younger judges, including women 
judges, of the resulting increase in a taxable benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there has been some discussion of the range of approaches 
to this issue, fuller consideration of this and other options is 
required.  This is therefore an issue that would be appropriate 
to refer to the new commission once established for further study 
and recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important part of Bill C-37 is improvements to the 
judicial compensation commission process that are responsive to 
the supreme court decision and are designed to reinforce its 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judicial compensation and benefits commission would conduct 
an inquiry into the adequacy of judicial compensation once every 
four years.  However, to provide flexibility timeframes would be 
extended on agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission would have nine months to complete its inquiry 
and submit a report to the Minister of Justice.  Again 
flexibility is provided by providing that the period to report be 
extended on the agreement of the minister.  In addition, the 
minister could submit a matter to the commission for full 
inquiry, make recommendations at any time and establish the 
timeframe for a report in such cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The independence of the commission would be enhanced by our 
proposal that it have one member nominated by the judiciary and 
one nominated by the Minister of Justice.  The representatives of 
each side would in turn nominate a third member who would be 
chair.  Members would be appointed by the governor in council for 
a fixed four year term on good behaviour, removable for cause. 
Terms could be renewed once on renomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes a proposal that the Minister of Justice 
be required to respond to a report of a salary commission.  This 
is responsive in part to the recommendations of the Scott 
commission that would require the Minister of Justice to table 
the report of a commission in the House of Commons, together with 
the government's response to the report and the government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, perhaps, this proposal is designed to comply 
with the new constitutional requirement that commission reports 
be dealt with in due dispatch. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is proposing a response that differs in two 
respects from that recommended by the Scott commission, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are proposing that the minister respond, at the latest, 
six months, and not three, after the report, so as to allow the 
time required for careful study of a commission's reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government cannot agree with the recommendation that 
bills should be tabled within a set time frame.  Control of 
legislative priorities and of the House agenda are the 
government's prerogative and this prerogative must not be 
hampered by rigid or inflexible deadlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy that this bill also follows up on a promise we 
made in the 1997 budget to expand family courts.  It proposes 
adding 24 new judges positions, paving the way for the largest 
increase yet in these very important courts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the model of the unified family court in part because 
it allows one judge to resolve all family law issues resulting 
from separation or divorce.  This reduces complexity, delay and 
costs, and helps ensure that these matters are presided over by 
expert specialist judges. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is equally important to point out that the courts are based on 
a model which we have supported from the outset and have 
discussed with the provinces and territories interested in 
establishing or expanding courts, and which would see 
extrajudicial services incorporated into the conflict resolution 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These services include information on family law, educational 
programs on the effects of separation on children, home studies, 
referrals to counselling and other community services, 
information on alternatives to litigation and access to such 
services, including mediation, and supervised visiting programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Including these services with appropriate safeguards for power 
imbalances and special measures where required to ensure equality 
of access can reduce the level of conflict both during and after 
the resolution of the matter and promote resolutions which are 
acceptable to the parties and likely to last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of the children involved, better long term 
outcomes can be expected from the lower levels of conflict, 
quicker resolutions, greater focus on impacts on children, 
increased durability of outcomes, and from the emphasis on an 
integrated service intensive approach to child protection, child 
support and custody and access issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill includes an amendment requested by the 
Government of Ontario, which is calling for the appointment of 
three new judges to that province's court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Court of Appeal is by far the busiest appeal court in 
the country but, with its complement of 19 full-time judges, it is 
only the second largest of all provincial appeal courts, and its 
combined staff of full-time and supernumerary judges equals that 
of two other provinces.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Court of Appeal is facing significant delays, 
particularly in civil appeals.  The civil appeal backlog 
increased from 1,400 in 1990 to over 2,300 at the end of 1996, 
notwithstanding that between 1990 and 1996 the court increased 
the number of civil appeals yearly by 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with this growing backlog the court embarked on a number 
of innovative measures to further increase its productivity.  As 
a result of these initiatives, in 1996 the court heard about 50% 
more civil appeals than it did in 1995 and, as I indicated, 100% 
more than it did in 1990.  Notwithstanding this very significant 
productivity improvement, the growing number of new appeals that 
were filed resulted in the civil appeal backlog decreasing only 
marginally in 1996 over 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province's increasing population and overall economic 
activity suggest that the court's workload will increase rather 
than decrease in the years ahead, contributing further to the 
backlog situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario and federal governments, as well as the court 
itself, have examined the nature and extent of the court's case 
load.  The consensus is that an increase of three to the court's 
full-time complement of 19 would result in a significant 
reduction in the backlog and a concomitant reduction in the 
delays experienced by litigants before the court. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes other technical amendments, including 
amendments arising from changes in the names of the Ontario 
Court, General Division, and the Ontario Court, Provincial 
Division, made by the Government of Ontario. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, these amendments will serve to strengthen what is 
already one of the best judicial systems in the world by 
enhancing the independence of our courts and improving access to 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The improvements to the judicial compensation process will 
ensure continued public confidence in the independence of our 
judiciary.  Increased judicial resources for unified family 
courts combined with provincial commitment of support services 
will improve the way our courts respond to families and children 
in crisis.  Increased court of appeal judges will improve access 
to justice generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can look forward to the support of all members in the 
House in moving these important amendments to the Judges Act 
quickly through parliament to the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be the first on behalf of the Reform Party to respond 
to Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, and to explain why we 
cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, this is the third time the Liberals have 
amended the Judges Act.  During the last parliament in 1996 they 
introduced Bill C-2 and Bill C-42.  Both were inconsequential 
pieces of legislation and of little significance to Canadians 
concerned about their safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are again spending our precious time on judge's salaries 
and benefits.  The Liberal government has failed to introduce a 
victims' bill of rights.  It has failed to amend the YOA.  It has 
failed to limit the Conditional Release Act.  It has failed to 
address the parole system, which is failing constantly in a 
number of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It fails to deal with the safety of Canadians but we are to talk 
about judges' pay and benefits.  We will occupy our time doing 
that instead of dealing with important issues like maybe amending 
some law pertaining to drinking and driving. The government will 
wait for forever.  In the four years I have been here we have 
hounded the government to make important changes, but, no, not 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of the legislation is the fact that it increases 
judges' salaries retroactively from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 
1998 by 4.1% and an additional 4.1% or a little more from April 
1, 1998 to March 31, 1999.  In other words judges will get an 
8.3% increase over two years.  With the average salary of a judge 
being approximately $140,000, this means they will make in excess 
of $151,000.  This is a substantial increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  How many other public servants have 
received pay raises in a two year period of 8.3%?  I hope all 
security guards will hold up their hands and shout hurrah for the 
8.3% raise the judges got who went from $140,000 to $151,000. 
I hope the lady pushing the carpet sweeper and broom and emptying 
garbage cans in front of my office this morning is pleased to 
hear that judges will now make $151,000 instead of $140,000 
because of a pay raise.  I hope bus drivers do not get too

or eight years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about prison guards?  I spend a lot of time in the prisons. 
The guards have been crying out for nine years that some of them 
have not seen a raise or pay increase of any kind.  They go to 
work in the morning and are at high risk and in high stress day 
after day.  It is a dangerous and difficult job.  Yet the 
government makes certain that the judges receive an increase from 
$140,000 to $151,000 while the guards in our institutions who 
have been asking for a pay raise for seven to nine years simply 
do not get one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I arrived in Ottawa in 1993 the weepy teared deputy prime 
minister said the government had to do something as there were a 
million children starving and living in poverty. Today there are 
still a million or perhaps more children in this situation. The 
government does not have time to address that. It can give away 
$25 million worth of flags and not worry about starving children 
living in poverty.  It goes on, and four years later there are 
still a million children living in poverty.  Yet it has time to 
deal with the judges and give them another big raise, increasing 
their salaries to $151,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would simply say it is extremist and does not 
care.  It shows its caring by making sure senior bureaucrats, 
possibly their frontline officers in caucus and judges are all 
well looked after with their bonuses.  Let us not forget big 
business grants.  It has several millions of dollars to give to 
big businesses.  Maybe they are donors to the Liberal Party.  I 
do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of issues we hoped would be solved when we 
came here.  However, what are debating today?  Judges' salaries 
and benefits.  The government is not worried about those million 
children.  It has not worried about this issue for four years so 
why worry about it today?  It is not worried about prison guards 
or security guards in this building.  They have not had a raise 
for seven or eight years.  The government will not worry about 
that today.  It has to look after judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually judges come from a lawyer background as do most of the 
people on that side of the House.  There is a good industry going 
on here.  Maybe we need to protect that industry.  I wish the 
government would show a little more caring about some things that 
are going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding are being evicted from their homes because 
they cannot afford to pay the rent or their mortgages. They have 
children.  I could name three families who are being evicted from 
their homes because they can no longer afford to pay their 
mortgage payments.  The government does not deal with that.  It 
deals with high wages for the bureaucrats and all the highfalutin 
Liberal garble.  It gives them bonuses and makes it look good. It 
goes on and on.  When will it stop?  When will it begin taking 
care of the needy instead of the greedy?  When will that happen? 
The caring government of the day, huh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point about the bill brings some things out in me that 
should not be brought out.  There will to be a commission that 
has to report but not to parliament.  There will not be 
opportunity for members to respond.  The commission is a creation 
which will provide the federal government with another 
opportunity to make more patronage appointments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not good news?  More appointments in a government where 
the Prime Minister said many times that he was going to put an 
end to that, much the way he said he was going to put an end to 
the GST.  Instead there are more and more appointments. It is 
going to be a patronage heaven by the time they get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will hold office for four years and they are eligible to 
be reappointed for another term.  One will be appointed by the 
justice minister.  Another one will be appointed by the governor 
in council.  A couple more will be recommended by somebody else. 
Another patronage appointment, welcome to Liberal world. 
Patronage heaven, what a great place to be. How can this 
government ever be seen as being accountable when the patronage 
appointments process is rejuvenated again and again, bill after 
bill, more patronage, appointments galore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's press release on compensation and benefits, 
the supreme court underscored the importance and the necessity of 
the role played by such an independent commission in ensuring 
public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the 
Canadian judiciary.  This clearly does not mean a system of 
patronage, yet that is what we got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They clearly know how to talk the talk, but they do not walk the 
walk.  The public confidence is at an all-time low because of 
these kinds of patronage patronage appointments.  Club Chrétien 
with its exclusive membership is already at 124 members.  This 
legislation will open the door for more.  Is that not good news? 
More patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have a good time taxpayers of Canada.  You think your taxes are 
high now, they are going to go up and up.  We are not going to 
really address the needs of the nation.  It is not a priority of 
that crowd over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third highlight of the bill increases the number of appeal 
court judges from 10 to 13.  It is no wonder this has become 
necessary in light of the shoddy pieces of legislation, such as 
conditional sentencing.  In B.C. alone there have been a record 
number of cases appealed because of Bill C-41 in the last 
Parliament.  What does all does that mean?  What is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Liberals are doing it to B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  That is exactly what the Liberals are 
doing to B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a good close look at this.  I want to refer to a 
case as I move into the next area regarding backlog.  They are 
going to increase the number of judges in the family court from 
12 to 36 to take care of the backlog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a case going on in Calgary right now.  In June 1996 
Christopher Goodstoney was charged in an accident which took the 
lives of four people.  He was accused of being drunk and was 
found guilty.  His first court appearance after the accident in 
June 1996 was on June 27, 1996, the same day the four children 
who were killed were to be buried.  Because of the snail's pace 
of our justice system, these grieving families have yet to lay 
their children to rest.  The overloaded courts are squarely to 
blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me show the chronology of this event as in the eyes of Carla 
Powell, the only surviving sibling of all the families. The other 
four were killed in the automobile wreck: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were normal families.  Ben Keuben is a house painter; his 
wife Darlene is a school librarian.  Gordon Smith is a long time 
employee of the Calgary <I>Sun</I>; his wife Susan is an executive 
at Hewlett-Packard.  Douglas Powell is the custodian of the Big 
Country Educational Consortium in Drumheller; his wife Jean is 
an English instructor with the Alberta Vocational College in Calgary 
in the outreach program in Drumheller. Carla Powell, the only 
remaining sibling of the three families, has a B.A. from the 
University of Calgary and is presently employed by the University 
of Saskatchewan.  Craig, her brother, who was one of the victims 
in this wreck attended SAIT in welding engineering technology and 
was employed by All New Manufacturing in Calgary. 
Amber, who was another victim, attended the University of 
Lethbridge and planned on continuing her studies at Mount Royal 
College.  Brandy and Stephanie, the other two victims, were 
fun-loving teenagers who had just finished their school terms 
when they were killed.  Not only is there a past but also there 
is a future that we have helped plan and optimistically 
anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that we must explain the journey from our perspective 
rather than that of the courts or the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 27, 1996, the day of the funerals for all of our 
children, Christopher Goodstoney, along with his lawyer, Larry 
Hursh, made his first court appearance before Judge John Reilly 
and he was remanded into custody until August 13 charged with 
five counts, four of criminal negligence causing death and one of 
criminal negligence causing injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 3, at which time five more counts had been added to his 
charges, four of impaired driving causing death and one of 
impaired driving causing injury, he appeared in Court of Queen's 
Bench in Calgary before Justice Ernest Hutchinson and was 
released into his community with no cash bail because of the 
tremendous support shown by members of his tribe. However, he was 
given very strict bail conditions.  He was not to drive, he was 
not to drink, he was to live with his mother and he was to report 
on a regular basis to the Cochrane RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 13, Goodstoney appeared in court in Cochrane for a 
minute or two and the proceedings were set over to September 24. 
Sometime along the line, an 11th charge of being over the legal 
blood alcohol limit of .08 was added to the charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 24, the appearance of Goodstoney in court was, if 
that is possible, even shorter than the previous time, but a date 
was set for the preliminary hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 19, 20 and 21, 1997 a preliminary hearing was 
conducted.  After three days of testimony, the proceedings were 
adjourned until May 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 6 the court heard from a witness who had been out of the 
country for several months.  The defendant was ordered to stand 
trial on 11 charges and an arraignment date was set for June 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11 the proceedings were postponed until August 13 
because the defendant said he needed more time to find funding 
for his lawyer.  His lawyer told the newspaper he needed the time 
to make a deal with the crown prosecutor.  All deals were refused 
by the prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 13 the same argument of needing more time and 
requiring money was presented to the Court of the Queen's Bench 
and the arraignment was set over until September 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 10 Goodstoney's lawyer quit and Goodstoney was told 
to be back in court on October 8 with a lawyer.  At that time, 
however, the trial date for the case was set down for days 
starting on March 16, 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there on March 16 and what we were waiting for was his 
sentencing.  We listened to one lawyer on one side and another 
lawyer on the other side debate for an hour or two about this 
person who had been charged with drunk driving, who had killed 
four people because of his actions two years ago and guess what, 
they did not arrive at a sentencing.  The judge was a little 
confused about what was being said and so it was postponed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighteen court trials on a clear-cut drunk driving case where 
people were killed.  The driver of the vehicle said that he was 
guilty, that he was sorry and he wished he had not done it.  He 
wanted to be dealt with and have it over with. It has now been 
two and a half years and 18 court trials on a case like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the government is coming in with a piece of legislation that 
is going to help all this backlog.  There is one judge in Ottawa 
who, if he does not get a raise, I will be glad to take out for a 
steak because he hit the nail on the head in an article “Judge 
scolds greedy lawyers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's most senior judges has blatantly condemned the 
legal profession's growing preoccupation with making money.  This 
judge of the Supreme Court of Canada said “Law has become more 
of a business than a profession or a calling and many lawyers are 
rapidly losing sight of their obligation to the public and to the 
pursuit of justice”.  I will take that judge out for a steak if 
he does not get his raise, and an Alberta steak at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 18 court cases on a clear-cut case of negligence 
causing death over two years ago.  This goes on and on. Pockets 
are getting fatter and fatter.  The victims and even the families 
of the criminals are not satisfied.  They want this to come to 
end but the system carries it on and on.

farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 fruit growers in Okanagan and Similkameen valleys were

government like the new B.C. whole farm insurance program.  This 
government continues to stonewall.

the federal government to give aid to the maple syrup producers. 
Orchardists in British Columbia have been waiting almost a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules determining which farmers qualify for federal disaster 
relief assistance should be the same for all Canadians and should 
not be based on what part of the country they live in.  The 
Liberal government must end this double standard today and 
announce financial aid for B.C. fruit growers.

children from 19 schools in rural Ontario participating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original mathematics competition was created for students in

did five years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Transport has said that his department 
has been generous in funding highway networks. However, the

highways despite collecting in Manitoba an average of $124

the health minister has tried to craft a public image of being a

finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, last week we saw the real McCoy come forward.  He

alone without any hope.

found $2 million for Brian Mulroney and not one thin dime for the 
victims of hepatitis C? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
13 governments, all the provinces, the two territories and the 
Government of Canada had to make a tough decision.  We identified 
in this tainted blood tragedy a period of 1986 to 1990 which 
stands apart from all the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period there were tests available that could have 
and should have been put in place to avoid infections and they 
were not.  We are compensating people during that period because 
it was during that period that something could have been done to 
help. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is no comfort for those who were tainted and infected 
outside of that time.  This health minister made a legal 
decision, an accounting decision, a budgetary decision.  It had 
nothing to do with compassionate, fair, human decisions at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now two tiers of hepatitis C victims in this country. 
There are those whose life is valued and those who do not even 
seem to exist at all in the eyes of this minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much money has the minister set aside to fight these victims 
in courts and lawsuits and how much has he spent on PR damage 
control? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in the period before 1986 hepatitis C was not even known.  It was 
called non-A, non-B hepatitis.  In the period before 1986 people 
in the medical system, acting in the best of faith and with the 
scientific and medical knowledge of the day, did the best they 
could.  There are risks and benefits in every medical procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these cases, tragically, before 1986 that risk benefit worked 
out in the case of tainted blood to cause infections with 
hepatitis C.  However, the period 1986 to 1990 was the period 
during which something could have been done and was not done.  It 
is for that reason, as a matter of principle, that we 
distinguished that period from all the others. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not much comfort for those who were infected before 1986. 
Frankly, they do not really care what it is called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is so fond of saying “We care.  We have families 
too and we really understand how you feel”.  The hepatitis C 
victims have family members also, except they are dying.  Instead 
of spending their last months with their families, they are now 
going to be going through the courts fighting against this 
minister for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the new Liberal definition of compassion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Etobicoke Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not recall and I do not think my colleagues, the ministers of 
health, can recall any decision which has been more difficult 
than dealing with this issue of compensation for those who 
innocently were tainted by contaminated blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also agreed that we should proceed on a principle. 
We agreed that we should look at the situation to determine 
whether distinctions could be drawn.  To say that anybody who 
has an adverse consequence from the health system, no matter 
fault, no matter good faith, no matter the state of scientific 
knowledge, should receive compensation is not a principle on 
which we—

<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the health 
minister says there was nothing that could have been done before 
1986.  That is categorically false.  In 1981 one of the main 
directors of the Red Cross sent a memo around to the Red Cross 
saying that there was something specific that could be done and 
they did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way to differentiate people who have hepatitis C. 
They are sick and many of them will die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not just admit that what it has done is 
wrong and compensate all the victims of hepatitis C?  Why not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the best history of all of this tragedy was written by Mr. 
Justice Krever who spent four years going through the evidence. 
It is clear from the chronology that 1986 was the turning point. 
That was the year in which the countries to whom we compare 
ourselves internationally, for example the United States, adopted 
surrogate testing.  That was the turning point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that all health ministers agree that the

last few months in Canada.  Two governments suggested 
compensation packages which were wrong for the Dionne quintuplets 
and for those who were sterilized in Canada without their 
permission.  As soon as they realized they were wrong, they 
reversed their stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a right way and a wrong way to treat the victims of 
hepatitis C.  Why has this health minister chosen the wrong way? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Justice Krever did his job.  He was speaking about just the 
blood system.  He made his recommendations.  Then it was up to 
governments to do their job, to take responsibility for making 
decisions about the health system in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have explained to this House and to the public of Canada the 
basis on which we proceeded.  The distinction between this and 
the other cases referred to by the hon. member is that in those 
cases they proceeded on the wrong principle.  Here we are 
proceeding on a rational analysis, a basis of principle which 
will remain a distinction justified by the facts.  It is a 
distinction with which I believe the Canadian people will agree.

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health is wrong.  There was a test available and it 
was being run in Germany prior to 1986, in fact in 1982, to 
screen out what is now know as hepatitis C, but the department 
did not act on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, we have 40,000 people left outside the 
compensation package.  Will the minister now act unilaterally to 
compensate these innocent victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as I mentioned, I think it is clear that 1986 was the year of 
demarcation, when countries to whom we compare ourselves, such as 
the United States, put in place as a matter of standard practice 
a test for looking for this contaminant in blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan issue.  At the table last week with me 
were ministers from Conservative provincial governments, from NDP 
provincial governments, who all agreed as a matter of public 
policy that this is the right and the responsible course to take. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
agree—and this is probably the only thing we agree on—that this 
is not a partisan issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the only reason the minister is using the U.S. 
model is because it is a model of convenience.  That model of 
convenience allows him to fit within the timeframe of 1986 and 
1990, therefore leaving out 40,000 innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is talking about fairness.  I want those 40,000 victims 
compensated.  It is as simple as that.  He has the constitutional 
and moral responsibility to do that.  Will he act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I take a different view of the facts.  My provincial colleagues, 
my counterparts, take a different view of the facts. 
I have explained the principle upon which we proceeded.  The

this matter.  If we are to compensate people who are harmed 
however tragically through no fault, with people acting in good 
faith based on the evidence that is in hand in the medical 
system, then that is a very dangerous course on which to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have identified the principle upon which we have acted.  All

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the National Council of Welfare one in ten of 
Canadians is on welfare and 78% are continuously on welfare for

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the finance minister's definition of a golden age for 
Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the definition of a golden age is one in which 
employment increased by 82,000 in February.  This is the biggest 
one month increase in employment since November 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A golden age is when the help wanted index increases 2.3% in 
February to 136 points.  Housing starts increased 11% in 
February, the largest monthly increase in over a year.  Real 
exports of goods and services grew 8.3% in the fourth quarter. 
Those are the kinds of numbers that give Canadians confidence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 2.8

is not the minister's definition of a golden age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Canada we have seen take home pay plummet since the 
government came to power by $3,000 for a family of four.  We have 
seen an increase in personal bankruptcies and in personal debts.

million people on welfare?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

improved since the government took office and in fact have 
improved more over the course of the last six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is the crocodile tears of the hon. member when he 
talks about welfare.  We must remember that his party wants to 
take a further $3.5 billion out of the transfers.  It 
specifically targeted welfare.  The Reform Party stands up and 
talks about its compassion for the poor which flies in the face 
of everything it has ever said or every written.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

because of patronage appointments.  We have to return to merit, 
he says.  He also says that some appointees have no experience in 
dealing with refugee cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week Anna Terrana, a defeated Liberal MP, I might add, 
who was appointed to the board admitted that she was not the best

not a single employee is being laid off.  They are all being

that the current legislation which governs merchant seamen was 
passed in 1992. This legislation extended equal veterans rights 
to wartime merchant seamen.  It provided them with the same

happened.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK207">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-37, an 
act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, because 
of its extreme importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with all bills relating to justice, I am going to try to 
examine it as in as cool and level-headed a manner as possible, 
and I will make a particular effort to avoid descending into the 
demagoguery I heard this morning from several of the Reform 
Party members, or the complacency the government party members 
seem to have with respect to courts and to judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a special bill in that it addresses an essential aspect 
of our democratic system: judiciary independence.  This is a 
concept we often hear referred to, without always understanding 
exactly what it is all about.  I believe it is important to take 
a few minutes, or seconds, to examine the principal aspects of 
this principle, in order to be able to assess and criticize the 
bill in a properly informed manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basis for asserting that judiciary bodies responsible for 
interpreting and enforcing the rules of law must have a minimum 
of independence from governments and parliaments is the 
separation of powers concept. The expression institutional 
independence will be used in relation to the judicial system as a 
whole, while individual or functional independence relates to the 
judges sitting on the court. The bill before us today, Bill C-37, 
deals with the latter aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process by which judges are appointed must be considered in 
dealing with the individual independence of judges. The 
Constitution and parliaments recognize that the power to appoint 
judges is vested in the governments. The federal government 
appoints superior court judges and federal court judges, while 
provincial governments appoint provincial court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitutional Act, 1867 requires a single condition be met 
to become a judge and only for superior courts: judges must be 
selected from the bar of the province where they are being 
appointed, in accordance with the provisions of sections 97 and 
98 of the Constitutional Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal lawmaker imposes an extra requirement on the central 
government. Judges must have at least 10 years standing at the 
bar of the province. Section 3 of the Judges Act deals more 
specifically with this additional requirement. The federal 
government therefore has considerable leeway in exercising its 
power to appoint judges. 
No other criterion limits its discretion regarding applicants' 
competency or qualifications.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As constitutional experts Henri Brun and Guy Tremblay pointed 
out in their book “Now that judicial independence has become a 
formal constitutional principle, one may wonder about the 
appropriateness of the process for appointing judges, 
particularly in the federal government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, I would be remiss if I did not repeat 
once again in this House that it is also out of respect for 
judicial independence that the Bloc Quebecois opposed, and 
continues to oppose, the reference on Quebec's right to be the 
only one to decide its future. By imposing its reference to the 
supreme court, the Liberal government is seriously jeopardizing 
that tribunal's credibility. 
It is sad to see the government stubbornly forcing supreme court 
justices to be part of its despicable intimidation tactics 
toward Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members opposite claim that their government is acting out 
of respect for the law, I am not convinced, far from it. In fact, 
I am convinced of just the opposite, particularly when I look at 
the statements made by the federal Minister of Justice and by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us go back to the legislation before us, Bill C-37, to 
take a good look at it and determine its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 
amends the Judges Act to, among other things, increase judges' 
salaries and change eligibility criteria for an annuity. The bill 
also establishes the judicial compensation and benefits 
commission. 
Finally, Bill C-37 seeks to increase the number of judges on 
appeal courts and provincial family courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her March 18 release, the Minister of Justice told us that 
the bill was in response to the recommendations of the 1995 
triennial commission on judges' salaries and benefits. In its 
report, the Scott commission—named after the chairperson of the 
group which conducted the review of judges' salaries—recommended 
a gradual salary increase of 8.3%. The Liberal government 
accepted the recommendation and is proposing in its bill a 4.1% 
annual increase, over a two-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In determining what was reasonable, the Scott commission 
recognized that a complex range of factors should be taken into 
consideration in setting an appropriate level of compensation, 
including the need to offer levels of compensation that will 
attract and keep candidates for the judiciary, and ensure that 
they are as highly qualified as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it should be noted that the report is based on the 
relationship that exists between the income of a judge and that 
of a lawyer from the private sector, from which, it must be 
said, the majority of candidates for the office of judge come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of the Judges Act now provides a legal mechanism by 
which a judge's salary may be increased, in accordance with the 
industrial aggregate, by a maximum of 7%. 
Under the Public Sector Compensation Restraint Act, judges' 
salaries were frozen in December 1992 until March 31, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the reference with respect to the independence and 
impartiality of Prince Edward Island provincial court judges.  In 
a September 18, 1997 ruling, the supreme court stressed the 
importance of such independent commissions, which establish an 
essential link between two of the government's arms, the 
executive and the judiciary.  The court also emphasized the 
constitutional obligation to determine the salaries of members of 
the judiciary.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court so stipulated, and the following quote is extremely 
important in understanding the context in which the Bloc examined 
Bill C-37.  The court found, and I quote: “However, to avoid the 
possibility of, or the appearance of, political interference 
through economic manipulation, a body, such as a commission, must 
be interposed between the judiciary and the other branches of 
government.  The constitutional function of this body would be to 
depoliticize the process of determining changes to or freezes in 
judicial remuneration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the justices of the supreme court, in order to 
avoid the possibility of political interference, the court is 
proposing the creation of an independent body that would 
depoliticize the decision to increase or not to increase 
justices' salaries and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc therefore is right to worry about the way the Liberal 
government appoints justices to the supreme court.  The justices 
have said themselves that there could be political interference 
through financial manipulation.  What about their own 
appointments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the flourish of the Prime Minister's pen, a lawyer could be 
comfortably installed in a judge's chair on the bench of the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  This is no fantasy.  We have seen it 
happen just recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the conventional and constitutional criteria of 
eligibility, there are no doubt certain criteria the Prime 
Minister alone could explain to us.  I will be careful not to 
head down this path. 
However, I would like the Prime Minister to list the criteria 
that guided him in appointing two justices to the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there is room for political interference in the 
remuneration of justices.  There is certainly room for it in the 
appointment of justices, especially when the judges are 
appointed sub judice by the party initiating the reference to the 
supreme court in the matter of the future of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, less financial aspect of the function of a justice, 
although important, was not analyzed by the court, and we will 
limit ourselves naturally to the part on salaries, benefits and 
pensions relating to Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the recommendations of the Scott commission are not 
binding on the government, the same cannot be said for 
constitutional decisions of the supreme court, and the Bloc 
Quebecois is keenly aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, despite the arguments I have advanced since the 
beginning of my speech, the Bloc Quebecois wants the House to 
know that it will not be supporting this bill for several 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is important to look at Bill C-37 in context.  The bill 
is proposing many amendments to the Judges Act.  These amendments 
include a salary increase of 4.1% annually over two years.  As I 
mentioned earlier, this increase would give effect to a 
recommendation by the Scott commission that a progressive salary 
increase of 8.3% would be justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Bloc Quebecois decries the fact that the Scott 
report is based solely on indices of federal economic activities 
with no regard for the economic sectors most affected since the 
beginning of the 1993 cutbacks, some of which were the work of 
the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As lawmakers, as elected officials living in a period of 
budgetary restraint, the most fundamental question we must ask 
ourselves in 1998 is therefore the following:  Should we be 
putting books in our schools, or beds in our hospitals, or 
increasing the salaries of judges which, it should be remembered, 
stand at around $155,800 annually for superior court judges?  To 
ask the question is to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $155,800 salary of a superior court judge is hardly a 
starvation wage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its leader, the member for Laurier—Saint-Marie, the Bloc 
Quebecois recently stated its views on salary increases for MPs 
and senior public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabled on January 31, the Blais report, which looked at the 
salaries and benefits of members of the House, recommended that 
parliamentarians' expense allowances be abolished and their 
parliamentary allowances increased by an equivalent taxable 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we must not forget is that this report did not 
recommend any increase in the total value of MPs' compensation. 
The proposals focussed solely on making this compensation more 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, whether one is a superior or lower court judge, an 
MP, a minister or the Prime Minister himself, we all have an 
extremely important role to play in the democratic system of 
Canada and of Quebec, and I sincerely believe that no one should 
be getting any increases if Canada or Quebec cannot afford them 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois endorsed the recommendations of the Blais 
report, stating its view that an increase in MPs' salaries was 
not justified at this time.  The same goes for superior court 
judges.>Paradoxically, the President of the Treasury Board, a good 
Liberal, recently announced an increase in the salaries of senior 
federal government managers, increasing the budget envelope by 
7.96% between 1998 and 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the view of the Liberal government, the increase is justified 
by the exodus of senior managers for the private sector and the 
dearth of experienced and qualified managers that would result. 
It is great for those that remain, who are extremely competent, 
to hear that, if they are not paid enough, the good ones leave. 
Some encouragement for those who stay.  But this is the 
explanation offered by the Treasury Board president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the salaries they are paid, and the associated benefits, 
these public servants are hardly to be pitied either, in my view. 
Yet, the President of the Treasury Board raised their salaries, 
but this raise did not affect superior court justices, and that 
is why the government decided to introduce Bill C-37, among 
others.  As I understand it, this bill is in response to a 
decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, and as responsible 
legislators, as I was saying earlier, we have to respond to the 
remarks of the justices in their decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now take a look at what happens in this area, in Quebec, 
among other places.  I am a member from Quebec.  I am going to 
talk to you about my country, Quebec, about what is being done in 
Quebec in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release dated February 20, 1998, the Quebec justice 
minister, Serge Ménard, announced the appointment of the members 
of the committee on the remuneration of justices of the court of 
Quebec and municipal courts. 
While this is a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada through 
a reference to it, Quebec responded with its usual 
professionalism and speed to a decision by this court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this commission has the mandate to evaluate the 
remuneration of justices, clearly the government is not obliged 
to accept its recommendations.  Indeed, the Quebec government or 
governments in general must be able to assess the economic 
context of any recommendation to increase salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that, on March 22, 1997, the Quebec 
government passed a bill which aimed to reduce labour costs in 
the public sector and which implemented the agreements concluded 
in this regard.  It provided that the salaries of Quebec court 
judges would be cut by 2.3%. 
There was no mention in this legislation, as there is in Bill 
C-37 of a salary increase.  In Quebec, legislation was passed to 
reduce the salaries of the provincial magistrates by 2.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need we point out that this reduction also applied to the premier 
of Quebec, to all the provincial ministers, to all the MNAs and 
to all the employees of the Quebec government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the entire private sector has been or will be called 
upon to contribute to the deficit reduction effort. It is a 
matter of solidarity, as Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard so aptly 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going through difficult times of restraint due, to a 
large extent, to federal cuts to transfer payments to the 
provinces. Everyone must do his or her share to help balance the 
budget. Again, whether one is a judge sitting on a court, a 
member of Parliament, the Prime Minister, a minister, the speaker 
or deputy speaker of the House, I think that everyone must 
contribute to balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the federal government has finally achieved its 
zero deficit, but must I remind you that this objective was 
achieved on the backs of the provinces and the unemployed. 
Over the course of two mandates, the Liberal government opposite 
will have cut $42 billion in social transfers to the provinces. 
These transfers are used to fund hospitals, higher education and 
social assistance among other things. Any money the federal 
government takes away from the provinces is money the provinces 
cannot invest in hospitals, education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is spending the money thus saved to 
increase its visibility, while the provinces are left with the 
dirty job of implementing the cuts. The Liberal government must 
not start squandering the taxpayers' money. 
Accordingly, while the Minister of Justice may want to be nice 
to judges by increasing their salaries, she should instead 
convince her colleague, the Minister of Finance, to give back the 
money cut from transfer payments to the provinces for health, 
social assistance and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not question the fact that judges play 
an essential role and that they work hard to create a just and 
fair society. However, we feel that before increasing judges' 
salaries, certain other priorities should be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think that the state of judicial independence in 
Canada and in Quebec requires that Bill C-37 provide an 8.2% 
increase, over a two-year period, to superior court judges. These 
are prestigious positions and, to my knowledge, no appointee was 
ever forced to accept the job. 
There is no arm twisting required to appoint a judge. When a 
person agrees to become a judge, whether on the supreme court, 
the federal court, the superior court or other Quebec courts, 
surely that person knows about the salary that goes with the job 
and accepts it. The government must not introduce a bill such as 
this one under the pretence that judges are not adequately paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to 
increasing judges' salaries. We support the establishment of an 
independent commission, but we cannot support a lack of 
solidarity and vision in an economic context where the fight 
against the deficit was conducted mostly at the expense of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the government say that the most qualified lawyers must 
be interested in becoming judges. 
But a magistrate is also part of society, and being part of 
society means bearing part of the collective burden.  Even if the 
federal deficit is eliminated, as we have seen, the $500 billion 
debt remains to haunt us.  It will continue to haunt us for many 
years and many generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the money we are preparing to inject into this salary hike 
for judges and magistrates, the government could have enabled the 
provinces to invest in their hospitals, where they feel the money 
would be put to better use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supplementary estimates tabled last Wednesday also indicate 
that the Canadian unity group at Justice—within the Department of 
Justice there is a so-called Canadian unity group, the main 
responsibility of which is the reference to the Supreme Court—is 
costing Canadian and Quebec taxpayers $700,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such expenditures are unacceptable.  This money could pay for a 
number of hospital beds. Especially since the Minister of 
Justice herself has said that the reference was of no use 
whatsoever to clarify the constitutionality of the potential 
secession of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ought to re-examine its budget priorities. Should 
it raise judges' salaries and spend a fortune on a reference to 
the Supreme Court, which even the Minister of Justice admits is 
of no use and whose validity is being challenged left and right, 
or should it hand over all these millions, these billions even, 
appropriated from the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am therefore asking the Minister of Justice to withdraw 
her bill as drafted and instead to compensate the provinces for 
the unjust cuts her government and herself have forced upon the 
governments of each and every province.  In our opinion, because 
Bill C-37 was introduced in the House subsequent to the Supreme 
Court of Canada ruling on this important matter of appointing 
justices, the Minister ought not to be giving the judges such a 
gift during these difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants the support of the Bloc Quebecois, it 
must limit its actions to striking what the Supreme Court ruling 
calls for, a Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission, as 
provided for in clause 6 of the bill.  Nowhere in the Supreme 
Court ruling is there a request that the federal government 
increase the salaries of superior court justices in this way. 
On the contrary, the supreme court ruling asks the Canadian 
government and all provincial governments to establish a 
commission that would rely on various external, objective factors 
in determining compensation.  The supreme court judges never said 
that the decision of such a commission would be binding on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us in the House was elected in a general election or a 
by-election.  The government was also elected.  The Minister of 
Justice was elected to administer as fairly as possible.  In 
handing down such a ruling, the judges never thought that the 
increase would be given automatically, with judges receiving 
increases when no one else did.  Judges are not above everyone 
else. 
It is each one of us, all taxpayers in Canada and Quebec, who, 
indirectly, pay the salaries of judges of the superior court, 
or, in Quebec's case, of family, criminal or youth courts.  Each 
one of us pays for these judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the public were to be asked, the answer would be immediate. 
If you were to ask the average citizen:  “Do you agree that the 
judges of the superior court, who are earning only $155,800 a 
year, should have their salaries increased by 8.2%?”  The answer 
will obviously be no.  Is $155,800 a starvation wage?  Do they 
not earn enough to hand down fair rulings?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a lawyer myself.  Before coming here, I was a practicing 
lawyer and often had to deal with judges. 
I was frequently in court.  One must keep one's distance from 
judges, but no one who had accepted the office of judge ever 
told me that they were surprised to be earning only $150,000 for 
the honour.  We all know how federal judges are appointed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my office in Joliette, my articling supervisor received a call 
from the then Minister of Justice, a Progressive Conservative. 
The telephone rang, and it was the Minister of Justice.   He 
said:  “Hello, Mr. Justice” as if he had no idea that he had been 
seeking such an appointment for years.  That is how these things 
are done.  But when he said “Yes, Mr. Minister” he knew what a 
judge earned, and he accepted the appointment.  I think that, 
nowadays, neither judges nor the Prime Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. member for Bourassa 
on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, the measures and the strategies 
of the previous Conservative government have nothing to do with 
the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member would like to 
participate in the debate later on, but as he will recognize, 
this is a point of debate and not of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Bourassa is 
partly right.  The Liberals are not operating at all like the 
Conservatives.  They are worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never did the Conservative government—and I am not a 
Conservative, I have no ties to this party—never did it appoint 
during proceedings two judges, who are deciding on the reference 
regarding Quebec's right to secede.  This Liberal government, 
for considerations known only to the Prime Minister, appointed 
two judges during the course of proceedings.  No Conservative or 
other government has ever done such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the criteria that might have guided the Prime 
Minister in making these two appointments.  That is inadmissible. 
I think the member made this comment without really thinking 
about what he was saying and without considering the history of 
the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, if I were to give the Minister of Justice some advice, 
if she appears concerned about the independence of the judiciary 
and especially her image, she should introduce a bill in this 
House to amend the process for appointing justices to the supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is something much more important than the pay or 
benefits of justices and that is the principle of the source of 
our confidence in judges—their training—which is vital in a 
democratic system of justice.  I believe very sincerely that the 
Minister of Justice should listen to these comments and 
particularly to the proposals of the Bloc Quebecois on 
appointments to the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we would perhaps have a much fairer system, as far as the 
judges of the Supreme Court of Canada among others were 
concerned, if the Liberal government had taken advantage of the 
two opportunities it had to put in place a transparent process 
for appointing these judges. It preferred, as it often does, or 
to put it more accurately, always does, to play politics.  It 
went looking for candidates among the ranks of the Liberal Party. 
Of course, they were all perfectly qualified to be supreme court 
judges, I am not suggesting otherwise.  I have great respect for 
the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, however, that it would have helped the Supreme Court of 
Canada tremendously, and especially those selected by the Prime 
Minister for these positions, to have had a much more open 
system of appointment, in which the House or a parliamentary 
committee could have taken part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made several suggestions.  The government has often told us, 
both when we were in the official opposition and today in our 
role as the third party, that we never make suggestions and that 
we are not constructive.  Yet, on more than one occasion, we made 
some very important suggestions as to how judges should be 
appointed that even had the support of eminent jurists in Quebec 
and in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many journalists backed up our suggestions for an appointment 
system, and, at her earliest opportunity, the minister should 
introduce a bill for making the judicial appointment process as 
transparent as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we will be voting against Bill C-37.  We 
will do so not because we oppose the often fantastic and very 
professional work that judges do, but out of a concern for 
equity, solidarity, greater fairness for all.  I do not think 
that today is the time to give a raise to judges, either judges 
of the superior court, or judges reporting to the National 
Assembly or the provincial legislatures, when, the premier, 
ministers and  members of the National Assembly and public 
servants saw their 
salaries cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the bill has to do, in large part, with this issue, 
the House will understand that we will be voting against Bill 
C-37. We call on the Minister of Justice to go back to the drawing 
board, to be more realistic, and to realize that the public is 
against any bill that would increase judges' salaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to rise today to address Bill C-37 on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party. I read this bill with some 
interest. As I went through it, it could not help but remind me a 
bit of my own family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my grandfather came to this country from Italy he was very 
proud of a sauce he made.  As hard as he tried to pass the recipe 
on to his children, he would on a regular basis taste their sauce 
and he would say that they got a little bit of it right and a 
whole lot of it wrong. As I look at this bill I see that the 
Minister of Justice got a little bit of it right but forgot a 
whole lot of ingredients that might have made this bill worth 
supporting in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with the few ingredients she got right.  It is 
important to note there are to be some changes which will allow 
certain parts of the legislation to be treated as matrimonial 
assets that could be divisible upon separation or divorce by the 
judiciary.  That needed to be done in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also helpful to have a unified family court.  In the 
province I come from many people have been very frustrated at the 
way the family court process works.  They have to appear before 
provincial family court judges to deal with essentially custody, 
access, division of property and maintenance provisions. Then 
they have to appear before federal court judges to deal with the 
same issues. To repeat them all over again is a duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those issues, the creation of unified family courts and of 
justices that can deal with those matters, as well as the 
division of annuities and so on are some of the positive aspects 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the minister could have taken the opportunity to 
truly address the concerns Canadians have about the way judges 
are appointed in this country.  There is some reference in the 
bill to a commission.  I believe the bill makes a recommendation 
that a commission be set up.  The commission would be composed of 
three individuals.  One would be appointed by the Minister of 
Justice and one would be appointed by the judiciary. Then those 
two individuals would appoint a third member to review judges' 
benefits and salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an opportunity to go further with this legislation. 
There was an opportunity to open up the way judges are appointed. 
A special committee or a subcommittee of the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights could have been set up to review 
different proposals to see how the judiciary might better be 
appointed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with this minute change, it does not go far enough.  The 
minister could have added to this commission a representative of 
the Canadian Bar Association.  Nobody knows better the workings 
of the courts and the workload of judges than many of the lawyers 
who appear in front of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a missed opportunity here.  It is a golden opportunity 
for the Minister of Justice to address some fundamental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have commented on the Young Offenders Act and 
on young people in the courts.  Young people appear before judges 
every day.  Families appear before judges every day. Those people 
have to ask how the people who make such fundamental decisions on 
guilt or innocence, on custody or access arrived at such an 
important position of making such decisions on people's lives. It 
is unfortunate that Canada's history is a legacy of patronage 
appointments, appointments to the bench of people who may not 
have the best legal qualifications and the best legal judgment 
but who support the right party.  There is some relief in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Nova Scotia there are many Liberal lawyers who 
in the last few days have seen their chances for judicial 
appointments recede into the mist as Nova Scotians have made 
fundamental political changes in their province. When the New 
Democratic Party takes power in that province, I expect there 
will be a change in the method of appointing judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an opportunity to address those concerns. It was also 
an opportunity to look at the crisis in the justice system. If 
money can be found to increase the salaries of judges, surely 
that money could be better directed to the very system which is 
in crisis right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many provinces in Canada crown attorneys do not have 
sufficient resources to prosecute the crimes that come before 
them.  In many parts of this country legal aid lawyers do not 
have sufficient resources to ensure proper fundamental freedoms 
are met and that trials are done in a proper way.  That results 
in injustice for all, for the accused, for the victims and for 
those involved in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than give those who are among the wealthiest in our 
society an increase of 8% or more, we could look at funnelling 
that money back into the provinces through the Canada health and 
social transfer payments.  These have been cut so drastically by 
the government the result of which has been the very crisis in 
the courts which has caused the judiciary to say it is 
overworked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice talk about the backlog of cases in provinces like 
Ontario.  I know she is talking about civil cases but civil cases 
include family cases.  Many people, in particular women, cannot 
afford legal representation when their marriages come undone, 
when there are questions of custody and there are backlogs of 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nova Scotia legal aid offices have stopped representing 
people who are seeking divorces because they simply do not have 
the resources to fulfil that role.  They have stopped 
representing people in civil cases who do not have the funds or 
the ability to hire private lawyers.  The provincial government 
says it does not have the money.  It has cut back on resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not just happening in Nova Scotia.  When I was 
practising law in that province, I tried to get hold of a legal 
aid lawyer in Ontario and it was almost impossible to find one. 
When I tried to get hold of a legal aid lawyer in New Brunswick 
to represent a woman in a custody fight whose children had been 
taken, there was one family law lawyer for almost the whole 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis at the grassroots level in Canada's justice 
system. 
Instead of addressing that, instead of providing funding which 
might better address that issue, the Minister of Justice has 
decided to give the judges a pay increase.  That is the third 
problem with this piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not go far enough in terms of addressing 
the way judges are appointed.  It does not address the flaws in 
the justice system that are creating the overburden in the 
courts.  It does not help the crown attorneys and the defence 
lawyers who have to operate in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have to look further at the other public 
servants who are involved in the justice system.  There has not 
been an increase for the average cop on the beat for so long that 
he or she probably cannot remember. There has not been an 
increase for those who work in the prison system, for those who 
work in the probation offices with young offenders, with the 
people who are coming out of prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is very little money for alternate forms of punishment and 
alternate forms of dispute resolution in the family law areas, 
the civil law areas and the criminal law areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those people for the last number of years have toiled 
with an ever increasing workload and fewer resources and without 
any kind of pay increase whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply unfair to provide the judiciary with an increase of 
8% when they already make well over $120,000 or $130,000. It is 
unfair to provide them with an increase when those who hold the 
system together and who do much work in the system are suffering 
because they have had such an increased workload and have had no 
increase in resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another thing which is lacking from this piece of 
legislation. It is another area the Minister of Justice might 
very well have addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that judges are not important.  In fact, this 
government has increased the workload on many of the provincial 
court judges by downloading on the system, by changes to the 
Criminal Code, by proposed changes involving things like 
preliminary inquiries. The government has downloaded on to the 
provincial judiciary taking work away from the federally 
appointed judges.  It has created more backlog in the provincial 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the appropriate way to address the system.  The 
minister had a golden opportunity.  Everyone in this House who 
has spoken on this piece of legislation, my colleagues in every 
party, have called for a review of the method of the appointment 
of judges.  That is what we are hearing from our constituents. 
That is what the Minister of Justice is not hearing. However, its 
time will come and it may come when we have another party 
governing on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to a crisis in the justice system, if people do not 
believe that judges truly represent impartiality, then they are 
not going to have respect for the justice system. That leads to 
cynicism.  It leads to a lack of faith.  The minister may well 
say that she has no choice, that she is bound in trying to keep 
the independence of the judiciary, that she is bound by the Scott 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those recommendations provided the minister with a way to not 
necessarily implement the recommendations.  As long as she could 
explain that to the public, as long as there was a reason given 
not to implement those recommendations which was justifiable, 
then they did not have to be implemented. The reasons we have 
indicated would provide the minister with some substantial 
grounds and certainly with public approval had she chosen not to 
implement the recommendation of the increase in salary but had 
offered instead to overhaul the entire Judges Act, to open it up 
to the standing committee on justice for a proper review and to 
make fundamental recommendations and fundamental changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons we will not be supporting the legislation.  It 
is too bad the opportunity has been squandered but we look 
forward to better days ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure the hon. member would agree with me.  I was listening to his 
speech. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT61"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT61"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this before in the House of Commons and I will say 
it again.  The primary purpose of a judge is to bring decisions 
that are a benefit to this country and that meet the needs of the 
people of this country.  That is what it was in the very 
beginning.  That is what it should be today.  That does not 
happen all that often. I wonder if the member would agree with 
that statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, being a lawyer I would like to know his comments with 
regard to Justice Frank Iacobucci saying that the legal 
profession's growing preoccupation with making money is a 
problem. Laws have become more of a business profession than a 
professional calling.  Lawyers are losing sight of their 
obligations to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we have an individual who has been charged with 
drunk driving causing fatality, which can bring a sentence of up 
to life.  He immediately plead guilty following the accident. 
That accident was in 1996.  He plead guilty to causing four 
deaths.  Can the hon. member explain to me any reason why this 
trial should be in court for the 18th time next month? They have 
not got around to sentencing that individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are actually three 
questions.  I will attempt to answer each one of them in the time 
allotted to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose asked is it not the job of 
the judge to make decisions in the best interests of the country. 
In essence, as I see it, it is the job of the judge to weigh very 
carefully the competing arguments and the evidence in front of 
him of her and to try and best find a just result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge or the justice has to be free from political 
considerations. In the case of an appeal it would be a panel. 
Sometimes it may appear that he or she is making a decision that 
goes against what the population at large might want. The 
distinction between the judiciary and legislature is well known. 
It is not the job of the judiciary to make popular decisions. 
That is very dangerous.  That is what happens south of the border 
in some states where the judiciary is elected.   What we have 
then is a judge perhaps not making a just decision but playing to 
what the public opinion polls indicate he should do.  A just 
decision, well written, well reasoned and explained to the public 
would avoid the concern the hon. member raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his second point on the comments of Justice Iacobucci, it was 
mentioned earlier that one of the reasons salaries for judges are 
so high is they want to make sure they can draw good people from 
the law benches.  They look at the salaries of private lawyers. 
There is a fault in that reasoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the best legal minds in this country and many of the 
best lawyers in this country are in the public service. They do 
not make nearly the salaries those in the private sector make. 
The average public defender in this country, the average employee 
of the justice department does not get paid the same as those in 
private practice.  I concur with some of the comments of the 
justice in that many young members of the bar are finding it 
incredibly difficult to meet the billing hours as we race toward 
profit margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, many members of the bar I know in private 
practice have served their communities well, have served their 
bar societies well, have taken time from their practice to be 
involved in public and volunteer organizations. Many do work on a 
pro bono basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately in this race to profit, for those who might be 
served on a pro bono basis where the private lawyer does the work 
for free, their file falls to the bottom which underscores the 
need for a public legal aid system across this country that is 
properly funded and can meet the needs of all individuals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question is one that I have not heard all the facts 
on.  I am not suggesting the hon. member would mislead me.  I do 
not know the facts of the case.  I do not understand why an 
individual who plead guilty in 1996 would be before the courts 18 
times.  It sounds incredible to me and I do not know all the 
facts and so I do not think it would be appropriate for me to 
make a decision in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act and other 
consequential acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 is the government's response to the last triennial 
commission on judges' salaries and benefits, the Scott 
commission.  Since 1981 Parliament has provided for an 
independent commission to examine judges' salaries and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 is also responding to the Supreme Court of Canada's 
independent decision on judicial compensation.  On September 18, 
1997 the Supreme Court of Canada released a key decision 
relating to the constitutional requirements of financial security 
of judges.  That decision reinforced the principle of judicial 
independence and outlined the broad constitutional requirements 
for the determination of judicial compensation such as there must 
be an independent, objective and effective commission that makes 
recommendations on all aspects of judicial compensation, salaries 
and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be independent the commission members must be appointed for a 
fixed term and the judiciary must nominate at least one member. 
To be objective the commission must use objective criteria in 
coming to its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be effective the government must deal with recommendations 
with due diligence and reasonable dispatch.  Bill C-37 proposed 
amendments to the Judges Act that will, following the Supreme 
Court decision, improve the independence, the objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the salary and benefits commission process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the principles of Bill C-37, there is very little we 
can disagree with.  The bill establishes new rules for an 
independent commission which has the responsibility to review the 
salaries and benefits of judges every four years.  These rules do 
seem to ensure in a certain way that the system is equitable and 
reflects reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the PC Party of Canada has concerns is in the way these 
new proposals will be implemented.  As parliamentarians we must 
ensure that the commission will be accountable to Parliament and 
that the process will be transparent.  On accountability, the 
membership of the commission should not become once again an 
opportunity for patronage by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 26 of the Judges Act, before the amendments proposed in 
Bill C-37, requires that the minister of justice appoint the 
whole commission, which means all three to five members.  The new 
provisions certainly improve that situation.  While one of the 
three members will be appointed by the minister of justice, we 
are encouraged by the provision which makes the other member 
appointed by the judiciary.  Together the two members will 
appoint a third member as the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question has to be raised here in favour of improving the 
accountability and transparency process.  Why not have the one 
member nominated by the minister appointed instead by a committee 
of the House, such as the standing committee on justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a process would not only improve the transparency but also 
avoid patronage appointments.  It also appears that Bill C-37 is 
addressing the important question of transparency.  The 
commission will have to report at regular intervals, which 
encourages an open process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's report with its recommendations has to be 
presented to the Minister of Justice who in turn has to table it 
in the House of Commons within 10 sitting days after having 
received it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly playing in favour of accountability but a 
question should be raised in the interest of further 
transparency.  Why not make the commission accountable directly 
to Parliament?  If the report has to be made available to both 
houses why not then eliminate going through the minister?

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, government Bill S-5 which the standing committee on 
justice has just completed studying provides for the human rights 
commission to report directly to Parliament instead of the 
minister.  If this can be done for the human rights commission, 
why not do it for the commission on judges' salaries and 
benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By reporting to both houses, the commission would be more 
accountable and more transparent than if it has to report to the 
minister first.  Furthermore, the standing orders of the House of 
Commons provide for the report to be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights which completes the public 
request on transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the amendments pertaining to the salary 
commission, improvements have been made but we could do more in 
order to have more accountability and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 supports the creation and expansion for unified family 
courts across Canada.  Bill C-37 will appoint 27 new federal 
judges for unified family courts in four provinces.  We welcome 
these amendments as they will permit the improvement of legal 
services given to families and help the provinces direct more 
resources to the courts and the services themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-37 provides for some changes in the criteria for 
supreme court judges to retire with a full pension.  Judges will 
now have to be 65 years of age or older and have served for at 
least 10 years.  The PC Party of Canada does not have any problem 
with these proposals.  The bill could be improved further on 
certain provisions dealing with accountability and transparency. 
The commission could report directly to the House of Commons 
improving its accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one member of the commission appointed by the minister could 
instead be appointed by a committee of the House of Commons, 
improving its transparency and avoiding the possibility of 
patronage.  We will be raising these points in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are encouraged by the provisions contained in 
Bill C-37.  We are prepared to support it in principle at second 
reading.

would like to ask my distinguished colleague for some additional 
explanations concerning clause 26, which would create a three- to 
five-member commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated that, if there were three members, one would be 
appointed by the Minister of Justice, one by the judiciary, and 
the third by the first two, in other words, those appointed by 
the Minister of Justice and the judiciary.  If there were four or 
five, what would be procedure be? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the idea here is to make the 
system as transparent and as accountable as possible and the way 
the judges would be chosen if it could be done through the 
process of having nominations from all aspects of the system in 
place would make it more so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I first of all wish to convey to the House that a very 
good maritimer just stood and gave a speech.  We know he is not 
feeling very well today and our party gives credit to him for 
hanging in there and being a real trooper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is with regard to the pay scales of judges in those 
positions.  Would he not agree, being in support of the bill, 
that other people in other aspects of the public service such as 
PSAC workers should be seriously looked at for pay increases too? 
They have been waiting an awful long time for pay increases as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my position is very clear on 
pay equity and PSAC. Pay equity is something that should be 
resolved. There is no question about that.  However, people in 
judges' positions come from situations whereby they could earn a 
lot more money in the private sector and they have to be 
compensated fairly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be afforded the opportunity to speak today to Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to deal with four specific topics:  first, 
the issue of the pay raise for our judges; second, the issue of 
the establishment of a judicial compensation and benefits 
commission; third, the Judges Act itself; and fourth, a 
particularly troublesome definition within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the pay raise I must state how disappointed I 
am.  Once again we witness this government going to great lengths 
to look after what some might refer to as the upper class or the 
elite of our society.  At the same time, what is it doing for the 
ordinary citizens other than taxing them into the ground? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks ago this government announced pay increases for 
the executive levels of the civil service.  Those who occupy the 
upper echelons of our civil service were well looked after. 
Meanwhile, those in the trenches, the clerks and receptionists 
who form the first line of contact between the government and its 
citizens, are again expected to do without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to illustrate my point with a specific example from 
my own community of Surrey, British Columbia.  When this 
government provided pay increases to the executive levels of the 
civil service it included the person who we in Surrey might refer 
to as our chief of police, even though he is with the RCMP and 
they do not use that title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Superintendent Terry Smith, the officer in charge of the 
Surrey detachment, the largest in the country, came within the 
qualifications for a raise in pay.  In fact all chief 
superintendents, assistant commissioners, deputy commissioners, 
as well as the commissioner himself received raises in pay.  The 
constables and the corporals did not.  Those men and women 
charged with keeping our communities safe were passed over.  It 
was not until this past Friday that the lower ranks obtained 
raises in pay after a five year freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this raise came about primarily as a result 
of the leadership shown not by the government, but by the upper 
management of the RCMP itself.  Chief Superintendent Smith and 
his colleagues, to their credit, had refused to accept their pay 
raises until those in the lower ranks received the long overdue 
and much needed increase in salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with Chief Superintendent Smith on several 
occasions and he has expressed concern over significant staffing 
problems within the Surrey detachment.  If he has a problem, then 
the citizens of my community definitely have a problem.  If my 
constituents have a problem, then it is my duty to bring it to 
the attention of those who are in a position to do something 
about it, namely the officials of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that experienced members of the RCMP are 
leaving the force in droves.  They are being lured away by other 
police departments.  The Vancouver Police Department and the 
Calgary Police Service are just two of the organizations which 
have been quite eager to obtain fully trained and experienced 
RCMP officers.  In Vancouver an RCMP member can leave the force on 
Friday, start with the Vancouver Police Department on Monday and, 
in effect, receive a $5,000 a year raise.  Some go to the special 
investigations unit of the Insurance Corporation of British 
Columbia and some go to B.C. Transit.  Indeed, the Surrey 
detachment just recently lost a much respected and experienced 
member to the Municipal Bylaw Enforcement Department, one 
presumes for better pay, better hours and in all likelihood 
significantly less stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Superintendent Smith is plagued with almost perpetual 
vacancies.  He is forced to fill positions with either raw new 
recruits or with personnel of lesser experience.  In fact, when 
last we spoke he estimated that between 25% and 28% of Surrey's 
finest were rookies.  That has the effect of reducing the overall 
efficiency of the detachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regularly go on ride-alongs and I can assure members that it 
is not an easy community to police, partly because Surrey has one 
of the poorest if not the poorest police-to-resident ratios in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does this leave the residents of Surrey, a large, 
sprawling, diverse municipality with both urban and rural aspects 
and a very large immigrant community?  Terry Smith has every 
reason to be concerned, as do my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of the lower mainland of British Columbia will tell 
everybody who wants to hear about it that it is the most 
desirable place in the country in which to live, primarily 
because of the climate, although we would never know it the way 
the weather has been here for the last few days.  However, there 
is a price to be paid, which is the high cost of living.  For 
that very reason it is well known within the RCMP establishment 
that the lower mainland is not an enviable posting.  Experienced 
police officers are not compelled to accept transfers to Surrey 
and they do not do so because it is just not a practical 
financial decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the RCMP rank and file receive after five years of 
waiting?  They received 2.75%.  They have to wait until next 
October to benefit from the whole package.  Even then they will 
still be approximately $3,000 behind their Vancouver 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compare the increase in pay received by the already well 
compensated judges with the increases afforded our RCMP officers. 
As I said, the Mounties get 2.75%, payable in increments, 
retroactive to January 1 of this year, while the judges get 4.1%, 
retroactive to April 1, 1997 and then get a further 4.1% 
compounded to their new 1997 salary figures, payable on April 1, 
1998.  They already receive, on average, in the vicinity of 
$140,000 per year.  The government seems to believe that it needs 
to retroactively come to the aid of these poor, financially 
strapped judges all the way back to April of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it come to the same conclusion when compensating our police 
officers?  No.  The government throws a few pennies at them, 
retroactive to January, gives them a few more pennies in April 
and then tells them to wait until October for the remainder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the violent crime linkage analysis system, or 
ViCLAS.  ViCLAS is a computer database developed by the RCMP, 
used to analyze, research and search out potential links between 
violent crimes.  It has the potential to save enormous amounts of 
investigative time and effort.  More important, since it targets 
serial killers and sex offenders, the potential to prevent future 
victims is invaluable.  Used by police forces throughout the 
world it has already been proven successful and is recognized as 
the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in speaking with E Division ViCLAS representatives, the 
project is in serious danger of going under due to lack of 
funding and inadequate staffing.  How ironic.  This is a world 
class crime solving and crime prevention tool originally 
developed by the RCMP, but the RCMP will not be able to use it. 
Why?  The government says it does not have the money, yet there 
appears to be plenty of money available to give judges a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government appears to have its priorities all out of sync. 
It falls over backwards to look after its friends, but fails to 
look after those who need it most.  It likes to talk about public 
safety and crime prevention, but it seems to have a difficult 
time putting its money where its mouth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the issue of the judicial compensation and 
benefits commission.  The government wants to set up yet another 
bureaucratic agency merely to concern itself with the salaries 
and benefits of judges.  I see, as well, that the governor in 
council will appoint this new commission.  The Minister of 
Justice gets to make another political patronage appointment.  It 
is just what this country needs, more patronage, more friends of 
the government to carry out governmental responsibilities without 
being accountable to the citizens of this country.  What we need 
is less patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we must establish a commission why is it not set up to 
conduct public hearings into judicial appointments?  Yes, it 
could also govern pay and benefits, all subject of course to 
parliamentary approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much is the judicial compensation and benefits commission 
going to cost Canadian taxpayers?  What do we get for this money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to appoint three people at, no doubt, fairly 
attractive salaries to carry out their duties.  They will be paid 
fees fixed by the governor in council.  In addition, they will be 
paid travel and living expenses which are also fixed by the 
governor in council.  There will be no parliamentary review or 
control of these salaries and fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  Under section 26.2 as proposed by the bill the 
commission may engage the services of any persons necessary for 
the proper conduct of the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are being asked to create a new agency of 
bureaucrats and provide them with all the financial resources to 
have others do the work for them.  There are obviously other 
portions of this bill which deserve comment, but my limited time 
will not permit me to discuss them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the third issue I mentioned at the 
beginning of my speech, the Judges Act itself.  This is the third 
time this act has been before the House in the last couple of 
years.  Bill C-2 was passed in March 1996.  Bill C-42 was passed 
in June 1996.  We now have the Judges Act back once again for 
amendment.  One must ask:  Was the previous minister of justice 
so incompetent that he had to bring the same legislation before 
the House twice within a matter of months?  Did he still not get 
it right as it is now back again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we do not have other acts of parliament like this.  I am 
sure Canadian people would not be too impressed if it came to 
their attention how much time and debate is devoted in this place 
just to our judges.  No wonder our country has a $600 billion 
debt.  In the last two years legislation regarding judges has 
been brought before the House three times.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must wonder about the misplaced priorities.  Maybe we should 
not be too surprised.  Last June, eight months ago, the Minister 
of Justice stated that the young offender legislation was her top 
priority.  We have not seen it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice promised almost two years ago to 
bring in victims' rights legislation.  This past summer the 
present Minister of Justice told Canadians that it was also one 
of her priorities.  Victims are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberals are certainly wasting no time in looking after 
the judges.  Imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the fourth issue.  As I mentioned earlier, 
a definition within the legislation causes me some difficulty. 
It appears at the first clause of the bill.  It amends section 2 
of the act to include the definition for surviving spouse.  What 
attracts my attention is that the definition of spouse is limited 
to a person of the opposite sex.  It seems to me that this 
Liberal government has gone to great ends to foist the whole 
issue of same sex benefits onto Canadians, but it would appear as 
though this legislation creates an exception for judges. 
Regardless of one's personal opinion, I have to ask why there 
seems to be one rule for judges and another rule for the rest of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason to be concerned with legislation which 
proposes to give judges an increase in pay.  Recent surveys have 
shown beyond a doubt that Canadians have lost confidence in the 
courts; not just the justice system, but the judiciary itself. 
That is extremely troubling.  Canadians are telling us that they 
have no faith in judges to uphold the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who will undoubtedly argue that people who say 
such things do not understand the system.  There is that elitism 
showing through again.  Certainly most citizens are unfamiliar 
with the intricacies and the vagaries of the justice system.  My 
goodness, I know lawyers who become confused.  What the public 
does understand, however, are dubious decisions which come from 
the bench, like decisions to sanction violent offenders by 
sending them home on conditional sentences.  Even the Alberta 
court of appeal was extremely critical of some of their peers in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about this one?  A man suspected in the kidnapping and 
forcible confinement of two young women while fleeing from the 
police attacks a third woman, puts a plastic bag over her head 
and wraps a length of wire tightly around her neck.  The judge 
ruled that this could not be viewed as an attempt to kill her. 
The man was eventually convicted of not only the initial offences 
but two murders in another province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians also understand are outrageous comments from the 
bench, comments suggesting that a three-year old child was 
sexually provocative, implying that she was in part responsible 
for an assault against herself; comments suggesting that rape is 
acceptable in some cultures; comments implying that the sexual 
assault of three young girls by their teacher was not as serious 
as the “buggery of little boys”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that most judges conduct themselves in an extremely 
responsible and thoughtful manner, but in this climate of public 
mistrust to grant our judiciary such a generous increase while 
other public servants receive nothing or a pittance at best 
merely invites more cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that note, I will end my comments on this legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
some ways I agree with my hon. colleague from the Reform Party, 
particularly on the issue of retroactive raises back to January 
1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a quick calculation, a supreme court justice earning 
$148,000 and getting a 4.1% increase would end up with about 
$6,000, or $120 a week, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visited a sugar bush operation in my riding on Sunday, a 
group of women told me their average wage was $240 for 37 hours. 
So the increase weekly to a justice would be about half of what 
these women are earning for 37.5 hours.  Four per cent of their 
$8 an hour makes 32 cents, but 4% of the justice's $148,000 makes 
$6,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that at any time in the history of mankind, a 
superior court justice has resigned because he was underpaid. I 
personally have never seen such a thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, when the time comes for a judge to be appointed, 
nearly all of the lawyers belonging to the party in power call 
upon their MP, or the minister, or the Prime Minister to remind 
him “Keep me in mind, it ought to be my turn for a court 
appointment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my distinguished colleague in the Reform 
Party. In order to make the Canadian judiciary a little more 
transparent, should we not add a clause to Bill C-37, precisely 
so as to facilitate appointments, to make them more transparent 
and to move away for once from a type of patronage comparable to 
what happens, for instance, in Senate appointments? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what can I say?  I 
mentioned in my speech that if the commission is to be appointed 
why do we not take a look to see if the commission could have 
something to do with reviewing or actually considering the 
appointments?  Of course this would be subject to approval of the 
House.  Whether the bill is the appropriate vehicle to put this 
clause into effect remains to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the whole process of appointments to the bench is now 
has left the public absolutely cynical.  Again I say it is not an 
appropriate time to give judges a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to add that the 4.1% is compounded in the 
second year, so we are looking at 8.3% by the time we are 
finished, which is considerably more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday an RCMP officer came into my constituency office.  He 
was exceptionally upset over the whole issue of pay raises. There 
had been quite a discussion at the police station about the issue 
of pay raises and how long they had been delayed.  He said there 
was a tremendous resentment over the fact that the raises were so 
very small:  2% retroactive to January 1, 1998; a second 
increment of 1% on April 1, 1998; and an additional .75% on April 
1, 1998.  Basically he was saying that this put him in a position 
of moving from $50,508 up to $52,423, but left him in 
approximately 11th position against all other police members 
throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing in mind what my colleague has just said, effectively the 
bill would give the judges an 8.3% increase over a two year 
period.  It creates greater disparity between those who are 
attempting to enforce the law, already having a serious morale 
problem because of their wages having been frozen for as long as 
they have been, with a very meagre increase and the judges, who 
in many cases do things that end up infuriating the police 
officers, with an 8.3% increase in a two year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member would agree the disparity that is being 
proposed by the Liberals simply should not stand.  It sets out 
the judges in this special case while Canada's finest, Canada's 
RCMP, is not going begging but is certainly getting the short end 
of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member would agree that this will lead to further 
morale and attitude problems on the part of the members of the 
RCMP who serve the country so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Yes, certainly, Mr. Speaker.  I can 
speak from my own experience with RCMP members in my community of 
Surrey, which as I said is the largest in the country.  There is 
a serious morale problem there.  I know a lot of the members 
personally.  They are very honourable people.  They will not let 
it affect their ability to perform the function we ask them to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a real serious problem is the bleeding of experienced 
RCMP members into other police forces and other businesses which 
give them better rates of pay and a definitely less stress 
related job, not to mention usually nine to five hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is definitely a morale problem now and I cannot see 
it getting anything but worse when they understand how much the 
judges are receiving as an increase.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
issue a challenge to the member for Surrey North.  If we were to 
take all the televisions and the condoms provided to prisoners, 
if we were to take all the bleach provided for their needles, if 
we were to take the money used in terms of their right to sue in 
legal challenges, if we were to take the money allocated for 
prisoners to safeguard their “right to vote”, and if we were to 
take the money the government is looking at currently spending in 
Bill C-37 with regard to raising the salaries of judges, how many 
extra police officers could we potentially hire? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if anyone has done a calculation.  I do not think 
anyone would question the idea that money spent on hiring more 
police officers to enforce the laws and to go after criminals 
would be better spent than on bleach, condoms, right to sue, 
right to vote, TV and raising the salaries of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to agree.  I 
honestly do not know how many more police officers could be 
hired.  I do not have a calculator handy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It spreads into other areas.  It is not just the question of 
salaries for the RCMP.  I alluded to the ViCLAS system for 
tracking sex criminals, violent offenders and repeat offenders. I 
have seen this program demonstrated to be very useful.  It cuts 
down the amount of time police spend investigating cases.  There 
is a serious potential that it could go under because of lack of 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should start getting their priorities straightened out on 
the other side of the House and decide where we have to spend the 
money for law enforcement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to raise another side to this question. 
Rural communities like those in Caribou—Chilcotin often do 
without police services because there is no money for budgets in 
the larger detachments.  I think of places with interesting names 
like Gold Bridge and Horsefly, but when there is a crisis in such 
communities it will be an hour or two hours minimum before 
policemen can respond after driving the distance to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been watching the government cut its expenditures.  The 
difficulty is that while frontline services are being cut senior 
bureaucrats and research people are finding more resources for 
their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member see a correlation between the increase in crime 
and the lack of necessary funds for policemen to meet this 
challenge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot say that I have 
seen a correlation because I have not actually seen the data.  My 
gut instinct tells me that there would be if we do not have 
police on the streets to deal with some of the crime we are 
seeing, especially in rural parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my speech on Bill C-16 I alluded to the difficulties the 
RCMP had in remote parts of Canada.  I know the Speaker likes to 
go to Whistler and knows how remote it can be up there.  I go to 
a place that is even further outside Vancouver than Whistler. If 
the Pemberton RCMP need me they have to drive an hour up a 
logging road to get me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some serious problems with policing in rural areas. 
Somebody had better get the idea straight as to where funds will 
be allotted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my duty at this time to rise and speak to the 
Judges Act, Bill C-37 at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because I am representing my constituents.  As they 
hear what is going on in this parliament, they are very 
concerned.  They feel that the emphasis of the government is not 
on law enforcement as it should be.  For example, in this act, as 
has always been the case, the government introduces amendments to 
an act of parliament which fall far short of the public's 
expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is objectionable not for what is in it but for what is 
not in it.  That is of major concern to the people in my riding 
of Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are more concerned about opening up the 
appointment process for judges.  The more judges use the charter 
of rights and freedoms to strike down parliament's laws, the more 
people want to have a say in what their judges actually think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have used this opportunity to open up the 
judicial process.  Right now it is an old boy's club with lawyers 
deciding behind closed doors who the best Liberal available is to 
get these plum patronage appointments to the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will oppose this bill on these grounds alone, even though 
there are a couple of positive aspects to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill increases the number of appeal court judges from 10 to 
13.  Hopefully this will help to move more cases through the 
appeal process and help move them through more quickly. Likewise, 
the increase in the number of unified family court judges from 12 
to 36 should help to deal with the huge backlog of family law 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of positive things in here.  Reform supports 
the use of family courts to resolve separation and custody 
disputes.  However, it is unfortunate that the divorce rate in 
Canada has soared to such proportions that we require so many 
more family court judges.  Liberalized divorce laws should be 
fixed first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Bill C-37 also increases judges' salaries 
retroactively from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998 by 4.1% and an 
additional 4.1% from April 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999.  Thereafter 
salaries will be reviewed by the newly created judicial 
compensation and benefits commission.  In other words, judges 
will get an 8.3% increase over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, judges are already making approximately 
$140,000 per year.  How many other public servants receive pay 
raises of 8.3% in a two year period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government awards judges and senior bureaucrats, including 
their own ministers, with large pay raises and bonuses while, 
comparatively, frontline police officers and low level public 
servants receive virtually no additional compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, March 27, 1998, RCMP officers secured a pay raise 
of 2% retroactive to January 1, 1998.  They will receive a second 
increment of 1% on April 1, 1998 and an additional 0.75% on 
October 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP officers have had their wages frozen for five years.  The 
starting salary for a third year constable will go from about 
$50,508 to $52,423.  This sends a clear message to the public 
that this government cares more about judges than it does about 
the frontline police officers who risk their lives to protect 
Canadians in service to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the key point.  These people are frontline.  They put 
their lives on the line to protect us.  They need the support of 
those judges but we need to properly compensate them. 
That should be our first priority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add this insult to the decisions by the government not to allow 
the amendments the police recommended to the DNA act. Add this 
insult to the government's ongoing expenditure of hundreds of 
millions on a universal gun registration which frontline police 
officers universally oppose. The Canadian Police Association even 
says register criminals before guns. That is where our priorities 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police get a slap in the face with a pay raise that does not 
compare to what judges will receive and the government also fails 
to give them the tools they need to do their job of improving 
public safety and saving lives. How many Canadian workers receive 
retroactive pay raises as the judges will receive?  Public 
servants, especially judges, should only be given salary 
increases in keeping with the average Canadian wage earner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also establishes the judicial compensation and 
benefits commission to inquire into the adequacy of the salaries 
and benefits for judges.  The creation of the judicial 
compensation and benefits commission provides the federal 
government with yet another opportunity to make patronage 
appointments.  The Reform Party wants to reform the patronage 
appointment process to make it more transparent and publicly 
accountable.  Meanwhile the Liberals create more opportunities to 
make patronage appointments.  That is going backwards.  That is 
not the direction things should be heading in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new patronage appointees will hold office for a term of 
four years and are eligible to be reappointed for one further 
term.  Fees for commission members will be fixed by the governor 
in council.  Members are deemed to be employed in the public 
service of Canada.  The commission may also engage the services 
of any person necessary for proper conduct of the commission 
begging the question just how much will this commission cost 
taxpayers.  We need to know before we go any further with this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third time the Liberals have amended the Judges Act. 
During the last Parliament in 1996 Bill C-2 and Bill C-42 were 
introduced, both nebulous, inconsequential, fuzzy pieces of 
legislation which were of little significance to Canadians who 
are concerned about their safety.  Canadians want violent crime 
to be curbed.  They do not want more of these judicial review 
types of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Liberal justice ministers have failed to introduce the 
victims bill of rights which has taken low priority on the 
justice committee's agenda.  They failed to substantially amend 
the Young Offenders Act.  They have failed to limit the use of 
conditional sentences for violent offenders. Instead they occupy 
the justice committee's time with these administrative matters at 
the expense of more important issues such as amending the laws 
pertaining to drinking and driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that this government got its priorities straight. The 
people know what is important.  This bill proves the government 
does not.  This bill does not contain what it should and 
therefore I do not support it.

<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
simply like to ask my colleague a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the difficulties raised by the very sensitive issue 
of salary increases, whether for MPs or judges.  This raises all 
sorts of questions with the public, perhaps legitimately so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he think that the Government of Canada could once again 
follow the lead of the Government of Quebec?  A few years back, 
the Quebec government decided to use the equivalent of a job 
category in the civil service. 
It was decided that all those with sensitive positions, such as 
MNAs or judges, would receive the same increase as that arrived 
at more objectively, through negotiations between the employer, 
the Government of Quebec in this case, and government union 
representatives.  This gives the whole proceeding an objective 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member think if such a procedure were to be used 
here in the Government of Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course I do not 
know all the details of what the process is in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that I am trying to make is that the people of Canada 
should have more direct input into what is happening in the 
judiciary.  They have the right to determine who those judges 
are.  They should not be patronage appointments.  They have the 
right to determine what those people are paid.  The people of 
Canada are fair.  They are the ones who should be determining 
what is happening here, not us as parliamentarians, especially 
the government using this as patronage appointments. I think I 
have made my point abundantly clear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there are a couple of points I would like to make by way 
of comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking in particular of one judgment I read recently, 
Delgamuukw, in which the justices referred not to legal 
precedents but to the literature from the law schools on which at 
least their judgment was based in part.  This means there is a 
divergence from the tradition of consolidating the law, referring 
to the law and using the law as the basis on which to build 
judgments. I am concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wish to raise comes out of today's Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> which has a headline:  “Judge scolds greedy 
lawyers”.  Mr. Justice Frank Iacobucci of the Supreme Court of 
Canada has said that many lawyers are rapidly losing sight of 
their obligations to the public and to the pursuit of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the influence of these lawyers who have lost 
this sight is also being lost on the courts.  Mr. Justice 
Iacobucci, to his credit, says that lawyers are not merchants of 
legal services but members of a calling dedicated to helping 
clients and improving society generally.  But he is concerned 
that there is a clear tendency for a lawyer to be a hired gun, as 
he says, in the promotion of the client's cause rather than an 
active and constructive participant in the course of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two points cause me concern which I add to the debate. I 
would like to ask my hon. colleague if he sees any relationship 
between the justices, their influence by the law schools, by the 
lawyers of the community of which they are a part and if this is 
part of the reason that these justices are being given these pay 
raises that perhaps other frontline bureaucrats and government 
workers are not entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member makes an 
excellent point.  I can only underline and underscore the 
importance of that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have a judiciary that is at arm's length to 
Parliament it will begin to become political and will be 
influenced by its political masters. That should not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the law schools and the influence they are having 
on the judiciary, that is becoming more and more commonplace. 
People have made predictions as to the decisions that will be 
coming down from the supreme court simply by reading the 
literature that is coming out of the law schools.  The judges are 
reading that literature, the commentary and the political 
correctness that is often associated with it, rather than looking 
at the merits of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need judges who are not political.  We need judges who are 
carrying out the will of the people in this country, who are 
concerned first and foremost with justice.  That is I think the 
point that the member was making and I agree with him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to change the nature of the question that I posed 
before because I have new information that I would like to add to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to take the costs of colour cable TV, free condoms, 
free bleach for needles, the right to sue and legal costs 
involved, the right to vote and the administrative and logistical 
costs involved, gun registration and the cost of patronage 
appointees the Liberals have put on the parole board, just those 
costs alone, would we not be able to spend more money on hiring 
more officers or more judges without the increased raises to get 
rid of the backlog in the courts?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose I could add 
to the list, the list of condoms, voting privileges, gun 
registration and all of the associated costs.  I could add the 
costs of the golf courses, the pool tables, the cable TV and I 
would be asking the government the very same that this member is 
asking me.  Would it not be better to put that money into law 
enforcement, putting police on the street where they are going to 
do a lot more good than to put it into what this government is 
putting it into?  That is the point that needs to be made over 
and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked on that gun registration issue a long time.  I examined 
it very thoroughly and if we look at the hundreds of millions of 
dollars being wasted in setting up a huge bureaucracy that will 
not make our lives any safer we would be asking the question why 
is that money not going into hiring more police.  I think this 
needs to be debated.  I see the government unfortunately avoiding 
this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listen very intently when Reform talks about more 
enforcement on the streets in order to make our streets safer.  I 
certainly do not want to debate that aspect with him but last 
night <I>60 Minutes</I> had a very good show on about enforcement 
and what to do with young people and young offenders when they 
are behind the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep hearing the hon. member say that more money should be 
spent on enforcement but would he not believe, or would he not be 
at least corrected, that actually more enforcement is just sort 
of the other approach to it and really more resources should be 
put into the education of young people so that they do not commit 
these crimes to which he is referring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
member broadening the picture.  I do not agree necessarily that 
more education is going to be the answer.  We have already made 
suggestions. In addition to putting more police on the street, we 
should not be hurting the family with legislation that is coming 
before this House and especially with taxation that is forcing 
both parents to work and allowing children to virtually fend for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more to the problem and I am glad the member has 
broadened this whole justice issue.  Yes, more police on the 
street would help but there are many other things that would help 
reduce the rate of crime in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to strengthen our families first.  That will do much 
more than trying to impose maybe some kind of an educational 
scheme on the whole country that does not fit.  I think we need 
to discuss this a lot more and I thank the member for raising it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-37.  It deals with the 
salary and the annuity benefits for our judges along with 
establishing a judicial benefits and compensation commission.  It 
also authorizes additional appeal court and unified family court 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that judges should get a raise and that the increases 
in the number of judges are probably justified according to the 
government's recommendations. 
We cannot always believe all the statistics, as was recently seen 
in the firearms act trial in Edmonton.  However I will believe 
them this time that we could use more family court judges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government's legislative actions should always reflect a 
consistent and fair approach to everyone in the public sector.  I 
agree that judges' pay should be set by an independent council. 
However their salaries are the ultimate responsibility of 
Parliament.  The setting of salaries can be delegated by the 
government but once again ultimate responsibility and 
accountability rests with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it hard to support this bill because judges are getting a 
much larger raise than those employees on the lower rungs of the 
public service who make $30,000 a year.  Public service employees 
will get maybe a 2% raise which is around $600 on $30,000. 
Previous governments have taken and the current federal Liberal 
government takes a very extremist view on these kinds of issues. 
They prefer to take care of the higher echelons and forget the 
little people who are trying to get pay equity and a better raise 
to feed their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The independent pay council is of concern to me.  I refer to it 
as independent but I do not think that is quite the word when I 
look at its make-up.  The council should be made up of more 
middle income people who could better reflect what the average 
person sees is a justifiable salary for judges. They would be 
more inclined to give raises in keeping with what the rest of 
society is collecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the gross amount paid.  Certainly judges 
have a very responsible job in society. A salary in the $140,000 
range is very acceptable.  It is the times that count. It is the 
percentage of the raise that the average person gets compared to 
the percentage of the raise that those in the upper strata of 
society get that is the problem.  I will probably get a question 
later on about members of Parliament on that issue and I feel the 
same way about members of Parliament.  We should not be setting 
ourselves above the average person who is struggling to make a 
living in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the judicial compensation and benefits 
commission.  Under section 26.1(1), one person will be nominated 
by the judiciary, one person will be nominated by the Minister of 
Justice and one chairperson will be nominated by the first two 
nominees.  If any member can convince me that is going to be an 
independent committee, I would like to have a long discussion 
with that member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we certainly do not need to appoint five people to 
sit on a committee to decide compensation.  Three is plenty. They 
are certainly going to be well compensated so costs will go up 
the more people we have on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the independence and fairness of this judicial 
compensation and benefits commission?  As was pointed out, it 
really is not.  As I said before, the patronage and payment of 
higher increases are more extremism on the part of the Liberals. 
They take care of their own and to heck with the little guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I agree that judges should get their raise.  The 
salaries of the commissioners who will sit on the independent pay 
commission, as I like to think of it, should not exceed $60,000 
to $80,000.  They too must understand what the average person is 
trying to get by on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of how the other two members could be appointed was 
dealt with a little bit by a Progressive Conservative member.  A 
case could be made for having one judge on this board to reflect 
the judges' view.  Maybe the government would even look at having 
the official opposition and maybe the second largest opposition 
party appoint the other two.  We might see a little independence 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on the surviving spouse situation.  In the 
annuity section, section 44(4) it is stated under subsection (5): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No annuity shall be granted under this section to the surviving 
spouse of a judge unless the surviving spouse 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  married the judge before the judge ceased to hold office; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  commenced cohabiting with the judge in a conjugal 
relationship before the judge ceased to hold office. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of good things. It will address these 
gold-digger marriages that happen to come along after the judge is 
out of office.  Also, in the definition under subsection (2), the 
surviving spouse has to have cohabited or have been married for a 
minimum of one year before the judge's death. That is a good part 
of the bill.  The surviving spouse definition confirms what is 
the law in Canada today, that a spouse is a person of the 
opposite sex and then it goes on to cohabitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total salary for all of the increases in the number of 
judges will have a significant impact on our judicial system.  I 
have made rough figures which indicate that the added judges will 
bring the total salary compensation up into the $5.5 million 
range associated with all the other expenses in setting up the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is certainly not cheap.  We do not want to try to get by 
on a real cheap court system but we do want to keep it 
reasonable. Salaries, particularly raises, should be in keeping 
with what the average Canadian gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government may want to consider the 
suggestions I had for this bill before it pushes the bill 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should amend the section dealing with appointment 
of members to the commission and to try to eliminate the 
patronage that will be going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment is to try to have the salary increases more 
in keeping with public sector pay raises.  Fairness is really 
important.  In court the judges tell us that not only does 
justice have to be done but it has to be seen to be done.  I 
think a lot of people would say that a $600 raise for a person at 
the low end and a $5,000 raise for the person at the high end in 
the salary scheme of things is not fair. The government should 
not be reflecting that type of unfairness to Canadians.

Offenders Act.  Not only do we see it before changes to the Young 
Offenders Act, but we see it before changes to section 745, the 
faint hope clause.  There is also a backlog in our court system. 
If there is a backlog in our court system, surely the money would 
have been better allocated to hire more judges to take care of 
the backlog rather than to pay the judges more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on the lack of 
priorities of the Liberal government on criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am always pleased 
to continue on with the facts on a bill and the fact that the 
government tends to waste a lot of money and does not have its 
priorities straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the issues my hon. friend raised, we also have a 
serious street gang problem.  There is organized crime. 
Pedophiles are out on the streets.  Some jails are filled to 
overflowing. Priorities are all around this government and it 
fails to recognize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament the government had the great idea of 
bringing in useless Bill C-68, the firearms act.  It spent 
millions and probably billions in the end.  We are going to need 
all these judges plus a few hundred more in order to handle the 
court cases that will come from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government gets the priorities wrong, it has a snowball 
effect all the way down.  It ruins a lot of good things in 
society which could have benefited by the government setting its 
priorities properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree.  The government should set its priorities better.  It 
should spend the money better.  Let us get on with making Canada 
a better place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
when I spoke to Bill C-37, I was asked a question concerning the 
morale within the RCMP when its members see judges getting this 
kind of an increase.  The RCMP is just coming out from under a 
five year wage freeze and has received a pittance compared to the 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is a former member of the RCMP.  I would like 
to get his views as to what he feels this will do the morale of 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and to the constables out on 
patrol. How is this going to affect them?  My experience is that 
they will do their jobs and they will do them well but it 
certainly does not bode well for their morale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I lived through that 
personally.  Over those six years I did see the morale of the 
people working for me decline seriously.  It will recover a 
little bit now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the serving uniformed members that cause a drop 
in the policing on our streets.  The government is failing to 
take care of the non-uniformed people, the public servants who 
still have not had a raise.  These are the people with the lower 
salaries I was talking about earlier. Their poor morale reflects 
up to the members.  The members' poor morale reflects to the 
general public.  There are more complaints against the members. 
Everything the government should have done it did not do over the 
past two or three years and now we are in the situation of trying 
to fix everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no real change in the government's attitude.  It is 
still one of keeping the rich and elite happy and letting the 
little guys fight for themselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for his fine 
intervention and for bringing his expertise to the House today on 
this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is a former RCMP officer.  I am sure he has a lot of 
experience with arresting individuals, sending them to court, 
going through the legal process and then finding out that some 
members of the judicial community rather than interpreting the 
laws, have decided to make the laws.  They have set precedents in 
a number of areas which have made it very difficult for the 
police officers to do their job.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact they have turned the judicial system to some extent on 
its head.  That is not what they were there for in the first 
place.  The role of the judiciary is to interpret the laws made 
by the House of Commons and we as the representatives of the 
people have that duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from my hon. colleague in his experience 
whether he agrees with that assessment.  Does he agree that the 
judiciary rather than interpreting the laws is making the laws? 
Does the hon. member see that the House can play a role in trying 
to turn that around?   I would also like him to address the issue 
of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a number of egregious statements made by judges. 
They have put forth penalties that seemed completely out of 
proportion to the offence committed.  In the last few years 
particularly there have been rape cases where individuals 
basically got off scot-free for committing some heinous crimes. I 
would like my hon. colleague who has experience in these matters 
to address these two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly there have 
been some examples of this kind of decision making by judges that 
has adversely affected law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most recent examples was the requirement for police 
officers to obtain a warrant to arrest someone they knew had 
committed a crime.  The officers would approach the house and see 
the offender's car parked there.  They would go to the door and 
his boots and hat would be sitting inside.  His wife would be 
there and they would see the bathroom door closed.  The officers 
knew the suspect was there but could not go inside to arrest him. 
They had to try to get a warrant and come back later.  Of course 
when they returned he was gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges making decisions that result in new law is a serious 
concern.  We have seen a couple examples recently where 
provincial government justice ministers were talking about the 
primacy of parliament being usurped by the courts.  In fact, they 
are being pressured so heavily and so badly that they are 
considering using the notwithstanding clause of the constitution 
in order to have some control over judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges have to be independent.  However, parliament is the rule 
of law of the land and judges come under parliament.  It seems 
like parliament is becoming second place, which forces us into 
the use of a club, the notwithstanding clause, to swat a little 
mosquito. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments I am making regarding the accountability of judges 
are that while they are independent they must be accountable to 
someone.  They cannot be a law unto themselves.  If things 
continue the way they apparently have over the past years, 
eventually parliament will have to come up with a radical 
surgical solution to correct the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, for those watching the debate—and some may just have 
joined us on CPAC—I say that we are debating Bill C-37, an act 
to amend the Judges Act.  This is the third time the Liberal 
government has changed the Judges Act.  We hope one day they will 
get it right.  They certainly keep flailing away at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This series of amendments does four things.  First, it increases 
the salaries of judges.  Second, it provides a better pension 
plan for judges.  Third, it puts a full time commission in place 
to monitor judicial benefits. 
Fourth, it provides authority to pay some additional judges in 
particular areas of the system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the four things this bill provides.  Canadians who are 
watching the debate will be interested, because guess who gets to 
pay for the measures brought in by the government.  Some measures 
Canadians are willing to pay for.  Other measures we as Canadians 
question whether they are a good use of our hard earned money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some detail on each of the four measures.  First, 
judges' salaries will increase by just over 8%, which is an 
increase many Canadians wish they could look forward to.  The 
increase is retroactive for a whole year.  That is a nice bonus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second measure concerns making the judges' pension plan more 
generous. Currently a judge can draw a full pension at age 65 
after a minimum of 15 years of service.  The full pension is 
equal to two-thirds of the judge's salary at the time of 
resignation.  The new changes will allow judges to retire much 
earlier.  Retirement will not be based on the age of 65 but on an 
80 formula, that is the judge's age plus the judge's years of 
service.  If they equal 80, the judge can retire with a full 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the public service formula is based on 
85 years.  Theirs is a more generous formula by five years than 
public servants are allowed.  If a judge is age 60 and has been a 
judge for 20 years, the individual can retire at age 60 with a 
full pension.  If the judge has served for 25 years, the judge 
could retire with a full pension at age 55.  This is a very 
generous pension formula for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third measure is the matter of the full time judicial 
benefits and compensation commission.  It has not been in the 
past but now will be a full time commission of three people doing 
nothing but monitoring judges' salaries and compensation. I am 
not quite sure how many hours a week the commission will require, 
but I am sure many Canadians would be quite happy to have a full 
time job serving on a commission that just looks at judicial 
compensation and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting these commissioners are all patronage 
appointments by cabinet, more patronage appointments to good and 
faithful Liberals, no doubt, if past experience is anything to go 
by.  It will be a four year appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fees for the commission will be fixed by cabinet and the 
commission members will be deemed to be employed in the public 
service, which means they will be eligible for a generous package 
of benefits and a pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission has to report within nine months of being 
appointed, but the report will not be debated in the House. 
Whatever the commissioners say Canadians will not know because 
the report will be tabled quietly.  There will be no opportunity 
to take issue with it, debate it or talk about it, even in the 
people's House of Commons as we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth measure is the authority to pay additional judges. 
The act increases the number of additional appeal court judges 
that can be appointed to appeal courts across the provinces from 
10 to 13.  The federal government has essentially said that it 
will pay for three more appeal court judges if a province can 
convince it that it needs one or more. 
If all ten provinces and two territories want additional appeal 
court judges, there will be quite a dust up as to who comes out 
on top.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with unified family court judges.  There will 
actually be triple the number of unified family court judges 
possible across the country.  Right now there are 12.  The 
federal government is saying that it would pay 36.  There will be 
no additional judges, however, to other levels of the judiciary 
such as Queen's bench and the provincial courts which administer 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk in a few minutes particularly about the provincial 
court level which administers the Criminal Code.  That is where a 
lot of the backlog exists and where there needs to be substantial 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the justice committee's time has been 
considerably taken up in administrative matters to do with the 
judiciary.  That is not to say that there may not be a need for 
some of it, but certainly Canadians do not have reform of judge's 
pay and pensions at the top of their list when it comes to 
justice reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the new justice minister, although she spoke nicely at 
the beginning of her appointment after the last election, has 
come out with no strength of purpose in overhauling the justice 
system.  She has simply flailed around, tinkering with small 
repair jobs and avoiding the major overhauls that Canadians are 
demanding to our sputtering justice system.  That is a criticism 
we as the official opposition with the job of holding the 
government accountable need to bring before the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we spending our time, our effort, our air time, our 
study, our committee time and the time of the Canadian people on 
issues that are not the ones which Canadian people are demanding 
need to be dealt with when it comes to the justice system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, for example, want victims' rights to be protected. 
What does the minister spend time on?  In this parliament we had 
a law that limits the use of DNA evidence to protect the rights 
of accused and convicted criminals.  Far from protecting victims' 
rights, which is what the public is demanding, particularly 
families and friends of victims and victims themselves, we have a 
government that has spent time in parliament making sure that the 
rights of the accused and convicted criminals are not infringed 
too heavily by the taking of DNA evidence.  That is the kind of 
perverse priority of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have Canadians saying that they want laws that 
effectively deter youth crime.  That is important to them.  The 
Young Offenders Act gives a slap on the wrist and almost 
encourages youth crime because the consequences are so lenient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, what does the government spend its time on?  As my 
colleague who was with the RCMP before taking his seat in 
parliament just said, we have spent time in parliament with a law 
that would force law enforcement officers to break off attempts 
to find suspects to obtain a search warrant to enter a building. 
At that time anyone but the most inept of criminals would be long 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking for measures that deter crime. Parliament 
in response spends time on laws that will protect criminals to 
make sure they are not too easily caught.  We would not want to 
actually bring a lawbreaker too easily to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we wonder why Canadians put up with this nonsense. 
Canadians are asking for a bold new package of ideas to 
substantially reduce delays and costs in the legal system.  I 
will talk in a minute about delays in the legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister do in response to this demand by 
Canadians? She beavers away on a bill to expand a tiny corner of 
evidentiary procedure when it comes to disabled people. That is 
her big contribution to addressing the delays and costs of the 
legal system.  That is what the justice committee has been asked 
to spend time on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to reverse the shocking leniency of sentences 
that are handed down by our courts even for serious violent 
crimes, for example, drunk driving and some of the light 
sentences for incredible violations and assaults on our citizens 
due to conditional sentencing. Canadians are saying enough 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister do?  Her best shot is to introduce this 
bill to appoint a few more judges, not of course in the criminal 
area but in the appeal area and the family court area, and to 
promise more money for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this sound like the acts of a competent, responsive justice 
minister?  My answer is absolutely not.  Here we are nearly a 
year into the mandate of a government and the best this 
government has been able to do is practically the exact opposite 
on handling the four greatest concerns of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister promise when she took on the job?  What 
was her promise?  Was it to appoint a few more judges, pay them 
more and give them better pensions?  I did not hear any of that. 
I am pretty sure Canadians did not hear that either.  Did the new 
justice minister say she will make sure that before a police 
officer goes after a suspected criminal following the commission 
of a crime that they go back to a judge and get a search warrant, 
lest they catch up with this person too quickly?  Did anyone hear 
the justice minister say that after she was appointed?  I did not 
hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what she did say: “Improving the Young Offenders Act is 
one of my top priorities”.  Oh really, her top priority.  Here we 
are months and months from the appointment of this minister who, 
by the way, had the benefit of a full two years of study of the 
Young Offenders Act by the justice committee which had just been 
finished prior to the election.  All the study had been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee travelled across the country, spoke with 
Canadians from top to bottom of this country, from law 
enforcement officers, to the judiciary, to regular citizens, to 
high school students, for two years studying the Young Offenders 
Act, helping the justice minister to carry out her top priority, 
to improve the Young Offenders Act.  Here we are nearly a year 
later without one single line of legislation to carry out the 
justice minister's supposed top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we are spending hours of debate in this House and in 
committee talking about whether we need a few more judges and if 
we should pay them more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is far wrong with the mandate of this government and a 
justice minister who can change priorities to such a sad extent. 
The record speaks for itself.  As I have said, I believe the 
priorities that have been carried out are bending over backwards 
to protect the rights of accused, convicted and fleeing criminals 
and expanding the operations of and rewards to a justice system 
many Canadians describe as ineffective, inefficient and out of 
touch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been time for four bills to do that but no time to put 
even one line of legislation before this House to deal seriously 
with the glaring flaws in a justice system which has repeatedly 
failed law abiding Canadians when it comes to protecting their 
safety and their right to security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about what is 
causing so much frustration and unnecessary pain to regular 
Canadians.  That is the case of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. 
Gilles Deraiche. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. and Mrs. Deraiche now live in Calgary and have given me 
permission to talk about their situation. They lived in Ottawa 
not too long ago.  In September 1996 their son was viciously 
murdered in Ottawa.  Since that time it took seven months to hold 
a preliminary hearing.  One could imagine the agony of these 
parents who wanted justice and closure on this terrible family 
tragedy.  They had to wait seven months for the preliminary 
hearing to find out if there was enough evidence to hold a trial. 
Following that it took five months to schedule an examination 
for discovery.  Eight months after that a trial date is 
scheduled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty months are going to pass before there will be a trial to 
bring this personal loss to any kind of closure.  My constituents 
have been treated as if they have no right and no interest in 
this entire proceedings.  When they called the prosecutor's 
office in Ottawa they were advised it was the responsibility of 
the police to give them information.  When they called the police 
they were advised it was not the police's responsibility to 
advise them of what was going on.  The police also told them that 
sometimes they do not even know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they call for information they must always state the names 
of the individuals who were accused of their son's murder, thus 
putting the emphasis on those who created such tragedy in their 
lives.  This is very painful for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were advised of the trial date of their son's murder by 
relatives in Ottawa who read about it in the Ottawa newspaper. 
These are the parents of a murdered son.  That is the way our 
justice system works for Canadians.  Canadians are told it is 
really important that we pay judges more and that they have 
better pensions.  Maybe it is, but that is not how Mr. and Mrs. 
Deraiche feel.  Their situation will not be helped at all by this 
act because it appoints judges in a totally different area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. 40,000 criminals are awaiting trial.  This has forced 
the B.C. attorney general to request an amendment which would 
allow a longer period of time for bringing a criminal to trial 
before the case is thrown out of court.  Under our charter the 
criminal is entitled to a timely trial.  If the system is 
backlogged and the criminal does not get a timely trial he or she 
walks free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to spend time in this Parliament to address some 
of the changes being demanded for our legal and justice system. 
The priorities of this government are completely wrong.  I appeal 
to the government to put the tinkering administrative matters on 
the back burner and get on with the real job we were elected to 
do, provide safety and security for Canadians and their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the member's remarks.  While I do not 
necessarily share all her opinions, including those on the Young 
Offenders Act and the severity of sentences imposed by the 
courts, on the whole, as regards Bill C-37, we are not far apart 
in our understanding of it and on the government's obligations 
regarding decisions by the Supreme Court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada handed down an 
important decision.  It is the reason we have Bill C-37 before us 
now.  I will quote a passage from the decision I consider very 
important, and then I will ask her a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justices said the following “However, to avoid the 
possibility of, or the appearance of, political interference 
through economic manipulation, a body, such as a commission, 
must be interposed between the judiciary and the other branches 
of government.  The constitutional function of this body would be 
to depoliticize the process of determining changes to or freezes 
in judicial remuneration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is quite simple, and I am sure she 
shares my position on this.  Could she tell us what she thinks, 
in the light of the statement by the Supreme Court justices, of 
the way judges are appointed to the Supreme Court, to federal 
courts and to superior courts?  Does she not believe that, if we 
are to depoliticize the process and prevent all economic 
manipulation, there has to be a commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be more natural or better if the government opposite 
introduced a bill to set up a sort of committee, commission or 
whatever for the appointment of justices?  Would this serve to 
prevent all political interference, all political manipulation, 
as it was put by a certain lawyer with a high international 
profile in the Supreme Court reference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would justice not be better served if the government listened to 
the arguments put forward by the opposition on a number of 
occasions?  I think the Reform Party also has a platform or 
arguments on the appointment of judges to superior courts under 
federal jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think a lot of 
Canadians found it rather shocking to suppose, if I understand 
the case, that unless judges are paid more they could be open to 
bribery.  Therefore their integrity may be for sale unless the 
government pays them more.  I find that to be a tremendous insult 
to the many fine people we have on the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we extend that argument we could say that law enforcement 
officers, members of Parliament and legislators should be paid a 
lot more for the same reason.  I think the whole premise behind 
that judgment was certainly very flawed and suspect in its 
assessment of the character of our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member did ask me about the way judges are 
appointed and whether that could be improved.  I certainly agree 
with him, as do most Canadians, that simply basing appointments 
to the bench on patronage, past faithful service to a particular 
party is very undesirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how naive I was in law school. Some days I think I 
still am but I was more so then. We had a visiting judge. I asked 
him afterwards how one became a judge.  I know that really sounds 
naive but I was quite curious.  He laughed and said most people 
would say it depends on belonging to the right political party. 
Surely we can do a lot better than that in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to reform this patronage appointment 
process to make it a lot more transparent and publicly 
accountable.  We formed a task force which made recommendations 
in a report to our national assembly in Vancouver in 1996.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform task force recommended was an appointment 
process whereby a Commons committee made up of the elected 
representatives of the people would review and interview 
candidates whose names were put forward for judicial 
appointments.  We felt this would open up the process a great 
deal and ensure that it was not simply done in the back 
rooms of the PMO, by whomever was handling the patronage 
appointments of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to push very vigorously for this kind of reform to 
restore trust and confidence in the judicial system and in its 
integrity and objectiveness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my hon. colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill, who is a lawyer and who has brought her 
expertise on legal matters to this party which has been greatly 
appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the beginning of her speech she mentioned that the justice 
system has ground to a halt.  She brought forth a heart-wrenching 
example.  This is a situation that we are faced with across the 
country.  Justice is being delayed.  Justice delayed is justice 
denied.  If we want to make sure that justice is done, it has to 
be done in an expeditious fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the government has failed to adopt any of 
the constructive solutions that have been put forth to ensure 
that we have an expeditious criminal justice system so that 
people who are arrested get a fair trail in a timely fashion, in 
a reasonable timeframe.  The system right now does not provide 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill whether she can 
provide to the House some constructive solutions that the 
government can adopt to ensure that individuals who are in our 
criminal justice system will go through the system in an 
expeditious and fair fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the House 
would like a long dissertation on this subject and I would be 
happy to provide one.  However, I will limit my comments to just 
a minute or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of frustration over the length of time it takes a 
lot of these cases to be dragged through the courts, not just on 
the criminal side but also on the civil side.  When this matter 
was studied, and it has been studied to death by the Canadian Bar 
Association, by the trial lawyers association and by various task 
forces, one of the main recommendations was to change some of the 
rules of courts to limit the grounds upon which adjournments can 
be granted and to ensure that there are specific timeframes given 
within which steps in a case must go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues who have dealt with the justice system or 
who are lawyers themselves will know that adjournments are 
routinely granted for almost any reason.  This can happen even 
though people have taken time off work to appear as witnesses in 
support of a plaintiff or the accused.  All of a sudden, in two 
seconds, someone stands and says “I am asking for an 
adjournment” and it is off the docket until another time.  This 
is very frustrating and very inconvenient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be one simple way to bring things forward.  There are 
a number of recommendations along that line.  Perhaps I will get 
to them at another time.  I believe that is enough said on the 
subject, except to add that this is an enormous frustration not 
only for the constituents who I just spoke about, but for 
literally thousands and thousands of Canadians who have to deal 
with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were going to be responsive to the wishes of 
Canadians, then it would do a lot to move in that direction 
instead of dealing with some of these other matters that we have 
talked about today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-37.  This bill seeks 
to amend the Judges Act, something which the government has put 
forth on a number of occasions.  I will go through this bill 
briefly and provide some constructive solutions for the 
government so it can truly make meaningful amendments to this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary purpose of the bill is to increase the pay of 
federally appointed judges.  They will receive a 4% increase both 
for 1997-98 and for 1998-99.  Their salaries have been frozen 
like those of the rest of us for several years.  That is a fact 
of life, given our fiscal restrictions.  No one has any 
complaints about that.  Our judges should be paid fairly. No one 
has problems with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what the judges make here and what they 
make in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the yearly salaries for judges of the Supreme Court of 
Canada?  The chief justice makes $163,800.  The yearly salaries 
of judges of the federal court are as follows:  the chief justice 
of the federal court makes $139,700, an associate chief justice 
makes $139,700, the 13 other judges of the trial division each 
make $127,700.  As I said before, no one has a problem paying for 
competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us look at what judges make in the United States.  I 
will look at the salary reports in the U.S. as of January 1, 
1997.  The average salary of associate judges of the highest 
courts was $101,782.  For intermediate appellate courts the 
average was $100,400, and for judges of general jurisdiction of 
trial courts the average was $91,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in perspective, we can see that our judges make 
roughly one-third more than judges in the United States who have 
a relatively equivalent stature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the judges are receiving an 8% increase in their salaries, 
the people in our military are receiving 1.5%.  There is no 
equity.  As well, the proposals for MPs' salaries were much 
higher than what anybody else in the private sector would get. 
All we are asking for is some fairness and equity for people 
across this country who are being paid, in effect, by the 
taxpayer.  In other words, one group should not get much more 
than other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are enormous opportunities for the government to really 
deal with this issue.  I just returned from the United States. 
They have done some innovative things in California to put 
accountability back into the judicial system.  They elect their 
judges, instead of appointing them.  Competence is ensured 
through the electoral system.  I will illustrate how they do this 
in California in the hope that the government will adopt it so we 
can elect judges in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In California they use one election system for trial court 
judges and another for appellate court judges.  The judges serve 
six-year terms and they compete in a non-partisan election.  That 
is important.  It has nothing to do with politics.  It is a 
non-partisan election in which individuals run on what they will 
offer and on what they have done as judges.  Anyone who gets more 
than 50% of the vote is declared elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justices of the supreme court serve 12-year terms and are on 
the ballot in November every four years.  There is a revolving 
door, with one-third of the judges being on the election ballot 
every four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals from the public who will be putting their ballots 
forward can get information on the judicial candidates in a 
number of ways. 
They can read the local newspapers which cover the judges.  They 
can call the county bar association.  They can read the 
candidate's own campaign literature and evaluate the campaign 
literature of the judges themselves.  This way the public can 
evaluate the judges based on what they are going to offer in the 
position.  Again, they will be evaluated on the basis of merit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a supreme court judge in California who tried to 
overturn this.  The judge tried to strip the ability of citizens 
to have the power to decide whether an individual should run as a 
judge.  Every state in the United States has a system of election 
and all but one, Rhode Island, has a term system of six, eight or 
twelve years.  It does not extend for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any enlightened court system has to blend executive appointments 
with public votes.  It is probably the most sensitive way of 
ensuring that our judicial system is non-partisan, has merit and 
ensures that the people are the ones who are going to judge the 
people who are going to judge them if they come into a court of 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to consider the suggestion of an 
elected judiciary.  I urge the government to look at the 
California system.  The California system also has the ability to 
review the behaviour of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago there were a number of court rulings that had 
members of the public shaking their heads.  There was a man who 
was charged and convicted of sexually assaulting a five-year old 
girl.  The judge gave this person an extraordinarily low penalty. 
His argument was that the five-year old girl was being sexually 
provocative by sitting on the man's lap and rubbing herself up 
and down on him.  Five-year olds do not think that way. This was 
a judgment that was beyond comprehension and it let somebody who 
had committed a foul, egregious crime out onto the streets to 
probably do it again.  Where was the accountability?  It simply 
did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competence and a continual review process has to be in place. 
In California they have a system whereby a judge can be reviewed 
when his or her behaviour has been completely out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that the judiciary is independent of the 
House.  Their behaviour has to be independent, but competence and 
accountability in what they do as individuals has to be ensured. 
We are all accountable in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the incredible costs that exist today in our 
legal system.  We have a legal aid system which is costing us 
billions of dollars.  Perhaps there is another way to ensure that 
people who cannot afford the system will be able to get a good, 
competent legal defence and a fair trial at an affordable price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, as well as a system of crown prosecution 
there is a system of crown defence.  People are appointed to 
defend a person who cannot afford to pay for his or her defence. 
These appointed individuals give a good competent defence as 
salaried lawyers within the department of justice.  This works 
very well in the U.S.  I urge the government to look at that 
system.  Perhaps Canada could appoint public defenders to give a 
good, competent defence to individuals who cannot afford a 
lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To streamline and expedite the system is extremely important. 
Unfortunately I am not a lawyer.  Sometimes I wish I were. 
However, we have a system which enables individuals to put forth 
constructive solutions.  I have a challenge for all the good, 
competent lawyers who work in the trenches in the legal system. 
I would ask them to provide us with good constructive ideas on 
how we can streamline the system, to come up with a good and fair 
legal system, an expeditious system that ensures people get a 
fair trial within a reasonable time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have such a morass that we have justice delayed and 
justice delayed is justice denied.  Justice denied is not 
justice.  There are ways of doing this.  Let us look at those 
ways and ensure these changes are made to the system.  My 
colleague for Calgary—Nose Hill mentioned an example of 
adjournment proceedings where they are far too lenient with how 
those adjournment proceedings are performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime and punishment is another situation where our party has 
been accused of being, for want of a better word, far too right 
wing on the issue.  We have really been given a hard time with 
this.  Fortunately for us it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at justice in two ways.  We look at it in a balanced 
way.  We say that for those people who have been proven to be a 
threat to society, who are a danger to society and particularly 
those who are violent, it is the role of the justice department 
to ensure that those people do not go out and harm innocent 
people again.  Those people should be met with the full force of 
the law, the objective being to protect innocent people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another group of people who are non-violent and perhaps 
there are alternative ways of dealing with them such as the use 
of restorative justice.  There are some very good programs in my 
province of British Columbia where restorative justice is used to 
ensure that people are going to be able to pay a penalty to 
society, pay a penalty to the victim and also ensure that they 
receive the rehabilitation and treatment they require, that they 
do not go into the cycle of crime, punishment and recidivism that 
takes place in far too many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of prevention.  Many months ago I 
introduced in this House a private member's motion calling for a 
national headstart program.  There have been horrible shootings 
in Arkansas where 11 and 13-year-olds have been charged with 
committing some very foul murders, and in some recent tragic 
situations within our own country such as the terrible murder of 
Reena Virk in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  Their 
history does not exonerate these individuals from their actions 
but at least by looking at it we will be helped to understand 
that the origins of crime in many of these youths start at time 
zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that half the people in jail suffer from 
fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects. Fetal alcohol 
syndrome is the leading cause of preventable birth defects in 
this country.  These individuals have an average IQ of 68.  It is 
preventable.  We can do something about that.  But it has to 
start at time zero.  We have to identify families at risk. We 
have to ensure that those families receive their basic needs and 
the children receive their basic needs.  There are programs that 
have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Moncton, from the government, has been a leader 
in the Moncton headstart program, a program that has been very 
effective at preventing children from entering into lives of 
crime at worst or at best suffering indignities that give them 
fractured psyches and make it very difficult for them to interact 
with society in a constructive fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Perry preschool program in Michigan, the Hawaii 
headstart program, the Montreal longitudinal study with Professor 
Tremblay which shows very clearly that if we are to address and 
prevent crime starting at time zero, when the building blocks of 
a normal psyche are developing, when we prevent the trauma to 
that developmental process, we will have a cost effective and 
indeed humanitarian way of preventing crime in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how we prevent crime.  The Reform Party is really taking 
a multipronged approach to crime. I know there are members across 
this House who have been working very hard, members from the NDP, 
members from the Liberal Party, members from the Conservative 
Party, members from the Bloc and members from our party, the 
Reform Party, who have been working very hard to develop a 
balanced approach to crime and punishment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us came to this House to ensue that we would have 
sensible proposals to crime and punishment so we can change the 
tide of what is occurring in our streets today.  Let us not 
forget that with respect to youth crime the number one victims in 
youth crime are youth.  They are the ones who have the most to 
lose and the most to gain from what we do in this House. They are 
also people who are not represented well in this House because 
none of them sit in this House. They are too young to be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do our job and ensure we can put our minds together to 
put forth these sensible, constructive, pragmatic and cost 
effective solutions to prevent crime.  Headstart programs work. 
Let us introduce one.  It does not have to be some huge sink hole 
of money.  It can be done within existing resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Atlanta where schools along with medical, professional 
and existing resources are used to make sure that basic needs are 
met.  Parents need to know what proper nutrition is.  Members 
would be surprised to know the number of parents who are in 
underprivileged situations who often had parents who did not 
teach them how to be parents, who do not know what proper 
nutrition is, who do not know what proper discipline is, who do 
not know what setting appropriate boundaries are for children, 
who do not know what substance abuse and violence do to the 
development of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just words.  These are cold, hard scientific 
facts.  The medical community has done studies and has ways to 
look into the brain through something called positron emission 
tomography which illustrates how brains work.  Using a PET 
scanner we can see how the brain develops and how the brain is 
affected by various things.  We can prove conclusively and 
scientifically that the traumas I mentioned before have a 
deleterious and disastrous effect on the development of that 
child's psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can prevent this. I hope the government uses the collective 
knowledge that is in this House today and all the tremendous 
experience and expertise in our country and in others to build 
these constructive solutions, work with the medical community, 
work with the counsellors, work with the schools and we will have 
a comprehensive plan to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is absolutely essential that the government work 
with the provinces because most of the control has to be on a 
local basis where they can meet and fit with the needs necessary 
for the local community because not all communities are the same. 
An aboriginal community off reserve is different from an 
aboriginal community on reserve.  It is different from a 
multicultural setting in urban Toronto.  They are different. They 
have different needs but they can all be modified to address 
those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be difficult to argue for it but pragmatically if we deal 
with the facts we will ensure that our society and our country 
will have a dramatic benefit in the next 10 years.  The cost 
savings are massive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With crime costing us $44 billion a year, even if we shave off 
5% that is over $2 billion saved.  Imagine what we could do with 
that $2 billion.  We could provide tax relief to ensure that 
families are able to better meet their needs, strengthen our 
social programs, strengthen our health care system, strengthen 
our education system. These are cold, pragmatic arguments for 
this approach and it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to this bill, there are some innovative solutions 
to revamp our judiciary.  I have mentioned them in my speech and 
my colleagues have mentioned it in their speeches.  I hope the 
Minister of Justice takes these suggestions and implements them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to hear at the closing of the hon. 
member's remarks that he decided to get back to the bill at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was speaking to childhood nutrition and crime prevention 
which are of course very important issues.  I always have time 
for my hon. friend in debates here in the House, though he may 
stray from the point of debate.  He and I attended high school 
together in Scarborough just a few years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of his colleagues have not provided me with so many things 
to listen to.  His colleagues have chided the government for not 
having a list of priorities by placing this bill ahead of other 
bills they believe should be at the top.  One of the members 
mentioned two items they felt were of priority.  One was 
amendments to section 745 of the Criminal Code and the other was 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here in the last Parliament but I am not certain the other 
hon. member was.  I have to remind the House that the government 
did amend both those items in the last Parliament. The government 
chose to amend section 745.  The government chose and Parliament 
adopted legislation amending Young Offenders Act. This increased 
the penalties for murder and provided for the transfer of violent 
young offenders to adult court. Those were government priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the speech at hand, I could not help but note the references 
to the salaries of U.S. judges.  I think they were in 
$90,000, $110,000, $115,000, $120,000 range.  The 
member suggested they were one third less than the salaries 
proposed for our Canadian judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness, did he forget to take into account the exchange 
rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars?  If he did, it is 
unfair to use those numbers.  Would the hon. member like to 
recalculate judges' salaries either in Canada or the U.S. to 
incorporate the exchange rate?  A member on this side did a quick 
calculation and if we take the U.S. numbers, apply a 40% exchange 
rate, we would have the U.S. judges being 7% ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, would my colleague like to correct this for the record? 
Having not applied the exchange rate, the discrepancy between the 
judicial salaries is not as great as he suggested and it would 
help to put that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
and fellow graduate of Neil McNeil high school in Scarborough for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All things being equal, we do not equate salaries within a 
country based on what the exchange rate du jour happens to be. 
That is irrelevant.  All salaries are based within the confines 
of our own country.  The salaries of judges in the United States 
are one third less than the salaries of Canadian judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice if our salaries were taken into consideration 
according to the exchange rate.  That is not the reality we live 
in.  I will put this in his lap.  He has been very constructive 
throughout many of the debates he has entered in this House.  I 
hope the hon. member works with the Minister of Justice to deal 
with the issue of civil courts and what is happening with the 
civil court situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We unfortunately are moving toward the situation in the United 
States where civil courts and cases they are hearing are becoming 
spurious. I bring up the situation involving McDonald's. A woman 
had a cup of McDonald's coffee sitting on her lap.  She spilled 
the coffee and received burns.  She also received an 
extraordinarily high million plus dollar judgement in her favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a Parliament have to seriously look at the civil court 
situation to ensure we do not get tied up in spurious civil 
litigation that has a very onerous effect and very restrictive 
effect on society.  It makes for a very fearful society.  I hope 
the government and my hon. colleague will address the situation 
and use his expertise in the area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is always a pleasure to listen to the hon. member whose great 
concern for the well-being of society in general has manifested 
itself in many of the debates and certainly the exchanges in the 
standing committee meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to him three points came to my attention.  With 
what is happening in the United States in particular with the 
murder of young children by young children, does he not think 
that perhaps there ought to be a change in the attitude of his 
party that he could deal with?  I believe his party has a view of 
gun control that is not in the best interest of preventing this 
very dangerous equipment from being close at hand for young 
people.  The member also might want to think about the fact that 
the number one killer of women are guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I would like to ask my hon. colleague about his concern 
with respect to the salary of judges.  I am much more concerned 
about the election of judges.  Does he not believe that this 
might put judges in a conflict of interest situation and open to 
potential abuse?  I have serious concerns about the misuse of 
power in the hands of an elected person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question I would like to pose to him is in light of the 
particular bent of the Reform Party.  The member is talking about 
enabling legal aid.  Does my colleague not realize that is 
provincial jurisdiction and perhaps it would be best for him to 
encourage his colleagues in the provinces to take a look at the 
way they allocate funds for legal aid?  I do agree that many 
things need to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he talks about the fact that we do not have a comprehensive 
plan and that he is approaching this whole debate with a 
comprehensive plan, it might be most informative if they looked 
at the work we are doing in prenatal parental care and the grants 
that we are giving to ensure nutrition, public health and a 
better understanding as mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should also look into the field of prevention undertaken 
jointly by the provinces and the federal government, the question 
of the aboriginal head start and the $1.7 billion child tax 
credit which is not enough but it is certainly on the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern of the hon. member is being addressed in a way that 
can end up being a consolidated approach to better child 
development and learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
from Montreal who has repeatedly demonstrated in the House her 
deep interest, expertise and experience in the issue of crime 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address a couple of points.  I am glad she 
mentioned the Reform Party's attitude toward gun control.  If the 
gun control bill, Bill C-68, would make our streets safer this 
party would vote for it.  I looked at all the data in this regard 
very carefully.  In fact, I appeared before the House standing 
committee on justice.  I would be happy to speak with the member 
on this matter, to deal with the facts and to have good discourse 
with her.  We feel very strongly.  We would do anything to ensure 
that guns were not in the hands of 11 and 13 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are completely in favour of responsible gun control.  We 
would fight along with the government to ensure that firearms are 
not in the hands of children and to ensure that automatic weapons 
are not in the hands of criminals.  We want restrictive gun 
control laws to ensure that guns and weapons which are not useful 
to hunters and such would not be in their hands. We have fought 
very hard for that.  Unfortunately Bill C-68 would make our 
streets less safe by taking money out of the judicial system to 
put into gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to divide the bill into two sections.  We supported 
the good parts of the bill but wanted to get rid of the bad parts 
that would make our streets less safe.  We wanted to support the 
government in its pursuit of a bill that would make our streets 
safer.  My colleagues and I would be very happy to speak to the 
member about that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like 
other members of the Chamber I enjoy the opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-37 basically boil down to?  It means that 
judges will receive a raise in a two year period of 8.3%.  How 
many other public servants or how many other people in the 
country, period, can expect a raise of 8.3% in that short period 
of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a comparison to make.  The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police have gone five years with a wage freeze.  Are judges 
somehow more important?  Do they have a higher priority with the 
government than those who enforce the law, than the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police?  It appears so.  They are misplaced 
Liberal priorities, things that both you and I have problems 
with, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many other Canadian workers can count on a retroactive pay 
raise like the one under Bill C-37 for judges?  It just does not 
exist for other people.  It is not on the Liberal agenda for 
other people and it is a crying shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well there is nothing in Bill C-37 that addresses the 
patronage process for appointing judges.  It is a shame.  I am 
sure members know only too well that it is Liberal lawyers who go 
on to become Liberal justices.  That has to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  I hear rumblings from members opposite 
who think that should be the case.  Good for them.  I encourage 
them to make amendments to Bill C-37 to make changes to the 
patronage process that awards justiceships to Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us speak to the lack of priorities for a second if we may. 
On the Young Offenders Act we have seen no substantive changes 
coming out of the government since it was elected.  We still have 
serious repeat offenders who are being treated with kid gloves 
under the Young Offenders Act.  Yet the priority of the Liberals 
is to raise the salaries of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely taking care of serious repeat offenders, young offenders 
who violate the act again, again and again, must take a higher 
precedence not only in the eyes of the Canadian public but also 
in the eyes of the technocrats here.  That must be more important 
than a raise in the salary of judges in this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding section 745, I heard the Liberals claim that they have 
made changes to it.  Tinkering they must be, for otherwise I 
would not have had to appear on the steps of some of the Alberta 
courts in 1997 with Darlene Boyd, a mother who lost a child and 
wanted to make sure the individuals who killed her child would 
not be getting early parole under section 745. If there had been 
substantive changes to section 745, mothers like Darlene Boyd 
would not need to make appearances before courts hoping that the 
killers of their children would not be set free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also speak to the lack of priorities in terms of the backlog 
of the courts.  Nowhere in Bill C-37 do we have an address of the 
issue of the backlog in the courts.  Surely this is something of 
high priority and concern.  Yet we see nothing to deal with the 
backlog in the courts.  Once again, they are fast to want to 
raise the salaries of the judges under Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fourth point in terms of lack of priorities is that we have 
prison overcrowding.  Nowhere in Bill C-37 do we see an address 
of the issue of prison overcrowding.  Yet they are quick to raise 
the salaries of the judges in this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is that Liberal politicians do not like to actually 
make laws in the House.  They would rather abdicate the supremacy 
of parliament to the judiciary.  As a result, they only see 
fitting that taxpayer money and their salaries go toward paying 
judges because they write more laws and make the laws, not the 
Liberals who like to abdicate that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fifth point is that street gangs are becoming a problem. 
Nowhere in Bill C-37 do we see an address of the issue of the 
rise of street gangs, but it certainly speaks to the raise in 
judges' salaries.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sixth point concerns lack of priorities and once again speaks 
to the whole idea of judicial activism.  I touched lightly on the 
idea that the justices rewrite and write the law of the land.  It 
should be a supremacy of parliament that is respected.  We as 
members of the House of Commons should write the law, not the 
justices.  This does nothing to speak to the judicial activism 
that goes on and what is happening now with the justices' writing 
the law rather than elected members of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The six reasons I listed are all perfectly justified.  They give 
a clear indication of the lack of priorities of the Liberals in 
criminal justice.  They would rather raise the salaries of judges 
than deal with the six substantive points that should take 
precedence over raising judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will speak to the money.  When the money trail is traced 
that is usually when these matters get interesting.  Let us take 
a look at the lack of priorities in terms of money.  A lot of 
working poor do not have the luxury of colour cable TV but our 
prisoners do.  By committing a violent act they earn the right to 
have colour cable TV but the working poor do not have that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a misappropriation of government resources to raise the 
salaries of judges while it continues to give colour TV to our 
prisoners.  This money could be better allocated to hiring more 
judges or RCMP officers to hopefully get rid of the backlog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of priorities when free condoms are handed out 
to prisoners in jail.  I do not see the purpose of handing free 
condoms to sexual offenders in jail.  They are not supposed to be 
having sex in jail.  That is not the whole point, yet money is 
spent on handing out condoms to prisoners.  It is a Liberal 
priority to hand out condoms to prisoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bleach is given to prisoners to sterilize their contaminated 
needles.  They should not be using needles in jail.  Once again 
that is a Liberal priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where prisoners have the right to sue and 
use public funds to initiate charter challenges.  How is this 
justified?  How is a charter challenge on behalf of a prisoner 
more justified than hiring an extra RCMP officer or an extra 
judge to look after the backlog in the courts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is spent to make sure that the prisoners have a right to 
vote with all the logistical costs involved in that process. Paul 
Bernardo had an opportunity if he so wished to cast a ballot in 
the last election, which I believe was in your riding, Mr. 
Speaker, if I remember correctly.  How could anybody justify to a 
constituent in Kingston that money should be spent to allow Paul 
Bernardo to vote when there are other things that are much more 
needed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is spent on pool tables in our prisons to make sure that 
our prisoners are entertained.  There are many people in Kingston 
or in my home town of Calgary who would love to have unending 
amounts of time to play pool.  They do not have that luxury 
because they have to pay taxes to the government and they have to 
work for a living.  They cannot play pool as many hours as they 
might like to while away the day.  Certainly Canadian prisoners 
have that ability because it is a Liberal priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other people would like to spend some more time on golf 
courses but the Liberals are allocating money to make sure 
prisoners have golf courses.  I do not understand the logic in 
providing pool tables or golf courses.  Why not hire more police 
officers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working poor would not be able to afford an exotic meal of 
eel, but such foods are shipped in to make sure the requirements 
are met for the Inuit serving time in our penitentiaries so that 
they have access to foods that are part of their traditional 
diets.  We spend a lot of money on these types of perks and 
privileges for our prisoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not speak to the real needs of the Canadian justice 
system to hire more police officers or to hire more judges and 
not give them raises.  Certainly none of these things speak to 
the priorities.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SIERRA LEONE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
not long ago I asked the Secretary of State for Africa and Latin 
America a question concerning Sierra Leone, a small west African 
country, arguably the poorest country in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country's legitimate government was overthrown in May 1997 
by a so-called armed forces ruling council which itself was 
removed from power recently by a Nigerian led west African 
peacemaking force.  I was very pleased to learn that the 
secretary of state will be visiting Sierra Leone tomorrow and 
gathering information about the state of affairs in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The news reports from Sierra Leone are very serious.  There is a 
crisis brought on by food shortages.  Continued sporadic fighting 
in certain areas has also contributed to a serious refugee 
problem.  Some reports put the number of people in need of food 
as high as half a million.  This situation is extremely volatile. 
The west African force that I just mentioned which ousted the 
military junta replaced it with the civilian government which had 
previously been in power and which was led by former President 
Afmed Tejan Kabbah. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freetown right now and a number of the other major centres such 
as Bo, Makeni and Kenema have been secured but there are still 
areas where there is sporadic fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of suspicion about the intentions of the 
Nigerians in Sierra Leone.  A recent article in <I>The 
Economist</I> magazine suggested that Nigeria may be interested in 
Sierra Leone's mineral wealth, which includes deposits of rutile, 
bauxite and diamonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sierra Leone's recent history is a continuing tragedy of 
enormous proportions.  Since independence in 1961 the country has 
been on a downward spiral brought on by political instability, 
greed, corruption and repression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the last 30 years Sierra Leone has witnessed three 
conspiracies to overthrow the government, six attempted and five 
successful coups d'état.  Over the last few years the political 
problems in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone have created 
nearly one million refugees in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My personal interest in Sierra Leone goes back about eight years 
when I first visited the country as a member of a delegation 
sponsored by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  I was a 
participant from the city of Nepean.  At that time I was involved 
in a municipal development project sponsored by CIDA involving 
the town of Bo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a total of three trips to Sierra Leone, in 1990, 1991 and 
1993.  I was very pleased and proud to be involved in several 
projects including the construction of a new market building in 
the town of Bo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada's interest in Sierra Leone?  Apart from the 
Canadian aid and development agencies that have operated in the 
country for many years, including CAUSE Canada, the Red Cross and 
CUSO, there is a longstanding historical connection between 
Canada and Sierra Leone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many freed slaves from Nova Scotia made their way back to 
Freetown in the early decades of the last century. In this regard 
I understand there still is a community to community link which 
exists between Halifax and Freetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an English speaking Commonwealth country, Canada shares many 
of the same traditions and institutions as Sierra Leone.  It is 
interesting to note that as Commonwealth countries, Canada and 
Sierra Leone are at the top and bottom respectively of the United 
Nations human development index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although blessed with many mineral resources, Sierra Leone has 
simply been incapable of exploiting these resources for the 
benefit of its people who remain the poorest of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister returns from his visit to west Africa I hope 
he will provide this House with a report on what he discovered in 
Sierra Leone, in Ghana and some of the surrounding countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in relation to Sierra Leone has promised aid.  I am sure 
many members of this House will probably share the view that we 
can and should do better in terms of food aid, medicine and 
reconstruction assistance to a country that has been seriously 
devastated.

would like to thank the hon. member for bringing this question to 
the attention of the minister and members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked what help we are extending to Dr. 
Tectonides.  I am very happy to announce that Dr. Tectonides has 
returned to safety and to his family in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this crisis Dr. Tectonides' family was kept fully 
informed of all developments in Sierra Leone and of those 
concerning his whereabouts.  On various occasions Dr. Tectonides' 
family expressed sincere appreciation for the fact that the 
Government of Canada and the international organization Médecins 
sans frontières were working together to secure the release and 
the return to safety of the doctor and the French logistician who 
had been abducted with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present Dr. Tectonides is looking forward to his next 
assignment with the same organization, Médecins sans frontières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of Canadian assistance to Sierra Leone, as the 
secretary of state mentioned in the House, we have provided 
$600,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross as an 
initial grant to the ICRC humanitarian assistance aiming at 
alleviating the suffering of the local population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his current visit to Sierra Leone in the context of the 
Commonwealth ministerial action group, the secretary of state, 
the hon. David Kilgour, will be in a better position to evaluate 
the humanitarian and other assistance needs of the Sierra Leone 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I remind the hon. member not to refer 
to other colleagues in the House by their names.  I am sure she

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this adjournment 
motion in relation to a question I asked the minister on February 
26, 1998 as to whether it was normal that employment insurance 
now allows no more than 40% of unemployed workers to receive 
benefits, compared to 83% in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is inappropriate, inefficient and unacceptable to 
Quebeckers and Canadians because fewer than 50% of the 
unemployed are entitled to benefits. This deprives the system of 
all credibility and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very clear political message was sent during last year's 
federal election, and again just recently in the Nova Scotia 
election.  This totally contradicts what the minister said, and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are perfectly happy that we had the courage to change 
the EI system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would take real courage would be to put the reform back on 
the table, to make it humane and acceptable, and to make sure 
that the program is really one which will give people a decent 
income when they are between jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already managed to get the minister to admit that there 
were not as many cheats as former minister Young claimed.  Today, 
the statistics indicate that no more than 3% are defrauding the 
system, which is more or less the figure for all systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is a system for the 21st century, a system that will 
make people want to work, not one that leads systematically to 
welfare.  Between 1990 and 1998, 200 000 Quebeckers and 750 000 
Canadians were forced onto welfare by employment insurance 
reforms.  That is not an incentive but a disincentive to work. 
It is an encouragement to get out of the work force, and the 
federal government has an important responsibility in the battle 
against poverty.  It is encouraging an increase in poverty, 
rather than a decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a 21st century system that will give people working for 
themselves access.  The minister said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we are going to look into the matter and make the right 
decisions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reached the point where it is urgent to take action.  We 
are heading into the period of the year called the spring gap, in 
which people, with the new conditions of the system, lack an 
income for six, eight or ten weeks.  These are people in the 
seasonal industries.  These are people in fishing, agriculture 
and tourism.  For a period of six, eight or ten weeks, the very 
survival of these people is threatened.  They are penalized and 
often do not even qualify for social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we expect a decision from the government, despite the 
position taken last week in committee by the Liberals, who 
refused to report to the House on the first evaluation of the 
employment insurance reform?  Is there no way to heighten their 
sense of responsibility and to get the government to act and 
change the employment insurance plan in keeping with the six 
bills, the constructive proposals of the members of the Bloc with 
the support of the NDP.

<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development has indicated on many occasions 
that his department is conducting a review into why the 
percentage of unemployed Canadians receiving benefits is 
declining.  We do not believe it is simply due to changes in the 
EI system.  We believe the problem is far more complex than the 
hon. member is suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that changes in the economy and labour market are 
resulting in more self-employed workers who are not eligible for 
EI. 
It could also be discouraged workers returning to the labour 
market as the economy improves.  They have no recent work 
experience and therefore are not eligible for EI. That is why we 
are focusing on re-employment measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of making changes to the employment insurance system, 
as the member knows, the former unemployment insurance program 
was 25 years old and in need of a massive overhaul to meet 
today's new demands.  Canadians would not be satisfied with a 
step backward to an obsolete system as recommended by the 
opposition. Instead the federal government is working with the 
provinces to provide real solutions for unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will spend an additional $800 million per year on active 
employment benefits under EI bringing federal funding to more 
than $2.7 billion annually by the year 2000-01.  These benefits 
are about helping Canadians with the assistance they need to get 
back into the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also creating more new durable jobs by using the three 
year, $300 million transitional jobs fund that is now in place to 
help high unemployment regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also co-operating with provincial and territorial 
governments to deliver these benefits in the best possible way. 
Labour market development agreements are now in place or under 
discussion in all provinces and territories.  Decisions on the 
best way to help the unemployed get back to work must benefit 
from the knowledge and insight of those most closely in touch 
with local markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have confidence that these measures will be successful in 
helping the unemployed return to productive employment.  As 
employment growth continues and the number of unemployed falls, 
the ratio of benefits to unemployed should also rise again.
