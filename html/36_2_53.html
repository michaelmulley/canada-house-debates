convene a meeting of “like-minded” nations in order to develop 
a multilateral plan of action to reform international 
organizations (e.g. International Monetary Fund, World Bank, 
United Nations) so that they can identify the precursors of 
conflict and establish multilateral conflict-prevention 
initiatives.

parties for showing support for the motion. It is a motion that 
will save many lives and, indeed, for Canada, it will demonstrate 
our extraordinary leadership on the world stage for the 
collective good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the unanimous consent of all members, I would like to 
change the wording of the motion in a way which I think the 
government and other political parties will find acceptable.  I 
have only changed a couple of words.  The motion would read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
continue to intensify efforts with `like-minded nations' to 
further develop multilateral initiatives in order to strengthen 
the capacity of international organizations (e.g. International 
Monetary Fund, World Bank, United Nations) to enable them to 
identify the precursors of conflict and improve their conflict 
prevention capabilities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for unanimous consent that this be the motion that stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The debate is on the 
motion as it was originally presented to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion will enable us 
as a country to deal with the horrible situation facing the world 
today.  We have seen throughout the world tens of thousands of 
people who have been indiscriminately slaughtered in internecine 
conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the refrain time and time again “Never Again”; never 
again would we see the slaughter that took place during World War 
II.  After World War II the world got together and made a 
commitment to end the conflict that plagued it.  In the case of 
Europe, we saw the decimation, destruction and genocide of over 6 
million Jews, gypsies and other people who were unwanted by the 
Germans at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After World War II, instead of the world breaking apart, it came 
together to develop the IMF, the World Bank and the United 
Nations.  However, the outcome was two superpowers glaring at 
each other over a nuclear arsenal that was enough to destroy and 
decimate the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the breakdown of the Berlin Wall, we have seen a very 
different picture.  After the cold war and the post-cold war era 
there has been a proliferation of internecine conflicts, 
conflicts within states.  Rather than soldiers being killed, 
which is what took place during World War II and before, we now 
have situation where civilians are the ones being slaughtered. 
Over 90% of the casualties occurring today are innocent people 
like us and the viewers out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a situation for the faint of heart.  When I used to 
work in Africa, situations happened where children came up 
holding their bowels after they had been eviscerated.  At the end 
of last year a friend of mine who worked in Uganda was confronted 
by a group of women who were walking along a roadway.  Children, 
as part of the Lord's Resistance Army, stood up, took the women 
to the side of the road, cut off their ears, their noses and 
their lips and forced the women to eat the parts.  This is the 
brutality that children were inflicting on adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those same children were abducted by other adults in northern 
Uganda.  However, before they were abducted they were forced to 
kill one of their parents.  This is the kind of trauma that is 
occurring there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see circumstances in west Africa where individuals have their 
hands and legs chopped off.  It is not to kill them but to 
terrorize them. 
In Central Africa right now we have the largest war in the 
history of the world with unspeakable brutality taking place. 
Widespread torture of unimaginable proportions is taking place 
against innocent civilians. The international community has been 
unable and unwilling to deal with these situations in a 
preventive manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will articulate a way of dealing with conflict and of 
preventing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often in our foreign policy today we confuse conflict 
prevention with conflict management.  When we talk about conflict 
prevention we often talk about peacekeeping and peacemaking, 
which is often too late because once blood has been spilled and 
people have been killed the seeds for future ethnic discontent 
and war have been sown for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trauma has been inflicted upon children and lost generations 
occur.  We see that in many countries of the world, from Caucasus 
in Europe, to Bosnia, to west Africa, to Central Africa, to South 
Africa and to South America, to name just a few. Whole 
generations are lost.  Economies are laid to waste.  The degree 
of trauma to a nation is extraordinary, not only to the people 
but to the costs that are inflicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Mozambique, in its 16-year civil war 400,000 
people were slaughtered, 400,000 children lost their lives, 
200,000 children were orphaned and the gross domestic product 
fell to 20% of its pre-war situation.  We had a country laid to 
waste.  This is what is happening throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we as Canadians be involved or interested?  We should 
be involved not only on a humanitarian basis but in cold hard 
dollars and cents.  If we do not get involved and prevent these 
conflicts then we pay for it through our defence, aid and our 
domestic social program budgets.  When conflicts occur we have 
refugees leaving their countries and going to other countries, 
including our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need look no further than the Somalia and Ethiopia situations 
where thousands of poor individuals have come to our country 
putting demands on our immigration social program budgets.  We 
have welcomed them here because of the circumstances that they 
left, but I am sure most of these people would rather live in 
their own homes in peace and security than have to move half a 
world away just to have their basic human needs met.  We must 
prevent conflicts because it costs us, it costs them and it costs 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of peacekeeping and peacemaking to the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the UN has driven these 
institutions, particularly the UN, to bankruptcy.  The UN costs 
have increased dramatically. The peacekeeping and peacemaking 
options have increased dramatically. It takes such an enormous 
chunk of money out of them that they simply cannot afford to 
function.  It is driving them into bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the World Bank, the cost of post-conflict 
reconstruction has increased 800% in the last 12 years alone. 
This cannot continue but it will continue unless we put measures 
in place to prevent conflicts from occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a road map to conflict prevention.  The first thing we 
need is an early warning centre.  I propose today to the Canadian 
government that it work with members from across party lines to 
develop an early warning centre in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three possible sites that I have identified: First, 
Royal Roads Military College in Victoria, which has an excellent 
centre for conflict prevention; second, the Norman Paterson 
School of International Affairs in Ottawa with its fine 
post-graduate programs in diplomacy and in teaching political 
science; and third, the International Centre for Human Rights and 
Democratic Development in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any of those sites could be an early warning centre where people 
from around the world could input data from the private sector, 
NGOs, private individuals and academia. They could input 
information concerning their particular area for human rights 
abuses, violence being meted out to individuals and torture or 
polarization taking place between different ethnic groups, which 
is what usually happens.  Polarization is foisted upon certain 
groups, usually by despots who are trying to do this for their 
own political gain. 
An early warning centre is key.  Second, we need to have a series 
of responses.  These have to be an integrated series of responses 
involving diplomatic, economic and military initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diplomatic initiatives are fairly self-evident.  I propose 
again today that the government work with like minded nations, 
with other interested parties, to develop a rapid reaction force 
of multilateral diplomats under UN auspices that can go early 
into a situation.  We have rapporteurs in the Horn of Africa but 
we need more of them.  We need teams of diplomats who are viewed 
as being independent and without prejudice who will go in and try 
to identify ways in which the circumstances can be diffused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is economic issues.  This is an area that has been 
untouched and unexplored and an area wherein we as a nation can 
use multilateral organizations to enormous effect.  Using 
economic levers can be very effective both as a carrot and a 
stick in the prevention of deadly conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War needs money.  We have all seen pictures on television 
screens of individuals in impoverished countries where the 
average income is $1 a day, carrying on their backs AK-47s, 50 
calibre machine guns and enough weaponry that would cost them 
years to be able to afford.  The money to buy these comes from 
somewhere. To look behind the scenes to see where it comes from 
is interesting.  We must develop a way to choke the money supply. 
We can do that by applying sanctions targeted particularly at 
despots engaging in behaviours patently destructive to their 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at the present situation in Angola where President 
Dos Santos and the head of UNITA have been engaging in a war for 
more than 12 years that has resulted in the slaughter of hundreds 
of thousands of people.  As we speak, there is an impending 
devastating famine in Angola, completely and utterly organized by 
the two individuals that have been engaging in war for so long 
and using their people as tools and pawns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Angola is one of the richest countries in Africa, and indeed the 
world, with its billions of dollars from the sale of oil and 
diamonds, diamonds that we buy when we get engaged or married. 
The diamonds coming from Angola are fuelling a conflict that is 
causing the death of thousands upon thousands of innocent 
civilians as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must develop ways to choke off the money supply.  Intelligent 
targeted sanctions and the use of financial levers should be 
applied to these individuals to encourage them to pursue peace 
and not to take the road toward polarizing groups.  Using 
economic levers as a carrot on a stick can be enormously 
successful in the prevention of deadly conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Bank and the IMF should put conditions on their loans 
and on their development aid packages.  We simply cannot continue 
to pour money into countries with no good government and where 
there will be an explosion of conflict.  Once conflict takes 
place all the aid and development engaged in for decades is 
destroyed.  We go back to square one.  All the good money that we 
and many other countries of the world have put into the IMF, the 
World Bank and the UN for development is for naught once conflict 
takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the degree at which destruction can occur.  If we 
look at Kuwait, six months after Saddam Hussein walked into 
Kuwait he destroyed the country.  It will take up to $100 billion 
to bring Kuwait back to where it was.  Who pays for that?  Kuwait 
and the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford it.  International organizations cannot afford 
it.  We have to prevent it.  The IMF, the UN and the World Bank 
need to put conditions on the actions of countries behaving in 
ways that are completely destructive to the internal and external 
security of their regions.  The government has done some 
excellent work in Sierra Leone by sending one of our colleagues 
there.  We need to continue doing this.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these organizations are not apart from us.  They are us.  We 
make up those organizations.  People like to sling arrows at the 
UN, the IMF and the World Bank, but we are a part of them.  We 
make the decisions and set the direction of these organizations. 
Therefore we can change it.  In self-interest we must argue with 
other countries of the world that this can no longer continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually the last resort is military.  It can also be implemented 
in a preventative fashion as was done in Macedonia.  The argument 
can be that a small early investment in troops, particularly of a 
multilateral nature, can be enormously effective in preventing 
conflict.  We saw this is in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have worked in Rwanda if it had happened before April 
1994.  Instead we sat on our hands and did nothing.  I find it 
ironic that the European Union would rise on its hind legs and 
criticize Mr. Haider for his egregious and repulsive comments of 
the past.  It went through enormous gymnastics to slam him yet 
sat on its hands when it knew that people were being slaughtered 
in Srebrenica and Bihac.  The European Union was targeted with 
doing something about it.  It knew full well that people would be 
slaughtered and it did absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we see situations all over the world where the 
European Union, the OSCE, the OEDC and the UN are sitting on 
their hands while people are being slaughtered.  In Rwanda there 
is another impending conflict.  It is the same one that took the 
lives of over 700,000.  It will happen again.   We do not hear a 
peep about what is happening in Angola, yet thousands of people 
are being slaughtered.  In northern Angola the body parts of 
innocent civilians are being chopped off and fed to them, and we 
are doing very little to save them from this trauma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military intervention has to take place under certain 
circumstances.  Troops have to be armed for war while engaged in 
peacekeeping missions.  We cannot send them into a situation 
without being armed appropriately.  They must have robust rules 
of engagement.  We cannot have a situation like occurred in 
Bosnia where soldiers helplessly watched while innocent citizens 
were gunned down.  They must have the mandate to go to their 
defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why a rapid reaction force is good.  I compliment the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for proposing that in the past.  It 
is good and we need to continue to work toward it.  Five to ten 
thousand troops in a multilateral initiative that has a permanent 
peacekeeping base and operation centre can be very useful for 
diffusing a situation early, but it has to be multilateral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope these initiatives will take place with regional 
organizations.  Regional organizations can and should play an 
enormous role.  Too much emphasis has been placed on first world 
countries, NATO and North America to implement peacekeeping and 
peacemaking solutions.  More power and more initiative has to 
come from organizations like the OAU, OSCE and ASEAN on security 
issues within their areas.  This is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is to deal with the U.S. arms registry.  It 
should be expanded to involve the sale of small arms.  The 
greatest producers of small arms are the G-8 nations and the five 
permanent members of the security council.  They stand and want 
to talk about peace, yet they are fuelling the fires by selling 
small arms to individuals engaging in wars in which civilians are 
being slaughtered.  This circular pattern needs to be broken. We 
need to engage in the rules and regulations and develop a method 
of preventing deadly conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I thank the government and members of the other 
political parties for their support of this apolitical motion. 
It is one that could be extremely useful to our country in 
finally breaking the cycle of war that continues to take place. 
The major problem we have is a lack of political will and action.

the basic need to intervene by helping civilians who are helpless

these conflicts we will pay for it in defence aid and economic 
costs to the taxpayers of Canada.

other regional organizations.  It is up to us to work with other

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion before us calls 
on the government to convene a meeting of “like-minded” nations 
in order to develop a multilateral plan of action to reform 
international organizations, so that they can play a more 
effective role in the area of conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has rightly brought to the attention of the 
House the importance of strengthening the capacity of 
international organizations to prevent conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government, in particular the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
is cognizant of the devastating effects of conflicts around the 
world.  Recent events have demonstrated that Canadians are not 
isolated from international conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the recent Air India hijacking, the kidnapping last 
year of eight Albertan oil workers in Ecuador, the insidious 
influence of the illicit drug trade on young Canadians, the 
impact on Canada of the global traffic in human cargo, and the 
spectre of terrorist activity in our country.  These are all 
human security threats happening today in Canada or to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the promotion of human security is a foreign 
policy priority of this government. 
Human security is a complement to national security which takes 
the safety and well-being of people as the measure of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada views conflict prevention paired with good governance and 
respect for human rights as the best path to follow to achieve 
sustainable peace and human security and achieve our goals.  We 
are already pursuing these goals in a wide range of 
international fora. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ongoing efforts to enhance the capacity of the 
international community to improve conflict prevention.  Canada 
believes that the United Nations must be at the centre of the 
international community's efforts to prevent conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter of the United Nations, with its strong emphasis on 
“we the peoples”, has as a guiding principle the promotion of 
human security. 
We now need to give new meaning to these words, to make the UN's 
actions more relevant to the security and welfare of individual 
human beings, in a way, to give the Organization back to the 
world's people for whom it was founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Canada sought election to the United Nations 
Security Council.  The United Nations remains the only global 
body with nearly universal membership.  It has a mandate to 
assist states to prevent and resolve conflict and build lasting 
peace.  The United Nations Security Council has as its central 
role the maintenance of peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has consistently called for greater security council 
activism on conflict prevention. 
We welcomed the debate led by our Slovenian colleagues on the 
security council last November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada called on the security council to embrace a culture of 
prevention rather than responding once conflict has broke out. 
We stressed the security council's key role as a deterrent to 
conflict, in particular through the judicious and timely use of 
instruments at its disposal. 
These include peacekeeping interventions, sanctions and the 
creation of international criminal tribunals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By ending impunity for war crimes and other human rights abuses, 
these instruments in turn deter others.  Above all, by becoming 
more responsible to threats to human security, the security 
council will serve as a more effective tool of conflict 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of that important security council debate came a 
presidential statement in which the security council reaffirmed 
its responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations to 
take action on its own initiative in order to maintain 
international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement also expressed the security council's intention to 
support, with appropriate follow-up action of course, efforts to 
prevent conflict by the UN secretary-general through such areas 
as fact-finding missions, good offices and other activities 
requiring action by his envoys and special representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security council also decided to consider the possibility of 
a meeting at the level of foreign ministers on the issue of 
prevention of armed conflicts during the Millennium Assembly, 
which will be held this fall. 
Canada, as a member of the security council—and as president next 
April—remains engaged in the ongoing discussions on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reject the argument that the security council should limit 
its attention to traditionally defined conflicts between states. 
In this spirit, we participated in the recent open debate of 
the security council, chaired by the United States, on the 
impact of AIDS on peace and security in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's deputy permanent representative to the UN said during 
the debate that the AIDS pandemic has presented, and continues 
to present, major challenges to governments, in part because one 
quarter to one half of African personnel in the health, 
education, security and civil service sectors are expected to 
die from AIDS within the next five to ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this a serious human tragedy, but it is also a 
tangible threat to peace and order in the affected countries 
which already confront many other challenges, including civil 
strife, refugee flows and internal displacement, rapid 
urbanization and poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago, when Canada assumed the rotating presidency of the 
security council, we convened an open debate on the protection 
of civilians in armed conflict. 
The meeting was chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who 
identified four challenges facing the security council.  These 
included: the prevention of conflict; ensuring respect for 
international humanitarian and human rights law; supporting the 
pursuit of those who violate humanitarian norms and standards; 
and, finally, addressing the issue of the instruments of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was pleased that the security council agreed to ask the 
secretary-general to prepare a report on the protection of 
civilians in armed conflict.  The secretary-general's report was 
tabled last September.  His excellent report identified concrete 
measures that might be taken to improve the legal and physical 
protection of civilians in armed conflict, including several 
practical recommendations for preventing conflict. 
The secretary-general called for adherence to and ratification, 
implementation and dissemination of international human rights, 
humanitarian and refugee law instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He advocated greater responsiveness to the early warning 
indicators of conflict by making use of human rights information 
and analysis from independent treaty body experts and the UN 
Commission on Human Rights.  He recommended the establishment of 
expert working groups of the council to monitor volatile 
situations and to consider options to prevent the outbreak of 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary-general also suggested that the council consider 
the deployment of preventive peacekeeping operations such as 
UNPREDEP in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1995, 
or other preventive monitoring presences, and he noted the need 
to address hate media assets in situations of ongoing conflict. 
He also identified factors which should trigger action by the 
security council to protect civilians in the face of massive 
human rights violations or humanitarian emergencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the Canadian drafted resolution adopted in September 
on this subject, Canada now chairs an informal experts-level 
working group of the security council which is considering ways 
to implement the report's recommendations.

guidelines for demilitarization, demobilization and 
reintegration of combatants during the peace process.  In 
addition, Canada has created CANADEM, a stand-by roster of 
experts in various peacebuilding skills, who are available on 
short notice to serve on human rights field missions and in 
peace support operations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the government welcomes 
the interest of the hon. member in the issue of conflict 
prevention.  We do not disagree that the international community 
must continue to enhance its ability to prevent conflict, 
including through international organizations.  Through the 
promotion of human security, this government is working at the 
United Nations, in the G-8 and within a network of states to 
accomplish just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is already involved in ongoing efforts, both 
formal and informal, and involving a broad range of countries 
aimed at achieving the objective contained in the hon. member's 
motion.  As I have indicated, Canada is at the forefront of 
these efforts to enhance the international community's conflict 
prevention capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the government is not convinced that the 
adoption of this motion calling for the convening of a meeting 
would be conducive to advancing the important objective of 
improving the international community's conflict prevention 
capability. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in connection 
with the motion by the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, 
while I have sympathy for his intentions, at the same time I 
have misgivings about the wording and even his proposed 
amendment, for a number of reasons which I am going to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I have sympathy.  He spoke eloquently of the 
extremely troubling and revolting scenes taking place all around 
the world, which are intolerable.  We will readily agree that 
millions of people have been killed all over the world in 
senseless conflicts since the end of the cold war.  We are all 
aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also hope for prevention. 
The desire to take preventive action is not lacking, not in the 
hon. member, not in the government, not in the party I 
represent, not in members of parliament, not in ordinary 
citizens, not in the NGOs.  The real question is: how we go 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal made by the hon. member, and I recognize his merit 
in so doing, is to perhaps stir up debate on this in the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This might be the ideal 
forum for doing so. However, several aspects of the motion 
disturb me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the notion that one country could play a lead 
role, to spark a so-called policy of the necessity of prevention, 
is not realistic.  This is not how it is done.  Many people 
everywhere want to carry out prevention. 
We need only go to the UN, to visit the representatives of the 
institute for conflict resolution. Many people are working 
concretely on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, when he refers to like-minded countries, in 
French “nations de même esprit”, this raises questions in my 
mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to create a real prevention force, there may be 
countries with different visions, but these visions together 
must then lead to the establishment of a plan, if a plan is 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question concerns the expression “like-minded 
nations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with the expression “in order to develop a 
multilateral plan”.  I must say that I have a bit of a problem 
with that.  Our hon. colleague is his party's critic, and his 
party revealed a new position on foreign policy last fall.  I 
was therefore expecting that, as critic, he would adopt this 
policy,  I understand that this is not the case, and I am a bit 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in light of this policy that I prepared my speech.  I 
note that my colleague is distancing himself a little from it, 
but he will have to tell us more.  Developing a multilateral 
plan involves all parties, otherwise how could we manage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says “to reform multinational organizations”.  They 
do indeed need reform.  There has been consensus on the need for 
reform in the various forums I have participated in.  Mr. 
Camdessus, the outgoing president of the International Monetary 
Fund, does nothing but talk about the interests of the 
developing countries, but what was his policy when he was the 
active president? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all seen the fiasco of the Seattle summit, resulting 
from the collision between the rich countries and the others. 
The gap between the rich countries and the poor ones is 
widening. 
We cannot be thinking that a single political plan will reform 
these international bodies.  Major interests are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as the rich countries, including the most powerful, do 
not understand the link between the unacceptable aggression 
happening worldwide and poverty, we will get nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the member's motion is for the plan to make it 
possible to “identify the precursors of conflict”.  I think 
there are ample such organizations.  In Canada and Quebec, there 
are groups working at the site of conflicts around the world.  I 
heard what Canada's ambassador to the UN, Mr. Fowler, has to say 
and I have also read what he has written.  If the situation in 
Rwanda, around the great lakes, turned into something like what 
we have seen elsewhere, he was not certain that the UN would 
intervene. 
I respectfully submit that the problem is not that we do not 
know there will be conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion also says establish multilateral 
conflict-prevention initiatives. There is nothing my party and I 
wish for more than for countries to be able to achieve that. As 
the hon. member pointed out, in 1997, out of the 27 conflicts 
that occurred, 24 were internal ones taking place within a 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conflicts involve groups and people who have power 
relationships between each other. These conflicts sometimes have 
economic roots. Some of them occur because a group wants 
recognition. It is not enough to know that a conflict is 
brewing. We must also understand the situation, otherwise we 
will not be able to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the conflict in Kosovo, regarding which there was 
what I would call a reluctant consensus in this House to call 
for military intervention. The current situation in Kosovo is 
extremely problematical. In the name of humanitarian objectives 
that I shared then and that I still share, we created a 
situation where the multi-ethnicity of society has become 
difficult to maintain. 
That conflict should have been avoided altogether. But how could 
it have been avoided without looking at the issue of Kosovo's 
self-determination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the international community is still opposed to 
self-determination. In preparation for this speech, I read a book 
written under the direction of Charles-Philippe David and Albert 
Legault, two very attentive observers in Quebec. In their book, 
a professor wrote the following about Yugoslavia: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis of the events that preceded the declarations of 
sovereignty and independence of Slovenia and Croatia suggests 
that the armed conflict in Yugoslavia might have been avoided if 
the international community had been prepared to rethink the 
role and implementation of the principle of self-determination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member's determination, but I cannot 
support the proposal in its present form. However, I hope that 
this debate will lead to more discussions on the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to participate in the debate on 
this important motion.  I want to congratulate the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for proposing this motion to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the general note that he has struck in his comments in 
speaking to the motion.  I might say, as my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois indicated, that it represents somewhat of a shift 
from the position that appeared to have been taken by the Reform 
Party last fall.  In October the Reform Party tabled a foreign 
policy document that in fact would take us in many respects back 
to the dark ages, a document that in fact in many respects was 
highly critical of the role of the United Nations, a document 
that was isolationist and profoundly reactionary in many 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if the new critic—and I congratulate him on his 
appointment to that position—is now putting some distance 
between himself and the policies of the Reform Party as 
enunciated in that earlier document.  I can only say that I 
certainly hope that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat troubled by the comments that the critic made 
with respect to an important issue last week.  That was with 
respect to the policy of the Government of Canada to join with 
the European Union and many other countries in voicing our deep 
concern as Canadians about the profoundly racist and anti-Semitic 
policies of Joerg Haider in Austria.  It is my understanding that 
the position of that member was that Canada should not have 
joined with the European Union in expressing our strong 
condemnation of those policies and, in particular, joining in the 
diplomatic isolation of Haider.  That signal was again an 
unfortunate one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House today calls on parliament to urge 
the government to show leadership with respect to identifying the 
precursors of conflict and establishing conflict prevention 
initiatives. 
It speaks of a number of multilateral organizations:  the IMF, 
the World Bank and the United Nations.  To that I would add the 
World Trade Organization, a very important organization.  More 
and more we see in these international organizations that they 
are being driven not by human values or respect for human rights, 
but by global corporate values, the global pursuit of profit.  We 
saw that in the context of the WTO meetings in Seattle.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud that a broad cross-section of people from around the 
world stood to vigorously reject that agenda.  They said that as 
part of any fair global trade regime we must put human rights, 
the rights of working men and women and the environment at the 
forefront.  As long as we cannot, for example, take action on the 
exploitation of child labour within the WTO there is something 
terribly misguided, wrong and twisted about those priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand here as a New Democrat, as member of a party that has 
since its founding been committed to strengthening multilateral 
organizations which work on behalf of the interests of people. 
Forefront among those is the United Nations.  So much of what the 
UN has done is tremendously important in advancing those global 
objectives of human and social justice.  I think of the work of 
UNICEF, the World Food Council and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have to recognize that the time has come to 
make significant changes, to reform those organizations.  That is 
why I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I 
congratulate the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for his 
leadership in bringing this issue before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the structure of the United Nations itself. 
We must strengthen that body.  We must certainly look at the 
composition of the security council of the United Nations, which 
does not reflect present global realities, and we must look at 
how we can more effectively strengthen the general assembly of 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have a more fundamental challenge today, and that is 
how we can restore confidence and respect in the process of the 
United Nations itself, because too often the countries of the 
world and, in particular, the most powerful country of the world, 
the United States, show contempt for those resolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples and share some of the concerns that 
we New Democrats feel about that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs is, as my colleague 
for Mercier has said, in the process of addressing the Kosovo 
situation.  The United Nations has passed a very important 
resolution, resolution 1244, which is aimed at restoring an 
environment in Kosovo in which there is respect for all the 
inhabitants of Kosovo, including the Serb minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have already been some very powerful, very significant 
reports as to how this resolution is not being respected in 
Kosovo at all.  As well, there are insufficient resources to 
promote human rights, rebuild the country's infrastructures and 
establish a fair judiciary sytem.  The cost of one or two days 
of bombing would be sufficient now to create a fair and just 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations has failed in Kosovo, not only to protect 
fundamental human rights, particularly the rights of the Serb 
minority and other minorities, but at the same time to put in 
place the resources that are necessary to establish respect for 
that resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that in too many other areas.  We see it with respect to 
the resolutions that have been adopted overwhelmingly by the 
United Nations on Cuba, condemning the United States embargo or 
blockade of Cuba, and yet the United States shows total contempt 
for those resolutions.  We see it with respect to the Middle 
East.  Recently many of us voiced deep concern about the Israeli 
bombing of southern Lebanon.  It is in total violation of many 
United Nations resolutions, not the least of which is resolution 
425 which calls on Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, which would 
help lead to a peaceful solution in that very troubled part of 
the world.  Once again it is selective enforcement of United 
Nations resolutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to recognize as well the concern that many have voiced 
about the failure of the United Nations to respond to a continent 
that is undergoing profound agony.  I know the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has spoken to this and indeed has 
travelled that continent, Africa.  Too often the United Nations 
has turned a blind eye to the terrible tragedy, the grinding 
poverty, the debt burden and the terrible violations of human 
rights in Africa.  I hope, as part of this debate, that we will 
have an opportunity to address that issue as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last issue I want to touch on is the question of Iraq.  The 
hon. member talked about United Nations policies on sanctions.  I 
had the privilege of participating in a delegation which 
travelled last month to Iraq, sponsored by a group from Quebec, 
Objection de conscience.  What we have seen in that country are 
humanitarian, environmental and social disasters as a result of 
the implementation of United Nations sanctions.  Our government 
has talked about human security as being the cornerstone of our 
foreign policy, but how can we speak of human security in Iraq 
when over 500,000 innocent children have died as a direct result 
of this cruel and inhumane sanctions policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that the policy must be changed.  Indeed, the 
last two UN humanitarian co-ordinators for Iraq have resigned. 
Denis Halliday resigned. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the co-ordinator put it, “We are destroying an entire society. 
It is as simple and as terrifying as that”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned last week that the current UN humanitarian 
co-ordinator, Hans Von Sponeck, is also resigning in despair over 
the failure of this sanctions policy in Iraq.  The head of the 
World Food Programme has also announced her resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to plead with the Government of Canada 
to show leadership and to call for the lifting of these inhumane 
sanctions on the people of Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by once again welcoming this debate.  In the remaining 
hours of the debate I look forward to continuing to discuss how 
we can strengthen and reform the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House will 
continue the debate until 12:05 p.m., in order that we will have 
a full hour for Private Members' Business. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
already had the opportunity to speak to the motion by my 
colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, but I would like to add 
a few points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first time we discussed this motion, I noted its 
difficulties and limits with respect to the concept of 
like-minded nations.  Obviously, if we have a bill from the 
government, for example the upcoming budget, and I invite the 
four opposition parties, we are like minded.  It seems fairly 
easy to unanimously oppose something, someone or some bill. 
When it comes to like-minded nations, apart from developing 
awareness, from saying how good we are and that we are on the 
right track, I am not sure we will reach the desired end.  That 
said, it does not mean doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the consequences of this concept, which is already 
several years old, is that groups already exist but do not have 
the backing of the major international organizations, which have 
been in existence since, the second world war, the 1960s or the 
1970s. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only think, for example, of the two groups, when the 
issue of genetically modified organisms was discussed. We had 
the Miami Club and others. Instead of seeking a solution, we 
divided ourselves. However, I want to stress that the beauty of 
Motion M-30 is that it develops an awareness to all international 
organizations. It might have been advisable to give priority to 
one or two, instead of providing examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask you a question, since you have 
been following world events since World War II. How many 
international organizations have been created since, and how 
many have disappeared? Not many. 
International organizations were created and more continue to be 
added every year. The result is that their duties are added or 
changed, and there is duplication. People, including 
parliamentarians in this House, must humbly recognize that they 
cannot keep track of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I referred to the hierarchy among international 
organizations. This morning, we talked a lot about Kosovo and 
about the gulf war. During the gulf war, the UN assumed a large 
part of the decision-making process. A few years later, the case 
of Kosovo came up. Because some members did not think it was 
effective enough, the UN was replaced by NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, depending on what is going on at the international level, we 
choose those organizations that we like. Another situation where 
people pick and choose is in the case of trade disputes between 
Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they think they have a better chance of winning out over 
Canada in the WTO, they are going to opt for the WTO.  If they 
think the chances there are less good, they will opt for the 
free trade agreement.  There is a problem.  Which is the more 
important?  The bilateral agreements, the international, the 
multilateral?  No one knows.  The decision is made at the time. 
I have referred to the UN and to NATO.  Which is more important? 
Depending on what the Americans want, they are going to opt for 
the UN, for NATO or for some other organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed high time to think seriously about the 
internationalization of absolutely everything.  Today there is 
frequent reference to the sovereignty of a country, but finally 
something is relinquished.  I do not know if I can use marriage 
as an example, not having the experience myself, but it is a bit 
like when people get married. 
Two people marry—whether or not they are of the same sex, and 
that will be voted on later today—and they decide to pool certain 
things, accept certain obligations, and thus relinquish some of 
their sovereignty, because of their marriage.  On the 
international level, it is the same thing, when it comes down to 
it.  We relinquish more and more of our sovereignty in 
international organizations and lose more and more of ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequently, in Foreign Affairs or elsewhere, there is a desire 
to put an initiative in place, but we are reminded that this is 
contrary to an agreement signed with this or that organization. 
In another case, we will say “Yes, that is what we should do”. 
But then we are told that it cannot be done, because of the free 
trade agreement, the UN, NATO.  So we are extremely limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we support what Motion M-30 proposes, as we did before 
the last session was prorogued.  I can tell hon. members that 
profound reflection will be required.  I could spend days 
discussing the matter, but unfortunately my time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The time provided for 
Private Members' Business has expired.  The hon. member for 
Richmond—Arthabaska will have four minutes when next this item 
comes before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-23—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to deal with the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre on Tuesday, February 15, 2000 relating to the alleged 
disclosure of Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of 
Canada in relation to benefits and obligations, to a third party 
before the introduction and first reading of the bill in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter 
to the attention of the House, as well as the opposition House 
leader, the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader and the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley 
for the assistance they have offered to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue raised by the hon. member for Calgary Centre concerned 
the premature disclosure of Bill C-23 by the Minister of Justice 
to a special interest group which subsequently did an in-depth 
analysis of the bill before it was actually introduced and read a 
first time in the House. 
In his presentation the hon. member argued that this behaviour 
was contrary to the parliamentary law and practices of the House.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand the frustrations of the hon. member regarding 
the circulation of documents that are of a confidential nature 
and I have ruled on this in the past. Certainly, the Chair is of 
the opinion that government bills, once placed on notice, should 
be kept confidential until introduced in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing this in mind, the Chair wishes to emphasize that this is not the 
first time that a case of this nature has been raised on the 
floor of the House. 
In fact, a question of privilege with certain similarities to 
the present one was before the House on January 18 and 19, 1984. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer members to the ruling Speaker Francis gave on January 
19, 1984 and which can be found at page 563 of the <I>Debates</I>. 
He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of consultation is an important part in the 
development of proposals if they are to succeed in the public 
interest— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are any number of situations where drafts of bills have 
been circulated and no further action has been taken with regard 
to them.  Surely the Chair cannot be placed in a position of 
determining whether a document or a piece of paper, or whatever 
it is—it is certainly not a document of the House—can or cannot 
be circulated, or that the Speaker in some way should regulate 
the persons to whom such a document could be circulated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the same opinion as Speaker Francis.  Although the 
members of the House should always be the first ones to examine 
legislation after it has been introduced and read the first time, 
this rule must be balanced against the need for the government to 
consult both experts and the public when developing its 
legislative proposals.  The form and content of such legislative 
proposals is entirely left to the discretion of the government. 
Once introduced and read a first time in the House, the text is 
officially made public and the legislative process in parliament 
is initiated. The Chair must rule that the matter raised by the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre does not constitute a prima facie 
case of privilege nor a contempt of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Calgary Centre and all 
of the other interveners for raising this matter.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 15, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in 
relation to benefits and obligations, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate today 
regarding Bill C-23.  I believe it to be a reasonable and sound 
bill.  It is after all an administrative bill which promotes the 
objectives of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note that several of my colleagues have already 
provided compelling arguments for the adoption of this 
legislation.  They have, and quite rightfully so, noted that the 
proposed amendments to modernize benefits and obligations are 
fundamentally about fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note that I will be sharing my time with my 
learned friend and a very prominent person, the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada in its May 1999 ruling in M. v H. sent 
a clear signal that governments cannot limit benefits or 
obligations to opposite sex common law relationships.  This bill 
will ensure that federal laws reflect the values of Canadians, 
values that are enshrined in that sacred of documents, the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modernization of benefits and obligations act will treat 
common law same sex relationships and common law opposite sex 
relationships equally under the law. The act recognizes that same 
sex couples in committed relationships are entitled to the same 
benefits and obligations as their unmarried opposite sex 
counterparts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be reassured that the proposed legislation does 
not change the legal definition of marriage.  Marriage is clearly 
defined in Canadian law as being the union of two persons of the 
opposite sex.  Although a few European countries, Denmark, Sweden 
and Norway, by way of example, have limited recognition of same 
sex relationships, a distinction is maintained in the law between 
marriage and same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is in line with what is happening elsewhere in 
the country.  Several provinces have already begun to amend their 
benefits and obligations legislation.  For example, in 1997 
British Columbia amended numerous statutes to include same sex 
partners.  In June of 1999 Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 
regulations to grant to same sex partners the same benefits and 
obligations that are available to opposite sex common law 
partners.  In October 1999, to comply with the supreme court 
decision in M. v H., the province of Ontario passed omnibus 
legislation to bring 67 statutes in compliance with the ruling, 
and it was done within 48 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, more than 200 private sector Canadian companies 
currently give benefits to their employees' same sex partners, as 
do many municipalities, hospitals, libraries and community and 
social service institutions across this great country of ours. 
Clearly a majority of Canadians acknowledge and accept that same 
sex common law couples should have legal rights and obligations 
similar to common law couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is necessary to make a distinction between 
common law and dependency relationships.  For example, the 
conjugal common law relationship, be it of the opposite or same 
sex, is very different from a relationship between members of the 
same family or long time roommates.  A number of adult Canadians 
currently reside with elderly parents, siblings or other 
relatives.  Extending benefits and obligations to people involved 
in all of these forms of relationships would have far-reaching 
consequences for individuals and for society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many federal statutes currently extend limited benefits 
and obligations to family relationships, further study is 
required to determine if it would be appropriate to treat family 
relationships in a similar manner as common law couples in all or 
at least in some of the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, who led off debate last Tuesday on this 
very important bill, has referred the question of dependency to a 
parliamentary committee where the proper consultation and 
discussion can take place.  Canadians need to be brought into the 
discussion and included in an examination of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a little time to outline some of the things that 
need to be looked at and discussed.  For example, take the case 
of an elderly women living with her son and daughter-in-law. 
Should the younger couple's combined income be included in the 
senior citizen's calculation of her eligibility for the 
guaranteed income supplement or under the old age security?  I do 
not know the answer to that.  I think we should find out.  Or, 
consider the example of children caring for parents in their 
home.  In one case a daughter supports her widowed father.  In 
the house next door another woman provides for both her mother 
and father.  How would we treat these cases?  I do not know, but 
we should find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would relationships of dependency apply to any two people who 
live together or to limited numbers as long as they are under the 
same roof?  I do not know the answer to that.  Again, we need to 
find out.  Would the government exclude all relatives, as France 
does now, or exclude only opposite sex common law couples, as 
Hawaii has chosen to do?  We need to study that.  More to the 
point, are Canadians prepared to assume the obligations that are 
part and parcel of this legislation?  The fact is, the issue goes 
far beyond simply extending benefits.  Bill C-23 also imposes 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objectives in considering changes to the system should be to 
encourage rather than discourage people from taking care of each 
other.  While benefits which reflect dependency would likely be 
welcomed, it is unclear whether the accompanying legal 
obligations should be imposed on individuals for those relatives 
with whom they reside.  This needs further study to know exactly 
what that means.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equally important consideration is that even if such a system 
were created at the federal level it would only apply to areas of 
federal jurisdiction.  Many pieces of legislation that grant 
benefits and impose obligations are now divided between or shared 
among the federal, provincial and territorial governments.  More 
and more of our social programs are seamless, necessitating 
consultation and co-operation with our provincial and territorial 
colleagues and partners.  This is exactly what the Minister of 
Justice wants to pursue, as announced last Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not preclude discussion which has already 
started, and rightfully so.  This is a huge and very important 
issue, not only to the House but to all Canadians, on whether and 
how to acknowledge the nature and reality of the many types of 
dependent relationships.  The government will carefully examine 
the findings of current studies being conducted into this issue. 
It seems obvious that there may be many remaining issues to be 
resolved.  It is important that we take the necessary time to do 
our homework and get it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we have an immediate requirement to extend 
benefits and obligations to same sex partners.  The supreme court 
ruling is clear.  It has sent a clear message that same sex 
couples must be treated equally to opposite sex common law 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a just, fair and honourable people.  They do not 
like discrimination.  They do not like intolerance.  They believe 
in fairness.  They believe in tolerance and equal treatment under 
the law.  It is now up to us as legislators to ensure that the 
laws of the land comply with the direction given to us by the 
courts and the court of public opinion.  By amending these 68 
statutes, affecting some 20 departments and agencies, in one 
comprehensive bill we can quickly and efficiently modernize many 
laws that are currently out of sync with Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members of the House to vote accordingly and to 
endorse this necessary administrative legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the comments of the member opposite. 
He brought up a couple of points which I would like him to 
clarify. Regarding his plea to have all members of the House vote 
for this legislation, I can assure him that I will not be voting 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned taking direction from the courts.  One thing we 
must remember is that there was some direction given by the House 
last June when it voted to affirm the definition of marriage.  I 
would like his comments on why that definition is not affirmed in 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned many areas that needed clarification.  How are we 
going to apply this law when it is based on sexual activity and 
when other relationships of dependency are not clarified?  How 
are we going to do that?  If this needs to be done, as I believe 
it does, then why have we not opened up this bill to more broad 
public input?  Would that input not help to solve some of the 
problems that he indicated still exist with this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the hon. 
member that the definition of marriage is already in law.  It is 
built into the laws of Canada.  Therefore, it really is 
unnecessary in this instance to reassert it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the member's second question, we are not about to 
bring in sex police or anything else that he might have alluded 
to in terms of enforcement.  This is simply an administrative 
bill that is a fair bill.  It ensures that Canadians, whoever 
they are, are treated with tolerance, compassion and respect.  We 
will do it in a manner consistent with the values that all or at 
least most Canadians hold, and it is important that we proceed 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is immigration, Indian affairs, the Nisga'a treaty, 
or other issues relating to a whole host of things, it is always 
amazing to me to hear Reform members talk in code.  They talk in 
code in a manner that is inconsistent with the very fundamental 
principles of this great country of ours. 
Canadians reject outright what they represent and the kind of 
nonsense they promote.

politics of hope.  On the government side we will continue to 
maintain the politics of hope because that is what Canadians, who 
are fair, tolerant and compassionate, want us to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we should perhaps examine what this bill is and what it is not. 
It is a response to a Supreme Court of Canada decision, M v H. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament, under our system of modified separation of powers, 
is a co-ordinate institution with the court and must respond to 
and accept supreme court decisions in our area of constitutional 
competence.  The only solution other than that is by way of 
constitutional amendment seeking to override a supreme court 
decision, and that is a very difficult hurdle; or it is by use of 
the notwithstanding clause, and by consensus of parliament all 
parties, since the adoption of the charter of rights, accept that 
that is not a remedy to be used at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have responded appropriately to the Supreme Court of Canada 
decision.  It is on that basis that I support this bill, and my 
constituents, as good Canadians, understanding that we live under 
the rule of law, will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, though, that the nature of the bill, the limited 
objective that it has, explains what in terms of legal drafting 
might be called a somewhat inelegant, dull or pedestrian 
formulation.  It is a compendium of 68 different federal laws 
which are changed as a result of this bill.  It is not, however, 
a declaration of same sex rights or a code of new relationships. 
That is not its function.  It simply establishes certain legal 
consequences of same sex relations applying to 68 different areas 
of federal responsibility.  That is what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Larger issues were thoughtfully raised by the Minister of 
Justice and by my colleague, the member of parliament for 
Waterloo—Wellington, in his address on the larger issue of the 
legal consequences of relations of dependency.  It is one of the 
interesting things in the multicultural society in which we live, 
and which is very much present to me as a member of parliament 
for the city of Vancouver, that the new cultural communities have 
reaffirmed what has always been part of their heritage but seems 
to have disappeared in general in the older Canadian society. 
That is the extended family relationship and the notion that 
there are categorical imperatives, if we can call them that, of a 
moral nature but which are observed even more fully than in a 
legal relationship, between parents and their children, in the 
relationship of children to support parents, in the relationship 
of siblings within a family relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice promised study of this issue and it is 
an idea that seems historically right for reaffirmation.  I know 
of very many situations of aged parents supported by children.  I 
know very many situations of unmarried sisters or unmarried 
siblings living in support to each other.  It is correct, as the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington said, that these relationships 
will involve, if we are to give legal recognition to them, the 
same sort of intricate study of perhaps 68 or even 108 federal 
laws, and probably provincial laws, to get an answer, but it need 
not be a Kathleen Mavourneen situation, that it may be now or 
maybe never with the study.  We can rely on enough pressures 
within the cabinet and the government to be very sure that when 
we speak of a study it will be a very timely study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been problems that have been referred to and I will 
simply say that as a lawyer I do not see the same degree of 
problem solving difficulty as perhaps some of the people who have 
already spoken.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that if one gets into a legal dependency relationship 
one may logically lose the benefit of separate income tax filing 
benefits that apply to persons operating singly.  This is true as 
the law stands.  It may be a case for changing the law.  It may, 
however, also be a case for persons seriously considering whether 
they wish to offer themselves in a special category of a 
dependent relationship deserving recognition by the state, 
especially in our taxation laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned that people may change their mind.  The 
son who supports his aged mother may decide enough is enough and 
run away.  I am afraid if we establish legal dependency relation 
privileges and benefits it maybe one of the things we have to put 
up with; that we cannot renege unilaterally or casually on a 
relationship entered into.  These are the sorts of things that an 
intelligent legal study by a parliamentary committee, that is now 
envisaged for this new type of legal relationship, will get into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may also have problems of establishing a bona fide 
relationship of dependency.  I see this problem existing in 
relation to Bill C-23 as it now stands and any future bill on 
dependency relationships.  It is not an insuperable problem. It 
is the sort of thing that a good revenue minister is very well 
aware of because revenue ministers aim to catch up with gaps in 
the tax system and evasion, fraudulent or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that there are problems.  They can be 
studied in depth but the difficulty of solving them are not 
impossible or beyond the capacities of parliamentary committee of 
the calibre of an all-party committee set up in this particular 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reaffirm that the relationship of dependency, which the 
minister promised to study, is perhaps the most interesting idea 
to come out of this particular debate.  It is something on which 
the new Canadian communities have more to offer the older 
Canadian communities and to remind them of obligations that they 
have perhaps forgotten too easily, the older communities in the 
open society in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 goes a very important part of the way but it is only 
part of the way.  We should, in this sense, accept in good faith 
the undertaking by the minister and vote for Bill C-23 because it 
respects our obligation to respect decisions of the supreme court 
and bring federal laws in line in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have drafted it differently. It is a huge bill with 68 
different laws but it is an indication of the complexity of the 
problem in terms of tidying up the legal details.  That work has 
been done in this domain and the work in the other domain, the 
larger dependency relationship, will take at least as much time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, I commend this idea to you, Mr. Speaker.  One 
could note that in another capacity it seems to me that you, Mr. 
Speaker, have expressed ideas very similar to my own. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-23 is an act to modernize the Statues of Canada in relation to 
benefits and obligations is an act to ensure that common law 
relationships, both opposite and same sex, are treated equally 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians believed that this was already the practice in 
Canada, just as they believed that pay equity was already 
established.  Canadians have had their eyes opened over the last 
few years as we New Democrats in the House of Commons have had to 
constantly, week after week, remind the government of its 
obligations to follow the law and to treat people equally and 
fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in Bill C-23 are about fairness.  They will ensure 
that in keeping with the Supreme Court of Canada decision in May 
1999 same sex common law couples have the same obligations and 
benefits as opposite sex common law couples.  The act will ensure 
that same sex couples have the same access as other Canadian 
couples to social benefits programs to which they have 
contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is supported by 70% of Canadians. 
As Canadians we recognize the diverse makeup of families in 
Canada.  We have come to understand and support same sex partners 
who are committed to each other and their families.  With that 
commitment comes the right to equal and fair treatment inferred 
by legislation in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act is not about special rights, as some in the House would 
suggest.  It is not about special treatment.  It is about 
fairness and equality, responsibility and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government has a hard time with those words when it 
comes to taxpayer dollars, but in this act that it what is 
intended:  responsibility and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a long overdue response by the government to the 
supreme court.  It is a long overdue recognition of same sex 
couples.  The supreme court case, M v H, which led to this act, 
was about support payments after the breakdown of a same sex 
relationship:  commitment, responsibility and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to legislation as a result of the bill are not about 
money.  In fact the finance department estimates that changes to 
the Income Tax Act to extend conjugal obligations to same sex 
couples will lead to an additional $10 million in revenues for 
the federal government.  I am surprised this did not come about 
sooner, as we see the government trying to get as many dollars as 
it can through EI and CPP surpluses and numerous other reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will save taxpayers and litigants expensive court 
battles which are the result of out of date and contradictory 
legislation.  Some 68 acts will be amended as a result.  I will 
mention just a few:  the Employment Insurance Act, the Family 
Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act, the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security 
Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces have already begun to amend their legislation. 
Since 1997 British Columbia has amended numerous statutes, 
including six core statutes to add same sex couples.  In June 
1999 Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations to grant same 
sex couples the same benefits and obligations that are available 
to opposite sex common law couples.  In October 1999, to comply 
with the supreme court decision, Ontario passed omnibus 
legislation to bring 67 statutes into compliance with the ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament passed legislation, Bill C-78, that extended survivor 
pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service 
employees, as have Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British 
Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Yukon, Nunavut and 
the Northwest Territories.  As well, the majority of large cities 
in Canada and more than 200 private sector Canadian companies 
currently provide benefits to the same sex partner of their 
employees, as do many municipalities, hospitals, libraries, and 
social service institutions across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Immigration Act will not be 
amended with this legislation.  It is understood that 
requirements for such recognition are distinct from other 
benefits.  However, the minister of immigration has indicated a 
willingness to address this issue and New Democrats urge the 
government to move quickly on this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of Canadians support the legislation.  It is a step 
in the right direction.  I and my New Democratic Party colleagues 
will be supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think it is about time we cleared the air a little bit about some 
of the rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not create equality.  For that reason alone this 
member should be voting against the bill.  It is not equal 
because same gender couples, heterosexual and homosexual, must 
wait for one year before they qualify for benefits.  It is not 
equal to married couples and the definition of marriage will not 
be changed in the legislation.  The definition of marriage, under 
the common law of Canada, is defined as a union between a man and 
a woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely incorrect.  This does not create 
equality.  Many people have said that in the next step they will 
go after marriage.  I can tell the House today that there is no 
question in my mind that the vast majority of the members of the 
House will not support the change in the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member refers to a cost of $10 million and that somehow the 
government should have moved quicker on this. 
The facts are that only 1.6% of all same sex partners will ever 
qualify for benefits under the changes proposed in this 
legislation.  Officials have estimated that the government will 
make money on the changes because things like the GST credit will 
no longer extend to two persons but rather to only one 
partnership in which the partner income will be a clawback 
determinant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  This bill is not about equality between same 
sex partners and married persons.  It is very different. The 
member should acknowledge that because there is a discriminatory 
clause that says that there is a one year waiting period which 
will exclude 98.6% of all same sex partners she should be voting 
against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, seeing as that member is 
from the governing side, I think he should look to his minister 
to get clarity on the issue.  She has spoken in a different tone 
and has indicated that the bill is about equality and fairness. 
It is no surprise that on the government side one hand does not 
know what the other hand is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the bill does not ensure total equality for 
everyone.  The member is absolutely right.  That is at fault in 
the legislation and we will work hard to ensure that equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is not about marriage.  The issue is about 
benefits for same sex couples to ensure they are treated fairly 
under the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there needs to be some serious work on 
that side of the House when members on the backbench come out on 
one side saying that this is not about equality and fairness and 
the frontbench ministers saying that it is all about equality and 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it is no surprise to hear the government speaking one 
way and then another way.  It is whatever fits the mould. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am here today to speak in favour of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the bill are not only a reaction to the recent 
supreme court decision but, I would suggest, also reflects the 
need to acknowledge the contemporary reality of relationships 
that are not exclusively unions between men and women.  I think 
the spirit of the bill is closely tied to a sense of fairness, 
tolerance and equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will specifically address a few points that require some 
clarification.  First, there is a misconception that the bill 
alters the institution of marriage and the definition of spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill simply brings the federal government up to date 
with other governments and the private sector in expanding 
benefits and obligations to adults engaged in same sex common law 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it is wrong to think that extending benefits will create 
added or undue physical burdens on the federal treasury and the 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I think it is necessary to point out that the supreme 
court recently made a ruling that suggested that the federal 
government might enact statutes that are compatible with that 
court's rulings and the charter of rights specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill and the legal interpretation confirm that changes the 
bill would bring would not alter the definition of marriage. 
Marriage would still be defined as the union between a man and a 
woman with all its past and contemporary legal applications 
intact.  We should point out that Canadian courts, academics and 
ordinary citizens have continuously reaffirmed the first 1866 
British court case definition of marriage as being the union of 
one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress here by saying that there was also a 
1970 House of Lords decision on this very point, the case of 
Corbett v Corbett, where the individual, who appeared to be a 
woman had in fact been a man.  On the basis of genetics, the 
court decided that a man was always a man notwithstanding what he 
appeared to be otherwise.  To this day, Canadian courts have 
upheld the constitutionality of this definition.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, under the legislation the term spouse will only refer 
to a married man and woman.  Marital status will remain 
unaltered. Any existing federal statutes that include the term 
spouse will still only apply to married couples.  It is wrong to 
suggest that the provisions of Bill C-23 will alter the existing 
legal definitions with respect to the term marriage and all that 
that entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that some would try to use the legislation so that it 
might have the effect of turning back the clock to a time when 
social prejudice forced same sex relationships into the shadows. 
I would like to think as a society we pride ourselves on openness 
and compassion and that to ignore reality that is as old as time 
is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of one province in particular. An individual who taught 
in a school was given high approval ratings as a teacher until 
such time as it was learned by his employer that the individual 
was in fact gay. The terms of his dismissal were exclusively on 
the basis of his sexual orientation.  In that province it was 
allowed to pass because, as I understand it, there was no 
legislation to protect the individual.  I would think as a 
contemporary society and as a federal government we are long past 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also told that public opinion surveys indicate that 
Canadians by a two to one margin believe that same sex couples 
should have access to the same benefits and be subject to the 
same obligations as any man or woman presently engaged in a 
spousal or opposite sex common law relationship.  I ask those who 
are opposed to the bill to canvass their constituents to gain an 
accurate composite of opinion in their constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand there are people who are opposed to the bill.  I 
think that in the House most who oppose it do so on the basis of 
belief systems and value systems. We have to look beyond our own 
individual belief or value systems to the wider, larger picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also reasonable to expect that same sex couples should be 
treated in the same way as other conjugal relationships.  The 
time is long past when it was acceptable to characterize same sex 
relationships as deviant or odd, as some people would call them, 
or acts of rebellion against social conformity.  Same sex 
relationships for some are just as natural and regular as other 
types of relationships and it is not for us to treat them 
otherwise. That opinion reflects my views on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in the city of Sarnia in my riding there was the first 
gay pride parade.  I was approached about participating.  I had 
no problem whatsoever; I am not so insecure as to be afraid of a 
gay pride parade and I participated in it.  The shame of the 
whole thing was that not one other elected person in my riding 
was present, municipal or provincial; they could not find a 
councillor, a mayor or anyone who would go in the parade. There 
were 500 people in the city of Sarnia who participated in that 
parade.  I was quite proud to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not so insecure as to think that if I went to the parade 
that somebody would start a whisper campaign. My mother said to 
me that if I went to the parade, people may say things about me. 
The next day I happened to go to another event at the Polish 
Combatants Association.  I called my mother and said that I was 
concerned that people were starting to whisper saying they 
thought I was Polish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children who are in university and below were quite proud of 
me that I would go to the gay pride parade.  In this country 
there is a continuum of opinion, but I think a part of it is 
related to age.  Young people understand that there is equality 
in this country, that we are not all made the same and that we 
cannot all be the same.  It is like fingerprints; no two are the 
same.  In this continuum of relationships, one could argue in 
this continuum of sexuality, young people inherently understand 
that if somebody is different from someone else, it is not a big 
deal. 
It is not a criterion on which we want to discriminate or even to 
point out differences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children were quite proud that I would participate. I felt it 
was important to show everyone that alternative lifestyle choices 
are in some respect mainstream, no big deal, or nothing to get 
upset about and that they crosscut every facet of social 
identities. Alternative lifestyles, although not perhaps my 
lifestyle, are valid.  There is no legal, social, fiscal or 
political reason to treat those choices as anything else but 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is being described by some, and it is fair to make 
comment, as trend-setting or innovative because several provincial 
governments, including good old Ontario, that hotbed of liberal 
thought, British Columbia and Quebec have similar same sex laws. 
Also, in my riding private sector companies such as Dow Chemical 
have had them for a number of years.  Large corporations in 
particular have been extending benefits to same sex couples for 
some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been some expression of concern with respect to 
the confusion between federal and provincial laws, in other 
words, the federal statutes would in some way cause confusion 
with the provincial statutes.  I fail to understand how this 
would be the case because proposed federal legislation will only 
affect existing federal statutes. Provincial laws fall under 
corresponding provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the proposed federal legislation will not impact on 
provincial jurisdictions, it will not affect private sector 
companies nor non-governmental organizations. In fact over 200 
companies and organizations in the private sector have already 
extended benefits to adults in same gender relationships, as have 
many municipalities, quasi-governmental organizations such as 
some hospitals and other public or municipal institutions such as 
libraries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 brings us up to the same level of benefit coverage 
that is available in several other provincial jurisdictions and 
in the private and municipal sectors.  Even if the supreme court 
ruling had never been handed down, I would suggest it would have 
been odd that the federal government not introduce legislation 
similar to what is included in Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been some talk that by extending benefits to same 
sex couples, an undue fiscal burden would be placed upon the 
federal government.  This legislation aside, certainly when 
legislation is introduced for which there may be a fiscal 
implication, it is a fair question to ask having regard to the 
cost of a piece of legislation, having regard to the sector of 
the population which may be touched by the legislation, what the 
overall cost is, what it means to the taxpayer, the taxpayer 
being somebody whose sexual orientation is not even known. It is 
important to study fiscal implications of any bill regardless of 
a person's sexual orientation.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, if we take the time to examine the bill and 
consider the overall ramifications, we come to the conclusion 
that the changes would be revenue neutral.  It is important to 
remember that while the provisions of Bill C-23 extend benefits, 
which is one thing the public has latched onto, they also extend 
obligations to same gender couples.  Any financial gain a couple 
would have gained would likely be offset by a higher taxation 
obligation, as a different status would require such things as 
income to be assessed jointly rather than separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are cases where one could make the argument that 
in a particular instance there is a benefit to this.  But we are 
talking about the overall envelope and what the Department of 
Finance has studied and what it has concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of obligation is how the GST credit can be 
claimed.  Currently two individuals involved in a same sex 
relationship can individually claim two separate GST credits and 
file two separate income tax returns based on separate individual 
incomes, increasing the combined value that their credits are 
worth.  Under the bill this practice would not be permitted. 
Extended benefits would likely beget higher total taxation 
obligations.  In this case any extra money flowing out of the 
treasury to cover the cost of extended benefits would be recouped 
by the added money that would come in on the revenue side.  All 
indications are that this is a revenue neutral matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would cost taxpayers money would be the ensuing legal costs 
of contesting personal discrimination suits that could be 
launched because of federal government refusal to conform with 
the charter of rights and freedoms.  Those who oppose this 
legislation might address this concern.  There is a rising 
awareness in this country of the importance of the charter and of 
its application in a myriad of situations, this general round 
being one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my final point.  I would respect anyone's 
right to oppose this bill but we should consider the consequences 
of not proceeding with it.  I want to emphasize that I understand 
that there are people who see this from a different perspective. 
I appreciate that.  I might have been the same way at some point 
in the past.  I understand people's right to oppose this because 
of their religious beliefs and value system.  I completely 
understand that.  I am not saying that mine is superior to 
theirs.  I just think that at the moment this is where the 
mainstream and the majority of Canadians are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 fits in with the overall philosophy of fairness that 
the government ascribes to.  We must not lose sight of last 
year's supreme court ruling that gave effect to this bill.  It 
prodded it along.  In M v H the supreme court ruled that 
governments cannot limit benefits and obligations to married and 
opposite sex common law relationships.  If this bill had not been 
introduced, or if the House chooses to defeat it, we must 
understand that the federal government's general operations would 
run afoul of this constitutional obligation as laid out by the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitutional system demands that its governments strictly 
adhere to its precepts and that includes the charter of rights of 
freedoms.  It would not be able to operate indefinitely without 
doing so.  One can argue that if it did, a constitutional crisis 
could develop.  That might be taking it a distance, but it 
undermines the respect for the charter.  No government can 
operate outside the constitutional box for that long.  For this 
reason Bill C-23 is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that this is not a piece of legislation 
that has been ordered, that the supreme court has held a gun to 
our head saying that we must do this.  The supreme court is there 
to tell us whether a piece of legislation is consistent with the 
charter, whether it is consistent with the spirit intent of the 
charter, and whether a particular piece of legislation which is 
sensitive to the rights of minorities in this country, stands up 
to that very important standard as laid down in the charter. 
The bill simply brings us into line with what the supreme court 
has interpreted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair for some people to say that the Supreme Court of 
Canada should not be telling the Parliament of Canada what to do, 
and I agree.  In this place we can ultimately decide what we are 
to do, but we should be mindful of the charter.  Unless there is 
some overriding reason to opt out of the charter, and I suggest 
that would have to be a very severe case, we should be mindful at 
all times of the rules of fairness, equity and equality.  The 
only way we could ever get out of it is by invoking the 
notwithstanding clause and in this case it would a no-go, a 
drastic response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to operate indefinitely by invoking the 
notwithstanding clause every time certain interests suggest we 
should, we would end up undoubtedly questioning the legitimacy of 
the charter which guarantees the rights we hold very close as a 
democratic society and as citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might choose to diminish the supreme court ruling by 
trotting out the bogeyman of judge made law or by saying the 
supreme court interpreted the charter in the wrong way and 
therefore the House can ignore it, just disregard it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This line of thought is extremely dangerous.  By deploying such 
characterizations critics are effectively delegitimizing the 
entire judicial system by suggesting that some legal rulings are 
not as sound as others.  For our constitutional system to work we 
must faithfully accept that rulings made by the Canadian 
judiciary are sound and appropriately reflect the present meaning 
of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that there may be some point in the future where the 
supreme court makes a ruling that flies in the face of all logic, 
flies in the face of where we are as a country.  There may be 
that odd ball exception every 10, 15, 50 or 100 years where the 
notwithstanding clause could be invoked, but this is clearly not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful for having had the opportunity to address the 
House on this matter.  I hope by offering my views on Bill C-23 
that I have been able to allay some concerns people in my riding 
have expressed to me.  I welcome any questions or comments at 
this time.

because I have watched him in other arenas.  The hon. gentleman

struck down a provision in the Ontario family law act defining

relationship who have lived together for more than three years. 
The court ruled that it was unconstitutional to exclude same sex 
couples from the second category but it left the issue of 
marriage untouched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member three questions.  First, 
does he agree that the supreme court left the issue of marriage 
untouched?  Second, would he agree that the bill on a legal basis 
changes the status of marriage vis-à-vis where it stands at the 
present time?  Should Bill C-23 be cognizant of and take into 
account what was passed in June 1999 when the definition of 
marriage was endorsed whole heartedly by the House as being a 
union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others?  Could 
the member address those questions?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
those questions.  There is a certain level of fear that is not 
based upon any reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this piece of legislation in a continuum of time. 
Who would have thought 30 or 40 years ago that we would be in 
this place talking about something that is popularly referred to 
as gay rights?  Who would have thought 25 years ago that there 
would be a movement not just in Canada but on this continent that 
would be called the gay rights movement?  It was inconceivable, 
but we have to recognize that society is changing, certain 
values, beliefs and attitudes.  Attitudes tie into the belief 
system and value system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is a relatively old institution.  The basic institution 
called marriage will not be undone in this place or in a 
provincial House because of a social movement which may have 
started 20 years ago or because of changes in attitude toward 
people who are generally referred to as homosexual or lesbian. 
That will not destroy the institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is concern expressed that one day the nine judges of the 
Supreme Court of Canada will wake up and say that this has been 
around for 20 years, that they have read about it in newspapers 
and that they will undo marriage.  The supreme court is not about 
to undo marriage.  The only way that marriage can be undone is 
through the collective action of this House and the 10 provincial 
houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a man and a woman are about to enter into a marriage, who 
lays down the regulations about who can marry?  It is the 
provinces.  They dictate everything from who is qualified to 
perform a marriage.  I cannot perform a marriage but I have some 
friends in the clergy who are licensed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces also lay down degrees of consanguinity which deal 
with my being unable to marry my sister or my first cousin.  The 
idea that this place or the nine justices down the street will 
wake up one day and say that marriage is over after eons of 
civilization is slightly paranoid.  Marriage is defined not only 
by the courts but most recently reaffirmed in the House a year 
ago. There is a conspiracy theory, which is the toughest to deal 
with. There is an ongoing whisper campaign that somehow we will 
overturn it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Sarnia—Lambton for his 
speech on this very important piece of legislation and raise a 
couple of points he referenced in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concerns the fact that some individuals would like to 
portray this debate, this issue, this bill, as trend setting, 
groundbreaking and innovative.  I wonder if it makes more sense 
to portray the legislation in terms of housekeeping and necessary 
work on our part to bring federal statutes in line with the 
values of Canadians and with numerous judicial and legislative 
rulings in the country to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the fact that the member referenced 
differences of opinion on the whole issue of extending the 
benefits to same sex couples that exist now to opposite sex 
couples.  He referenced that there were differences that should 
be respected.  I agree with that. 
However, I wonder if he shares our concern that positions have 
been stated in the House which are thinly veiled attempts to 
promote and endorse discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation.  I wonder if we are really talking about 
acknowledging the rights of every person in the country to 
participate as equal citizens and about ensuring we acknowledge 
loving and committed relationships whether they are same sex or 
opposite sex.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for those questions.  On the question of housekeeping I 
totally agree.  I recall in the last parliament we amended the 
federal rights act regarding employees of federal institutions. 
That was also regarded as an attack upon the institution of 
marriage.  Even in my moments of free association I could not 
make that connection.  As I pointed out, there are provinces that 
have already enacted similar legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the earlier legislation we were 12 years behind 
some provinces.  We were 10 years behind good old Ontario and 12 
years or thereabouts behind the province of Quebec.  It is 
housekeeping.  We are getting caught up although in this case we 
are not terribly behind in terms of the pack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other point made, this is about a societal 
shift.  We have become more aware of society saying that people 
who are labelled homosexual or lesbian are part of society.  They 
are just as important and equally vital to society.  They should 
be recognized as part of society and extended the same benefits 
and obligations as those we extend to others who happen not to be 
homosexual and happen to be something called heterosexual.

the best—and citizens have access to the skills and knowledge 
they need to excel.  Where citizens—regardless of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has spoken and we share his vision.  Budget 
2000 will make Canada the place to be in this new century.

permanent features of our landscape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today more than 98% of all the farms in Canada remain family

Canada's wealth, despite the fact that only 3% of Canada's 
population farms and only 6.8% of land in Canada is being farmed.

contributions to rural communities.

C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the CSN, a union can only disaffiliate itself with the 
support of an absolute majority of the members paying dues, not 
a majority of those who vote. So, this is not the same as the 
famous 50% plus one rule, which they keep telling us about as if 
it were the only existing democratic rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about this, Mr. Larose made the following leap of 
logic: a vote for Quebec sovereignty would be comparable to a 
union affiliation, not a disaffiliation. Separating from the 
Canada that we know would be equivalent to joining a renewed 
Canada. Therefore, 50% plus one would be enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such illogical reasoning can only be based on one premise, which 
was stated by Mr. Larose. According to him, Quebec never joined

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are 
celebrating Heritage Day.  Our Canadian heritage is a reflection 
of our pride as Canadians, our loyalty to our country, our 
feeling that we are honoured to be citizens of the best country 
in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian heritage is the link between our people from coast 
to coast to coast, regardless of sex, race or religious belief. 
Our heritage explains our past, creates our present and paves the 
way to our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all Canadians to take the time to explore this great 
country which I and my family have adopted. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us all take time to visit our national historical sites and 
monuments.  Let us take time to introduce our children to their 
country in all of its beauty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
February is heart and stroke month and many Canadians' lives have 
been or will be affected by congenital heart defect, CHD, which 
is ranked as the most common birth defect, affecting an estimated 
one in 100 children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of these children have repairable heart defects and 
require no surgery, at least half will face one, if not many 
surgeries in their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents, Michael and Carol Ferry, have a daughter, 
Natalie, who was born with a severe and complex heart defect. 
Just 18 months old, Natalie will soon be preparing for her third 
and hopefully final surgery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians give generously every February in support of the Heart 
and Stroke Foundation.  As a result, ongoing medical advances in 
the next decade could surpass all progress made during the last 
century, which will help to ensure that children with CHD, such 
as Natalie Ferry, will lead a rich, full and normal life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday the HRD minister told the House “I confirm again that I 
wrote to my deputy and indicated that she would be the sole 
decision maker in terms of projects that were approved in the 
riding of Brant”.  But that letter said absolutely nothing about 
approval authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask, who was approving these grants? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me clarify three things.  First and 
foremost, no rules were broken in the application of grants and 
contributions in the riding of Brant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with regard to transitional jobs fund money and Canada 
jobs funds, the terms and conditions were met in every case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and in accordance with Treasury Board guidelines, it was 
the deputy minister who approved Canada jobs fund money in the 
riding of Brant in November. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is a nice try but she wrote a letter that was simply not 
true.  The deputy minister already had signing authority, and we 
know that.  What we are concerned about is actual approval 
authority.  The minister remained the only person who could 
actually approve those grants to her riding, yet she tried to 
blame it on her deputy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that her letter delegated approval authority 
to her deputy minister.  It did not.  How long does the minister 
think this trick can last? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no blame because the terms and 
conditions were not breached.  No rules were broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did happen with these grants and contributions was that men 
and woman, who otherwise would not have had the opportunity, are 
now working and are very thankful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
I know some people who are not thankful today and those are the 
taxpayers who are paying a huge amount of cash to look after the 
minister's insatiable desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She says that there is no blame here whatsoever.  She pretended 
she knew nothing about this $1 billion boondoggle for months 
before she actually let on.  She pretended that her riding 
actually qualified for grants when she knew full well that it did 
not.  Now she is pretending that it is her deputy minister who 
makes all the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the pretend minister stand up and say that she takes 
ministerial responsibility for this boondoggle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

issues before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>   Order, please.  I would ask the hon. 
minister to please stay away from those kinds of words.  The hon. 
Minister of Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member 
makes reference to the fact that $1 billion is missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me convey again to the House that today at the request of 
members of parliament and the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development Canada, we have issued the equivalent of 
10,000 pages of information that documents the grants and 
contributions in every single riding of members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is wrong to suggest that $1 billion is missing. 
It is all there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
week the human resources minister told the House that she had 
granted her deputy minister the authority to approve CJF grants 
in the minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we know that simply was not the case and that the deputy 
minister had only been given signing authority.  There is a huge 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister tell the House that she had granted the 
deputy minister the sweeping powers that go with approval 
authority when that simply was not the case? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, because it is true.  Indeed, it was done 
in accordance with Treasury Board guidelines. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a huge discrepancy between what she told the House last 
week and what was revealed in that letter.  The minister has been 
unable to satisfactorily explain this big difference and why she 
told the House something and then revealed something completely 
different in a letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this gaping contradiction between what she has told the 
House and what was revealed in that letter, how can the public 
and this place have any confidence at all in anything the 
minister says? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly the public cannot have any 
confidence in anything that this party says.  It has continually 
talked about the missing $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in the context of all the grants and contributions that 
have been identified in ridings of members across the country, 
that has proven to be wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the government's intention to turn this committee into a

<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is his party being reasonable by tabling hundreds of clippings 
from old newspapers in the House of Commons instead of sharing 
the views of his party?  No.  This is not being reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has simply tried to advance the bill to the next 
stage.  We have said we were ready to hear up to 45 witnesses in 
committee, provided that doing so did not delay proceedings.

than a few.

the clinics that the member refers to comply with the Canada

increased the transfers to the provinces.  It said at that time

there were some areas in the country where the level of 
unemployment was lower than 12%.  Because of the pockets of 
unemployment we decided that they were to receive grants. The 
riding of Kootenay—Columbia had six projects.  The riding of 
Nanaimo—Alberni had seven projects.  The riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan had six projects.  I have a long list which I

feel enough confidence in his minister to explain such a simple 
concept of pockets. Not only is the minister not clear on the

public servants were the ones who had to pick up the pieces for 
decisions made during the election campaign.  People do not 
realize that this problem is not limited to the transitional

order to buy votes in the last election.

every one of the members who has risen received all sorts of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to 
get back to the memo that comes from the transitional jobs fund 
dealing with grants and how they are approved, it says that the 
minister and her officials say that each region was using its own 
approach in considering if a pocket was or was not eligible.  It 
seems that how they pick pockets on that side is a matter of 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell us how she proposes to pick the pockets 
and could she tell us how the taxpayers should be left on the 
hook once she does it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, part of the strength of the transitional 
jobs fund and the Canada jobs fund was to allow local directors 
to help meet the needs of local communities.  There is a 
flexibility that is associated with both these programs. As we 
said that flexibility was used in a number of Reform ridings. 
Surely that great western party that touts the need for 
flexibility would not want the control to be drawn back to 
Ottawa. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, so 
far we have heard three different ways they pick the pockets in 
this place.  One is as the minister said last week, that it was a 
period of time, that it was a pocket of time.  Next she got up 
and said it was actually— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We could stay away from the words “picked 
pockets”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, it was a 
period of time of high unemployment.  Then the minister said it 
was not a period of time at all, it was actually a geographic 
location.  Now we find out it may be that or it may be something 
else or it may be whatever they woke up and decided it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the approval process is not local at all.  It 
appears to be tied together quite closely to the front bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister say that picking a pocket of high 
unemployment deserves to be done in her office? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

time with his colleagues, those members of the Reform Party who 
wrote to me, through their offices, sometimes individually, 
saying to please get the approval of the Canada jobs fund 
completed for their riding.  Some made phone calls asking where 
the approvals were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me what that party is.  Its members stand in the

scrap programs like the Canada jobs fund, but when they go back

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have made clear to the House, in my riding there were no 
rules broken. The terms and conditions of the projects were

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister is having trouble explaining that aspect.  Let us 
move to another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weekend the Prime Minister compared the billion dollar 
boondoggle at human resources to Canadians not being able to 
balance their chequebooks, a poor analogy to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister is entrusted with billions of taxpayers' 
hard-earned dollars, he has a responsibility to keep track of 
them. Why does the Prime Minister try to minimize the bungling of 
a billion dollars as though it were a commonplace occurrence in 
his government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, they keep talking about billions of dollars. Everyone 
knows that there was an audit on cases for $200 million.  Out of 
459, 37 had problems.  Thirty-seven representing $33 million had 
problems.  As I said on Friday, and it is still the same, one 
more file was completed.  Only four more are to be completed. So 
far $5,974.93 has not been justified.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

theory, that this is not such a big deal after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister compared the loss and mismanagement of a 
billion dollars to Canadians accidentally going over budget at 
the end of the month. He said, “I think it happens to you at the 
end of month to see that you have spent a few dollars more than 
expected”.  That is what he said.  I can assure you, Mr. 
Speaker, that there are not too many Canadians who accidentally 
bungle a billion dollars.

mismanaged that a billion dollar bungle is a commonplace 
occurrence?

that was their duty to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditors reported that there were 37 cases with problems

method she had selected.  She just said it again a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask her again: Did her predecessor do the same?  I do not 
want her to repeat that she chose to do so; this, we know, as 
she has played the same tape over three or four times.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

jobs funding and indeed the Canada jobs fund, we felt it wise to 
include members of parliament who should know their communities, 
although I think we are going to find, as we just did, that many 
of them are not aware of the grants and contributions given to 
their ridings.  Members who do know their communities can have a 
voice as senior elected federal officials in those ridings on 
grants and contributions and their application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our point of view that makes sense and I would think the

<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is ducking the issue.  The question is whether or not 
projects were approved with members' involvement that do not meet 
the objectives of the program.  The fact is that good programs 
are being poisoned now for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have forwarded a copy of this e-mail to the auditor general 
and asked that it be investigated.  The political management of 
these funds is of huge concern to Canadians.  Again, will the

Mr. Speaker, once again Canadians are finding there is a direct

spouting about the HRDC scandal and what senior officials in his 
own department are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says $6,000 and senior officials say $90,000. 
The Prime Minister has constantly led Canadians to believe there 
was no problem.  He has diminished and downplayed the amount of

that occurred.  Who should Canadians trust, the officials who are 
simply doing their job and being asked to shoulder the blame, or 
the king of Shawinigan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are getting more and more into nicknames.

point.  I would reiterate that the Prime Minister is absolutely 
correct.  Of the 37 projects that we are reviewing, 33 have been 
closed and we have identified an overpayment that we will try to 
collect in the area of $5,974.93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the media article about the $83,000 that was 
portrayed as an overpayment, it is absolutely wrong.  The

I can inform the House that the project, Atlantic Furniture

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale,

Transport.  Since Pearson International Airport is in my riding 
of Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, many of my constituents 
want increased international air services for Canada with 
increased competition from overseas airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain why the government is not doing more 
to help Canadian carriers get a large share of international air 
routes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ with my distinguished colleague, but 
the air restructuring that we are going through has meant the 
opening up of more transborder routes to the United States and 
more international routes to Asia and to the Atlantic.  Many of 
those routes will be going from Toronto as well as from the other 
larger cities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I gave approval for Canada 3000 and Air Transat to fly 
to the United Kingdom and to Germany.  There have been 
applications from Canada 3000 to fly Southeast Asian routes. 
There will be more and more choices and more and more competition 
that will be offered from Canadian cities on international 
routes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 1997

no choice but to approve the projects from the Prime Minister's

</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Minister of Human Resources Development expect to 
maintain the confidence of Canadian taxpayers when dollars are

.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>*Question No. 12—<B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to AIDA/WFIP and the tree fruit industry: (<I>a</I>) what is 
the percentage differences in gross margin levels among 
commodities: For example, perennials, tree fruits, versus 
annuals, grains; (<I>b</I>) can the government provide information to 
show that commodity groups are not treated inequitably based on 
their relative use of eligible and ineligible expenses; (<I>c</I>) can 
the governement provide data that would indicate the AIDA program 
would still work should back to back below average returns be 
experienced in the base period; (<I>d</I>) can the government provide 
information to indicate that the inclusion of negative margins in 
the reference margins but reducing to zero in the claim year is 
more beneficial than reducing negative margins to zero for both 
the base period and the claim year; (<I>e</I>) can the government 
provide information to show if AIDA recognizes the special 
problems of perennial crops such as the little flexibilty to 
switch commodities and varieties? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B> (a) AIDA is a whole farm program so that support is not 
provided on a commodity basis. Data is not available on gross 
margins by commodity produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) AIDA provides a common basis of support for all commodities. 
There is no evidence to suggest that any commodities groups are 
being treated inequitably based on eligible versus ineligible 
expenses. Larger farms whether grain, tree fruits or other 
commodities would tend to have larger margins in dollar terms 
than smaller farms producing the same commodities. However, it is 
not the absolute size of the margin but the variation in the 
margins between the reference period and the claim year that triggers 
an AIDA payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Depending on the trend in the margins, AIDA can make 
payments continuously to bring farms up to 70% of the previous 
three year average. In the sense that AIDA payments can be 
triggered in periods where margins are declining, the program can 
work in back to back below average return years. However. the 
level of payment will reflect the historical margins. In 1999 
producers will be able to choose a reference period on which to 
base their payments, either the previous three years, or three of 
the previous five years, not counting the high and low income 
years. This will help to maintain their reference period margins 
as one of the low margin years can be dropped from the support 
calculations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) There is no evidence that ignoring negative margins in the 
reference period would have a significant impact on program 
payments versus the current design where negative margins are 
included in the reference period. Raising negative margins to 
zero in the reference period would be contrary to World Trade 
Organization, WTO, guidelines governing green programs and leave 
Canada open to trade action by our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On november 4, 1999, the Government of Canada announced that it 
is making a further $ 170 million available to cover negative 
margins under AIDA across the country. A good portion of farmers' 
negative margins will now be covered for both years of the 
program, 1998 and 1999. Along with allowing producers to choose a 
reference period another change will ensure that family and 
non-family labour are treated the same in calculating eligibility 
for 1999. These changes mean that a potential $1.07 billion in 
federal funding will be available to help farmers through two 
years of low international commodity prices and adverse weather. 
The changes are consistent with the advice received from the 
national safety nets advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) AIDA is not intended to provide support for producers until 
their plants mature and produce a reasonable yield. A producer 
must be able to finance the period when plants are not producing. 
AIDA will only cover the portion of the farm that is in 
production, but as with all other commodities it will provide 
payments when income falls dramatically. While perennial crops 
limit flexibility, this is also true of those who have little 
flexibility in the mix of their annual crops and it is true for 
those with large investments in specialized livestock facilities.

to rise today in the debate on Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to make adjustments to reflect our 
changing society, and to acknowledge advantages and obligations 
for same sex couples on the same basis as those conferred upon 
common law couples of the opposite sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further in this debate, I must make it clear 
that I am speaking for myself, since the Progressive 
Conservative Party has chosen to allow its members to vote 
freely on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sign of the times that this is at least the second 
occasion in two years on which the members of this House have 
had the opportunity to debate this matter.  We can therefore say 
that this is definitely the reflection of a new reality.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this demonstrates how the thinking of Canadians 
has evolved, as they are now prepared to accept a certain degree 
of recognition of same sex partners.  That is what the 
government's bill proposes, nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Bill C-23 proposes an updating of some 68 federal 
statutes in order to reflect numerous decisions by the courts of 
this country, the most recent of these being the May 1999 
Supreme Court of Canada decision in M. v H., to which several of 
my colleagues have already referred.  At the very most, this is 
a technical bill aimed at correcting a discriminatory definition 
of the expression common-law spouses, which has until now been 
limited to heterosexual couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Must this bill be considered a threat to the institution of 
marriage?  Or are we to consider it legitimate recognition of a 
social situation in Canada and the simple adjustment of federal 
laws in effect?  Members will have understood that I am in the 
latter camp, since marriage is a whole other matter for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the House's indulgence to make an aside in order to add my 
voice to the arguments by my colleagues who are criticizing the 
limited time afforded this House to study the scope of this 
bill.  Clearly, as we have realized with the bill on clarity, 
the government is pushing us for time.  The government's 
propensity to push things lends credence to the disillusionment 
of a number of our fellow citizens at the role elected 
representatives play in the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the courts in this country have reached many 
decisions that would indicate the legislator is being dragged 
along by the judges' decisions.  It is the job of elected 
officials and not of the judges to consider and vote on the laws 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the matter before us, there are innumerable decisions 
decrying in one way or another discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation.  The polls indicate clearly that most 
Canadians consider it appropriate to give some sort of legal 
recognition to same sex partnerships.  Even if parliament were 
to reject the present bill, it would face this issue once again 
in a relatively short time.  I would be surprised if the courts 
were to change their minds and public opinion were to change 
completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elected officials will therefore be, as we are today, pressed to 
change the laws to put an end to discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. 
By rejecting the bill, we could send Canadians the message that 
we are not in tune with their concerns. Rather, we must show 
Canadians that the government is aware that things change and it 
is keeping an open mind. A number of provinces have passed or 
are about to pass legislation to correct the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government too must adjust its legislation before it 
becomes totally obsolete. We, as elected representatives, must 
not merely react to social pressure, but anticipate it and act 
accordingly. The public expects the government to be proactive, 
because that is its role. If passed, Bill C-23 will put Canada 
alongside the most progressive countries regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleagues and fellow citizens who feel that the 
bill before us today relates closely to fairness and human 
rights. Canada is constantly cited as an example of a tolerant 
country that respects human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago, the Right Honourable Antonio Lamer, former 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, said that several 
countries were constantly calling on his expertise in 
interpreting the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to 
develop their own laws. I personally care a great deal about the 
principles of fairness and tolerance, which are the foundations 
of Canadian society. However, I wonder why discriminatory 
provisions can still be found in our legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Canadian parliament hesitating to take a step that 
many companies in the private sector have already taken?  The 
private sector is hardly known for its social convictions.  I am 
concerned that the prejudices associated with sexual orientation 
are winning out over respect for human rights as understood in 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, if not in the 
letter, then at least in the spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there had not been legislation to abolish discrimination

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has deliberately chosen to maintain a clear 
distinction between partner or spouse, which refers to legally 
married couples, and common law partner, which refers to couples 
living in a common law relationship, a conjugal relationship 
different from marriage.  The spirit of this important 
distinction is the same as that in similar legislation passed in 
Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.  It is only logical that 
the definition of common law partners include same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be sticking our heads in the sand to think that there 
are no moral implications to this bill.  However, I think that 
this kind of definition corresponds to the evolution in what is 
acceptable to Canadians. 
That is what our society is prepared to accept.  I do not 
believe that the majority of the population wants a debate on 
the definition of marriage.  The government has the right angle 
on this matter and I congratulate it on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues would like to see a debate on marriage or 
on the institution of the family as it has been understood for 
generations.  I am not rejecting such a debate, but I do feel it 
is inopportune within the context of the bill being debated 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I did in the debate on Bill C-309, introduced by the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in 1998, I support Bill C-23, and 
for the same reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament must recognize, once and for all, that the 
definition of common law spouse contained in federal legislation 
is discriminatory.  This flaw must be corrected promptly, in a 
country claiming tolerance and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I would 
call upon the members of this House to set aside personal or 
partisan considerations in order to reach a neutral and rational 
judgment on this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
we are debating the modernization of benefits and obligations 
act, an act that was sponsored jointly by the Minister of 
Finance, the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is part of an ongoing commitment by the Government of 
Canada to ensure that its policies and programs continue to 
reflect the values of Canadians, values that are enshrined in the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members are aware, the Supreme Court of Canada made it 
clear that governments must treat unmarried opposite sex and same 
sex couples equally.  When the bill is passed it will amend 
legislation to recognize the principle of equal treatment for all 
common law relationships.  Same sex partners will be included in 
the new definition of common law partners and they will be 
granted the same benefits and obligations as opposite sex common 
law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that the legislation changes will preserve the 
fundamental importance of marriage in Canadian society.  The 
definition of marriage will not change.  It is the union of a man 
and a woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will amend 68 federal statutes affecting 20 federal 
departments and agencies.  The proposed changes are about 
fairness.  Same sex couples in committed relationships should be 
entitled to the same benefits and obligations as their unmarried 
opposite sex counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its May 1999 ruling in M. v H., 
has made it clear that governments cannot limit benefits or 
obligations to opposite sex common law relationships.  The 
proposed changes will ensure that federal laws again reflect the 
values of Canadians which are enshrined in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation does not affect the definition of 
marriage.  In fact, a few European countries have limited the 
recognition of same sex relationships but a clear distinction is 
maintained in law between marriage and same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provinces have already begun to amend their legislation. 
Since 1997 British Columbia has amended numerous statutes to 
include same sex partners.  In June 1999 Quebec amended 28 
statutes and 11 regulations to grant to same sex partners the 
same benefits and obligations that are available to opposite sex 
common law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999, again to comply with the supreme court ruling 
in M. v H., Ontario passed omnibus legislation to bring 67 
statutes into compliance with the ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At present more than 200 private sector companies give benefits 
to their employees' same sex partners, as do many municipalities, 
hospitals, libraries and community and social service 
institutions across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not preclude discussion, which has already 
started, on whether or how to acknowledge the nature and reality 
of many different types of dependent relationships. Dependency is 
a very complex issue with far-reaching consequences for 
individuals and society as a whole.  A number of adult Canadians 
currently reside with elderly parents, siblings or other 
relatives.  Although many federal statutes currently extend 
limited benefits and obligations to family relationships, further 
study is needed to determine if would be appropriate to treat 
family relationships as similar to married and common law couples 
in all or at least in some circumstances.  While benefits which 
reflect dependency would likely be welcomed, it is unclear 
whether the accompanying legal obligations should be imposed on 
individuals for those relatives with whom they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, eligibility for a guaranteed income supplement 
under the old age security is determined on the basis of 
combining the income of both persons, which might result in 
reducing benefits for some elderly persons who live with 
relatives.  As another example, if an adult lives with an elderly 
parent for many years and then leaves, should that adult remain 
legally responsible to pay support for that parent because they 
were once in a dependent relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other issues that would need to be resolved include how 
dependency relationships would be defined and what relationships 
would be allowed.  Would individuals be allowed to self-declare 
their relationships, or would the government require proof of 
some kind?   Would relationships of dependency apply to any two 
people who live together or to unlimited numbers as long as they 
are under the same roof?  Would the government exclude any 
relatives, as France has done, or exclude only opposite sex 
common law couples, as Hawaii has chosen to do?  There are many 
issues yet to be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective in considering changes to the system should be to 
encourage rather than discourage people to take care of each 
other.  We must be careful to ensure that any legal changes would 
not impose obligations that act as barriers to people supporting 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of creating a domestic partner registry is also 
of interest to some.  However, there are several concerns with a 
registry which would require further study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are privacy considerations since a registry would be open 
to the public, as are registries for births and deaths, which 
might result in people being forced to have their relationship 
publicly known.  As well, there are no guarantees that such a 
scheme would protect the most vulnerable in a relationship, for 
example, where one partner might refuse to register in order to 
avoid legal obligations on the breakdown of that relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, if such a system were created at the federal 
level it would have limited utility as it would only apply to 
areas of federal jurisdiction.  In Canada, where the many pieces 
of legislation that grant benefits and impose obligations are 
divided between or shared among the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments, a registry would require the unanimous 
agreement of all levels of government on the relationships to be 
recognized.  This would be necessary to help assure Canadians 
that a registry would work effectively, efficiently and fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are balanced.  Obligations as well as benefits 
will be conferred on same sex couples.  As a result, the fiscal 
impact of these amendments will be minimal, if any.  Clearly, 
this is not a cost issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many here today have expressed concern that the Government of 
Canada is deferring to the courts on this issue and that the 
supreme court is overstepping its proper role.  It is important 
to remember that the court is performing the role given to it by 
elected representatives of all Canadians through the introduction 
of the charter.  There is no question that the role of the courts 
in interpreting the charter has given them both a higher profile 
and a direct influence on the daily lives of Canadians.  However, 
at the same time, the charter also maintains the equally 
important role of parliament in determining important questions 
of social policy.  I assure the House that this role is taken 
very seriously by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about fairness.  It is a balanced and responsible 
approach to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to emphasize, because it is very important to my 
constituents in Erie—Lincoln, that there is nothing in the bill 
that alters the definition of marriage.  The House will remember 
that we passed a motion to that effect last June, the definition 
being the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others.  The bill maintains a distinction between married and 
unmarried couples and no changes are made to the legal definition 
of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term spouse in the federal legislation will refer only to 
married persons and the term common law partner will refer to 
those in same sex and opposite sex common law relationships.  As 
pointed out, the bill extends both benefits and obligations to 
common law same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the potential impact on individuals, as well as on 
government programming costs of creating a system of benefits 
based on broader principles of dependency, the issue again will 
require further study and consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our objective is clear:  We wish to encourage rather 
than discourage people to take care of each other.  We must be 
careful to ensure that any legal changes will not impose 
obligations or barriers to people supporting each other.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Kelowna.  I begin my debate on Bill C-23 today by reflecting on 
the comments and arguments which were made during the first day 
of debate last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly indicate from the outset that I do not support the 
legislation.  The official opposition is the only party opposing 
this fatally flawed piece of legislation.  I will outline the 
reasons why I cannot support Bill C-23, and I will begin with an 
examination of some comments made by the Minister of Justice last 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Kelowna just mentioned, debate on this 
important issue has a wide range of implications.  It is being 
shut down today through time allocation, a process that has been 
used over and over again by the Liberal government.  I cannot 
understand why it would do that on such an important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week on February 15 the Minister of Justice stated that the 
bill ensured respect for the principle of equal treatment before 
the law of persons living in recognized stable relationships. Let 
us be very clear that the minister's bill defines a stable 
relationship as one that is one year in length.  She went on to 
state that fairness, tolerance, respect and equality were 
touchstones of our national identity.  The minister will get no 
argument on this point.  This has been echoed by members on both 
sides of the House, both those for and those against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went on to say that they recognize marriage is a 
fundamental value and important to Canadians, and that the value 
and importance are in no way undermined by recognizing in law 
other forms of committed relationships.  I categorically say that 
assertion is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline the strongest argument I think possible for 
rejecting Bill C-23, one which I believe cannot be refuted by 
means of recent argument or logical consistency. 
The bill defines the new term common law partnership as a stable 
relationship of at least one year between two committed 
individuals, whether it be a same sex relationship between two 
men or two women or an opposite sex relationship between a man 
and a woman.  I do not believe anyone would argue that is what 
Bill C-23 does and that the bill bestows benefits and requires 
obligations for those who enter into same sex relationships.  For 
purposes of this illustration let us call this arrangement 
example C.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that in the eyes of the law a man and a woman who 
choose to live together for at least one year, even though they 
have not participated in any ceremony before witnesses, are 
deemed to be in a common law relationship or marriage.  The same 
benefits are accessible and the same obligations are in effect 
for those who are living in such an arrangement.  Let us call 
this common law opposite sex relationship example B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logically if A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C.  If the 
law sees marriage, and it does, as equivalent to a common law 
opposite sex relationship and sees a common law opposite sex 
relationship as equivalent to common law same sex relationships, 
and it does in this proposed piece of legislation, in effect the 
law if passed, Bill C-23, will see marriage as equivalent to 
common law same sex relationships or as stated in the bill in 
terms of a common law partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the minister to state that the bill does not affect marriage 
is completely false and illogical in any form of reasoning.  The 
minister may believe this to be true.  She may make assertions to 
the contrary, but by means of logic we have just demonstrated 
that it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of the bill is to enshrine in law that two 
homosexual partners who live together for just one year will be 
afforded the same benefits and obligations as a married couple, a 
couple who have commitments to live together and love each other 
through sickness and health until death do them part, a 
commitment which is fundamental to the continuation and 
well-being of any society, the building block of society where 
children learn about right and wrong, good and bad, how to treat 
others, and how to be positive functioning members of society. 
For the minister to claim otherwise is simply false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians trust the Liberal government to protect 
marriage?  The justice minister is unwilling to enshrine in 
federal statute the definition of marriage as the union of a man 
and a woman as recognized by the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion was passed in the House in June 1999 that was brought 
forward by my colleagues in the Reform Party and agreed upon by 
the majority of members in the House including Liberals.  They in 
no way can take credit for such action.  It is because of the 
Liberal inaction on this question and their unwillingness to 
define in statute the definition of marriage that we brought the 
motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says she values marriage but she is unwilling to 
speak with her actions instead of her hollow words.  This point 
was made by the Liberal member for Scarborough East, a member of 
the government and one of only a handful who was willing to stand 
and say something contrary to the will of the Liberal Party. I 
will quote from <I>Hansard</I> what that member of the government 
said in regard to the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is fairly simple.  It really could be written in one 
line:  common law heterosexual relationships are the legal 
equivalent to common law homosexual relationships.  Therein lies 
the entire issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quoting the member for Scarborough East, a member of the 
government, who also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill turns common law homosexual relationships into the legal 
equivalent of common law heterosexual relationships, which for 
many purposes is equivalent to marriage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a member of the Liberal Government of Canada who I 
guess is in direct contradiction to the majority of his group in 
the governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let Canadians make no mistake about the net end effect of Bill 
C-23 and its implications.  Anybody with concerns about the issue 
who is listening today should voice their concerns to their local 
member of parliament, to the Minister of Justice and to the Prime 
Minister to tell them what he or she feels is the right way to 
proceed in this area of public policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the Liberal government is signalling that it believes 
in sexual egalitarianism, the belief that there are no 
arrangements that are to the benefit of any others in the country 
in terms of private sexual activity.  The government is 
signalling to Canadians that it no longer values the direction of 
a social policy which encourages and nurtures family and marriage 
as the building block of this society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake about it.  That is what the bill does. 
It signals to Canadians that the governing group, the Liberal 
Party of Canada, is setting off in a direction and it has not 
even consulted Canadians on this very important issue that is the 
building block of any society.  That is patently wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and other colleagues have put forward an argument, 
which we heard not long ago from the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Justice, that the courts made the government do 
it so it must be right.  They say that other jurisdictions are 
putting this into legislation so we must follow.  Again this is a 
false assertion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the highest court in the land.  We as parliamentarians 
are charged with the responsibility of sending a message to the 
courts.  It is not the other way around.  It is here that we must 
take the stands from our constituents and bring them to this 
place and argue and debate by logical reasoning which is the best 
way to go.  Here in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us clearly point out that the Liberal government is 
unwilling by its actions to enshrine in law the definition of 
marriage.  It has a perfect opportunity right now with Bill C-23, 
yet it has not done that.  We must take from its actions as it is 
legislating that this is a path it does not want to pursue.  The 
government does not want to enshrine the definition of marriage 
in law for whatever reasons it might have.  We need to hold and 
Canadians need to hold this Liberal group accountable for that 
particular action.  The Liberals over and over again have 
derogated their responsibility to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I am quickly running out of time on this important 
subject.  I will end my speech by encouraging Canadians to look 
at what this legislation does.  The parliamentary secretary, the 
Minister of Justice and other members of the Liberal Party have 
stood in this place and said “Don't worry.  This bill has no net 
effect on the definition of marriage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out earlier in my speech, because they are 
unwilling to enshrine in law what marriage means, and they are 
equating marriage to be the same as a common law relationship and 
now a common law partnership, they are in effect signalling to 
Canadians that they no longer support the family.  They no longer 
support with their social policy the longstanding tradition of 
this country and the building block of this society.  That is a 
shame and they need to be held accountable.

Speaker, I would like to ask a very direct question of the hon. 
member opposite because certainly what this bill does do is it 
equates a same sex relationship with a common law heterosexual 
relationship.  I am sure he would agree that the reason why we 
have common law relationships is because they are specifically 
not marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not follow his reasoning that this is a threat to marriage 
in some way because we have grouped same sex couples with common 
law heterosexual couples.  However, I do take note of his point. 
It is regrettable that this bill does not define marriage as a 
relationship between opposite sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if the bill did define marriage in the 
way we all agree that marriage should be defined and the way 
marriage is defined in common law, would he then be able to 
support this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague made an 
assertion which I do not think we can actually agree on, that we 
all agree on what marriage is. That in itself is another 
debatable point that will be coming at the end of this debate, I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will enshrine, as the hon. member said, that common 
law same sex relationships will be equal in the eyes of the law 
to common law opposite sex relationships. 
I would also say that in the eyes of the law in terms of 
splitting property if such a relationship dissolves in terms of 
the common law opposite sex relationship, the law sees a common 
law heterosexual relationship in very much the same way as it 
sees marriage.

constituents well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1973, when I decided to marry my girlfriend, I wanted a

adopted a little aboriginal child, who will be 18 on July 2.

teased.  There were even some people who told me “Gérard, now

you're doing”.  After adopting our first child, we had a boy and 
a girl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill says that same sex couples should have the same

the parliamentary secretary made that somehow he felt this was 
not as important as certain other bills that the hon. member from

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise two essential issues this afternoon.  First it 
is my intention to show that the bill is fundamentally and 
fatally flawed.  It was put together in a trivial manner.  It 
trivializes many of the very important things we believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I wish to show that the bill demonstrates that the 
Minister of Justice is actually acting contrary to the wishes of 
the House as expressed on June 8, 1999 when the House accepted in 
an overwhelming majority vote that the definition of marriage 
ought to be the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to look at the fundamental flaw that underlies this bill. 
Not only has it been put together on very short notice and not 
only does it have tremendously far ranging implications, I am not 
sure the government has analysed what all those implications are. 
I suspect it has not. I suspect as well that all of the speeches 
we will make will probably not analyse all of them either because 
this cuts right into some of our deepest held beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lest we think it is only the opinion of the opposition that this 
is the case, let me read into the record an editorial which 
appeared on February 15 on the editorial page of the <I>National 
Post</I>.  It is very significant and I wish to read it in detail. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of gay rights often argue their cause by analogy with 
anti-racism.  Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, 
they say, makes as little sense as discrimination on the basis of 
skin colour.  But this comparison does not hold water. While 
there is no justification for denying privileges to a citizen on 
the basis of race, the issue of sexual orientation is less 
clear-cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society has a manifest interest in promoting heterosexual 
marriage, through which it perpetuates itself. Unlike 
heterosexuals, however, homosexual couples cannot conceive 
children through conjugal union.  Nor can they provide children, 
however conceived, with adult role models of both sexes. Where 
all-male marriages are concerned, moreover, gay households would 
be far more likely than straight households to be destabilized by 
promiscuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the best way to recognize the intertwined economic 
interests of cohabitating homosexuals is not to expand the 
definition of marriage, but to treat gay unions the same way we 
treat common law partnerships.  This is the idea behind the 
modernization of benefits and obligations act introduced by 
justice minister Anne McLellan on Friday. The legislation, if 
enacted, would ensure that same sex couples will have—where 
federal law is concerned—the same legal rights and obligations 
as opposite sex common law couples. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague opposite has created a beautiful mathematical, 
logistical formula. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if gay couples are to enjoy the same benefits as common law 
heterosexual couples, what is the justification for denying these 
benefits to non-intimates, namely people in relationships who 
pool economic resources but do not involve sexual 
intercourse?—But this does not mean sexual intimacy should be 
taken, by itself, as a proxy for economic interdependence.  Our 
society has a special interest in preserving heterosexual 
marriage as an institution.  If we decide to confer economic and 
legal rights to couples whose relationships lie outside that 
special interest, then it makes just as much sense to accord 
rights to cohabitating family members and friends—spinster 
sisters or old army buddies, for instance—as to homosexual 
lovers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect the modernization of benefits and obligations 
act is poorly conceived.  It expands the definition of common law 
couples only insofar as gay couples are concerned. Non-intimates 
are excluded.  There are, of course, good policy reasons for not 
expanding the common law definition at all.  But, once the 
justice department expands it to include gay couples, there is no 
reason why it should not include all cohabitating people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And while the act does not go far enough in this area, it goes 
too far in another, elevating common law relationships to the 
same status as married couples with regard to all but a small 
handful of federal laws.  In this respect, the government is 
actually going further than the Supreme Court of Canada has 
required.  In the 1999 case of M. v H., the court struck down a 
provision in the Ontario Family Law Act defining “spouse” as 
(1) a married person; or (2) a partner in a heterosexual couple 
that has lived together for more than three years.  The court 
ruled that it was unconstitutional to exclude same sex couples 
from the second category; but it left the issue of marriage 
untouched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the backgrounder that accompanies her new legislation, the 
hon. Minister of Justice is eager to reassure Canadians that 
“the definition of marriage has not changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And on Friday she announced that “the definition of marriage 
relates to an institution that is of fundamental and longstanding 
religious and historical significance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if this is true, then why has she introduced legislation 
that trivializes marriage by reducing it to a status more or less 
equal to that of cohabitation plus sex?  Her new legislation, if 
passed in its present form, may soon become known as the End of 
Marriage Act.

being foisted upon us quickly, without adequate study and debate, 
it is also ill-conceived in the sense that not nearly all of the 
implications that arise from this piece of legislation have been 
analyzed and the conclusions drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us is an attempt by the government to foist 
a bill upon us under the auspices of what is deemed to have been 
a directive from the Supreme Court of Ontario, and it has gone 
beyond what that particular court decided.  Why would this House 
go beyond what that court said it should do?

has a say in what should happen in this House?  It could give all 
kinds of advice, it could give all kinds of indication as to what 
could happen here.  It is perfectly legitimate for the court to 
do that.  However, nothing could be further from the truth than 
for the House to take it as a directive.  “We must act.  This is 
the legislation we have to enact”.  That is an insult, not only 
to this House, but to every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians who are taxpayers and who elected people to this

wishes of the House.  She had a golden opportunity to introduce 
into this legislation a definition of marriage, to enshrine and 
affirm that we, this House, define marriage as one man and one 
woman to the exclusion of all others.  Once again she missed a 
golden opportunity to lay the foundation upon which our society 
rests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family is the basic unit, the most efficient unit to 
transfer values and beliefs from one generation to another.  She 
missed a golden opportunity, but she could still reconsider, and 
I hope she does.  I hope that she will withdraw this legislation, 
or introduce an amendment which recognizes the family and the 
definition of marriage, to enshrine it so there will not be a 
contradiction and the denial of what has been clearly expressed 
by the House as being the desired definition of marriage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite has gone on at great length about what 
the courts have and have not done.  The definition of marriage as 
the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others 
goes back to the court case of Hyde and Hyde in 1866. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out a recent case in Ontario.  In the Ontario court, 
general division, there was the case of Layland and Beaulne, 
which dealt with the definition of marriage.  In that decision a 
majority of the court stated as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—unions of persons of the same sex were not “marriages” because 
of the definition of marriage.  The applicants were, in effect, 
seeking to use section 15 of the Charter to bring about a change 
in the definition of marriage.  The court did not think the 
Charter has that effect. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unions of persons of the same sex were not marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that statement, in that unanimous decision by the 
court, what is the problem?  Why are they so concerned about it? 
It is there.  The courts are saying exactly what they want them 
to say.  Can the member reconcile the statement made by the court 
with what he has said today?

whatever he wants.  He can say whatever he wishes in terms of 
definition.  However, the judge needs to know what the House 
believes.  How does the House define marriage?  That is what it 
is about.  That is why it should be in law.  It should not be 
left to the courts to determine what is or what is not marriage. 
The House of Commons determines that.  The hon. member has it 
backward. 
I am saddened that he would come up with that kind of question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments by the Reform member who 
just spoke, and I believe he is right. If we were to follow the 
logic of the people across the way, why elect a parliament, why 
elect 301 members to this House? It would be a lot less 
expensive, a lot less costly to elect the nine supreme court 
justices and to ask them, as they have the monopoly of truth, to 
legislate as they see fit, which might not always be how the 
people really want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it runs contrary to reality to claim, as the member 
across the way—for whom I have the greatest respect by the way—is 
doing, that the House must listen to the dictates of the courts, 
be they high courts, medium courts or low courts. I believe we 
must give back to parliament its full authority, including 
defining a couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we define a legal marriage through legal means, in the near 
future—I guess this is my question to the member for Kelowna—are 
we not going to create legal children? Or are we going to come 
up with legal creations which are not anchored in reality? This 
is the danger. We know people who are living together, who are 
not in a sexual relationship, but who are economically dependent 
on each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there is a brother, of very sound mind, who will 
have to support his younger brother who is mentally deficient. I 
had breakfast with him on Saturday and he told me “Why would it 
not apply to me when I die? I am single, I will never marry, I 
will never have children, I have only my brother to support. Why 
could I not see to it that he is looked after, just as they are 
going to do for same sex couples?” 
This is why I have great difficulty with this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the 
hon. member for his very articulate analysis of the problem.  I 
really appreciate it.  I think that when it comes to supreme 
court judges, he would want them to be elected.  One of the 
problems, however, is that at the present time supreme court 
judges are not elected.  They are not accountable to anyone 
except the Prime Minister.  He appoints them.  That is a flaw in 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to the essence of the member's question, which 
comes to grips with the very basic issue of the family and 
marriage in Canada.  I think we have to recognize that in law and 
enshrine it in legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My reaction to Bill C-23 is that it is both a good bill and a 
bad bill.  It is a bad bill in the sense that it still keeps the 
issue of sex in legislation, and I am one who believes that the 
statement of a former prime minister that the government has no 
business in the bedrooms of the nation is very apropos and very 
correct. 
I am disappointed that the bill did not go much further, as many 
of us on this side wanted, to explore dependent relationships, 
which would certainly include same sex or heterosexual 
relationships, but to expand that to other forms of dependency. 
It would have been a better bill for that.

backbench MPs on this side and many members on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House a story with respect to this and I will 
address my remarks, to some extent, to the member for Kelowna. 
In his remarks the member for Kelowna suggested that this bill 
was driven by supreme court decisions.  In fact, Madam Speaker, 
there is a story to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring I served for a while on the committee studying Bill 
C-63, the citizenship bill.  I was not actually a member of that 
committee, but I was very interested in that particular piece of 
legislation and served quite a bit of time on the committee.  I 
was interested actually in the oath of citizenship.  I was there 
for an entirely different reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had several witnesses come to the committee who pointed out 
what they thought was a major flaw in Bill C-63.  This was a 
small section, section 43(i), and what it said, simply, was that 
the governor in council would be able to define spouse for the 
purpose of the legislation at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere in the bill there was a clause dealing with the 
problem of Canada's officials when they serve overseas.  If they 
enter into permanent relationships which would lead to 
citizenship, the law wanted to acknowledge that this should 
include same sex relationships as well as heterosexual 
relationships.  With leaving the governor in council the 
opportunity to define spouse for the purpose of these other 
clauses, what was happening was that this was abrogating 
parliament's responsibility to define spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that this issue was brought up first in committee 
by the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.  Its members spoke very 
well before the committee.  Later there were a number of legal 
representations made by people from law societies who raised the 
same concern.  They pointed out that this clause which gave the 
governor in council the authority to define spouse, and that 
could be defining spouse as a same sex relationship, was actually 
anti-democratic.  People spoke out very loudly against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came clause by clause.  This was all compressed into a very 
small space of time.  The committee sat very late that night 
because the minister wanted the bill finished as quickly as 
possible.  Of course the committee does try to help the minister 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened on the Liberal side of the round table.  We 
sat in a room with opposition members of the committee on one 
side and Liberal members on the other side.  As we went clause by 
clause, there was a group concerned about section 43(i) on the 
Liberal side.  At about 10 o'clock at night, even though we were 
still discussing other clauses, three members of the committee 
held up debate on the citizenship bill.  We complained that the 
Reform Party was not co-operating and we used that as a pretext 
to suspend debate on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We left the committee room and went to another room and phoned 
the citizenship minister.  We told her that we could not pass 
this bill.  We told her that we could not pass the clause as it 
stood because we all felt, all of the members who were sitting on 
the committee that night on the Liberal side, very strongly 
against the clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was quite upset.  She said “Look, I don't like it 
either, but it is impossible for me to change it without 
consulting cabinet.  Can you hold on for a few days?”  We came 
back and continued to go through clause by clause and that clause 
was accepted.  The bill in fact returned to the House for third 
reading and we continued to be concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened subsequently, as everyone will remember, is that 
the House prorogued and Bill C-63, the citizenship bill, actually 
went into suspension during prorogation.  Interestingly enough, 
when the House resumed the government picked up just about every 
other piece of legislation that it had before prorogation except 
the citizenship bill.  In fact, Madam Speaker, if you look at the 
new citizenship bill now, Bill C-16, you will find this 
particular offending clause missing.  It is no longer there.  It 
was taken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background to the background is that after this 
confrontation of the Liberal backbenches and the minister—and it 
was a polite confrontation but nevertheless it was a 
confrontation—in the fall, at the same time as this clause 
disappeared from the new citizenship bill, the Minister of 
Justice held a meeting for all members of the Liberal caucus and 
said that she was prepared to undertake an omnibus bill that 
would fix the situation with respect to the definition of spouse 
once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kelowna is quite right.  It is absolutely 
wrong to leave it to judges to define things that are so 
essential to the way we interact with one another as human 
beings, much less as Canadians.  What had been happening is that 
because the charter indicated that we had to give equality to 
people regardless of gender and regardless of sexual activity, 
the courts had been more and more inclined to redefine marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of people in my riding would be absolutely opposed 
to defining marriage as a same sex relationship.  I would not 
hesitate to vote against the bill in a flash if I felt that in 
any way it was perpetuating the idea that marriage should be a 
same sex relationship, but it is not. What it is in fact doing at 
last is providing a means to give people in same sex 
relationships the same kind of benefits that people have in 
heterosexual relationships outside of marriage. The operative 
word is common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you cannot be married and be in a common law 
relationship.  The whole idea of a common law relationship is 
that it is not marriage.  All the legislation is doing is making 
a parallel.  It is saying that a common law relationship can be 
heterosexual for the purpose of benefits and a common law 
relationship can be same sex.  It is simple.  No problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem though in the bill is twofold.  The legislators 
sometimes get very frustrated.  In amending various sections of 
the act, the legislatures chose to create this common law 
definition of same sex relationship.  In every instance, they 
have said it is a common law relationship involving people of the 
same sex cohabiting in a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we people who are into the meaning of words just throw 
up our hands because conjugal means heterosexual.  It does not 
mean same sex under any circumstances.  I just cannot for the 
life of me understand why the people who advised the justice 
minister did not simply use the word sexual.  What is wrong with 
sexual?  It covers everything.  It is absolutely same sex and 
opposite sex.  Sexual covers it all but conjugal actually refers 
specifically to a heterosexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense I sympathize with members like the hon. member for 
Kelowna because when the drafters of legislation use a word 
improperly, a word that has a pejorative meaning that is 
completely contradictory to what is intended, of course we are 
liable to have suspicions about the intent of the people who are 
crafting the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I am hoping I can persuade the minister to, for 
heaven's sake, change the word conjugal.  I will try to move an 
amendment on that subject.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another simple way to alleviate many of the fears of 
members in the House.  I am convinced that the bill is important 
and that it does at last take away from the courts the pressure 
they have been putting on us to define same sex relationships. It 
was very important to bring this back to parliament, and this 
bill does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is fear and worry out there.  I sympathize with 
that worry.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we 
cannot, simply to satisfy that concern, put a definition of 
marriage in the bill, the classic definition:  the union of one 
man and one woman.  It is simple.  Just stick it in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is a lawyer's argument  “We cannot do that because 
it is beautifully enshrined in common law and it will somehow box 
in the courts if we narrow the definition of marriage”.  We are 
not in this place because we are lawyers.  We are in this place 
because we are legislators.  We are here to shape society by the 
good laws that we create.  I have great sympathy for anyone in 
the House who says “for Heaven's sake, don't be driven by the 
supreme court necessarily.  The supreme court can give some 
direction but we do not have to do whatever the lawyers tell 
us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me, nowhere up here, see a single 
reason for not defining marriage in the legislation and 
satisfying the many people in my community and Canadians across 
the country who are worried about losing the traditional legal 
definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly about my community.  My riding contains a 
large number of people who are very devout Christians. I have a 
number of Christian communities, Protestant and Catholic, that 
are very concerned about this issue.  I also have a number of 
people in my riding who do live in same sex relationships and who 
contribute very well to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This compromise that exists in the legislation where same sex 
benefits are grouped very narrowly under common law 
relationships—although we are not entirely satisfied that it is 
completely done—and where marriage is protected, at least the 
minister, I point out, has been very careful to eliminate the 
word spouse from the legislation so that we do not get into that 
trap.  So that is gone from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sense of most people in my riding is that they really do 
believe that people who live in same sex relationships and who 
have a genuine dependency on one another should have the same 
benefits as people in heterosexual relationships who develop 
benefits so long as it is not a married relationship.  Marriage 
is the key thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a problem with marriage.  I do not believe marriage 
can ever be considered a same sex relationship because marriage 
implies the rights of adoption.  I would never ever take away the 
rights of children in order to satisfy the rights of adults. 
Until evidence is to the contrary, and I do not think it will 
ever occur, I think all things being equal there is not doubt 
that heterosexual partners make more appropriate parents than do 
same sex partners.  So we cannot detract from the rights of 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, the bill at least finally addresses what we on this 
side of the House, and I think many across the country, have been 
clamouring for, to take away the initiative of the courts that 
were poised to define marriage and spouse as same sex 
relationships which would be entirely inappropriate. I will 
support the bill on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, what I want the members opposite to realize is 
that many on this side fought very hard behind the scenes to have 
the bill take the whole sexual component out entirely and to 
address dependent partnerships.  There is no question about what 
is ultimately fair here.  We should not be talking about sex at 
all, any kind of sex.  What we should be talking about is the 
relationships that occur between human beings.  They may be of 
the same sex.  They may be of the opposite sex.  They may be a 
sister and sister or a brother and brother.  They may be any kind 
of combination where after a while they have lived together and 
they have become emotionally dependent on one another. 
It is not just material dependency.  It is that real emotional 
dependency that can occur in families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Citizenship Act, what I wanted to see there 
was a dependent partnership relationship occur where someone 
could adopt a child when he or she were serving overseas and have 
that child be treated as a dependent in a dependent relationship 
for the purposes of the Citizenship Act.  However, we did not 
achieve that.  Unfortunately, the government has said—and I have 
to accept it—that there are aspects of the dependent partner 
concept that it has not fully examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true.  We must be careful about plunging ahead 
with something that is really novel just in case we create 
problems for people to whom we had not intended.  The justice 
minister has said—I do not know whether she has said it in the 
House but she has certainly said it on the side—that she is 
prepared to study this issue of dependent partners forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill that addresses a current problem, gets the court 
out of parliaments, settles the legitimate concerns of people who 
have same sex relationships and who have been denied the 
equivalent benefits and other opportunities of heterosexual 
people living outside marriage.  We have solved that problem with 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is only a beginning.  It is an important 
beginning. What I like about it is that it is a beginning that 
actually began in this place, in this parliament, in a committee, 
at least for me, but I really do believe it is a beginning that 
began here among these MPs and the government has taken action. 
In that sense, I think the government should be congratulated.

listened carefully to the hon. member's speech. I understand 
that he supports the bill, but that he would have appreciated a 
number of clarifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not and cannot concern marriage. Some members of 
the Bloc Quebecois and other parties find it regrettable, but it 
was the supreme court which asked the legislator to recognize 
homosexual relationships as conjugal relationships. This ruling 
was made in the M. v H. case, on May 20, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he agrees with me that what is 
at issue now is the recognition of same sex spouses. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I actually think the bill 
is quite clear.  As long as we keep before us the idea that 
something that exists in common law is a common law relationship 
because it is not marriage.  In syntax and in grammatical sense, 
if it is common law it means that it is not marriage.  Whether 
the common law relationship is same sex or heterosexual it does 
not matter.  The final answer is that if it is common law it is 
not marriage.  In fact, we may put it in another way.  The bill 
creates a condition where if you are living in sin and getting 
benefits, it does not matter how you are living in sin. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member who just spoke.  He is one of those 
members on the opposite side of the House who actually makes 
sense every once in a while. I think that is very complimentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the hon. member seems to be very happy with 
the progress that has been made.  He then goes on to say “I'm 
going to support this bill simply because there is a little bit 
of progress here”.  The government has made a little bit of 
progress, but with that progress it may be creating all kinds of 
other problems that it has not anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does a compromise but has not studied the full 
problem, so now what is he creating?  Does he know what he has? 
It seems to me that the hon. member should very carefully 
re-examine his position because it made such eminently good sense 
and then all of a sudden he said “I'm going to support this 
because we got something”.  It is not enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, the pressure was coming 
from the courts.  Parliament simply had to act.  I do not know 
about the members on the opposite side, but many of us on this 
side were getting very, very panicky because the supreme court 
and other levels of courts were more and more interfering or 
directing the definition of spouse, and not so much the 
definition of marriage.  They were more and more inclining toward 
defining spouse as a same sex relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill does is that it cuts supreme court off at the 
pass.  It stops the courts from defining a spouse or marriage in 
a way that the vast majority of Canadians would find 
unacceptable.  However it is true that the bill does not go far 
enough.  The reason it does not fully explore the idea of 
dependent partnerships—and I have to take the minister at her 
word—is that she feels there are implications to dependent 
partnerships that may have adverse consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we solve a problem that is current, which is 
what we should doing.  We should fix the problem that is current, 
but as far as I am concerned this is only a interim fix.  The 
real answer will be when we can extend this kind of thing to all 
dependent relationships and take sex out of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I quite enjoyed the speech of the hon. member on the other side. 
I agreed with most of it.  There are a couple of problems. The 
things I do not agree with are not part of the bill.  We seem to 
be spending an awful lot of time talking about marriage and 
spouse. There is not a mention anywhere in the bill of these two 
words, yet the debate has continuously revolved around those 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that it is up to the House to define 
marriage and spouse.  That is what we should have done, but I am 
afraid it will have to be done in another bill.  Does the hon. 
member agree that we spent an awful lot of time on this bill 
debating the wrong thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, the reason why we are not 
debating spouse is because one of the things this bill does is 
take the word spouse out the various acts and legislation it 
affects and replaces the word spouse with common law partner. 
Spouse is very much a part of this legislation because it takes 
the word spouse out of all kinds of other laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I do not think we are debating the wrong thing.  I have to 
go back to my original point.  The only thing to me that is 
really missing in this legislation that I would have liked to see 
is changing the word conjugal to sexual.  Let us be upfront about 
it.  Let us put the proper definition of marriage in the bill and 
satisfy everyone's fears.

congratulate the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who guessed 
the member is going to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member started by saying that it was both a bad and a good 
bill, that he was against it, but that he would support it. He 
was against same sex couples being married, but he is willing to 
accept their staying together and being recognized. I really 
have trouble understanding the member, and people who are 
listening to us probably have the same problem as I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House recognizes same sex couples, it must give them the 
same benefits and obligations as heterosexual couples. If we 
give them the same benefits and obligations, are we ready to 
recognize that a homosexual couple, a gay or a lesbian couple, 
can have a family and adopt children? What will happen when a 
homosexual couple applies for an international adoption? We know 
that heterosexual couples, a man and a woman, can adopt children 
internationally.

adopt a little girl. The investigation will show they are both 
men, they have been living together for several years, they are 
working, they own a house, and have a good income. But will 
foreign countries be willing to give children up for adoption to 
homosexual couples? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am quite prepared to 
say that homosexual couples could make good parents and that 
there are heterosexual couples who make bad parents.  The 
difference between the common law relationship for same sex 
couples is that they still will not be able to adopt, in my view, 
but they will be subject to the discretion of the authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, married couples in my view should have the right to 
adopt.  The danger with giving same sex couples the privilege of 
marriage is that in getting the legal status of marriage they 
might get the right to adopt children.  I am not prepared to give 
them that right because if we give rights to one group we take 
rights from another.  I am not sure that children, all things 
being equal, are better off under same sex parents as opposed to 
heterosexual parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, nothing in this legislation so far as I can see, and I 
am not a specialist, precludes same sex couples from having the 
opportunity to adopt.  The only difference is that the various 
authorities that carry out adoption procedures will have a 
certain amount of discretion that they might not ordinarily have 
with married couples.

state a very interesting position on which I would have liked my 
colleagues to have the opportunity to question me, but I will 
leave it for third reading or for another life maybe, where I 
would be reincarnated as an homosexual. This is not the case for 
now, but I have absolutely no problem with the idea of two men 
or two women living together. I think that we should not confuse 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I noticed in reading the documents provided to me 
by the research staff of the Bloc Quebecois or the House is that 
a new definition of common law couples was being proposed, which 
would include same sex partners. This is an omnibus bill of a 
sort, which is designed to amend 68 acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to my colleagues who mentioned earlier the 
various forces and balances in our society. 
There are three recognized branches of government: the executive 
branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. 
Everybody knows that. I have often been among those who accused 
the Liberal federal government of lacking courage and letting 
others dictate its legislation, philosophy and parliamentary 
strategies. I often criticized it for modeling its policies on 
court decisions. But these things happen in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are courts that can have a certain influence on this 
House. The executive branch always has the power to decide, and 
so does the legislative branch. The 301 members of the House are 
part of the legislative branch and will be able to express their 
views and vote on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also various organized groups, like the labour unions 
I belonged to for 20 years, which have a certain influence. 
Gay and lesbian groups too have a certain influence in this 
debate. That is only natural, since are directly affected by 
this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those who feel that the time has now come to 
recognize those rights.  Moreover, once again, broadminded 
Quebec has jumped the gun on the feds.  Last year, Mrs. Goupil, 
the Quebec Minister of Justice, brought in amendments to 28 
Quebec statutes in order to recognize this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to my union experience—20 years of it—I was a grievance 
officer. I negotiated public sector collective agreements. We 
were governed by certain laws and certain collective agreements. 
I was always greatly disturbed when contacted by gays or 
lesbians saying “I have lived with my partner for a number of 
years, but when I die, I cannot leave that partner any part of 
what I have earned here, working day in and day out, in this 
institution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not find that right.  We tried to get the collective 
agreement changed, but we kept coming up against the statutes. 
When it came down to it, all these statutes told us that a 
common law spouse was not a same sex partner.  I found that 
profoundly unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demands a certain openmindedness as well.  I am no 
reactionary, not one to say that society is in a terrible way, 
that it will be all over within a hundred years because same sex 
unions are permitted.  That is not what I think. 
A certain percentage of the population is this way, and I 
respect their point of view.  I think the time has come to 
correct that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-three per cent of the people share the same reasoning, 
which is not insignificant.  We are all in politics here, and I 
am just as happy to be on the side of the 73% as against them. 
Mathematical and especially political reasoning hold that 
agreeing with the majority, and a very strong majority at that, 
offers a greater likelihood of popularity than if the reverse 
were true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that just in political terms.  I was open to 
that and was totally in support of having same sex couples 
recognized as common law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak to you as the Indian affairs critic.  Since 
last week, native people have contacted me on a number of 
occasions. In the 68 laws that will be amended, there is the 
Indian Act and the Cree-Naskapi of Quebec Act.  This act led to 
the James Bay agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the people were not consulted.  This is not the first 
time this has happened.  From the first day the Europeans 
arrived in America, the native peoples were not consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the two founding peoples decided to draw up a 
Constitution—in 1867—the native peoples were left to their own 
devices.  And yet these people were here and had rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately they were not consulted and they should have been. 
I do not begrudge the official responsible for that a whole 
lot.  The official is asked by the Department of Justice to make 
amendments and add new definitions to all the laws. 
He takes all the legislation he has before him and makes an 
amendment each time there is something to amend, in line with 
the desired policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot blame the public servant, but the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development should have known that this 
affected native peoples under his jurisdiction. Different 
concepts are involved.  I have risen in the House on many 
occasions to make this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A white person will tend to mark boundaries and draw up deeds. 
It is not like that on the reserves.  The reserves are often 
communal lands belonging to no one person; they belong to 
everyone.  This can have repercussions for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the native peoples have not been consulted, just as 
they were not consulted about very important bills passed in 
this House even before our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, the government passed Bill C-31, which allowed 
aboriginal women to reclaim their status.  Again, status is at 
issue.  Prior to 1985, native women who married whites lost 
their status, as did all their offspring.  However, a native man 
who married a white did not lose his rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government saw that there was a problem and said that it 
would do something about it.  But it did not consult any 
aboriginals, with the result that, when these negotiations were 
taking place, aboriginals warned that the budgets being 
considered would soon be inadequate if all the native women 
whose status was going to be recognized returned to the 
reserves.  The government said that, first, it did not think 
that there would be many women who would go after their new 
status and, second, if they did, the budgets would be adjusted 
accordingly.  Neither scenario materialized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened.  Many women returned to the reserve with 
their offspring, the budgets were not adjusted, and the 
aboriginal people found themselves with problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change to the Indian Act and I might remind hon. 
members that the former incumbent, Ron Irwin, tried here in this 
House to bring in many changes to the Indian Act and was 
rebuffed.  The aboriginal people did not want them.  We need to 
understand why.  It may be an old statute, but it is all that 
aboriginals on the reserve have.  It is therefore important for 
them to be consulted before touching it.  They are greatly 
concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote, in closing, Grand Chief Phil Fontaine, who said 
the following in a recent press release about his feelings on 
this bill “The federal government is unilaterally announcing 
changes to the Indian Act that will affect all our citizens in 
Canada. 
First nations governments had not received any advance notice as 
to the extent of the changes, their impact on our communities 
and the resources required to effect these changes”. 
This refers directly, by way of example, to what I have 
mentioned about Bill C-31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Fontaine concluded by saying “I am disappointed that 
neither the Minister of Indian Affairs or the Minister of 
Justice would give us the courtesy of a call to inform us of 
this legislative change, except for a notification letter, which 
contained no details sent to my office late in the day Thursday. 
I hope this is not the government's new approach to first 
nations participation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will have to listen to the native peoples.  It is not 
too late, we are only at second reading of the bill, which will 
be referred to committee.  I think that the native peoples have 
told me they wish to be heard. This will have to be given special 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill before us as a whole, I reiterate that 
I have no objection and that I will support it this evening, 
that I will try to have amendments made to reflect the very 
specific aspect of the aboriginal element, and that at third 
reading I will support this bill.  Obviously, it will be a free 
vote this evening for us.  I can say right off that I will 
support this bill.  I think the time has come.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Justice has already explained, there are 
powerful reasons to endorse the bill.  Of all the arguments, I 
believe none is more compelling than the fact that ensuring equal 
treatment under the law should be a basic standard of a fair and 
just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have an unwavering faith in the values enshrined in 
our charter of rights and freedoms.  We believe heart and soul 
that there should be no discrepancy between our words and our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak to 
the bill. 
This country has a long and enviable history of commitment to 
human rights, dignity and equal opportunity.  This is not 
rhetoric; it is a reality of which every Canadian can be very 
proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lives of gay and lesbian Canadians and the core values all 
Canadians hold dear are at stake if we continue to allow 
discrimination to exclude any group of Canadians.  Bill C-23 
reflects the Government of Canada's commitment to ensure that 
federal policies, social programs and laws reflect societal 
values and realities.  This responsible, measured and practical 
legislation recognizes the indisputable fact that same sex common 
law couples in Canada are entitled to fair and equal treatment 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of this reality, Bill C-23 will amend all 
relevant statutes to extend to same sex couples the same benefits 
and obligations that are available to common law opposite sex 
partners.  This legislation is the most responsible way to meet 
our constitutional obligations.  It is also in keeping with the 
majority opinion in Canada.  Public polling consistently finds 
that Canadians endorse the position that same sex partners should 
be accorded the same legal treatment as opposite sex common law 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999 Angus Reid found that 63% of Canadians believed 
that same sex couples should be entitled to the same benefits and 
obligations as unmarried common law couples. In another survey 
conducted a year earlier, 84% of Canadians agreed that same sex 
couples should be protected from discrimination.  These numbers 
tell us that Canadians are far ahead of their elected 
representatives in recognizing the moral and legal necessity of 
amending federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have already pointed out, hundreds of businesses 
across the country already extend same sex benefits to their 
employees as does the federal government.  Over 200 leading 
businesses in Canada, such as Bell Canada, Sears, IBM, the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Bank of Montreal, Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines, all consider it good policy to extend benefits 
to the same sex partners of their employees and they have done so 
for years. So too have 30 municipalities, 35 universities, 
countless hospitals, libraries and community and social service 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, all but three provinces provide social benefits to 
same sex and opposite sex common law couples in their workforces. 
The three largest provinces, British Columbia, Ontario and 
Quebec, have recently introduced or have already implemented the 
necessary changes to bring their laws and policies and practices 
into line with today's social reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, courts and companies have acted to bring fairness to 
all citizens.  Members of parliament must do the same.  We have 
an opportunity to bring federal laws into line with Canadian 
values as reflected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and interpreted by the supreme court.  We have an 
obligation to correct the shortcomings in our statutes, a duty to 
ensure they are constitutional and a responsibility to ensure 
fairness for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said in this House and during this debate about 
changes to the definition of marriage.  Let me be very clear. 
There will be no change in the definition of marriage.  A motion 
passed in this very House last year confirmed that marriage is 
the union between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all 
others.  This will not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Importantly, the changes we are bringing forward confer benefits 
and obligations on same sex couples.  For example, currently in 
married and common law relationships, the combined income of the 
man and woman are used to determine eligibility for the GST-HST 
credit.  Same sex partners currently apply for the credit as 
unrelated individuals and perhaps in some instances even gain 
financially by doing so. In the interest of fairness, Bill C-23 
will impose the same obligations on same sex partners as those of 
opposite sex common law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, this is thoughtful, responsible legislation.  It 
recognizes and reconciles our legal and moral obligations to 
ensure fairness and equality for all Canadians.  It outlines 
obligations and benefits.  Perhaps most important, Bill C-23 
makes it clear that Canadians will no longer tolerate 
discrimination on any ground, including sexual orientation.  It 
reaffirms our profound commitment to fairness and justice. This 
bill is truly a cause for celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the 21st century all Canadians can put 
behind them the idea that gay and lesbian Canadians are less than 
equal citizens. 
With the passage of this legislation we can write a new chapter 
in the evolving story of this great nation, a story of equality 
and respect for all which our children and grandchildren will be 
proud to retell.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Generations of Canadians have worked hard to build a country 
where people of different beliefs, religions and race and ways of 
viewing the world can coexist and thrive together.  Men and women 
across the country in communities from Gander to Victoria to 
Resolute Bay have come to recognize our diversity as a source of 
national strength, inspiration and pride.  This legislation 
reflects those values and I hope all hon. members will support 
the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member. I too would like to enter 
the debate on Bill C-23 to speak out on behalf of a minority 
group in the country, that group being Christians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us must remember that every morning we start with a 
prayer in this place.  The laws we have developed in this place 
are also developed because of our Christian heritage. I speak out 
on behalf of the traditions, society and foundations we have in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 was introduced in the House about 10 days ago.  A 
number of people have phoned my office or written in by e-mail, 
by letter or have faxed me.  I have letters from two well-known 
organizations, Focus on the Family and the Evangelical Fellowship 
of Canada which has several thousand members in Canada.  They 
deserve to be heard in this debate because they believe, as I do, 
that the union of a man and a woman is something sacred in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Parliament of Canada extended benefits in the 
first place.  If we look back at the family allowance program, an 
old program which is no longer with us, the Government of Canada 
and Parliament of Canada developed that program because the union 
of a man and a woman is very special.  They procreate; they have 
children.  The Government of Canada and the Parliament of Canada 
extended benefits to the family because there is a special status 
for that family and it is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent booklet by Human Resources Development Canada, 
“Social Security in Canada: Background Facts”, answers some 
questions. It states that our social safety net was intended to 
meet the needs of the traditional married family.  The booklet 
states: “Much of our social security structure and our work 
arrangements were developed to meet the needs of the average 
Canadian household as it existed”. It goes on to state that 
households consisted of two parents with two children. This was 
back in the fifties and sixties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of parliament when designing social benefits like the 
former family allowance program and current child tax benefit was 
to encourage and to protect the union of a man and a woman, and 
their children.  Marriage was the key to that union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families are facing difficult times. Crippling taxation has been 
foisted on them by the last six or seven years of federal Liberal 
government mismanagement.  Both parents are being forced to go out 
to work.  Day care and child care expenses are escalating.  There 
is a tremendous amount of pressure on the traditional family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has not changed is that marriage, the union of a 
heterosexual couple, is the backbone of Canadian society and the 
cornerstone of public policy because it is the only union that 
can procreate with the intent of caring for and raising children 
over the long term.  It is not an institution that should be 
unilaterally changed by the courts, bureaucrats or the federal 
Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of us know, effectively raising children requires a 
sustained expenditure of resources.  It is to the benefit of all 
society that the next generation of children grows into healthy 
adults.  Given the fact of married couples who are dedicated to 
raising children, the next generation requires continued support 
by parliament, by the 301 members of parliament to meet those 
children's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June parliament directed the Liberal government to affirm 
the definition of marriage in legislation with wide support of 
the Reform Party motion.  By introducing Bill C-23, however, the 
Liberals once again are ignoring the will of the Canadian people. 
Bill C-23 strips the institution of marriage of its unique public 
policy recognition.  Not only does Bill C-23 fail to affirm the 
definition of marriage.  It actually repeals the definition of 
marriage while it redefines terms such as related person and 
family.  In many instances the term spouse is being replaced by 
the word survivor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 introduces a new concept of common law partner which 
is defined as a person cohabiting with another person in a 
conjugal relationship for a year.  The legislation fails to 
precisely define conjugal but alludes to the fact that it is 
referring to sexual activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our social benefits were created to support and sustain the 
unique institution of marriage and the rearing of children. 
Extending the benefits of a traditional married family to two 
people who happen to live together in a conjugal relationship for 
one year is unfair and creates inequality.  Why?  It is unfair 
because the Liberals have chosen to extend benefits based solely 
on the presence of sexual activity while completely ignoring the 
unique role of marriage and child rearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 creates inequality because it blatantly discriminates 
against other important relationships of dependency where no 
sexual activity occurs whatsoever.  It is not uncommon for 
elderly siblings, for instance, to live together or a parent with 
adult children.  In fact poll respondents who indicate acceptance 
of benefits going to same sex couples show a stronger degree of 
support for benefits going to any relationship of economic 
dependence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has missed the mark on Bill C-23.  Many 
Canadians are clearly telling the government that economic 
dependence, not sexual activity, should determine the benefits 
and entitlements.  The Liberal government should be required to 
demonstrate a clear and compelling public interest for extending 
benefits based on one's sexual activity and not economic 
dependency.  The Liberals cannot because there are no compelling 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is legislation that is being driven by the courts and 
not by the economic needs of individual Canadians.  In fact I 
would argue that the Liberals do not care about the economic 
needs of Canadians one bit.  Since 1993 the Liberals have 
increased taxes every year through bracket creep.  They have cut 
transfer payments to the provinces.  They have cut employment 
insurance.  They have increased payroll taxes.  They have refused 
to index income tax rates with inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because sexual activity is the sole criterion for determining 
who receives benefits and who does not, Canadian taxpayers are 
wondering how the government will know whether a couple is truly 
having a conjugal relationship.  For the past month Canadians 
have witnessed how the Liberals have bungled the whole scheme of 
grants.  Granting benefits based on something difficult to prove 
will create more havoc and abuse than Human Resources Development 
Canada or any other department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  What about a heterosexual couple? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member from British 
Columbia is loud and proud.  He is interrupting my speech, but I 
believe a homosexual couple would be far more interested in 
seeing broad based tax cuts delivered by the government than the 
benefits that we are talking about today in Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up my speech this afternoon by saying again that I 
speak today on behalf of a minority group, that minority group 
being Christians who feel that the legislature of the country has 
a responsibility to set aside and make laws based on the 
uniqueness of the marriage between a man and woman and extending 
benefits to make sure that family unit is protected and looked 
after by the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the 10 minutes I am allotted I begin my remarks by 
acknowledging and thanking my government, the House leader and in 
particular the chief government whip for permitting me the 
opportunity to speak today.  It is well known to them at least 
that I do not support the legislation as written and I am glad to 
have the opportunity to explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that in the House most if not all members of 
parliament including myself have made up their minds. Most if not 
all the media has made up its mind on the issue and the courts 
appear to be making up their minds, so my remarks are addressed 
to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to reproduce these remarks in my spring householder.  I 
want my constituents to know that I stand here today to represent 
their views as they have communicated them directly to me over 
the 11 years I have been a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also speak today to those ordinary Canadians who may be 
listening and who have not yet made up their minds.  I ask them 
to continue to listen to the debate carefully and objectively.  I 
hope to some degree that I am speaking to future generations who 
may review these debates for historical or other reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support the bill as written and therefore I cannot 
support it in principle.  I will be moving amendments at report 
stage.  If they do not pass I cannot support the bill at report 
stage or at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not?  When I was discussing this issue with my colleagues, 
in particular with cabinet colleagues, I asked for three things 
before I could consider extending benefits beyond the benefits 
currently granted by the House.  First, I asked for a definition 
of marriage to be enshrined in statute so as to protect it from 
judicial attack.  I asked to extend the benefits based not on 
sexuality and sexual behaviour but on economic dependency.  I 
also asked that there be full and complete debate in parliament 
including not invoking time allocation or closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no definition of marriage in Bill C-23.  There is no 
extension of benefits based on economic dependency and there is a 
stifling of debate by invoking time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the bill is fatally flawed for the following reasons. 
It uses the term conjugal to include same sex relationships. This 
is, quite simply, incorrect.  The ordinary meaning of the word 
conjugal in the English language is as follows: “Of marriage; 
the right of sexual intercourse with a spouse; of the mutual 
relation of husband and wife”. To the question “why the word 
conjugal has been used to describe same sex couples” the justice 
department answers that the term conjugal has a meaning in law 
that is different from that in dictionaries. This also is simply 
incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the legal meaning of conjugal?  It is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of or belonging to marriage or the married state; suitable or 
appropriate to the married state or to married persons; 
matrimonial; connubial. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The source of that definition is Black's Law Dictionary.  As 
anyone who is listening will recognize, it has the same meaning 
as the definition in the English dictionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department goes on to say that the term conjugal has 
been used for 40 years to refer to common law relationships. This 
is only half true.  It has always, until very recently, referred 
solely to heterosexual partners in a common law marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meaning is now being expanded, first by activist judges such 
as those in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of 
Rosenberg and in the Supreme Court of Canada in M v H, 
completely ignoring the contrary view stated by the very same 
Supreme Court of Canada in Egan and Nesbit. 
Therefore in my judgment and in my analysis there is a hidden 
agenda, namely to allow these same activist judges to eventually 
declare the current prohibition of marriages between same sex 
people to be unconstitutional.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1999, we passed a resolution in the House supported 
by the vast majority of my Liberal colleagues.  I will only quote 
part of it, that parliament will take all necessary steps to 
preserve this definition.  What definition?  The definition of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this is a perfect opportunity to do what parliament 
has already voted on, that is to preserve the definition of 
marriage.  How could it be done?  Very simply by taking this 
omnibus bill which deals with 68 other statutes, adding the Marriage 
Act and including in the definition of marriage which the House 
agreed to in June 1999.  According to the Minister of Justice 
there is no need to do this.  If there is no need to do this then 
there is no harm in doing it, so why not put it in?  On June 8, 
1999, the Minister of Justice said in her speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of marriage, which has been consistently applied 
in Canada comes from an 1866 British case which holds that 
marriage is “the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others”.  That case and that definition are considered 
clear law by ordinary Canadians, by academics and by the courts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply not correct.  She goes on to say that the Ontario 
Court, General Division, recently upheld in Layland and Beaulne 
the definition of marriage.  That was a majority decision of the 
court.  If the definition is as clear in law as the justice 
minister says, why was it not a unanimous decision of the Ontario 
court?  In fact it was not.  It was, as she states, a majority 
decision, a majority of two to one.  Why?  It was because one of 
the judges said that it was perfectly acceptable to have marriage 
between same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the law is as clear as the justice minister says, why was 
that decision two to one?  Why were there academics who supported 
that position in the Ontario court if, as the justice minister 
says, all academics in Canada agree with that definition?  In

challenged on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not put it in this statute to stifle any further question

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I have one minute left.  That does not give me nearly

questionable because it is only mentioning parts of it. I have 
the poll here.  Let me read the final question that was put 
forward. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested that benefits and obligations should not 
depend on relationships like spouses but on any relationship of 
economic dependency where people are living together, such as 
elderly siblings living together or a parent and adult child 
living together, et cetera.  Do you agree or disagree with this 
view? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-one per cent of Canadians agreed that benefits should be 
given on the basis of economic dependency in the government's own 
poll, not on the basis of whom a person is having sex with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say on behalf of my constituents, 86% of whom have clearly 
told me that they dispute and do not agree with the Supreme Court 
of Canada decision in M v H, that we should protect the 
definition of marriage.  If we are to extend benefits, let us 
extend them to everyone in a position of economic dependency and 
not on the basis of what they do in the bedroom.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the House of Commons deals with very many important issues that 
are fundamental to the lives of every citizen in Canada.  There 
is no issue more important than the very basis of our society, 
our family and our family units.  Any society in the world is no 
stronger than its smallest unit.  Unfortunately legislation 
frequently chips away at the ability of Canadians to organize 
themselves in a way to enhance their family unit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in 
relation to benefits and obligations, would amend 68 federal 
laws, affecting key departments and agencies.  The bill creates a 
new term called common law partner, defined as a person 
cohabiting with another person of either sex in a conjugal 
relationship for a year.  Probably the most massive flaw with 
this legislation is that the word conjugal is undefined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants us to believe that this bill merely gives 
same sex couples the same federal benefits as heterosexual 
couples.  Mainstream news media parrot the same line.  The 
definitions of spouse and marriage have been under aggressive 
attack for many years.  The courts have asked politicians, 
elected by Canadians, to express the opinions of Canadians in 
law.  In 1995, one member of the Supreme Court Canada, Mr. 
Justice La Forest, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heterosexual relationship is firmly anchored in the 
biological and social realities that heterosexual couples have 
the unique ability to procreate.  Most children are the products 
of these relationships, and they are generally cared for and 
nurtured by those who live in that relationship.  In this sense, 
marriage is by nature heterosexual.  It would be possible to 
legally define marriage to include homosexual couples, but this 
would not change the biological and social realities that 
underline the traditional marriage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998, in the wake of court actions chipping away at the 
definition of marriage, members of parliament voted 216 to 55 in 
support of a motion which stated that “marriage is and should 
remain the union of a man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others and that parliament will take all necessary steps to 
preserve this definition of marriage in Canada”.  Bill C-23 
violates both the letter and the spirit of that motion, in spite 
of the fact that it was passed overwhelmingly by members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister stated during the debate:  “We on this 
side of the House of Commons agree that the institution of 
marriage is a central and important institution in the lives of 
many Canadians.  Indeed, worldwide it plays an important part in 
all society, second only to the fundamental importance of 
family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted by the justice minister, every society in the world, 
whether based on religious or non-religious standards, holds the 
uniqueness of the heterosexual relationship and the family unit 
in a unique and special position.  There are social benefits 
extended by every nation relating to the traditional family unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going into the 21st century it must be recognized that there are 
many single parent families, sometimes based on choice, sometimes 
based on uncontrolled events.  This is why Canadian society had 
decided, along with the rest of the world's nations, to extend 
special benefits to people in relationships that are similar to 
heterosexual traditional family units.  Rightfully, those 
benefits are extended to single parents along with family units 
related by blood, marriage and adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has stated that she is proceeding with the 
legislation because the courts made her do it.  Yet in 1995 
Justice Gonthier said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts must therefore be wary of second-guessing legislative 
social policy choices relating to the status, rights and 
obligations of marriage, a basic institution of our society and 
intimately related to its fundamental values. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has not demanded or even hinted that it wants 
this widespread, sweeping power which eliminates the special 
status for heterosexual couples in marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last eight years there has been an amazing erosion of 
legislative support for traditional marriage, and this in spite 
of the fact that there is overwhelming evidence showing the 
benefits of traditional marriage to children, adults and society. 
The government has eliminated any incentive under family law to 
marry.  The erosion has been led by certain politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1994, when the member for Mississauga West was a 
provincial MPP in Ontario, he said this about similar Ontario 
legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us who are opposed to this bill find it difficult to 
accept the lecturing that seems to go that if you are opposed to 
the bill you are somehow opposed to democracy.  I have just had 
it up to here with being called a racist or a bigot because I 
cannot accept the fact that the spouse is a member of the same 
sex.  That is my right, indeed my responsibility.  I have an 
obligation on the part of the people I represent and on the part 
of my family, from (the) heart, (to) speak my mind on this issue. 
I reject any attempt to try and muzzle people or try to 
intimidate us to try and paint this as some kind of human rights 
issue.

this month stood in his place and made what amounted to a full

Reform Party as he had been labelled six years ago.  He attacks 
us in the way he had been attacked.  What monumental hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal House leader, who is ramming this legislation 
through the House today, in 1994 said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to any suggestion that would have homosexual couples 
treated the same way as heterosexual couples.  Although I will 
fight against any form of discrimination whether it is on the 
basis of race, sex, religion or other, I do not believe 
homosexuals should be treated as families. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the government House leader speaking six years ago.  He 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Maryanne and I do not claim we are homosexual.  Why 
should homosexuals pretend they form a family? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five and a half years later, as House leader, he is the enforcer 
of the Prime Minister's iron fist to all Liberal backbenchers 
that they support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically to the case of benefits, when the current health 
minister was Minister of Justice in 1996 he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that in the year since March 1994 the Supreme Court of Canada 
decided the case of Egan and Nesbit.  It decided that 
notwithstanding that sexual orientation is a ground within 
section 15 of the charter on which discrimination is prohibited, 
the benefits do not automatically flow; so much for logic and 
that is the law. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago the Liberal Government of Canada clearly stated 
that it did not support an extension to same sex partners of 
pension benefits and other benefits, yet here we are today with 
the government speeding legislation through the House of Commons 
which will do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of the traditional family unit is so important to 
our society that the definition of marriage must be protected by 
legislation.  The spectacular flip-flops of Liberal cabinet 
ministers and backbenchers now that they are in power cries out 
for consistent legislation and specific direction for our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is fundamental to the lives of every citizen in Canada.  In 
spite of the feel good, fuzzy reasoning by Liberal backbenchers 
today, the effect of this bill is to depreciate the unique value 
and special meaning of marriage in Canada.  Any society in the 
world is no stronger than its smallest unit, the family.  Bill 
C-23 not only undercuts marriage and the family, it is just plain 
bad law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of 
Women), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this omnibus bill is a major step 
toward equality, since it seeks to correct the inequalities 
based on sexual orientation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus bill to modernize benefits and obligations is 
legislation whose time has come.  It is legislation that speaks 
very clearly to the issue of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within our country the issue of equality is carried forth in our 
charter of rights and freedoms.  It is brought forward in our 
Canadian Human Rights Act.  It is served by issues such as 
employment equity, the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, citizenship 
and immigration.  There are many acts and pieces of legislation 
in this country which deal with the issue of inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have identified over the years that there are very different 
ways in which inequality can occur.  There are many barriers. 
People say it is due to various reasons, most of which are about 
differences.  We have shown very clearly, the courts have shown 
very clearly and we have seen through the knowledge of people, 
communities and the manner in which they live that there is in 
fact inequality in this country based on sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a physician for 23 years.  In practising medicine I saw 
firsthand the destruction and damage that discrimination causes, 
especially to persons whose sexual orientation is different from 
the mainstream.  The simple right to call themselves a family we 
have heard over and over again being denigrated by Reform members 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard Reformers say that benefits and obligations have to 
do only with family and that has to do only with children.  I am 
here to tell the Reform Party that there are gay and lesbian 
couples who actually have children.  I know it is a shock to 
members across the way, but they actually have children from 
previous marriages or children whom they have adopted.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of children and families has to do with a unit, as the 
last member who spoke said; a unit that is loving and supportive, 
a unit that cares for and raises children.  We know that gay and 
lesbian couples do this.  If it is about children, then the bill 
is doing exactly the right thing, ensuring that persons with 
children have equal benefits and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard Reform members suggest that this is not about 
children at all, that this is really about sex and who has sex, 
and that the term conjugal means sex and only sex.  The term 
conjugal in the dictionary is about sex.  Under the law there are 
many criteria which are used to define a conjugal relationship. 
Sex is only one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that by bringing forward the bill we will suddenly be 
going into the bedrooms of the nation.   We never have before 
concerning the issue of married couples.  I do not know if all 
married couples have sex.  Should we be questioning them and then 
deny them benefits and obligations based on their ability to have 
or wish to have sex?  We have not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty years ago when we brought heterosexual common law couples 
into legislation we did not ask a question about sex.  Why do we 
suddenly have to ask a question about sex now?  Are we not 
applying a very different set of rules?  Is applying a very 
different set of rules and a very different set of criteria not 
exactly what discrimination is about?  How is it that this issue 
becomes one of importance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of rights and obligations, we are able to ensure 
that homosexual couples who have lived together and have told the 
world so by the way they behave toward each other enjoy the same 
benefits as heterosexual common law couples.  They have bought 
homes together.  They have lived together as faithful couples for 
many years.  Are we saying that because of differences, because 
they are the same sex and not heterosexual, they do not deserve 
the rights and obligations of others when they have committed to 
each other in a relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus legislation is not only about rights; it also 
speaks to obligation.  When a couple commits to a conjugal 
relationship that couple takes on the obligation to support each 
other.  If the couple separates, there is a mechanism and a 
process by which the individuals can continue to support each 
other, whether financially or through the division of property. 
This speaks to the obligation of people who have made a 
commitment to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition have brought in the red herring of 
other dependent relationships, saying that if two sisters live 
together this should be so, and if a parent and a child live 
together this should be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member said that we do not know if the people involved in 
those relationships wish to accept the obligation.  If they 
should separate, if the child should leave the parent, will the 
child be legally responsible to that parent later on, to support 
the parent or divide assets or whatever?  We do not know enough 
about those kinds of relationships to decide whether we can apply 
the same legislation to them.  There is time to do that.  There 
is time to discuss it.  Many of these issues involve provincial 
jurisdiction.  We will talk with the provinces.  We will look at 
the impact.  We will look at whether people in other 
relationships wish to have the obligations as well as the 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that we have discriminated against couples who have 
identified themselves as living in conjugal relationships purely 
and simply because of one reason:  they are not heterosexual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone a great distance since it came to power 
in 1993.  It has moved the equality agenda forward by amending 
the Canadian Human Rights Act to add sexual orientation as a 
prohibited grounds for discrimination.  It has added sexual 
orientation to hate crimes legislation.  It has moved for 
Treasury Board to apply health benefits and dental benefits to 
same sex couples.  It has moved forward recently in a Treasury 
Board bill to ensure pensions for same sex couples.  This is just 
a logical extension. 
Regardless, the supreme court and various human rights 
commissions across the country have told us very clearly that we 
have discriminated, in fact and in law, against same sex couples. 
We have moved to change that.  It is not only that the supreme 
court has told us that.  It is that this is a progression of 
things we started in 1993.

whether they be women of colour, whether they be women of 
different religions, whether they be lesbians.  There have been 
enough surveys done in my department that show there has been a 
great deal of discrimination against lesbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to stand across the way and say that one speaks on 
behalf of various minorities.  One has to live in a minority to 
understand what it means to be discriminated against.  There are 
same sex couples who, when they apply for a job, have had to hide 
the fact that they are in a same sex relationship.  Persons have 
had to hide the fact that they were gay or lesbian because they 
would not be allowed to work as teachers, or nurses, or in 
various areas where they would have to come into contact with the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is discrimination.  It affects where they work, which is a 
fundamental human right, where they play, whom they love, how 
they love and where they love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things that we are bound to achieve in 
this government.  We are committed to defending the human rights, 
les droits de la personne.  We are committed to ensuring that all 
Canadians, whether they look like the majority, whether they 
sound like the majority because of linguistic differences or 
whether they love like the majority, will not be discriminated 
against.  This is very clearly what this is about.  It is not 
some sort of hidden agenda.  It is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anyone who wishes to look at human rights, who espouses the 
dignity of the individual and the right of children and families 
to grow up together regardless of the colour, race, religion and 
sexual orientation of their parents, know that everyone must have 
the right to bind together as a unit in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard no one across the way asking if it was appropriate 
for gays and lesbians to pay taxes or to pay into the various 
premium plans we have to pay into to get the benefits that they 
do not get.  They have been allowed to pay.  They are considered 
to be equal in payment.  Let us now allow them to be equal in 
achieving the benefits that we all have.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why this legislative measure by parliament, like that of 
the Quebec National Assembly, seems to go against the tradition 
of openness and tolerance which characterizes Canadian society. 
Even in the United States, where liberalism is definitely not a 
main trait of society, some presidential candidates—namely John 
McCain—feel that Americans would be ready to elect a homosexual 
president. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that interracial marriages were illegal 
until the United States Supreme Court brought down its decision 
in Loving v. Virginia in 1967.  In Canada, until the positive 
intervention of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, homosexuality 
constituted a criminal act.  In this case, let us render unto 
Caesar the things that are Caesar's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the states of California and Hawaii also give 
partial recognition to unions between persons of the same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, complaints are filed with human rights commissions 
on the federal or provincial level concerning discrimination 
toward homosexuals relating to hiring, firing and treatment in 
the workplace.  This and other evidence points to discrimination 
against homosexuals. Sexual orientation is, unfortunately, a 
rarely mentioned factor in suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies reveal that young people, both male and female, who are 
homosexual are two to three times more likely than other young 
people to commit suicide.  More than three-quarters of these give 
as the main reason for their suicide attempt the conflicts 
arising out of their sexual orientation.  This is a clear 
demonstration of the negative environment in which homosexuals 
have to live and grow up.

overdue and will meet our obligations as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay a special tribute to the member for Burnaby—Douglas who 
has probably done more than anyone in the history of the country 
to pursue the goal of full equality for gay and lesbian people 
and to ensure that the values of Canadians around full equality, 
justice and fairness were fully enshrined in the laws of this 
land.  There are many people to whom I could pay tribute, but I 
wanted to single out the unswerving and dedicated work of the 
member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about equality, justice and fairness.  It is about 
meeting our obligations.  It is a long overdue measure to make 
operational the principle of equality for all people regardless 
of sexual orientation as articulated in the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, in numerous 
provincial statutes, in various court decisions and particularly 
by the Supreme Court of Canada in the spring of 1999, the highest 
court in the land, which ruled on this very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said earlier today, this is a housekeeping bill. It brings 
us up to date with the laws of the land.  It puts into practice 
the values of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. The 
legislation represents a basic democratic right of Canadians.  It 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  It 
takes us a step closer to the goal of full equality for all gay 
and lesbian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to some of the comments I heard today from Reform 
members, the bill captures the true meaning of family, not as 
some artificial construct based on some idyllic view of the past 
that never was, based on some norms of a previous society, based 
on various interpretations in the Bible or based on cultural 
conditioning that has permeated every aspect of our society 
today, but a definition of family that keeps pace with society, 
that captures the very fundamental issues that we are dealing 
with: loving relationships, safe and nurturing environments and a 
commitment to ensure the well-being of all members of the family 
unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was taken aback by the comments of the Reform Party today. 
Many times when we have had these debates the Reform members have 
shown their feelings on this issue in a rather veiled attempt, 
focusing on the intricacies of a bill rather than exposing their 
feelings on sexual orientation.  What we have heard today from 
the Reform Party and some Liberal backbenchers is just how far we 
must go as a society in recognizing equality of all people 
regardless of sexual orientation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but go back to some of the writings of the 
Vanier Institute of the Family.  It has written so many articles 
and has spoken so well about the family. I want to put on record 
a quotation from an article by Suanne Kelman from the winter 1999 
edition of <I>Transition</I>. She said, “I think what we can 
learn from the past is that we should ignore the hysteria many 
critics bring to the discussion of family life today.  We are not 
going to find perfect answers for every family but that fact 
should not stop us from grappling with the realities facing us. 
If we can recognize the impossibility of returning to a past we 
never had, we can get going, cheerfully, intelligently and 
compassionately on improving the future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are doing today.  We are clearly moving forward 
intelligently and compassionately on a notion of family that is 
rooted in the fundamentals of companionship and friendship, love 
and nurturing, caring and concern. That is the essence of this 
bill.  That is why it is important we move forward and recognize 
the need to ensure that those values are enshrined in every law 
of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is clear to me more than ever that there are those who 
fundamentally oppose the notion of recognizing people who are 
homosexual.  I appreciate there are differences that we still 
have to address.  I hope that the Reform Party does not try to 
take us back to an age when people are not recognized for their 
individual talents and contributions which they can make to our 
society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we are having today in many ways reminds me of the 
debate we had in the spring of 1998. The Reform Party brought in 
its motion pertaining to the Rosenberg decision in the Ontario 
court and presented us with what we all considered to be a most 
regrettable situation.  It was clearly seen to be a thinly veiled 
attempt to promote and endorse discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. That is being repeated today and I am very 
worried about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that on entering this millennium we would be 
looking at some very fundamental values that have to be upheld 
and supported in every law over which we have authority and every 
practice and program that we are responsible for. I hope we can 
move forward with a clear understanding of what this bill is all 
about and why it is so important for the fabric of Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by quoting from an article written by 
Helen Fallding which appeared in the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> on 
February 16.  In her article, “A Valentine for the Minister”, 
Helen congratulated the government for bringing forward this 
legislation and recognizing the reality in terms of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not quote the article directly because that would mean 
mentioning the minister's name.  Helen said that if the Minister 
of Justice “manages to sneak the new bill passed Liberal 
backbenchers and Reform Party opponents, Lisa”—her 
partner—“and I will receive the same treatment from federal 
government departments as common law couples”.  She went on to 
say, “Each year when I make my RRSP contribution, I pray that 
the federal government will stop its discriminatory practices 
before one of us dies.  If I died tomorrow, Lisa would have to 
pay taxes on my RRSP savings, instead of having them roll over 
into her account as they do for heterosexual widows”.  She 
concluded by saying that this “is not really about money for me. 
It is about finally getting to feel like a Canadian citizen.  It 
is about having my country acknowledge the mutual support and 
commitment partners like Lisa and I offer each other.  Ultimately 
it is about love”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will all support this bill and get on with the 
important work ahead of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to stand in the House to support the 
government initiative.  It is the right initiative and has been 
introduced at the right time. We should not have had to wait 
until the supreme court told us to do what we have done but the 
mere fact that we have done it is to be commended. This showed 
leadership on the part of the government and on the part of the 
minister in moving forward with this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues wonder about the pros and cons of this 
bill.  The bottom line is that we are not the first ones to come 
out of the gate.  A number of provinces have already introduced 
legislation to extend benefits to same sex partners or opposite 
sex partners who live in common law relationships.  In excess of 
200 private sector companies already have measures, laws or 
directives on their books that extend benefits to those who live 
in common law relationships or same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a number of letters from those who are for and 
those who are opposed.  Concerning those who are opposed, there 
is much misinformation coming out.  One of the key concerns those 
opposed seem to have is that this legislation will destroy the 
institution of marriage between a man and a woman. In fairness, 
this bill does not do that at all.  The institution remains as it 
stands now, which is a relationship or a contract between a man 
and a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation merely moves forward what has been a fact for a 
long time in our society.  It also sets the beginning of a long 
process for the government and for society to address many of the 
issues that have been on people's minds for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the commitment the government has shown in addressing the 
whole notion of what a dependant is.  This is to be commended 
because the issue deserves further study.  For example, should a 
woman or a man identify his or her mother or father as a 
dependant if the two live in the same environment? For a father 
and a son, or a father and a daughter who live under the same 
roof, should the law recognize and provide benefits the same as 
this legislation does? On the surface, I would say of course.  A 
single person who supports a family member whether it is a 
brother, sister, mother or child, should be allowed to designate 
that person as a dependant and therefore benefits should be given 
to that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about extending benefits, extending rights, we also 
have to talk about extending obligations.  In legislation every 
time we extend or advance one issue, there are all of the good 
things that go with it in terms of benefits, but other things go 
along with it as well which are the obligations. That is exactly 
what this bill does.  It provides people who live in common law 
relationships or in same sex relationships similar benefits and 
obligations as those provided to others who live in the same sort 
of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unequivocally clear that Canadians wanted the government 
to act on this issue.  A 1998 poll by Angus Reid showed that the 
majority of Canadians, more than two to one, in every region of 
Canada favoured legislation that introduced benefits to those who 
live in common law or same sex relationships.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court itself has told us as a society and as a government 
that it is time to put in law what has been a fact of life for 
many years.  It already has been implemented by many people in 
the private sector, as well as some provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario have changed their 
legislation or they are in the process of reviewing their laws to 
extend those benefits.  We are not alone.  We are moving 
collectively with other governments to ensure that we put into 
law what should have been put in place quite some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who are concerned about adoption by people in 
same sex relationships and also the whole issue of immigration 
and so on.  The legislation does not change anything.  Canadian 
law will remain the same on those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government must take a leadership role.  Sometimes it has to 
take leadership on tough issues.  In this situation not only is 
the government doing what is right, but it is doing what the 
people want it to do and what the courts have told the government 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be a non-partisan issue. Members on both sides of 
the House should be applauding. The Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms provides every citizen with equal rights and a 
chance to access justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that our colleagues on the other side of the House 
applaud the government and move on with the legislation. At the 
same time our government has already made a commitment to study 
further the issue of extending benefits to people who have 
dependants who rely on them, whether it is a mother, a brother, a 
sister, a father and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a personal interest in the bill and I would like to see 
it pass quickly.  I have a daughter and I am not married.  My 
daughter is dependent on me.  I am very interested in the 
Government of Canada studying this situation further. Possibly it 
will be feasible and acceptable at some point in time to address 
the whole notion of allowing an individual to declare another 
individual as a dependant should that be the case. To say that I 
have to block any movement by the government until such a time as 
this whole issue is addressed would be foolish and not 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take what we already have as a consensus in society, 
implement it and entrench it in law.  The next phase would be to 
study the other issues of dependency.  People like myself, many 
of my colleagues and others in society would have a chance to 
make their case before the government, a committee of the House 
of Commons or their members of parliament.  Surely if the 
economic situation in Canada continues to improve further, we 
would come to a point where we would not even need to discuss 
those issues.  It would be irrelevant because we would be able to 
afford to do what everyone wanted us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, I support the bill. I hope my colleagues on both 
sides of the House will support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-23, the modernization of benefits 
and obligations act.  I support this piece of legislation and I 
am happy that as a member of parliament I have the opportunity to 
outline my reasons, although it is just under the wire with 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not attempting to change anyone's beliefs.  It is 
not trying to impose a moral structure on society.  This piece of 
legislation is striving to address a financial inequality in 
Canada.  Federal benefits and obligations for same sex couples 
will be on equal footing with those of heterosexual common law 
couples.  As the courts have ruled, they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have said that it is unconstitutional for same sex 
couples to be treated differently than heterosexual ones when it 
comes to benefits and obligations.  Since 1995 sexual orientation 
has fallen under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  The bill has that very much in mind and will ensure 
justice and fairness for same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage will not change after the bill is given royal assent. 
Marriage has traditionally been the union of one man and one 
woman.  That remains unchanged in the bill.  Further, the bill is 
non-religious and does not attempt to change or alter anyone's 
beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a problem with the bill per se, but I do have 
reservations, several for that matter.  My reservations have to 
do with the timing of the legislation.  The fact that it was 
tabled on February 11 was no accident.  The timing is part of an 
orchestrated plan of the Liberals.  Allow me to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and other members of cabinet stand in the 
House on a regular basis and vent about how strong the economy 
is.  The unemployment rate is at its lowest rate in years, they 
say.  The deficit is eliminated, so we are told.  Interest rates 
are low.  Inflation is a thing of the past.  Parts of the economy 
are thriving, not because of Liberal policies but due to policies 
of the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, not all is well in our glorious land.  Health care 
is sorely underfunded.  Our refugee and immigration systems are 
broken and in need of repair.  We hear daily about the problems 
at HRDC.  Any government would want the public to forget about a 
billion dollar boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was first elected to the House in 1963.  He 
was present in the House when gay rights were debated and he 
knows full well the ire, emotion and controversy that such a 
discussion entails among Canadians.  He was present in the House, 
for example, in 1969 when homosexual acts between consenting 
adults were decriminalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is introduced at this time not because of a 
genuine desire for fairness and equality by the Liberals, not 
because of a desire to uphold a supreme court ruling, but rather 
to deflect public scrutiny from other governmental issues.  What 
better way to do that than to introduce legislation guaranteeing 
rights for gays and lesbians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a liberal democracy where the rights of everyone are 
respected and upheld.  That is the purpose of the bill, but it is 
shameful that the government is introducing it now when there are 
other pressing issues like HRDC, health care, education, 
immigration and national defence.  It is sad that the government 
uses such an important issue as equality to deflect attention 
from government controversies.  It is also sad that the 
government again uses time allocation to stifle debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hon. members have talked about marriage and spouse.  The 
bill has no reference to marriage or spouse.  It is a technical 
bill dealing with economic and legal rights.  I agree with other 
hon. members that the bill should have been clearer about the 
definitions of marriage and spouse, the union between a man and a 
woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is not dealt with is economic dependency.  We 
are missing the boat.  We all know family members or friends who 
have to live together to survive.  Why were these items not dealt 
with?  What was the rush?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-23.  I agree 
with my hon. Tory colleague who just spoke when he asked what was 
the rush.  We have missed an opportunity to do a couple of things 
the government neglected to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, on June 8, 1999, parliament passed a motion 
that we should affirm the definition of marriage in legislation. 
There is not a more perfect opportunity to do that than right 
now.  Whether in this bill or in another, this is when it should 
have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members of the NDP, including the member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, mention the Reform Party.  It was almost 
every 10th word in her speech.  I state on the record right now 
that my colleagues and I are not opposed to making sure that 
people are treated equally and fairly, including people of 
co-dependence, heterosexual and homosexual.  That is what we want 
to try to do.  They should be getting benefits but the bill does 
not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is based on sexuality.  All the way through it, it says 
that relationships must be conjugal.  How is that defined?  What 
does it mean?  One of the two biggest issues with the bill is the 
definition of marriage.  Parliament sent a very clear signal, as 
did Canadians, that marriage needs to be defined in legislation. 
The federal government has been remiss.  That has been completely 
overlooked.  The bill is being rammed through for a whole host of 
reasons.  People try to paint us as being against equality, that 
we do not support it.  That is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton Southwest put forward a very good 
solution in registered domestic partnerships.  It may need 
fine-tuning but I applaud him for it.  Not everyone in my caucus 
would completely agree with him but he had a lot of support.  He 
put forward a solution wherein we could define marriage and 
benefits could have been paid out but not on the basis of sex as 
the bill does.  Let us not make any mistake or have any illusions 
about what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Miramichi said on June 2, the the days leading up 
to the definition of marriage, that anything based upon sex was 
the poorest way to define a relationship whether it be the same 
sex or the other sex.  I could not agree more.  That is my 
frustration.  Some people are trying to suggest that we do not 
want to see equality.  That is not true at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things the government should have done but it did 
not.  It missed the most fundamental task that parliament 
directed it to do.  That is what frustrates me.  I absolutely 
believe in no uncertain terms that marriage is between a man and 
a woman.  It is not between two men as some people would like to 
suggest and have argued for.  Marriage is between a man and a 
woman, and that is all it can be.  A very clear signal could have 
been sent by defining that in legislation, but the government did 
not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not so sure I have confidence in the government when it 
obviously leaves something out that was so easy to include.  What 
is its underlining motive?  I ask that after being a member of 
parliament since 1997 and watching what goes on in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more important issues that need to be dealt with 
right now.  We have seen what is going on in HRDC, which is 
absolutely scandalous and is throughout many other departments. 
What does that have to do with this legislation?  It is very 
important.  It deals with the money of all taxpayers.  I have not 
seen one word of legislation to deal with the problem that arose 
last fall.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems in justice and in immigration.  We saw the 
problem with migrants.  We are hurting genuine immigrants who are 
applying to come here through proper channels and refugees who 
have a legitimate claim to come to here like people from Kosovo, 
East Timor and such places who are absolutely blocked.  Have we 
seen any legislation to deal with those problems?  We are on the 
eve of another season of migrants coming in and there is not one 
word in legislation.  The Minister of Justice tabled Bill C-23 
when there are many other pressing issues for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have backlogs in the courts.  Things could be done to speed 
up the process and ensure that people are getting justice.  We 
could ensure that victims are getting due process in relation to 
criminal charges and that they are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the area of sexual predators abusing young children. 
Once they are released into society it is paramount that we make 
sure that our children are safe.  Have we seen legislation 
brought forward?  I think there has been a little in that area, 
but have we seen it passed?  No.  So much could have been done, 
but government for whatever reason has introduced a bill that was 
not done very well at all.  That is why I will vote against it. 
We have missed an opportunity.  The bill will be open to 
challenges because it was not done well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other solutions could have been put forward, but the government 
has missed an opportunity to define marriage although it was 
directed to do so by the Parliament of Canada.  I appreciate that 
it was an opposition supply day motion but it was passed by 
parliament.  Does it take parliament seriously or not?  Or, is it 
just shuffled under the rug?  That is why I have to question its 
sincerity about the bill and its underlying motive.  Why did it 
do that?  Why would we trust anything it wants us to do? 
Government members stand and say it is about equality, but many 
other relationships are not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is the record of the government.  I would be the 
first to stand and vote in favour of a bill that gives benefits 
to all Canadians without discrimination.  There are other 
relationships that may not be conjugal, that may not involve sex. 
Why should they not be entitled to the same benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member talked about RRSP contributions and about what happens 
if one dies.  I know two friends who are not in a sexual 
relationship.  Should they not be able to have these same 
benefits?  Of course they should.  Why should they not?  I 
personally know people who have been in relationships for 20 or 
30 years where there is absolutely no conjugal or sexual 
relationship but they are very much dependent on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of another example of a priest in Chilliwack who resides 
with another person.  They share a car. They are very dependent 
on each other and have been for years and years, but they are not 
in any conjugal relationship.  They would not qualify under the 
bill.  That is discriminating against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the government has missed a real opportunity to 
define marriage as instructed by parliament.  It has failed in 
that regard.  That is where I have to question what are its real 
motives. I believe in equality for all Canadians.  I would be the 
first to stand here and say it.  Again I commend the member for 
Edmonton Southwest for putting forward a positive solution which 
government ignored.  That solution would have been far better 
than Bill C-23.  I will have to vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 6.15 p.m.,

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to 
have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ELECTIONS CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
October 25 I was on my feet in this place to question the 
government House leader on the joint UN and Elections Canada vote 
that was to be held in schools across Canada.  The initiative 
which was held on November 19 required all school age students to 
select a right as defined in the UN Convention on the Rights of 
the Child which they felt was most important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the government House leader and eventually to 
the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada was why, given the 
controversial nature of the UN convention, were Canadians being 
kept in the dark with respect to this undertaking?  More 
important, why were school administrators, trustees, teachers and 
parents being kept in the dark? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a subsequent letter to the editor which I forwarded to my 
riding media, I explained that the rights as listed on the 
proposed in school ballot were taken directly from the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is important to mention 
that this convention was passed in 1989 by cabinet only.  Indeed 
the document that has inspired this exercise in democracy, as Mr. 
Kingsley called it, has never been subjected to the scrutiny of 
the Canadian adult democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of the convention have long claimed that the wording 
of the document is anti-family.  I have also come to believe that 
this is one of the reasons the Canadian parliament has yet to 
debate the matter and why the United States has failed to ratify 
the convention to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue I want to be perfectly clear that I am neither 
supporting nor condemning the convention.  However, I have very 
grave concerns with some of the potential problems that have been 
brought forward by the many people who have signed petitions 
opposing this document.  I understand that over 13,000 Canadians 
have signed petitions since 1997 opposing this convention. I also 
feel that given the fact that the said petitioners claim that the 
convention has implications with respect to family life and 
parental rights and responsibilities, parliamentarians should 
have the opportunity to debate the issue more fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every day we pass laws and regulations that are 
supposed to improve the quality of life for all Canadians.  In 
fact earlier this evening we gave Bill C-23 its second reading. 
It is no secret that this bill which amends over 60 pieces of 
legislation to extend spousal benefits to same sex couples is 
highly controversial.  It is also no secret that I am not 
supportive of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that I am not 
supporting this legislation due to the fact that it recognizes 
financial dependency only in cases where there is conjugality. 
Yes, as silly as it seems, apparently Mr. Trudeau was wrong and 
the state does indeed belong in the bedrooms of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Madam Speaker, I represent one of the best ridings 
in all of Canada.  Moreover, Huron—Bruce is primarily rural in 
nature.  This fact often creates a situation where extended 
families are financially required to band together so as to 
maintain functionality.  I can name numerous dependency 
relationships such as those involving two siblings or even a 
child and an elderly parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask why are these relationships less deserving of 
benefits or less financially or emotionally dependent on one 
another than a same sex couple, those who are engaged in 
relationships based upon conjugality?  The short answer is that 
they are not less deserving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the Supreme Court of Canada has determined in 
accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that 
society cannot discriminate. 
With this in mind, I would respectfully suggest that if we fail 
to recognize all dependency relationships, we are simply 
exchanging one form of discrimination for another.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I do not want to be seen as someone who is simply 
opposing this legislation because it would extend benefits to 
same sex couples.  While it is true that I am a staunch supporter 
of traditional family values and its systems, I am also not a 
person who is prepared to promote hate or prejudice.  I am 
promoting an inclusionist policy.  Let us heed Mr. Trudeau's 
famous words and draw the shades if we are going—

member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the issue 
raised by the member for Huron—Bruce in his original question 
raised in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member had asked why Elections Canada was involved in 
hosting a vote in schools across the country.  I believe he was 
referring to what was known as the national election for the 
rights of youth.  Elections Canada and UNICEF Canada had invited 
all students under the age of 18 to select which one of the 
several rights enumerated in the UN Convention on the Rights of 
the Child they felt was most important.  These rights include the 
right to an education; the right to food and shelter; the right 
to a safe environment and a healthy life; and the right to be 
treated without discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Elections Act gives the chief electoral officer a 
mandate to implement public education and information programs to 
make the electoral process better known to the public. Over the 
years Elections Canada has undertaken numerous initiatives, many 
of them involving youth, on the importance of voting and other 
means of participating in our democratic system.  Examples are 
the Forum for Young Canadians, CRB Foundation, regional heritage 
fairs and Salon Pepsi Jeunesse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In carrying out such initiatives with Canada's youth, Elections 
Canada is not indifferent to the fact that the 18 to 24 year old 
age group registers the lowest rate of participation in the 
electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada has also developed educational programs to 
assist schools in explaining how the Canadian electoral system 
works.  Participation of schools in these educational programs, 
such as the national election for the rights of youth, is always 
on a voluntary basis.  The decision to undertake—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to rise tonight 
and put forward some views and ideas regarding the farm aid 
package announced last year by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex and the southwestern 
Ontario region producing a large percentage of agri-food 
products, the success of agriculture is of prime importance.  If 
we lose our farm families and our means of production, we lose 
our sovereignty as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having met with the federations of agriculture in my riding, the 
pork producers, dairy, corn, soybean, wheat and vegetable growers 
to name just a few, all have offered ideas on possible 
improvements to AIDA within the whole array of federal-provincial 
safety nets and national agricultural policies.  All of the 
producer groups in my riding believe that changes could be made 
to improve safety nets and help producers of all agricultural 
commodities in times of financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested by the Middlesex county pork producers for 
one that for NISA, the matchable deposit percentage of eligible 
net sales should be raised from 3% to 6%, allowing producers to 
build a cushion to fall back on when eligible net sales drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, they feel that producer accounts should be allowed 
to go into a negative balance when eligible net sales drop below 
75% of the previous three year average, to a maximum of 10% of 
the previous three year average of eligible net sales in any 
given year, with a total allowable negative balance of 25% in all 
years combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To offset prolonged financial problems, combined with the 
deposit caps now in place, the NISA program would help producers 
most in need of financial assistance, namely young producers just 
getting started in farming and producers of commodities prone to 
cyclical price swings beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corn producers have constructive suggestions too.  The market 
revenue program now extended for two more years needs to be 
confirmed for a longer period.  They are calling for 90% coverage 
and elimination of premium deductions in market revenue.  This 
would recognize the continuous pressure put on cash crop

definitely has some kinks in it and collectively we must make it 
work to establish a more effective farm aid approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the suggestions of producer groups, such as those in my 
riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, with the provinces and the 
federal officials, and through the national safety net advisory 
committee of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, I am 
hopeful that new proposals will be assessed on their own merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must stand for our farmers.  We must support our farmers and 
rural Canada, the backbone of our economy.  I look forward to 
working with the minister and local producers in my riding to 
develop better methods to deliver assistance more quickly and 
efficiently to the farmers most in need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the changes 
which the government has introduced to the AIDA program will 
benefit many producers across the country.  We will now be 
covering negative margins.  Negative margins occur when a farm 
has a particularly bad year and the operation has insufficient 
revenues to cover variable costs like fuel, machinery repair and 
chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will also help farmers get through these tough times is 
that they now have the option to make a choice in 1999 of a 
reference period on which the payment calculation for AIDA is 
based.  They will be able to choose either the previous three 
years or three of the previous five years where high and low 
income years are not counted.  This is called the Olympic 
average.  This will be a real help to farmers as they will not 
need to count a low income year that they may have had due to 
flooding, drought or some other occurrence beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in response to industry requests, on January 13 the 
Government of Canada made a new commitment of up to $1 billion 
for the next two years to design a new disaster program to assist 
those producers most in need and to help them get through the 
tough times the hon. member referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to improve AIDA in response to input 
from farmers and members of parliament, such as the hon. member 
for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
