</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9.  On the Order:  Government Orders 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>October 2, 1997—the Minister of Transport—Second reading and 
reference to the Standing Committee on Transport of Bill C-9, an 
act for making the system of Canadian ports competitive, 
efficient and commercially oriented, providing for the 
establishing of port authorities and the divesting of certain 
harbours and ports, for the commercialization of the St. Lawrence 
seaway and ferry services and other matters related to maritime 
trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and amending 
and repealing other acts as a consequence. 
</UL>
<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-9, an act for making the system of Canadian ports 
competitive, efficient and commercially oriented, providing for 
the establishing of port authorities and the divesting of certain 
harbours and ports, for the commercialization of the St. Lawrence 
seaway and ferry services and other matters related to maritime 
trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and amending 
and repealing other acts as a consequence, be referred forthwith 
to the Standing Committee on Transport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to have the 
opportunity to speak to hon. members about the bill before the 
House, the Canada marine act.  One of the government's central 
goals is to strengthen Canada's economy and create a climate that 
supports job creation and investment. Only with a solid economic 
foundation can we retain the standard of living and social 
benefits that we have come to expect as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fast, reliable, low cost transportation is critical to Canada's 
economy.  We must have a transportation system that is safe, 
efficient, competitively priced and operated according to sound 
business practices. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working since 1993 to modernize Canada's 
transportation network, by commercializing operations, reducing 
subsidies and modernizing the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all modes, air, surface and maritime, we are working toward 
greater efficiency by increasing user input and improving community 
and regional economies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is a national integrated transportation system for the 
new millennium, one that will help Canada meet the challenges of 
competing in a global marketplace.  A modernized multimodal 
transportation network will help to create jobs and growth by 
supporting domestic and international trade and by promoting 
tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine transportation is of vital importance to Canada's 
economic health and makes an enormous contribution to our 
international trade, tourism and jobs.  The sector handles 40% of 
the freight we ship each year.  That accounts for 200 million 
tonnes of our trade with other countries, which translates into 
more than $2.5 billion a year in revenue and more than 45,000 
Canadian jobs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's marine sector has to adapt to the challenges of the 
next millennium.  It must keep up with changing markets, 
competition and a changing commodity mix.  Modernizing the marine 
sector will have a direct impact on jobs and growth.  A stronger 
and more efficient marine transportation system will improve our 
international trade performance and that means more jobs for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was to accomplish this goal that the Department of Transport 
began a review of Canada's marine management and regulatory 
regime in 1994.  The next year the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Transport undertook a study of the marine sector. 
The leadership of my now parliamentary secretary, the hon. member 
for Hamilton West, was evident throughout the process. 
The report on the marine sector became known as the Keyes report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many recommendations which flowed from this report to 
improve the marine system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the report the department held regional meetings with 
shippers and industry to discuss the recommendations and then 
began a series of consultations with key players in the maritime 
sector.  Together these activities helped to shape the 
government's national marine policy which was announced in 
December 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy is designed to increase efficiency in the maritime 
sector, reduce costs and give communities more control over their 
ports.  It will help to ensure that Canada's marine sector 
continues to support international trade.  It will also help us 
to continue to meet our top priorities, safety, security and 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy calls for the government to continue, as regulators, 
our commitment to safe marine transportation and a clean 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centrepiece of all this is the bill before us, which the 
government has reintroduced as Bill C-9.  It was originally 
tabled in the House in June 1996 but did not complete the 
parliamentary process when the House adjourned in April 1997, 
prior to third reading in the Senate, as the election intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reintroduced the legislation as it was passed in this 
House last spring.  Not a dot, a comma or a change has been made. 
If changes are to be made the committee will deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider this an important bill.  That is why we have 
introduced it as is.  It is important to the competitiveness of 
our marine sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcomed the co-operation I received from the other parties 
who have agreed with my judgment that this bill should be 
referred to committee as soon as possible so that detailed study 
can begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that industry supports this bill and wants to see the 
marine system improved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised act will consolidate and simplify maritime 
regulations, reduce red tape, and speed up commercial decision-making. 
It will enable the ports to meet client needs more 
efficiently and to reduce the bureaucracy.  Overall, it will make 
our maritime sector competitive. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will meet seven broad objectives.  First, it will 
promote and safeguard Canada's competitiveness and trade 
objectives.  Second, it will base marine infrastructure and 
services on international practices and approaches consistent 
with those of our trading partners.  Third, it will ensure that 
marine transportation services are organized to satisfy the needs 
of users and are available at a reasonable cost.  Fourth, it will 
provide a high level of safety and environmental protection. 
Fifth, it will provide a higher degree of autonomy for the 
management of the marine transportation system.  Sixth, it will 
manage the marine infrastructure according to good business 
practices. Seventh, it will provide for the transfer of certain 
ports and facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four main components to this bill.  I do not think 
time will permit me to get into detail on all of them. However, I 
would like to say a few words about one in particular which is of 
great interest to members of the House, the port system.  The 
bill will deal with pilotage, on which I believe consensus was 
reached in the last Parliament.  It will deal with the seaway and 
it will deal with the ports themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port system has to be modernized.  There is no question 
about that.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go into the new millennium with a structure for our 
ports which is comprehensive and adaptable to all the needs that 
will be thrust on them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to step up the commercial discipline of the port 
system and to simplify the decision-making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will help us to make public ports into commercial 
ventures, and to gradually phase out the Canadian Ports 
Corporation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ports deemed essential to domestic and international trade will 
form a national port system and will be managed by Canada port 
authorities made up of representatives of user groups and 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any port can apply to become a port authority, CPA as we 
affectionately call it.  To be accepted it has to meet four 
criteria.  It has to be financially self-sufficient, it must have 
diversified traffic, it must have strategic significance to trade 
and a link to a major highway or railway line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPAs will be set up as non-share capital corporations with 
board of directors made up of federal, provincial and municipal 
appointments and user representatives.  CPAs will recover their 
costs from fees charged to customers and must comply with the 
relevant provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act. They 
will not receive federal funding.  The era of federal subsidies 
is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPAs will be agents of the crown.  Agent status will allow ports 
to pay for grants in lieu of taxes and will reinforce the ports' 
immunity from provincial taxation and regulation.  Agent status 
will be limited to core port activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The directors of the CPAs will have to conform to codes of 
conduct and the government will set up a public accountability 
regime with new disclosure requirements.  In addition, there will 
be annual financial audits and special examinations of the 
management operations and financial performance of CPAs every 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port authorities will be accountable to their customers, local 
communities, the financial community and to the three levels of 
government, federal, provincial and municipal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPAs will have to seek financing from the private sector.  The 
federal government will no longer be around to be responsible for 
their debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second category of ports, regional and local ports, will be 
transferred to provincial and municipal governments, community 
organizations, private interests and in some cases other federal 
departments over the next six years.  The process of divesting 
these ports is already well under way.  To assist this the 
government has established a $125 million six year port divestiture 
fund to ease the transition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will continue to ensure operation of 
remote ports.  Remote ports have been identified using criteria 
which reflect the communities degree of isolation.  Reliance of 
marine and transportation is essential to their survival and we 
shall continue to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy will be applied equitably and consistently across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay particular attention to the sensitivities which 
some members have expressed to me in Atlantic Canada about the 
future of ports in that region.  This is Canada's original 
maritime area.  The sea, the ports and sea traffic are so vital 
to all those communities.  In particular there appears to be a 
challenge in Prince Edward Island.  This is a challenge I would 
hope the committee could examine in great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these concerns were expressed in the other place when 
Bill C-44 was before committee.  In addition, many of my 
colleagues have approached me in the last few weeks with 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues in cabinet will be sensitive to those 
concerns.  We shall try to address all legitimate problems in a 
fair and equitable way to ensure this bill does truly reflect the 
national consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not permit me to talk about the other elements but 
other speakers on our side will talk about the rest of the bill 
and how important it is for quick passage by the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the general thrust of Bill C-9 is compatible with Reform 
Party policy. Several of us voted in favour of its previous 
incarnation as Bill C-44.  However that is not to say there is no 
room for improvement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had been looking forward to working with the minister and his 
department to address some of the concerns that have been 
expressed with respect to this legislation.  I found them to be 
very forthcoming and helpful.  It is regrettable that the 
co-operative atmosphere here has been so poisoned by the 
contemptuous, I might even say contemptible actions of his 
ministerial colleagues in the House a couple of days ago that it 
is going to be difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer I had the opportunity to discuss the 
legislation with many interested parties.  Others have come to 
the Hill to express their views since Parliament reopened. During 
the Thanksgiving break I plan to go to Vancouver to consult with 
stakeholders there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to now I have found remarkable consensus among shipping 
companies, stevedoring firms, unions, even shippers, both in 
general support for the legislation and in the identification of 
shortcomings.  In the limited time available for me today I can 
only touch briefly on a few areas where we would like to see 
further work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clauses of the bill which define the capacity and power of 
port authorities are inconsistent with the stated objective of 
allowing them to operate according to business principles. They 
are neither fish nor fowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port authorities will have the responsibility to operate 
with commercial discipline but they will be denied the tools to 
do so.  They may not, for example, diversify by establishing new 
subsidiaries on port property.  Their borrowing and investment 
powers will be rigorously constrained and they will be subject to 
the vagaries of ministerial discretion in the setting of the 
annual fee that they must pay to the federal government out of 
gross, not net, revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port authorities will have to be self-sufficient but the 
minister will be empowered to continue federal contributions to 
the seaway for capital works.  This constitutes unfair 
competition for railways and deep water ports, courtesy of the 
Canadian taxpayer. Again, the legislation is inconsistent with 
the expressed objective of commercialization. It is the partial 
pregnancy syndrome that afflicts the government in so many of its 
endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address the problem of excessive costs and 
featherbedding arising from pilotage monopolies.  There is no 
incentive to cut pilotage costs by certifying the masters of 
Canadian vessels that ply the same inland waters back and forth 
on a routine basis or by the employment of available new 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed boards of directors for port authorities are 
potential patronage havens as well as being a mechanism for 
continued political control.  Government participation in 
entities which will be managing crown assets is normal and 
acceptable but if the government is serious about 
commercialization, indirect government control is not.  Again, we 
are looking at partial pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The size of the proposed boards, seven to eleven members, is far 
too large for most ports and the majority will be appointed by 
the minister, ostensibly in consultation with port users. Ah, 
patronage joy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should remember that governments come and 
governments go.  They will not be forever in power.  Do they 
really want to set up such a juicy system, not just for 
themselves now but for whomever comes behind them?  Their 
mandatory provision for individual directors to be appointed by 
host municipalities and provinces is defensible and sensible. 
Each jurisdiction gets one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that there is no provision for labour 
representation on each board.  This could readily be done by 
specifying that there be one on each board.  It could be done 
without increasing the size of the board simply by reducing the 
number of ministerial appointments from these famous lists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The elimination of ports police is problematical.  I do not 
believe that was well thought out and it should be 
reconsidered.  There is a lot more to port policing than guarding 
the security of cargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sea ports, especially the larger ones like Vancouver, are 
wonderful funnels for contraband, for illegal entrance and they 
are targets for organized crime.  When mobsters get the upper 
hand in a port they are extremely hard to dislodge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few municipalities have the resources to properly police a port. 
If the government is determined to do away with ports police it 
should seriously consider establishing a specialized branch 
within the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is no mechanism for the resolution of disputes 
with shippers.  If the Canada Transportation Act can contain 
provisions with respect to railways, why can we not have 
something equivalent in Bill C-9 with respect to ports?  Why should 
they be treated differently? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot read the minister's mind.  I do not know the intent of 
fast tracking this bill to committee.  In theory, getting into 
committee early seems like a great idea, a chance for MPs to sit 
down and reason together away from the hurly-burly of the House 
and work together for the common good.  It is a great theory but 
in practice in the last Parliament we Reformers learned the hard 
way that this is generally a policy for stifling any meaningful 
debate and ramming a bill through to the report stage according 
to ministerial specifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we do not support the procedure.  We will vote against 
it.  If subsequent events prove that our suspicions were 
unjustified I will personally apologize to the minister and 
nobody will be happier than I.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as this is the first time I have spoken in the debate on 
the bill, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the voters 
of Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans for placing their trust in me 
once again in the June 2 election.  They may rest assured that I 
will do my best to meet their expectations from me as their member 
of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off, I would like to say that the Minister of Transport 
earlier presented a true picture of the procedures that led to this 
bill's return to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He probably forget, however, as memory is fallible, or perhaps 
he omitted—a little more serious in this instance—to mention 
that the bill is back before the House because the members of the 
other House, the senators, blocked the bill before Parliament 
adjourned prior to the elections.  This is more serious in a 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of input on the previous bill, Bill C-44.  The 
former Minister of Transport, the member for Victoria, confirmed he 
had consulted Canadians across the country.  The consultations took 
place in capitals, communities and among the people.  We in the 
Bloc proposed a number of amendments to the bill. 
The initial consultation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, if 
not millions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where does that leave us today? Unfortunately, because of 
unelected people appointed either by the ruling party or by the 
Conservative party, we must let unelected people interfere with 
democracy and completely set aside a piece of legislation that was the 
subject of extensive consultations. This is cause for concern. It has to 
be denounced because the members of this House have been democratically 
elected, they have been sent here by the people of their ridings. Is it 
normal and acceptable in this day and age to have unelected senators 
come and tell elected members what to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the substance of the bill in a moment. While all this 
is going on, the entire maritime industry in Canada and Quebec is 
suffering, and that is cause for concern. This puts an end to what I 
might call my preliminary remarks. I now come to the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to reiterate the Bloc's position on this bill, 
for the benefit of the current transport minister. As for the principle 
of the bill, we in the Bloc Quebecois agree with it because, except for 
the dates, the vast majority of the provisions contained in the bill are 
identical to those in former Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, to avoid making the system even more cumbersome, 
it might have been possible, perhaps even advisable, to pass the bill 
quickly. 
At any rate, the minister can rest assured that, if the transport 
committee approves the few changes we are seeking, it will be possible 
to proceed quickly with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that the government had given Bill C-44, now Bill 
C-9 before us, the bombastic name of Canada Marine Act, which was 
undeserved, as we in the Bloc Quebecois pointed out, denouncing the fact 
that it did not contain—and still does not contain—anything about 
shipbuilding, shipyards and the merchant navy. That is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, when I was the transportation critic of the official 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, I suggested in committee a tax policy 
designed to promote shipbuilding in Canada and in Quebec, as is done in 
several other countries. Unfortunately, the legislation is silent as 
regards that proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us essentially shows how miserably the federal 
maritime policy has failed in the past 20 years. The federal government 
just realized that its involvement over the years has resulted in costly 
and cumbersome bureaucratization as well as ineffective management. In 
this regard, I want to congratulate the government, and the current 
Minister of Transport and his predecessor, for accepting a proposal 
which the Bloc Quebecois had been pushing since 1994, namely to abolish 
Ports Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ports Canada was a fantastic tool for pork barrelling and 
patronage. 
I remember condemning that situation and putting questions to the former 
president of that body, who had engaged in lavish spending. He behaved 
as people did when money was not a problem in Canada. He spent tons of 
money for suites at the hotel located in the West Edmonton Mall. People 
slept in the so-called Truck Room. They slept in pick-up truck boxes 
equipped with jacuzzi baths for six to eight people, at a cost of $280 
to $300 a night. Ports Canada people slept there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, who represents the riding of Hamilton 
West, is doing the right thing by supporting my comments. I am the one 
who told the House about these things, and I am pleased that the 
government has accepted the Bloc Quebecois' request to abolish Ports 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we are happy to see that the government has also 
accepted the Bloc Quebecois' recommendation that compulsory pilotage be 
maintained in Canada.  Once again, with all the modesty I can muster, 
the Bloc Quebecois was the only party to defend pilotage on a Canada 
wide scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary and member for Hamilton West will 
recall a report on the future of the St. Lawrence Seaway in which the 
Liberal majority even recommended allowing foreign captains to navigate 
in Canadian waters, which are dangerous waters—look at the St. Lawrence 
River—without a pilot on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was crazy.  I told the parliamentary secretary, “You are giving 
me arguments to use against you.  You are giving me ammunition.  Do not 
do it, it makes no sense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this was the recommendation the government made in 
its majority report.  Fortunately, today's bill includes pilotage and we 
in the Bloc Quebecois are happy to have, once again, the assurance that 
the environment will be protected by qualified maritime pilots such as 
those we have on the St. Lawrence, especially those on the Lower 
St. Lawrence, in Central Quebec and in the port of Montreal, as far as 
Quebec is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have only one minute left and since, in any event, there 
will be another opportunity to speak of it, 
I now come to certain points with which we have problems, such as the 
divesting of ports with an envelope to undertake unproductive 
improvements.  The former bill mentioned $125 million.  We are still 
waiting to hear the amount. If the federal government stops running 
ports, it should hand over tools so that they can be improved and 
modernized, as it did with airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last point that we disagree with completely.  Since 
the government is no longer running ports, it should also give up its 
power to appoint the majority of representatives in local port 
authorities. On the one hand, the government is saying that it is 
leaving, but on the other it wants to hold onto control of port 
authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are looking forward to some good work in the 
transport committee with respect to this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
party opposes this bill as is for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 will create a patchwork of privately run ports with new 
mandates supposedly oriented to financial self-sufficiency.  It 
seems less likely that these ports will form an integral part of 
a coherent national strategy for meeting our transportation and 
regional development needs.  Instead we will have a set of local 
activities which are not linked to a national vision or plan. The 
danger arising from the withdrawal of a federal presence in the 
port system is that we will be handicapped in relation to our 
principal competitor the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. government has a transportation policy based on the 
national interest.  It has developed mechanisms to support and 
fund national transportation infrastructure.  The trust fund 
mechanism is used to fund airports, highways, inland waterways 
and harbour maintenance.  For example in the U.S., dredging of 
harbours is done by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is 
financed by the harbour maintenance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation we are considering today, 
Canadian ports that need dredging will have to pay for it 
themselves. This is estimated to cost a port like Saint John 
between $1 million to $1.5 million a year.  This imbalance in 
funding and resources in the absence of a commitment from the 
national government will undoubtedly hurt Canada's position in 
competing for the lucrative business of international container 
cargo and freight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed privatization will ultimately have negative 
implications for many of the people presently working in the port 
system and the maritime industry generally.  Despite assurances 
from the government about job security, it seems likely that as a 
new profit driven management approach is broadened jobs will be 
lost among the longshoreman and administrative workers who 
presently work within the Canada Ports Corporation.  There is 
evidence from numerous other sectors that short term financial 
considerations will inevitably prevail over the preservation of 
jobs and the maintenance of fair working conditions.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As productivity and throughput considerations become more 
dominant, who will look out for the welfare of the staff who 
remain in the service of the ports organization?  Cuts to 
workforce inevitably put additional pressures on the remaining 
staff.  The added stress this creates is often reflected in 
increasing numbers of industrial accidents. These sorts of 
conditions are rarely reflected in this sort of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the government assure us that there will be a fair and 
representative cross-section of the different interests who have 
a stake in the Canadian port system?  Will the federal government 
be able to protect the national interest in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the most important users of the port facilities, 
those with a real stake in its performance and fees are the 
farmers from the prairie provinces.  Under the new arrangements 
they will also be granted only one voice on the board.  We 
believe that the board must be more than just an expression of 
the interests of the local business community. There is no 
guarantee under the proposed legislation that this will be the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore will there be a representative of labour on the new 
board of directors? As a vital player in the activity of ports, 
surely there is a case for union representation on the decision 
making structure that will oversee the agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more appalling to this scenario especially in light of the 
statement by the Minister of Industry that if you did not vote 
Liberal do not expect to be treated fairly, and the Prime 
Minister's obvious approval of this prostituting of their favours 
for votes, two or maybe three members of the board will be 
appointed, not elected, and the remaining four to eight members 
will be appointed directly or indirectly by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former transport minister made the rather arrogant statement 
that you do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to check surveillance 
monitors and ensure doors are locked in reference to work done by 
port police. Although that may be one aspect of the work done, it 
is still done in a dangerous environment where without question 
criminal activity, drug, people and weapons smuggling is a major 
factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is irresponsible to suggest that lower cost security 
guards should have their lives devalued and put at risk. The 
proposal to remove the Canada ports police from the newly created 
entity seems an unwise step.  Private security firms are not 
peace officers and do not have the same range of powers enjoyed 
by the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is likely that drug smuggling, already a significant problem, 
will increase as a result of this legislation.  Neal Jessop, 
president of the Canadian Police Association in March 1997 was 
quoted as saying that abolishing Canada's ports police will open 
the floodgates to the smuggling of drugs, guns and other 
contraband by organized crime.  What passes through the ports 
will end up on the streets of our towns and cities from coast to 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the case of Vancouver, for example.  The Minister 
of Transport at the time said that Canada Ports Corporation will 
provide $1 million to B.C. to cover the cost of one year of a 
10-person Vancouver city police unit to patrol the port 24 hours 
a day.  When the $1 million for Vancouver policing runs out it 
will be up to the city and the port to determine who should pay 
for more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ian Whittington a port police officer and president of the Port 
Police Association for the Pacific region stated that the level 
of policing within Canada's largest and most major port will 
digress drastically.  Of course Vancouver will not be the only 
port affected.  St. John's, Newfoundland and Saint John, New 
Brunswick, Halifax, Quebec City and Montreal, every part of the 
country is going to be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have commitments that will ensure that all Canadians 
are safe.  The privatization of the ports fits into a pattern of 
the gradual withdrawal of the federal government from a host of 
activities and functions vital to the well-being of coastal 
communities. Cutbacks to the coast guard search and rescue 
capacity and the demanning and automation of lighthouses form the 
backdrop to the privatization of the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are estimated to be approximately 500 public ports and 
harbours in Canada.  It seems safe to assume that communities 
with ports smaller than those of Vancouver, Halifax and Montreal 
are likely to feel the brunt of this legislation. Why is the 
Liberal government turning its back on the legitimate needs of 
the smaller coastal communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the existing employees of the ports and the St. Lawrence 
seaway are transferred to the new authorities, there is no 
provision in the act for the continuation of superannuation 
benefits for existing employees within the new regimes, as was 
the case with the air traffic controllers when they were 
transferred to the not for profit corporation Nav Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might seem somewhat paranoid to suggest that these types of 
things are going to happen.  However, I happened to be in 
Churchill, Manitoba the day after the signing for the turnover of 
the port to the new owner.  The prime example of the pilotage 
situation came into question as a contract had not been signed 
with the pilot who was then going to be working and bringing in 
the tugs.  Because the contract was not signed and the pilot was 
thinking about not taking in the tugs, it was suggested that an 
American pilot might be able to bring the tug in instead.  Thank 
heavens for wiser heads prevailing and immigration seeing fit to 
make sure that would not happen.  It certainly leads us to agree 
with the Bloc member that piloting was a major question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill fails to provide for the capital financing that would 
be required to construct new port facilities at some future date. 
The submission of the Halifax Port Development Commission is 
highly instructive on this point and worth quoting at length: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding needed for construction of major port facilities can 
only be arranged in part, if at all, in the private sector. No 
private sector lender or investor can advance the bulk of such 
funding against user commitments which may or may not materialize 
when the facilities are completed, and if they do then 
materialize, may or may not continue until the funding has been 
repaid.  Under such a scenario, funding can only come from 
governments which have the necessary financial resources and can 
justify, in the interests of promoting the economy of their 
constituents, the assumption of the attendant commercial risk. 
Had Bill C-9 been in effect in the late 1960s, Halifax would 
never have been able to build and equip even one container berth, 
and the harbour would long ago have fallen into disuse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should these ports be privatized?  Will they be required to 
disclose their capital expenditure plans for local community 
input and review?  The kind of secrecy that normally shrouds the 
investment activities of private companies must not be allowed to 
prevail within the ports where a range of public groups have a 
vital stake in the financial posture of their ports. Why has the 
government not chosen to make mandated public disclosure of all 
financial plans a precondition for the transfer of the ports to 
the private sector? 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on Bill C-9.  I have a great deal of respect for the hon. 
member in the Liberal Party who chaired the committee and brought 
the committee meeting to Saint John, New Brunswick.  I really 
appreciated that our people had the opportunity to have their 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was debated as Bill C-44 in the House during the 35th 
Parliament.  It later died in the Senate. When this bill was 
debated earlier in the House I had a specific concern with 
respect to the section that deals with the policing of our ports. 
Nothing has changed with the reintroduction of this bill.  The 
section is still there.  But there is a question that I have for 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's intention contained in clause 108 of Bill C-9 
is to disband the Ports Canada Police across Canada.  It will 
have a major negative impact on all Canadian citizens and port 
users.  With the elimination of the Canada Ports Corporation the 
requirement for local port authorities to maintain and pay for 
the detachment of Ports Canada Police will disappear. How could 
this government allow the Vancouver port police to be disbanded 
when we are still debating the bill that allows for that 
disbandment?  I cannot imagine this has taken place.  What 
happened to democracy?  Where did it go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of a letter that was sent on October 2 to all port 
police in Halifax port.  The letter said in effect “Here is your 
pink slip, this is it, by the end of the year you are gone”. 
Those men, like the men in Saint John, have worked for 24 years. 
And those who have become superintendents in just the last few 
years are getting a larger severance package than the men who 
have been there for 24 years.  The minister has to step in and 
take a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saint John Ports Canada Police service will be disbanded as 
will be the case for all other port detachments if this bill 
passes.  Not only will well qualified and experienced port police 
officers lose their jobs, but port and community protection will 
be lost as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policing of Canada's major commercial ports started in the 
early 1800s at the port of Quebec with the operation of private 
police forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late 1960s most major ports had a security force, but the 
security force was unable to cope with the policing requirements 
of the national ports.  Smuggling, theft, drug offences, assault 
and traffic violations were the order of the day.  The serious 
escalation of crime in the major commercial ports was very 
detrimental to Canada's international trade reputation and raised 
public concerns for the safety and security of the ports and of 
the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 the Cassidy report traced the problem of our ports to 
the neglect of port policing by port management.  That report 
revealed the deplorable criminal conditions which existed in the 
national port systems across Canada.  This of course included my 
own city, Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Harbours Board adopted the Cassidy report in 1968. 
It reorganized its locally managed and autonomous police and 
security forces into a national force.  Professional police 
officers were hired to command the force at the head office in 
Ottawa and at the port police detachments.  The National Harbours 
Board brought the ports policing up to professional standards 
through recruitment, training and supervision.  They had to take 
and pass eight courses, and members became legally sworn police 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to reorganize the national police force in 1968 was 
taken only after study of all other viable options, which were an 
RCMP takeover, a provincial police takeover and a municipal 
police takeover.  Allowing a locally controlled security force 
was not even considered, but it is considered by this government 
today.  It is considered that the municipality's police force can 
take over, yet that report said it would not work.  It also said 
the RCMP could not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a national ports police force we were safe, but the 
citizens and port users witnessed a complete turnaround as the 
ports gradually gained a reputation of low cost and low loss with 
the change to a security system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Liberal government declared Canada's ports police 
redundant.  The minister announced that it would be disbanded, 
yet we are debating it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made this decision before Bill C-44 was passed. 
After it died on the order paper the Minister of Transport of the 
day still went ahead with the disbandment.  Here we are debating 
it today.  I have to ask how the government can eliminate the 
ports police before the bill becomes law.  I have never heard 
tell of that before.  I am sure that you, Mr. Speaker, have not 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is saying “I do not care about democracy.  I do 
not care about the parliamentary system.  I do not care about 
debate. I am going to disband it.  I am going to move”.  I find 
that incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  A lone voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I do not know whether I am a lone voice 
in the wilderness, but I know that I have every port policeman 
behind me all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-9 an attempt is being made to download port policing 
responsibilities on to the municipal taxpayer.  We saw what 
happened in Vancouver.  The municipal police force in Vancouver 
took it over.  It got a $1 million cheque from the government.  I 
do not know how that happened when it has not been agreed to. The 
local police in Vancouver took it over but found that there were 
so many problems it could not possibly do it without adding 10 
more local police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut transfer payments to the provinces and 
the local police departments have been cut.  In Saint John 30 
police officers have been cut already.  There is no way they can 
afford to take on the ports without more officers and without 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a marine act and there should be a marine unit 
in all local police departments.  If the bill is passed the boys 
who are leaving the port police should be hired by local police 
departments.  We should also be making sure they are being funded 
to allow that to happen.

and a specialized marine unit.  This had to be created and had to 
be paid for by someone, but they did not have the dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the port of Boston, dedicated policing services were 
withdrawn in favour of relying on city resources.  Without a 
dedicated and fully empowered police agency to target violations 
of environmental laws, the pollution in the Boston harbour 
increased tenfold and within six months they had to put back the 
port police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened in the port of Miami.  This is happening 
everywhere.  They try it but it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ports Canada police currently appears to be our first line 
of defence and its demise would be rejoiced by those elements 
sitting out there with criminal control of port operations and 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very evident from the report that a dedicated port police 
function should remain.  I feel a sense of déjà vu today for we 
have been down this road before and the amendments to change the 
port policing aspect of the bill were defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House and indeed members of the 
committee on transport to listen to the witnesses that will come 
before them.  We must not allow Canada to become the country of 
choice by criminals.

Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a question of information, 
I suppose the clock will run out prior to the conclusion of my 
remarks.  I would like to continue and conclude after question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the one minute I was given on the first day of the 36th 
Parliament I called on the provincial government of Ontario to 
call an independent inquiry into the so-called Plastimet fire in 
the north end of my constituency.  It has still to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have a little more time so I will first take the 
opportunity to thank the constituents of my home town, Hamilton 
West, for their overwhelming support, re-electing me to a third 
consecutive mandate with 50% of the vote.  I promise to continue 
to be a strong voice for my home town and to remind myself it is 
a privilege to serve in the highest court in the land, the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On to the business of today, quite frankly I have lost count of 
the number of times I have had the privilege on many occasions 
both here in the House of Commons and across the country to speak 
to a bill that will prepare Canada's marine transportation system 
to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Formerly it was Bill C-44 and now it is Bill C-9, the Canada 
Marine Act.  Regrettably it was not approved prior to the 
dissolution of parliament last April.  The government has 
reintroduced the legislation in exactly the same form.  It is 
vitally important to Canada's transportation system.  We heard 
from industry that it wants to see the bill adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer months the minister and I met all key 
stakeholders, including shippers, ship owners, port managers and 
pilotage interests.  We have consistently heard the marine sector 
industry.  It wants to see the bill adopted immediately, as soon 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's overall goal is to strengthen Canada's economy 
and create a climate that supports job creation and investment. 
To support that goal the government took steps to modernize 
Canada's transportation system, commercializing transportation 
operations, cutting wasteful subsidies and overhauling 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all modes of transportation, air, surface and marine, we have 
made great progress in moving toward greater efficiency, greater 
say for those who use the system, and more local and regional 
autonomy.  Much has been accomplished at Transport Canada by the 
government and by three successive ministers of transport, but 
more remains to be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 will make it easier for ports to operate according to 
business principles and will ensure those most affected by port 
related decisions are involved in making them.  It will 
consolidate and streamline marine regulations, cut red tape, 
allow for faster business decisions and help our marine sector 
become more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the history.  For the benefit of those 
members who were not with us in the last parliament and to 
refresh the memories of those who were, I would like to take a 
few minutes in the short time I have left before question period 
to review the history of the bill and the development of the 
government marine policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport, 
called SCOT for short, undertook a study of the marine sector and 
made a number of recommendations to improve the marine system, 
many of which were later incorporated into Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the SCOT report, Transport Canada held regional 
meetings with shippers and industry to discuss the 
recommendations.  Based on the consultations the government 
adopted the national marine policy in December 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite how much work has gone into the bill 
in close to three years.  We had the SCOT report.  We did a study 
across the country.  We developed a marine policy.  We went 
across the country.  We developed the Canada Marine Act.  We went 
across the country.  We spent many months in committee with 
literally hundreds of witnesses and we developed a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was give and take across the land by ports, harbour 
commissions, pilotage authorities, ferry services, and a 
consensus was reached.  Because there was give and take, because 
there was an air of co-operation among all stakeholders, users 
and industry in the system, we were able to come up with the 
Canada Marine Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came to us as early as this summer and told us not to come 
back to their communities with more bright ideas about how to 
modernize the marine sector.  They have heard it all.  They want 
us to get on with the job.

National Menopause Awareness Month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Menopause is a major health concern of Canadian women.  By the 
year 2000 approximately four million women will be entering or 
will already have experienced menopause.  There is a need to 
build greater awareness through the dissemination of information 
on the effects of menopause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Menopause can act as a trigger to accelerate the risk of certain 
diseases such as osteoporosis, which affects one in four women 
because of estrogen depletion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has made a commitment to women's health 
through the establishment of five centres of excellence for 
women's health.  These centres are mandated to conduct research 
and provide information to the public on key health issues 
affecting women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the initiative of these centres and the work of other 
national organizations such as the Society of Obstetricians and 
Gynaecologists of Canada, greater awareness on menopause will 
make our health—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
summer of 1997 was very cruel on agriculture producers in Nova 
Scotia as dry weather conditions created the worst growing season 
in 100 years.  Crop shortages are creating fear and apprehension 
among farmers who dread the long winter ahead.  The situation for 
beef farmers is particular severe.  Feed shortages of 50% mean 
that by February they will run out of feed for their herds.  The 
prospect has many so concerned that they are putting their cattle 
on the market now and prices are depressed lower than 
those in the 1950s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dairy farmers have sought a price increase of 6 cents per litre 
to ensure they can buy feed for their cattle.  Potato yields are 
likely to be two-thirds or less of the normal yields,

Speaker, here are the disturbing facts surrounding the recent 
sentencing of three convicted rapists in Montreal.  Found guilty 
of gang raping and sodomizing a pregnant teenager, they were 
sentenced to two years less a day.  The court was told the men 
held a 17-year old girl captive for more than 12 hours, 
repeatedly assaulted her, and at one point dangled her over an 
apartment balcony to deter her from reporting the incident.  One 
of the rapists was the father of the victim's unborn child, a 
gruesome circumstance which apparently prompted her to have an 
abortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In announcing the sentence the judge said the crown attorney's 
recommendation for prison terms of 10 to 12 years was grossly 
exaggerated.  He also said that while the rapists' actions were 
deplorable, the victim had no signs of provable violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion there is no such thing as a non-violent rape. 
There is no such thing as torture without pain.  As

be judicious in her choice of words.  I do not want her to push 
me too far, because then she will lose a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me ask the minister 
this question. Could he tell the Canadian public what he knew 
about this investigation and the search warrant and why he knew 
it in the first place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am glad to have the occasion to put the facts straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first time I learned about a mandate that would possibly 
have been issued for a search warrant to search the regional 
offices of the ministers in Quebec was during the course of 
question period yesterday, in a question from the Conservative

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is pretty hard to even read from a prepared script. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP investigation into the illegal fundraising tactics 
first of all was delayed until after the election. Then when the 
police did get two search warrants, they only acted against the 
party bagman, not the Liberal minister to whom he answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the question one more time.  Who in the world is 
running this investigation, the RCMP or the Liberal minister of 
the treasury board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is very clear.  The investigation is being 
run by the RCMP at arm's length from the government and at arm's 
length from ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the hon. member, after her totally wrong 
assertions about grants in the Prime Minister's riding, not only 
should she apologize but she should not be taken seriously on 
anything she says in the House on any subject.

those came from and the House will hear more about them.

these companies to Liberal bagmen so they could shake some cash 
out of these people.  Somebody, somewhere on the inside was 
giving the minister confidential information about the RCMP 
investigation and secret, and I note, secret search warrants. The 
minister said yesterday “we were well organized.” That is the 
point. You betcha.

these are allegations that are totally without foundation.

immediately called Montreal, relayed the message to my 
legislative assistant who was here in the lobby and who sent me a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cut a cheque to Les Confections St. Elie 
for $62,108 two days after the minister for HRD called in the 
police.  Les Confections St. Elie then donated $1,500 to the 
Prime Minister's personal election war chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister send that big cheque through just two days

this Shawinigan shakedown can no longer be written off as an

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister admits that at least five companies were approached 
for campaign donations in return for government grants.  We have 
found four other examples of companies receiving money from this 
tainted fund after they made donations to the Prime Minister.  In 
fact, Les Confections St. Elie received a further grant of 
$220,000 after the Prime Minister was re-elected.

example of the Ryder Travel Group which has received a $600,000 
grant and has only contributed to the Conservative Party, not a 
cent to the Liberal Party.  It is based on merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I can give an example which pleased the official 
opposition.  The hon. member for St. Albert was very pleased to 
write to me on July 24 supporting the transitional jobs fund in 
the St. Albert constituency, with funds going to Alexander Wood

question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister finally admitted that a warrant had been 
issued to search his Montreal office, but he said it had not been 
executed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who informed the minister of the existence of a search warrant if 
it has yet to be executed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

I learned of the possible existence of a warrant when a Conservative

its number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, one my assistants checked with our Montreal office 
and was told that no search had been carried out. This is why I said 
that while a warrant may have been issued, it had not been executed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to information we checked with various sources this morning, 
search warrants issued in the course of criminal proceedings are only

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

the question. But it is a very good question, since I learned of the 
existence of a warrant when a Conservative member told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is: How did the Conservative member know that a

in the House?

for the President of the Treasury Board, because the more he tries to 
explain, the less clear it gets and the less we understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, when asked by journalists how he knew about the search 
warrant, his answer was, and I quote: “Because we are well organized. We 
checked and we were told it was not executed”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very clear. Was the minister suggesting he knew 
about the search ahead of time because he had access to privileged 
information? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already given 
a very clear answer to this question. One of my employees phoned the 
regional office in Montreal and was told that no search warrant had been 
executed. This information was then relayed to my legislative assistant, 
who mentioned to me that no search warrant had been executed. That is 
how it happened. It is quite simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is worth repeating that allegations were made by the 
opposition regarding one of my employees, and Radio-Canada had to 
retract yesterday. I think I should warn opposition members that the 
same could happen to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, they can stop 
the melodramatics. When the minister says that they are “well 
organized”, does this mean that a minister's office which is under 
investigation might be informed of a search ahead of time? That is the 
question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Liberal government call in the RCMP on this 
investigation?  Why did it not call in the Sûreté du Québec, the 
provincial police, which should be looking into this question? 
Is it because the government knew it would get better, more 
regular reports from the RCMP than it would from the sûreté?

this is an unwarranted slur on one of the finest police forces in

strange coming from the hon. member who comes from the province 
of Saskatchewan, the historic home of the RCMP.

been executed. Finally he said, and told us again today, that he 
learned about it from me.  This does not sound well organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the minister does not know or does not want 
us to know anything about this matter.  Can the minister at least 
clear up one thing for us today?  How can a field organizer know

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday I raised concern that the CRTC violated its own 
guidelines by awarding a wireless cable broadcasting licence to a 
telephone monopoly, Teleglobe's Look TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage not only avoided my question 
but displayed a profound lack of intellectual capacity by 
suggesting that I was somehow in contempt of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a sensible answer directly from the Minister of 
Industry.  Why does the Liberal government condone the CRTC 
violating its own guidelines?  Does the government want more 
power for monopolies or less choice for consumers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the hon. member has respect for process as do 
all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are processes involved in hearing applications for 
licensing where some of the allegations of the nature he has made 
are present.  They can be adjudicated by the courts where there 
are disagreements on policy or other grounds.  There is an appeal 
to the governor in council and I am sure he respects that 
process.

the 7% GST on reading materials to be unfair, unjust, wrong, 
stupid, dumb, and the list continues. Actually they do not use

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask the federal government to step in and 
establish a board to oversee the price of fuels, recognizing that

petitioners are concerned about the debt load faced by students. 
They point out that students graduating from university on 
average have a debt load of $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that so many young people have a difficult time 
finding employment, particularly employment at a decent salary, 
to enter their working life with this kind of debt load is wrong. 
They ask the government to give more consideration to changing 
the Canada student loan program and to coming up with a number of 
programs to support students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a personal comment, perhaps this is the time to consider 
doing away with tuition fees as many other countries have done in

their level of income.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, picking up where I left off, 
the centrepiece of the national marine policy of 1995 is the 
Canada marine act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was originally tabled in the House in June 1996.  There 
followed discussions with stakeholders and a review by the 
Standing Committee on Transport which held hearings across this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SCOT, as it is commonly referred to, proposed a number of 
amendments to the bill after hearing a wide range of comments 
from interested parties, and further amendments were made at 
report stage here in the House of Commons before the bill was 
sent on to the Senate.  Parliament was dissolved and we did not 
get to the completion of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss briefly how Bill C-9 will help modernize 
the three key components of Canada's marine transportation 
system, ports, the St. Lawrence seaway and marine pilotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the federal government will focus on those ports that are 
vital to domestic and international trade and on preserving 
access to remote regions.  The remaining ports are being 
transferred to local interests who are in a better position to 
manage them efficiently and in response to local needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will create Canada port authorities, CPAs, with 
a majority of their boards of directors appointed in consultation 
with port users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 repeals the Canada Port Corporation Act and the Public 
Harbours and Port Facilities Act.  The Canada Ports Corporation 
will be dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To become a Canada port authority, a port must have financial 
self-sufficiency, diversified traffic, strategic significance to 
Canada's trade and have a link to a major rail line or highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port authorities will be incorporated by letters patent for the 
purpose of operating a particular port.  They will have powers to 
engage in activities related to shipping, navigation, 
transportation of passengers and goods and handling of storage of 
goods as well as other activities deemed necessary to support 
port operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each board of directors will be composed of between seven to 
eleven members.  The majority of each board will be appointed by 
the federal government only after consultation with the users who 
will then put the names on a list of candidates that will be 
considered by the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining directors will be appointed by the municipality or 
the municipalities adjacent to the facility, involve provinces 
and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most important accountability mechanism in the bill 
is the provision that ports will have to go to the private sector 
for financing.  As a result, all port related development plans 
requiring investment will be subject to commercial risk 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last Parliament the biggest change introduced by the 
standing committee was to give the new port authorities crown 
agent status.  Crown agent status gives port authorities a clear 
exemption from full property taxation and would enable them to be 
covered by the municipal grants act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they will pay grants in lieu of taxes to the municipalities 
at the same levels as other federal facilities and installations. 
For most of the ports that will become CPAs this represents 
mostly a continuation of the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new obligations arising from agent status would come mainly 
to the federal government and not the agent.  For example, crown 
agent status applies only to core activities of the ports and not 
to other more peripheral or non-core activities that they may 
undertake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure third parties know when they are dealing with a 
crown agent, the legislation obliges the port authorities to make 
this clear in their non-agent dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires ports to borrow in their own name and not in 
the name of the crown.  This emphasizes to lenders that the crown 
does not stand behind these obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative I will address is the part of the legislation 
that will permit us to commercialize the operation of the Great 
Lakes St. Lawrence seaway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system is a crucial waterway but it is also a business. The 
seaway faces formidable challenges, including high asset renewal 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 enables the minister to enter into agreements with a 
not for profit corporation or any other private sector interests 
to operate and maintain all or part of the seaway.  The federal 
government would retain regulatory control over the navigation in 
the seaway and the existing seaway authority would be dissolved 
at an appropriate date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new not for profit seaway corporation would be responsible 
for operating the system for asset renewal costs up to a specific 
limit.  There would be incentives to achieve operating 
efficiencies and lower costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is negotiating the transfer of the seaway 
operation to a group representing the major shippers and carriers 
on the seaway. We believe that this so-called users group is best 
suited to take over the system because users want to minimize 
their seaway tolls and ensure the long term integrity of the 
system. The industries represented, in particular the steel 
industry and the marine carriers, require the seaway for their 
long term survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On marine pilotage Bill C-9 allows the Minister of Transport to 
improve the way pilotage authorities operate in Canada. The 
authorities will have legislative support to ensure that they 
recover their costs from those who use their services as well as 
a streamlined appeals process for new pilotage rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course as always, safety and environmental protection will 
continue to be the government's top priority and any changes will 
help to ensure that our high standards of safety continue to be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-9 meets the goals of the national marine 
policy and it strikes a balance in how we manage our marine 
institutions and facilities.  The bill complements the 
government's other transportation initiatives and is an important 
element in the overall effort to prepare our transportation 
system for the coming century. But no matter what changes are 
made or how many services are commercialized, Transport Canada 
will continue to make the safety and security of Canada's 
transportation system its first priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-9.  I am glad to hear that the 
member opposite is positive about making all these changes to the 
marine act.  I am afraid it is some 50 or 60 years too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to talk about history.  I want to give members of the 
House a history lesson.  As we know, this bill will have a huge 
impact on the port of Churchill in Manitoba, which has been 
grossly neglected by this government and former governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that in 1930 members of this House had a vision for 
the future of this country and built this huge shipping facility 
and in 1929 a railroad was built to reach that port. 
Unfortunately from 1930 to 1997 not a lot has been done with that 
port.  It has been neglected, misused or underutilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear that the Liberal government has finally 
realized that privatization is not a dirty word.  I am glad to 
hear that the government believes the private sector can perhaps 
carry on the business of transportation of commodities, including 
airports, much better than the government sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time I have I would like to talk about the port of 
Manitoba, our direct access to the world. Its main purpose for 
construction as outlined in the Ports Canada document is that 
about 25% of western Canada's grain growing area is located 
closer to Churchill than to any other port.  This covers the area 
of central and northern Saskatchewan, northeastern Alberta and 
northwestern Manitoba. In other words, Churchill is up to 1,600 
kilometres closer to European markets than the port of Thunder 
Bay.  Those are facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though those are the facts and that was the original intent 
for the construction of the port of Churchill the Liberal 
government and previous federal governments over the past 50 
years have totally neglected this fact and have put the cost of 
transporting agriculture commodities on the backs of farmers. 
That is the reason we have an east-west focus rather than a 
north-south focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member for Churchill, I visited Churchill this 
summer and had a chance to meet with Mayor Spence and his 
council. I was amazed at the facility there.  What really amazed 
me was the shape it was in and how long it had been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I differ from the member for Churchill.  I understand from 
speaking with the stakeholders at Churchill that the changes in 
the marine act will have an immense impact economically on the 
community of Churchill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also fail to understand that not only is grain exported 
through the port of Churchill but also consumer goods.  It is a 
gateway to the big north of Canada.  There is over $300 million 
in consumer products transported through the port of Churchill by 
barge and there is no doubt this will increase as further 
development takes place in northern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on record the myth that the port of 
Churchill is really not the place to export grain and agriculture 
products to the world, therefore forcing the farmers over the 
last 50 years to pay all these ridiculous transportation costs at 
the ports on the east coast as well as on the west coast.  Today 
we are still doing that; 60% of agricultural products shipped go 
west and 40% go to the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The break even point at the port of Churchill, I believe, is 
between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes.  Having spoken to the port 
manager yesterday, so far this year 11 ships have come in and two 
more are scheduled to arrive.  He stated to me that 400,000 
tonnes will be shipped through the port of Churchill this year, 
about a 30% increase from 1996. The projection is that management 
of the port would like to see 3% to 5% of the prairie crop 
shipped through the port of Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three western provinces produce about 30 million tonnes of 
grain; approximately 1.5 million tonnes are shipped through the 
port of Churchill, which is very little in terms of the total 
export and transportation of grain in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good news with the passing of this bill that the port of 
Churchill will be out of government hands and into private hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern that there will be a lack of a voice on the 
port board by the producers and a lack of a voice in the 
transportation company which has taken over the rail line between 
The Pas and Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that farmers will be consulted by both the new 
owners and stakeholders of the port and the rail line.  Otherwise 
we will end up with another monopoly as we had in the past when 
CN was run by government and the ports were run by government and 
the farmers will get the short end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is that the Canadian Wheat Board must 
increase the amount of grain moved through Churchill.  It is long 
overdue that farmers get their grain to market without being 
hosed by the transportation system in this country.

member for Lévis to rise in this debate, because everything marine 
is of great interest to me.  My constituents are also particularly 
interested, because the chantier maritime de Lévis is in my riding. 
It was Canada's main shipyard before the Liberals arrived.  It 
still has the potential to be the greatest one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also concerns me because, as the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans pointed out, all the Great Lakes 
traffic passes by us.  Unfortunately, it often just passes by. We 
do not always reap the benefit, because there is not enough 
legislation favouring Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is not new, as it replaces Bill C-44, which died on the 
Order Paper last spring, when the Prime Minister decided to call an 
early election. Bill C-44 had gone through all the stages in the House 
and had been referred to the Senate, which is not known for acting 
expeditiously. So, the old Bill C-44 was not passed by the Senate and is 
now being reintroduced as Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage, we cannot be opposed to it, since second reading 
deals with the principle of the bill. The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed 
to the objectives of the bill, even though we feel they are too modest. 
We, of course, strongly support the purpose of the bill, which is to 
transfer responsibilities to local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are major uncertainties. The bill is flawed in terms of 
what it does not cover. For example, the $125 million fund for port 
authorities seems woefully inadequate. It would not even cover Quebec's 
needs, let alone those of the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insufficient. If that amount remains unchanged, we will 
probably oppose the legislation at third reading. But let us give the 
government a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the appointment of the members of port authorities, 
which are supposed to be privatized. The government is keeping way too 
many powers, given that these authorities should manage their own 
affairs. Changes will have to be made in that regard, otherwise we in 
the Bloc Quebecois will oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other concerns. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska.—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques will 
discuss these, including the issue of pilots on the St. Lawrence 
River, which is a concern, particularly to those of us who are 
from the Quebec City region. The bill provides that St. Lawrence 
pilots will continue to ensure marine transportation on the St. 
Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I represent the riding of Lévis, I will of course primarily 
discuss the flaws of this bill, pompously called the Canada Marine Act. 
There is absolutely nothing in this bill about shipbuilding. 
In Lévis, which, as I was reminding you earlier, was, and potentially 
still is, the largest shipyard in Canada, the federal government has 
done nothing in its first term of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But during the 1993 election campaign, these folks made a number of 
promises.  The first was to hold a Canadian summit on the future of 
shipbuilding in Canada.  Not a whiff of a summit have we had, nor have 
we heard anything about the future of shipyards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am telling you this because the Conservatives did not manage to 
finalize anything before the 1993 election, but the Liberals had said 
they would do something about the project to replace the <I>Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I>, the ferry running between the Magdalen Islands and Prince 
Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government dragged its heels and took forever to bring 
forth what looks like a mouse to me, because instead of allowing the 
Lévis shipyard to build a new boat for $60 million, it preferred to pay 
$30 million to refit an Irish ferry for service to the Magdalen Islands. 
This is no way to promote economic and maritime development in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we called for action; at the time, we formed the 
official opposition.  We pointed out that the Liberal Party in 
its red book had promised money for the conversion of defence 
industries such as the Lévis shipyard to peacetime purposes. 
Yet, nothing, not a single penny, was provided in this area to 
help not only our shipyard in Lévis but also shipyards across 
Canada. Not one penny. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a fine promise, another broken promise. Each time the 
question of the shipyard in Lévis was raised, the then transport 
minister—and there have been quite a few—and the industry 
minister would reply: “The shipyard in Lévis should have a 
business plan. They should submit a business plan.”  They did. 
The management of the shipyard submitted a plan but, in the end, 
they never saw a penny. This time, they were given a different 
set of reasons: new terms and conditions had to be negotiated 
into the collective agreement, and the workers had to make 
concessions. And they did. But even then, they never saw a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, in the background, another condition the government 
did not dare state publicly. The shipyard was the property of the 
Société de développement industriel, a Quebec crown corporation. 
They said: “As long as the Quebec government is a shareholder, 
the federal government will not put money into this 
corporation.” Dominion Bridge, a private company, took over the 
shipyard a year and a half ago. Still, not a penny was provided 
for infrastructure, for military or civilian conversion. Nothing. 
And no contracts either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, the shipyard in Lévis underwent a slight change in 
orientation.  It secured the oil rig contract and has three 
contracts lined up and ready to go, including one from a 
Brazilian Crown corporation called Petrobras to build the <I>Spirit 
of Columbus</I>. But financial securities are required from both 
levels of government: the Quebec government, which has done its 
part, and the Canadian government, through the Export Development 
Corporation. Nothing has moved in a little over a year. All the 
while, there is a rig moored in my colleague's riding, at least 
in part, as the port of Quebec is right at the limit of the 
riding of Québec. It is the second largest rig in the world and 
we get to see it every day, but the federal government will not 
lift a finger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the hon. member for Beauce, who is supposed to represent 
the interests of the Quebec region, is listening. That is good, because 
I hope he will convey the message. Time is running out. This contract 
could create 400 jobs. So it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even workers from his riding are involved because his riding is 
next to mine.  The same applies to the member for Bellechasse, the 
minister of state responsible for agriculture and agri-food and for 
fisheries and oceans. He was loudly defending the federal government in 
his riding instead of defending his riding on the federal scene.  I woke 
him up at one point and told him: “Be careful.  When there were 2,000 
employees at MIL Davie, 500 of them came from the Bellechasse riding. 
You should look after their interests.” I urge the member for Beauce to 
do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, they let two bills die on the Order Paper when they 
called an early election.  Now we know why: the Liberals were afraid of 
allegations and investigations.  The Prime Minister said to himself: 
“Given the usual sluggishness of the federal government, the 
investigations will take so long that there is enough time for an 
election”.  He called the election and he did the right thing.  I 
congratulate him.  I think he now has a majority of four members. 
It could have been different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is not to be congratulated as far as 
maritime issues are concerned. I am not the only one to say so.  All 
ridings with major shipyards are represented by opposition members, not 
by Liberal members; the Liberals were all defeated because of their 
inertia.  And Canadian shipowners agree with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that the government did something in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
member for Dartmouth and the representative of thousands of 
people who are employed and affected by the activities of one of 
Canada's most vital ports, I would like to discuss the impact on 
Atlantic Canada of Bill C-9, the Canada Marine Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will discuss the issue of divesting certain harbours and 
ports on the communities of Nova Scotia.   Then I will look at 
some of the aspects of Bill C-9 that will have negative impacts 
on the port of Halifax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced in its national marine policy 
in 1995 that it planned to divest itself of all of its port 
facilities across the country which were under the control of 
Transport Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa said it was spending $50 million each year to operate the 
country's 572 ports.  The marine policy later became Bill C-44 
which died in the House when the last Parliament was dissolved. 
Transport Canada is continuing with the divestiture scheme using 
other mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of Nova Scotia port facilities reaches over 150. There 
are Amherst, Baddeck, Mulgrave, Port Hawkesbury, Canso, Liscomb, 
Mahone Bay, Tor Bay, over 150 communities which depend on their 
ports as an important pillar of their communities are in 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like their churches, their schools and their post offices, for 
those who still have the luxury of having a post office, the 
ports are an important part of their existence.  So far Transport 
Canada has managed to unload three ports.  The Weymouth port was 
sold to Irving for about $250,000.  The Shelburne port was taken 
over by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Daysprings 
port was purchased for $30,000 by a shipyard company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the near future the Country Harbour facility will go up for 
public auction and the Sheet Harbour and Iona ports will be 
available for public tender. How many other buyers are there for 
these little ports?  I would say precious few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is holding public hearings in the affected 
communities.  An executive assistant to Transport Canada's 
Atlantic region divestiture team has said that the affected 
communities are very hostile during these meetings.  I can 
imagine why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So many of these communities are angry because they do not think 
they have the resources to maintain or take over these facilities 
and they do not.  These communities will go to ruin.  These ports 
will go to ruin without the infrastructure that the government 
provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a port with revenues of $2,000 and expenses of $20,000 
be profitable?  But is profitability the only criterion by which 
we judge things now?  Over 100 small ports which are central to 
the maritime fabric of life will flounder and go to ruin.  For 
what?  To save a few dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same mentality that wiped out the Yarmouth-Bar 
Harbour ferry in the winter time.  It is the same mentality that 
will force people to pay a toll on the trans Canada highway. This 
is the same mentality that led the government to privatize the 
air traffic control system for a billion dollars less than it was 
worth.  This is privatization ideology run rampant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the Prime Minister is presently meeting with 
the four Atlantic premiers to talk about Atlantic Canada's need 
to get ahead at the same time as the government is pushing 
through legislation which undermines the essential transportation 
infrastructure in Atlantic Canada. At the same time it tightens 
the grip of big corporations such as Irving on our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port of Halifax-Dartmouth is another community which has 
major concerns about Bill C-44.  The bill will prevent access for 
the port authority to the traditional primary source of funding 
for major capital projects and that is the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the primary negative feature of the bill.  Many port 
facilities such as Halifax are capital intensive and have to be 
built well in advance of user commitments.  Users often do not 
come until the facilities are in place.  In the case of Halifax, 
because little of its traffic is captive, when users of the 
facility arrive there is no guarantee they will stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ships float and boats are floating assets.  They will not stay 
if they find another port which provides cheaper access to the 
markets in the North American interior that they seek to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No private sector lender or investor can advance the bulk of 
such funding against user commitment which may or may not 
materialize when the facilities are completed.  Funding can only 
come from governments which have the necessary financial 
resources and can justify, in the interest of promoting the 
economy of their constituents, the assumptions of the attendant 
commercial risks.  This is true of all Canadian ports but also 
ports the world over which do not have enough captive or near 
captive traffic for their major borrowings to be bankable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the bill been in effect in the late 1960s Halifax would not 
have been able to build and equip even one container berth and 
the harbour would long ago have fallen into disuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be changed to delete the provisions intended to 
prevent the federal government from providing capital funding to 
the new port authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that we have in Atlantic Canada is the concern 
of labour with regard to this legislation.  Labour needs a place 
at the new port authorities.  From labour's standpoint the Canada 
Marine Act does not legislatively ensure that port labour will 
have a place at the new port authority boards.  Port labour in 
Halifax is asking that it be grandfathered into the new board of 
the port authority so as to ensure that labour has a continued 
voice in the direction and running of the Halifax port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Halifax Port Development Commission also has serious 
objections to the bill on the one hand denying any access 
whatsoever for ports to parliamentary appropriation of federal 
funds, while on the other hand continuing to offer access to the 
consolidated revenue fund for the seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As clause 67(c) states, the objective is to protect the long 
term operation and viability of the seaway as an integral part of 
Canada's national transportation infrastructure.  The port of 
Halifax and the CN gateway are at least as critical a component 
of Canada's national transportation infrastructure as the seaway, 
and given industry trends, hold considerably greater potential to 
expand their role in international trade for the benefit of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that in many instances the seaway 
competes with Halifax for traffic, making the discrepancy of 
treatment that much more objectionable.  We therefore strongly 
recommend that Bill C-9 be amended to ensure that the major ports 
and the seaway are treated in a consistent and equitable manner 
with respect to access to federal funds for capital investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 in its present form will have many detrimental effects 
on the communities of Atlantic Canada ports both big and little. 
Atlantic Canada and the port of Halifax deserve to have their 
needs met.  Bill C-9 is not acceptable in its present form and we 
will be examining it carefully and constructively in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, congratulations on your appointment to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly pleased to talk on Bill C-9 today.  It will have 
a big impact on my community and in many communities of the 
province of Nova Scotia and the entire maritime provinces because 
it deals with ports and harbours.  It also deals with the St. 
Lawrence seaway which does not directly affect us but it 
certainly does indirectly.  There will be a major impact on the 
federal ferry system, the pilotage programs and harbour police. 
Many aspects of the way of life in coastal communities either on 
the west coast or on the east coast will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about the impact it will have on the ports and 
harbours and the pilotage people.  It does not talk about the 
impact it will have on municipalities.  It does not talk about 
the tremendous impact it will have on the provinces and the 
people.  It will have an incredible impact on the people who are 
affected by the downsizing programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thought crossed my mind as I was reading the bill that it is 
very much along the line of the present government policy of 
downsizing which seems to be pervasive throughout government 
programs.  In some cases it seems to be innocuous and maybe even 
sensible, but the fact of the matter is that whenever national 
standards are taken away and the responsibility is given to the 
provinces and then down to the municipalities, we lose 
consistency and control over how the ports are managed. There 
will be inconsistencies from port to port from province to 
province and all over the country when this bill passes.  I know 
it will cause a lot of grief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have national policies which are inconsistent. 
Provincial policies change very rapidly.  Provincial policies can 
change in an instant, whereas national policies only change over 
a period of time.  They are much slower to change.  The people 
involved who are affected by these quick decisions by the 
provinces will be hurt a great deal more than if the control of 
the port stayed with the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pervasive downsizing approach by the government was 
eloquently repeated yesterday by the premier of the province of 
Nova Scotia, a former member of this House, who said, “We have 
suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts in recent years. 
Just give us a chance to get our bearings.  It seems that the 
cutbacks are promoting cutbacks.  Let us lay off for a little 
while until we get on our feet before you come back at us 
again”.  That is what this is doing.  This is coming back at the 
smaller communities and the smaller ports. Even though the 
premier of the province of Nova Scotia was a former member, he 
recognizes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A really good example of the negative impact of downloading and 
losing the consistency of national policies is the port police 
policy that the hon. member for Saint John so eloquently talked 
about a little while ago.  The port police in Canada are highly 
specialized and highly trained police.  They are specialized in 
the fields of drugs, immigration, firearms and contraband, all 
things that are really important to Canadians.  If we lose an 
effective police force on the ports, the whole country will pay a 
huge price for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-9 all the ports police are being disbanded and 
municipal police or whatever are going to take over this 
responsibility.  It is not even clear who is going to take this 
over.  The government is disbanding the ports police and there is 
no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we run into the inconsistency problem that I mentioned 
before where one port is doing one thing, another is doing 
something else and other ports have no plan at all. Basically if 
we do go to inconsistent port police we will have training that 
is inconsistent, quality that is inconsistent and the application 
of the rules and the law that is inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the ports that have poor policing systems will be 
identified by the criminal elements in our country.  They will 
become the ports of choice for criminal operations.  We think 
that is going to happen because we are losing our national 
standards for our ports police.  We are going to have every port 
with its own police application and approach. That is another big 
impact from downloading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am again going to quote Nova Scotia Premier MacLellan.  He 
said yesterday, “Nova Scotians have been devastated by what 
Ottawa did.  We have to get our financial house in order, there 
is no question about that, but excessive financial brutality is 
something else again.  We just cannot do that.  It is not the way 
to treat people”.  That is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to a few other aspects of C-9.  Probably the most 
important issue is the classification of ports.  The government 
is dividing all ports into three classes:  major commercial ports 
that are financially viable; regional ports that are to be 
divested over six years—I almost used devastated and that could 
be interchanged with divested because I believe they will be—; 
and the other class of ports is remote ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These again are separate from the fisheries and oceans small 
craft harbours where the same thing is happening.  Those wharves 
are all being divested or becoming port authorities.  It is going 
to have a tremendous impact on the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody in the closet in Ottawa who is writing this legislation 
does not have any idea of the impact this will have on 
communities like Wallace, Pugwash, Barachois and Parrsboro that I 
am sure Madam Speaker is very familiar with.  Communities like 
Advocate and Shelburne in Nova Scotia where a military base just 
closed.  Now they are having their port taken away from them or 
they are disowning the port I should say because the port is not 
viable by itself and they are going to lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first classification of ports is major ports.  They will 
become Canadian port authorities.  They will probably be all 
right because they have already been designated as viable.  The 
regional ports have a very uncertain future and this is where we 
are going to focus our attention.  The third is the remote ports 
which will continue to be supported by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our focus will be on the regional ports such as the ports I 
listed a minute ago.  These ports have not had the opportunity to 
be heard.  They do not even have any idea what is going to happen 
to them.  They do not even have any idea that this is happening. 
We want to make sure that the regional ports do know what is 
happening.  We will make sure, to the best of our ability, that 
they are informed and given the opportunity to speak and tell us 
what the impact will be on their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the port, the wharf, is the lifeblood of the community. If 
you take away the port and let it collapse, and this legislation 
will eventually force many ports to collapse, the whole community 
will collapse. 
I do not think we can stand by and let that happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One option that has been put up for the regional ports is to 
privatize the port facility or sell it.  Sell it to whom?  What 
about the community?  What about the community that uses it for 
recreational boating and fisheries and as a centre of its 
commercial activity?  What happens if it is sold to a company 
that has no interest in the community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a proposal in Bayside, New Brunswick to sell the wharf 
and the whole port to a U.S. company.  It wanted to take control 
over the entire port. It wanted to open a gravel pit or a quarry. 
It said that the only way it could do that would be if it totally 
controlled the whole port of Bayside.  What happened to the 
people in Bayside?  What about their concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the MP for Charlotte, that deal probably 
would have gone ahead and an American sand and gravel company 
would now own a port in New Brunswick.  It would own the whole 
port that tax dollars paid for, a port that is the centre of 
activity in the whole area of Bayside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I hearken back to Premier MacLellan's comments about 
downloading, devastation, brutality.  Let us go slow on this 
regional ports facility deal.  We will be monitoring the regional 
ports facility issue very very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been enough consultation with the regional ports. 
They do not even know what is happening to them.  We may propose 
that we split the bill.  We should do the national ports and 
remote ports now and the regional ports later as we get other 
alternatives that will offer opportunities for these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just cannot wipe out hundreds of communities. There are 
hundreds of communities on the list that have been presented. 
Regional and local ports from all parts of the country in every 
province will be affected.  These communities do not realize that 
they are about to lose the hub of their whole community.  They 
have to know and must have a chance to speak and be heard. We 
will be bringing that to their attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privatization aspect of this bill is really frightening.  An 
American company can buy a port since there are no restrictions 
on who can buy and own ports.  The bill just states that the 
ports are going to be divested, that they will be sold to the 
highest bidder.  There are now planned auctions for ports in Nova 
Scotia.  This is an incredible way to treat the people and the 
citizens of these ports that will be sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Whelan):</B>  Debate.  The hon. member 
for Portage—Lisgar. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, your father must be very proud of you in your elevation 
to the Chair.  I congratulate you and wish you well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a different slant on this issue.  I will try to 
point out why some of these ports are probably not profitable and 
why we need more cost effective transportation or handling of 
these ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain gave me some stats 
from the Canadian Grain Commission.  They really tell the story 
of what has happened to many of the ports.  The dates for all of 
these ports range from 1987 to 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic coast ports decreased from 552,000 tonnes in 1987 
to 73,000 tonnes today. That is quite a decrease.  The ports 
along the St. Lawrence have had an even bigger decrease.  In 1987 
they handled 11.8 million tonnes of grain.  Today they are only 
handling about 4.4 million tonnes.  We can see that the flow of 
traffic as far as grain is concerned has been diverted to some 
other transportation systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thunder Bay has done a little better.  It has actually increased 
from 1.1 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes, possibly because 
of the grain going to the U.S. being loaded in Thunder Bay and 
then unloaded at Duluth.  Churchill, which my hon. colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River talked about, used to handle about half a 
million tonnes or better of grain in 1987. 
In 1996 they were down to 227,000 tonnes.  As we heard today that 
has increased to about 400,000 tonnes, which is a good trend for 
Churchill.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pacific coast has actually stayed very stable at from 60 
million tonnes in 1987 down to 40 million tonnes in 1996. Because 
of market trends in shipping products to Asia, west coast ports 
have done better than east coast ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  One of the big reasons is that the costs at some 
of these ports have become almost unbearable for the shippers, 
especially grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the St. Lawrence Pilotage Authority negotiated a new 
wage contract that gave a 32% increase in wages over three years, 
which was unheard of in those days for other industries. Why 
these people were able to leverage this kind of a contract I have 
no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nine month period pilots earn from $115,000 to $156,000. We 
were told during the hearings in Thunder Bay that they did not 
want to prove or disprove after nine months of operation that 
they still qualified for unemployment insurance.  Their yearly 
earnings were fairly well looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brought to light other things.  I am looking at some of my 
notes.  Mr. Kennedy, one of the town fathers of Thunder Bay, 
pointed out that the cost of a tonne of grain going down the St. 
Lawrence Seaway on a 20,000 tonne freighter would be $2.50 per 
tonne just for the pilotage.  That is more money to be paid by 
farmers than all the fuel taxes on a tonne of grain being shipped 
across the country.  We can see the additional costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a laker coming up stream with another type of freight it 
would be about $1.25 a tonne or about half.  It is still very 
high and adds to the cost of operating the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also pointed out that a 10 day trip from Montreal up through 
the Great Lakes to Thunder Bay and back would cost shippers 
$53,000 just for the pilot.  That is as much as the total wage 
bill for the crew of the ship.   We can see that something is 
wrong in the pilotage authority that should be addressed in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 we were led to believe that this was one of the most 
important issues and that it would be dealt with when the marine 
bill was brought forward.  However it has been deleted and that 
really bothers me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will have to begin realizing that if grain transportation 
costs are not brought down there will not be much grain going 
through some of the ports.  The sooner we recognize that, the 
better off we will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at some of the figures that the grain companies 
gave us, it was astounding what property taxes were doing to some 
of these ports and terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cargill has a terminal in Duluth which is a third bigger than 
its terminal at Thunder Bay.  It was paying $27,000 property 
taxes at Duluth and $1.25 million at Thunder Bay.  It is about 
the same for west coast ports.  They are somewhat lower but the 
property taxes on some grain facilities are unbelievable.  That 
will have to be addressed, or we will begin to see things happen 
such as what is taking place in rail transportation now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to figures the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain 
gave me, direct shipping to the U.S. by rail in 1987 was 60,000 
tonnes.  In 1996 it was 1.889 million tonnes.  We see that these 
ports are interfering with the shipment of grain, in which 
direction it should go, because of the costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board, one of my favourite friends, tried a 
number of projects to ship grain down the Mississippi. It was 
quite successful.  It would take grain up to Minneapolis, barge 
it down the Mississippi and export it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are happening.  The government will have to realize 
it better do something to address the costs of ports or they will 
totally lose the business.  Once the business is gone it is 
pretty hard to bring it back, except it can be attracted with 
lower costs that are feasible and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded by what the pilotage did to shipping on the 
Great Lakes.  A Canadian ship owner who testified before the 
hearings had five vessels in the seaway system.  In 1994 he 
estimates he could have saved $475,000 on pilotage costs if they 
were in a competitive environment and operated on commercial 
rates.  That was half a million dollars for four ships.  When 10 
or 12 million tonnes of grain are taken through the system, we 
can be seen how it affects shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Government of Canada allowing these things to happen? 
As the whole transportation system was developing there was so 
much government interference in the system that they do not know 
how to rectify it.  It is so far out of whack compared to the 
U.S. system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While freight costs are a little higher as far as rail is 
concerned in the U.S, if I ship a load of grain through the 
handling system from my farm in Snowflake, Manitoba, to Seattle, 
I can save $16 a tonne just by elevation and handling charges in 
the grain handling system.  These are items that we have to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little story to finish up the whole debate.  In the 
1930s during the Bennett buggy days car tops were taken off, 
shafts were put on the wheels and cars were pulled by horse.  In 
those days one of my neighbours who was shipping a carload of 
barley to Thunder Bay got a bill for a number of dollars and the 
price of the barley did not cover the freight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The station master sent him a bill.  He went to the station 
master and said “Sir, I haven't got any money.  I can't pay this 
freight bill.  The barley didn't cover the cost of it, so you are 
just out of it”.  Things being very tough in those days, the 
station master said “Bring me a rooster and we will call it 
even-steven”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a week later the farmer came back to town and brought two 
roosters with him.  The station agent said “Sir, I only asked 
for one rooster.  Why would you bring me two?”  He said “Well, 
sir, you have forgotten I have another carload of barley to 
ship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about the way we are running our transportation system 
today.  It is becoming so costly that shippers cannot survive 
with it.  Sooner or later it will die.  If we have to pay it in 
roosters, the chicken industry in Ontario will also fold.

bill to be sent to committee as soon as possible. Let us remember that 
this is the old Bill C-44, to which we made a very constructive 
contribution to get meaningful results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had not agreed to make some amendments that we 
considered essential, which is why we had voted against the bill at 
third reading. These amendments are still not to be found in the new 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it has to be recognized that this is an important bill. 
It will create the port authorities and finally allow the regions to 
take over control of their port infrastructures, which is what the 
people of Quebec, among others, have been calling for over the past 20, 
25 or 30 years, while the federal government has long been a distant 
observer of the vitality of our regions and of the use of port 
facilities in our regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will introduce some interesting elements, but only 
if the federal government decides to put more than $150 million 
into the compensation fund it plans to put into place for when a 
regional port is handed over to regional authorities.  Let me give 
you an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several port facilities in my riding that are 
affected by this situation.  Since the community of Cacouna found 
out two years ago that a new ports policy was coming, it undertook 
some projects.  A port development corporation has been created. 
It has already twinned with the French port of La Rochelle. 
It is getting a commercial development plan drawn up under the 
leadership of the director general of a pulp and paper mill in 
Rivière-du-Loup, a very dynamic business man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community has taken its fate into its own hands.  It is 
prepared to take over, to assume administration of the facility, 
but only under acceptable conditions, and the federal government 
must turn over the facility under conditions which will maximize 
the port's future business opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they expect that if the port entrance needs 
widening, or if the port needs dredging, that must be done.  In 
other words, like any property, that it not be sold in a rundown 
condition. It must be sold in an acceptable condition and at a 
price that will enable the community to take it over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commercial ports are not the only ones affected by this 
bill.  There are also ferry ports.  Three are affected this way 
in my riding: the Rivière-du-Loup—Saint-Siméon ferry, the 
Trois-Pistoles—Les Escoumins ferry and the ferry between 
Saint-Juste-du-Lac and Notre-Dame-du-Lac on Témiscouata Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each case necessitates divestment, and the community has to 
take over the facility with the assurance that there will be a 
future for ferry services.  In Rivière-du-Loup, an impact study by 
the Corporation de développement économique confirms that the ferry 
brings in $25 million and provides each government with some $2 
million in tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The talk of giving money to the regions out of kindness and a 
concern for equality is over.  Governments have to consider ferry 
ports in Rivière-du-Loup an investment that stimulates the 
economy and provides revenues much higher than the cost of 
maintaining the facilities and especially divestment in the 
interest of the people of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Trois-Pistoles ferry, which is a private 
operation, and which the Government of Quebec did not consider an 
essential service, but which in practice provides an essential 
service.  It provides transportation to the North Shore alleviating 
traffic problems on the Saguenay ferry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must be open and permit this port to 
operate at full capacity.  It must also acknowledge the 
recreational and touristic aspects of the port developed in 
recent years.  It is a haven where tourists, who have made 
Trois-Pistoles the cultural capital of the Lower St. Lawrence, 
can use the port infrastructure as a gateway to the river and 
enjoy all the benefits of the various tourist developments in our 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things are dealt with in the bill, which is why we 
want it sent to committee as soon as possible, so that the government 
can listen to our arguments and agree to a number of amendments, 
including one to increase the compensation fund to make it efficient and 
operational and ensure that the local authorities will be able, 10 or 15 
years from now, to take charge of their own future and to control their 
port infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other reasons why we want to send the bill to 
committee as soon as possible. There is the whole issue of the 
maritime pilots on the St. Lawrence.  The last time the bill was 
before the committee, the Liberal majority came up with a 
last-minute amendment. We do not know where it came from but it 
did smack of influence peddling. This amendment took away from 
the pilots the role they were playing in terms of security. The 
amendment was designed to replace these people with machines, to 
remove some of the security measures they used to have and to 
threaten the independence they enjoyed as pilots on the St. 
Lawrence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a quick look at this amendment, and I was surprised at the 
attitude of the government. I had discussions with pilots, who clearly 
demonstrated to me the essential nature of their functions, as good 
human judgment is essential to navigation on the St. Lawrence, where 
security is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of the language of work for pilots on 
the St. Lawrence. Over the years, they have developed a tradition of 
working in French, and this tradition should continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, we fought real hard and convinced the government to 
withdraw this amendment. Today, this aspect of the bill is acceptable to 
us, and pilots want to see the bill passed as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me add that we would like to vote in favour of the 
bill as a whole at third reading. That is why we would like to get a few 
additional amendments from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-44 was in committee, we managed to have the port of 
Trois-Rivières designated as a Canadian port authority, thanks in 
part to the hon. member for Trois-Rivières, who made very 
significant representations.  Among other things, he provided 
information that helped the Prime Minister better understand what 
was best for Trois-Rivières, after originally saying that the 
status of regional port might not be a bad thing for that city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the hon. member for Trois-Rivières was able to 
demonstrate that Trois-Rivières deserved to have a port authority, and 
he managed to convince the committee. This resulted in an improved piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still a few things that need to be corrected in the 
bill. If the government is prepared to do so, the end result will 
be even better. I am thinking in particular of a clause that 
seems quite obsolete.  I am referring to the fact that port 
masters in Canada are appointed by the government, in a blatant 
display of patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1993 election, we had a port master who had been 
similarly appointed by the Conservatives, but who had developed an 
expertise. He had been there seven, eight or ten years and had become an 
expert in the field. Still, the Liberals got rid of him and appointed 
someone else. I have no doubt about the new appointee's competence, but 
he had to learn everything from scratch. I believe an amendment would be 
in order regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say we are prepared to go to committee. We hope the 
review takes place as soon as possible, and we also hope the government 
will give favourable consideration to our amendments, so that, in the 
end, the bill is a true reform of Canada's marine policy and a tool to 
promote our economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as someone 
who comes from the Lower St. Lawrence and lives in a riding on 
the banks of that river, it seems only natural that I should take 
part in the debate today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without waxing nostalgic, I would like to tell you, and members of 
the House, that, in my youth—this goes back a bit—transportation was 
generally by boat.  Boats took the place of trucks and trains.  Things 
have changed over time, but I still remember those days when any child 
living along the river knew that its moods changed, just as moods change 
here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois support the policy to divest and 
commercialize ports.  However, as those who spoke before me have said, 
certain questions arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-9, the Canada Marine Act, one of the first questions that 
comes up concerns the fate of ports.  We know that, historically, ports 
were not necessarily located where they might be today.  We know that 
the facilities in certain ports are completely obsolete, and that others 
have been transformed over the years from ordinary harbours to deep sea 
ports.  But on the whole these ports continue to serve the public and 
certain businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though a reserve of $125 million has been set aside to help 
with the restructuring or sale of certain ports, serious questions come 
to mind.  Will the free trade rules mean that people will buy only ports 
that are ready for use and financially viable?  Will other ports, which 
often contribute to their region's economic development, be completely 
divested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned and I wish other members would share my 
concerns about who will buy these ports. Will local disparities be 
taken into account? Will these ports, as in our case, still be 
owned by Quebeckers? Since it was mentioned that Americans or 
people from outside Quebec will be able to buy ports, we do not 
know how the ports will be managed and what impact this will have 
on local and regional markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, we would like to have more information on this 
whole aspect of the port transfer before giving our consent to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Lévis also spoke about shipbuilding. He is 
concerned about the issue of shipbuilding in the greater Quebec 
City area. In other areas in Quebec, we are also very concerned 
about this issue.  He mentioned the rig. I will not come back to 
that, but it is nevertheless a monument which could become a 
monument to shame if the people opposite do not make funds 
available to allow the required work to be performed as soon as 
possible. This would bring—I will not say grist to the mill, 
that would be too easy—more rig overhaul contracts our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipyards are also involved in ship refit. There were years when 
over 2,000 people, or 2,000 families, lived off the contracts awarded by 
the federal government to repair or overhaul ships. The mood of the 
people in our region depends largely on the employment situation. Now 
that only 500 to 700 people work in our shipyards, this is becoming a 
problem. And what about construction starts? 
But this is a thing of the past, and I do not want to sound overly 
nostalgic. There is nothing in bill C-9 on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another major point, which I will call the interference 
issue. Bill C-9, the Canada Marine Act, is a fine model of 
interference. We are familiar with this in my riding, where, 
following the 1993 election, the defeated Liberal candidate, 
Margo Brousseau, was appointed to the port of Quebec's board of 
directors.  We would not want these things to go on. We would 
like people to be appointed to these positions because of their 
abilities, not because of their contacts.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-9, the government will appoint directors who will have 
decision making powers within port authorities, but it is withdrawing 
from any financial involvement. What a nice model of centralization that 
does not reflect the realities of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding my remarks, I want to say a few words on the Pilotage 
Act. My colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques already spoke on this issue, but I would like to add a few 
words. We know the habits of our pilots on the St. Lawrence and we would 
like things to stay the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are totally opposed to the possible repeal of the 
Pilotage Act in favour of the creation of a central body such as the 
port secretariat, for which the government is already trying to find a 
role. The Bloc Quebecois will keep a close eye on this issue because it 
is of great interest to us, and we will not let it go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will not vote in favour of this bill unless 
certain amendments are made to our satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the 
question on the motion is deemed to have been put and a recorded 
division deemed demanded and accordingly deferred until Tuesday, October 
21, 1997, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.
