(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ) </B>moved that 
Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to raise a 
problem which has been been going on for far too long in Quebec 
and in Canada, and which in my opinion is prejudicial to the 
development of an essential sector of Canadian and Quebec 
industry, namely automobile mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start off by asking my colleagues of all parties in the 
House for their co-operation and support, because I believe that 
this problem is vital to a category of workers who are literally 
discriminated against when it comes to tax deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this bill goes beyond party lines. 
I do not think it has anything to do with the differences of 
opinion there might be between the left and right in Canada, 
between sovereignists and federalists.  I believe this bill 
should be an opportunity to rise above party lines.  This bill 
will be a votable item, as I remind hon. members.  Each and 
every one of my colleagues in this House will therefore be able 
to vote according to his or her conscience.  Based on the number 
of letters I have received in my office since introducing Bill 
C-205, I have great hopes of its being passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people affected by it are the men and women who work under 
the hoods of our cars and other vehicles, covered with grease 
and grime, day after day, in order to keep them in running order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every one of the 301 members of this House, myself 
included, have to submit every four years to the test of 
democracy, and when I say submit, I should probably be saying 
pass the test of democracy to convince people to support us. 
From time to time, we all visit car dealers for various meetings 
or during election campaigns. I am convinced that all my 
colleagues have had the same experience as I have. The owners of 
the garage open their doors to us, they allow us to meet the 
employees, either during the morning or the afternoon break, or 
at lunch time, and we then have the opportunity to talk with 
those men and women who tell us about the problems they are 
facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of you might be wondering why the Bloc Quebecois transport 
critic is introducing a bill. It is a private member's bill. I 
was, and still am, of the opinion that it is a problem that 
should be fixed by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand that it is actually very difficult for 
these men and women to work in a ideal context because of the 
high cost of the tools they need to do their job. We have to 
understand that mechanics usually have to provide every tool, or 
at least many of the tools that they need to do their work. 
These tools, as members can imagine, are much more that the 
simple screwdriver that people can buy for a dollar or two. They 
are very expensive tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to my information, a young mechanic or apprentice very 
often has to lay out a sizeable amount of money. This bill 
raises another problem with regard to the opportunity these 
young people have to work and earn a decent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It often happens that a young mechanic who has just finished 
school has to spend between $5,000 and as much as $30,000 or 
$40,000 to buy the tools he needs for his job. Moreover, some of 
these expenses are recurrent. Technological change makes some 
tools obsolete quite rapidly, and new parts have to be bought. 
Some tools are sometimes forgotten inside vehicles, or some of 
them break and have to be replaced. 
To sum up, a mechanic has to spend thousands of dollars on the 
tools of his trade, but since he is a worker and not a business, 
he cannot benefit from tax deductions. 
I hope the national revenue and finance ministers will be 
sensitive to this problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a business that has to buy equipment can claim a 
deduction for these costs and get depreciation. This is not 
possible for an individual, except in certain cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few of these exceptions. We have the chain saw 
operators, and forestry workers, for example. To a certain 
extent, musicians and artists can also claim deductions for 
their instruments and tools. But mechanics cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore believe that mechanics are being treated unfairly 
and it is high time parliament did something about it. Today, 
February 14, on Valentine's Day, we are exactly two weeks to the 
day from the Minister of Finance's budget. We know the budget 
will be brought down on February 28 because the Prime Minister 
let it slip out about two weeks ago already. I wonder if the 
Minister of Finance was pleased when his Prime Minister 
accidentally revealed the date of the budget speech. So, the 
budget will be brought down on February 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Minister of Finance, on his community spirit and 
on his sense of justice and equity. 
I would appreciate it if, in his budget—and I convinced that the 
minister will be receptive and our speeches today are aimed at 
making him aware of this issue—he took into account the 
government's anticipated surplus of some $95 billion over the 
next five years. The minister should take the opportunity 
provided by his budget to grant tax deductions to mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that I received numerous letters of support 
from members on both sides of the House. I also received letters 
from some of my constituents who work as mechanics in a garage 
and who are asking me to act. I would like to quote one such 
letter written by Mario Labrecque and Gérald Corriveau. Both 
work as mechanics in Beauport and they sent me this letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As constituents in your riding, we wish to inform you of the 
discriminatory nature of a tax policy that has an impact on our 
livelihood as automotive technicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young apprentice who 
begins his career as a automotive technician must, on average, 
invest over $15,000 in tools and equipment. He must also invest 
an average of $5,000 each year to keep up to date. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two persons go on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we are not entitled to deduct the cost of 
our tools, even though buying these tools is a condition of 
employment for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfairness of this treatment is aggravated by the fact that 
members of other professions, including chain saw operators and 
musicians, are allowed to deduct the cost of their saw or of 
their musical instrument. Moreover, the decision of the federal 
Minister of Finance not to grant any tax relief to mechanics 
regarding the purchasing of tools and equipment is a deterrent 
for anyone who might interested in that trade. The result is 
that the industry has a serious problem recruiting candidates 
and there is currently a shortage of skilled manpower. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of these remarks, I decided to introduce this bill, 
which is intended to provide a deduction relating specifically 
to, and I will explain the content of Bill C-205, the cost of 
tool rentals, tool maintenance, related insurance and the full 
price of tools costing less than $250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure, I am sure, will ensure tax equity for people who 
are well deserving of it.  This parliament is aware of this 
injustice and has been for a long time.  On many occasions since 
1992, members have drawn the fact to the government's attention. 
There was the member for Lakeland, I recall, and even a Liberal 
member, who introduced a similar bill when the party was in 
opposition in the early 1990s.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How have things changed since?  Why has the Liberal Party not 
remained true to itself?  Nearly every party, each in turn, has 
made the government aware of this inequity and nearly all have 
reached the same conclusion: the solution is a tax deduction for 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its December 1997 prebudget report, the House Standing 
Committee on Finance said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses. Special provisions in the Income Tax Act 
already apply to artists, chainsaw operators and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny this tax treatment to apprentices and technicians in the 
automotive industry is not only unfair, it also imposes an 
impediment to employment, especially for the young who might 
choose to work as apprentices. Revising the tax treatment of 
such expenses would remove the impediment that exists under the 
present tax rules. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the majority of the members of the House 
Standing Committee on Finance are government members.  I would 
hope the Liberal members of this House will indicate the route 
the government should follow in the vote at second reading of my 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Parliamentary Secretary to the then Minister of 
Finance, the government implied that it had great sympathy for 
mechanics and the difficult situation they faced, but that it 
could not take a piecemeal approach because other categories of 
workers might be facing a similar problem and it was necessary 
to bring in a legislative reform that would apply to all trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite its sympathy, in the budgets tabled since the 1997 
report of the Standing Committee on Finance, the government has 
still not introduced the tax deduction needed to resolve this 
problem.  Once again, I appeal to members, regardless of their 
party, and particularly to the Liberal majority, to offer 
automobile mechanics more than their sympathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sympathy is certainly helpful.  It is a comfort. 
It is encouraging and supportive.  But I am asking for more.  I 
am asking for a concrete policy, for this parliament to take a 
democratic decision that will bring around the Minister of 
Finance and influence the government.  I am therefore calling 
for more than sympathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House what I think of the supposed 
importance of not opening Pandora's box by creating a deduction 
for mechanics and not for other trades that might also be 
similarly penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An injustice exists.  We know what needs to be done to fix it. 
Under no circumstances can we allow it to drag on because there 
might be other similar cases.  On the contrary, let us resolve 
to take corrective action in the case of these other injustices 
at a later time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear from other members. 
Perhaps they will honestly decide to introduce other private 
members' bills to correct other injustices, but the bill I have 
introduced concerns a tax deduction for automobile mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the members opposite not to play the game of doing 
nothing until a comprehensive solution is found to the problems 
of federal Canadian tax law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government coffers are full. We expect a $95 billion 
surplus over the next five years. The Minister of Finance has 
money coming out his ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some of the decisions that have been taken, 
including the one about giving some thought to providing tax 
benefits to hockey teams owners when the average salary in the 
National Hockey League is $1.2 million.  Thanks to public opinion 
and because ordinary citizens sent faxes, phoned the riding 
offices and condemned this idea I would describe as stupid, that 
of giving tax deductions to hockey millionaires, the government 
thought about it for three days, then changed its mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this bill is concerned, mechanics are not hockey 
millionaires, they do not earn $1.2 million a year working in a 
garage. These people are middle-class workers, who are struggling 
and who have children in school. These young people need 
clothing and they sometimes have to rent an apartment away from 
home to pursue specialised studies in college or at university. 
We are talking here about middle-class people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as we often say in our speeches, we as parliamentarians are 
sympathetic to the concerns of the ordinary people and the 
middle class, this bill is a very good opportunity to show it 
instead of simply expressing pious hopes, saying kind words, and 
crowing over how nice and fine our actions are. When we vote on 
this bill at second reading, we will see if the 301 members of 
the House are showing solidarity with those who are unfairly 
treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that, when they finish school, many young people 
do not have $15,000 to spend on a tool kit. What does that mean? 
It means that, when they enter the work market, young people who 
have already run into debt to get an education have to get 
further into debt to equip themselves with a tool kit that may 
cost between a minimum of $5,000 and $15,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, these young people do not own any property or house, 
which they could use as collateral for a bank loan. Often they 
will need their parents to guarantee their loan. Not all parents 
are able to stand surety for their children. Let us not forget 
that parents who have spent a lot of money to support and help 
their children sometimes are not able to stand security for a 
bank loan. I hope that you are aware of the fact that, after 
graduation, young people do not automatically have $5,000 or 
$10,000 or $15,000 in their pockets to buy a tool kit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that a tool kit is required to perform their 
job. It is a job requirement. The garage owner will tell them “I 
am willing to give you a job, but you must bring your own tools”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that my bill, contrary to similar bills 
debated in this House since 1992, is a votable bill. I hope that 
that is evidence of a sincere commitment to this issue on the 
part of my colleagues. I thank the members of the committee for 
having given me the opportunity to plead in front of them and 
for having agreed to make the bill a votable item. This is good 
news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister regularly states that the members of his 
party are free to vote according to their conscience on private 
members' bills. There is no party line imposed by the 
government. Each member is free to vote for or against the bill, 
as he or she sees fit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate 
the member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans for 
this initiative and for his work on this very important subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill proposes that the Income Tax Act be 
amended to permit automobile mechanics to deduct the cost of 
tools they are required to provide as a condition of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deduction encompasses maintenance, rental and insurance 
costs, the full cost of tools under $250 and the capital cost of 
tools over $250.  This is a complex issue with many aspects that 
need to be examined carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In framing the issue, however, a number of tax policy principles 
must be kept in mind.  First, any tax policy change should be 
fair.  Second, changes should also be relatively simple to 
administer and enforce for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
and easy to comply with for taxpayers.  Third, any change should 
be consistent with the government's overall fiscal situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are not the only workers who have to incur 
considerable expenses as a condition of employment. It would be 
difficult to justify giving tax relief to mechanics and not to 
other taxpayers, as proposed in the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, other groups are also seeking tax relief for work 
related expenses.  Other expenditures for which tax recognition 
has been sought include personal computers purchased by 
employees, reading material, professional journals and other 
general costs associated with skills upgrading, business clothing 
and construction safety clothing, home office expenses, 
photographic equipment for staff photographers and tools for 
employee trade persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extending relief in all of these situations would be a major 
shift in policy and would be fiscally very expensive.  This is 
all the more difficult in view of the many other priority areas 
for tax reductions, given the overall level of personal income 
taxation that Canadians face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, one would need to ensure that any tax relief is 
targeted only for items required as a condition of employment and 
not for those purchased for personal use.  This would be 
difficult for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to administer 
and enforce and for taxpayers to comply with as many items, such 
as personal computers, provide a personal benefit even when they 
are required for work. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions that would have to be made to solve these 
problems would necessarily be complex since they would have to 
cover a wide variety of items which could be subject to tax 
relief as well as the various situations where these articles 
are used at work. To have an idea of the monumental task that 
would represent, one just has to think of the numerous 
provisions dealing with car expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions governing the deduction for equipment acquisition 
expenses by employees would apply to hundreds of different items 
and to a good number of occupations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill that is before the House today would 
also provide tax relief to all mechanics, irrespective of the 
size of their expenditures, instead of targeting relief to those 
incurring extraordinary expenses relative to their income.  For 
mechanics with employment expenses comparable to those incurred 
by other employees this would be unwarranted as tax relief for 
normal employment expenses is provided through the basic personal 
amount.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the complexities associated with providing tax recognition 
for specific employment expenses and the need to reduce the 
overall level of personal taxation that Canadians face, the 
government provided broad based tax relief in the last two 
budgets and will continue to do so in future budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. members present will agree with this approach 
and not support the private member's bill before us today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-205, in my view, is simply a matter of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician and an amateur mechanic, I have two interests in 
this.  I would like to compare what happened in my office when I 
became a young doctor setting up a practice.  I also have a 
profound interest in old cars so I have my own tools, for which I 
have spent a lot of money.  Because of my medical practice and my 
love of cars, I would like to rebut some of the things the member 
opposite has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I set up my practice as a young doctor I had significant 
expenses.  I bought electrocardiograph equipment.  I bought 
surgical equipment.  I set them up in my office.  Every single 
penny that I spent on those things was deductible as a practice 
expense.  It meant that the thousands of dollars that I had spent 
setting up my medical practice as a country surgeon was not an 
onerous burden for me personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said that I am a keen car enthusiast.  I purchased a 
significant number of mechanic tools, hobby tools and personal 
interest tools.  Those should in no way become deductible.  How 
about the young mechanic who just finishes school and sets 
himself up in his mechanic practice?  He generates a huge 
expense.  I have personal knowledge of some of the new equipment 
because it is equipment I could not afford. There is a 
significant expense in diagnostic equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bought those tools for my physician employment and I lost some 
of them and some wore out.  Sometimes new technology came along 
and I had to replace them.  Every single time that happened I got 
a personal deduction in my practice expenses.  What happens to 
the young mechanic?  If he loses a tool or has to upgrade his 
tools, or new technology comes along and his tools become 
obsolete, should he have credit for that?  In my view, it is a 
straight matter of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to someone say that it would be difficult for the 
department to figure out what was personal and what was bought 
for employment.  Obviously if I used a scalpel for hobby work 
that would not be for the practice of medicine.  If the 
department had trouble with this, it would be very simple for it 
to come to the mechanic's home or place of work and say “These 
tools are personal”, if all that is needed is to establish that 
they are in use for gainful employment and for making funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened to the incredible comment that there are other 
people calling for tax fairness in other areas.  Those things 
should be looked at on their merits.  Should construction safety 
equipment be brought under this regime?  Should computer use be 
brought under this regime?  Only if they are used for a specific 
generation of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those issues where I reflect back on the Liberals 
when they were in opposition.  One of their members put forward a 
private member's bill just like this one.  Who voted for it? The 
Liberals did.  Not so long ago my colleague from Lakeland brought 
forward just such a bill in private members' business which was 
supported by, guess who, Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a member of the Bloc.  What is going on here in 
terms of the partisan debate?  If this had merit when Liberals 
were sitting on this side of the House it has merit, plain and 
simple.  In my view, this is so meritorious that I cannot imagine 
that the member would stand up here and argue against it with a 
straight face.  If mechanics have significant expense for their 
tools, and they do, why not give them a deduction?  It is a 
straightforward deduction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave this issue for a second and talk about two other 
big problems with our tax system, one of which actually brought 
me to parliament.  The GST as it relates to medical practitioners 
is handled very poorly.  All other professionals who pay GST on 
their rent, supplies and equipment can use it as a deduction, but 
physicians and nurse practitioners cannot.  That is wrong.  The 
GST should be zero rated for those individuals, which is 
something I hope the government will also pay attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about fairness, and once again this is an issue of 
fairness.  If an accountant pays rent and pays GST on that rent, 
he gets a deduction.  If a physician pays rent, which every 
physician in private practice in Canada does, he or she pays the 
GST and does not get a deduction.  I want the member across to 
remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another issue that relates to the GST.  The GST is a big 
issue with Canadian auctioneers who auction off goods, such as 
art and antique vehicles.  An individual who purchases such an 
article has to pay GST on it but there is no way to get a 
deduction.  If the person resells that piece of property, then 
GST is paid on it again.  That is called a cascading of tax.  For 
used goods that are sold over and over at auctions there is a 
cascading of GST, which is wrong.  These are matters of straight 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the Bloc member on his initiative.  I congratulate him 
for bringing it forth again.  It is votable.  It will give us an 
opportunity to see if the Liberal members will vote the same way 
in government as they did in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the mechanics, I admit that this is a little lighthearted. 
For all those individuals who vote against the mechanics getting 
a deduction for their tools, which is not that big of an amount, 
maybe they should leave the spark plugs out of their vehicles so 
they cannot come here to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I also 
support Bill C-205 which would amend the Income Tax Act so that 
mechanics can deduct the cost of their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that bills similar to this have been brought forward by 
different parties over the past years and, at different times, 
supported by all the parties.  We now have an opportunity to vote 
on this.  If we all vote at the same time to support it, it would 
obviously pass.  Historically we have seen support for this bill 
and for the mechanics in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hardly fair to mechanics, who are self-employed or 
employed by someone else, to have to provide their own tools. 
That is the equalizing effect.  Whether they are running their 
own business or working for someone else, it is up to the 
mechanics to buy their own tools, and those tools are expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing I know, having many family members in the 
trades, they never dream of showing up to a job site without 
their own tool kit.  They also have to upgrade their tools and 
update their knowledge.  As machines become more sophisticated, 
the tools become more sophisticated and more expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, those living in the north may need industrial, 
high quality tools which are not easily available and are more 
expensive.  This adds more expense to the cost of people getting 
trades and going through their apprenticeships.  Apprentices do 
not make a lot of money because they must work for somebody else. 
They should be able to deduct the cost of their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness, as it is being distributed right now, is certainly in 
question.  The Liberal member who stood up made outright excuses 
for not supporting the bill.  He said that it should be fair, 
that it is complex, that it should be easy to comply with and 
that it should be consistent with the fiscal situation.  That is 
just putting up roadblocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, mechanics are facing a situation that is blatantly 
unfair.  What is wrong with treating someone fairly?  Is it that 
it would encourage other people to expect to be treated fairly? I 
do not think that is an adequate excuse for not supporting this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not an excuse to say that it would make a lot of work 
for the new Canada tax agency to treat Canadians fairly. Every 
Canadian deserves the right to be treated fairly.  When it comes 
to the cost of doing business and carrying out one's trade or 
profession, it should be treated equally.  The question should 
not be based on whether a person is in a trade or in a 
profession, or that somehow trades do not rank equally with other 
professions.  We should never entertain that sort of thought. 
Whether people are doctors, mechanics or carpenters, they should 
be eligible to deduct the cost of their tools to do their 
business in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is with bitterness that I rise this morning on Bill C-205. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not because of Bill C-205 that I am so bitter, so 
sad and so disappointed, it is because of the clarity bill, 
which we will be considering clause by clause in a few hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-205 leads me to talk about Bill C-20. Bill C-20 shows 
Quebecers, Canadians, the democratic world how low and arrogant 
the Liberal government has become and shows that it does not 
have the slightest respect for democracy. 
Its behaviour is shameful for all of us, members of the House, 
including you, Madam Speaker, who preside over the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself many questions: Where have they gone, the 
democratic values of the leader of the Liberal Party, the very 
little guy from Shawinigan? Where have they gone, the democratic 
principles of the brilliant university professor, the lackey of 
the very little guy from Shawinigan, the machiavellian member 
for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should we interpret the silence of the President of the 
Treasury Board, of the Minister of Finance, of the Minister of 
Public Works, of all the Liberal backbenchers on this assault on 
democracy? Are the advancement of the Liberal Party and the lust 
for power more important than democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not forgotten the Minister for International Trade, the 
hon. member for Papineau—Saint-Denis; every member knows that he 
makes himself scarce these days, since he is responsible for the 
HRDC scandal. What a courageous man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History will teach our children that the leaders of the Reform 
Party and of the New Democratic Party and the deputy House 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and all the members 
voting for C-20 have dealt democracy a dirty blow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that members of this House will weigh the benefits of 
Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment), in terms of democracy and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that mechanics generally have to 
provide most of the tools of their trade. You surely know how 
expensive these tools are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, a mechanic who is starting his career must invest at 
least $5,000 in various tools and, depending on his further 
training, this can reach over $40,000. The existing law is 
discriminatory for automotive mechanics. Indeed, a business can 
claim a capital cost allowance for the purchase of equipment, 
but auto mechanics cannot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is unfair because it permits chainsaw operators, 
musicians, artists and farmers to deduct the cost of their 
instruments and tools, but it does not let auto mechanics do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current act is dealing a serious blow to the profession of 
auto mechanic. Due to very high costs of buying tools, 
practically no young people are choosing this profession any 
more, which causes a shortage of auto mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill-205, sponsored by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, will permit 
mechanics to deduct the cost of providing tools for their 
employment if they are required to do so by the terms of the 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deduction will encompass the following: rental, 
maintenance and insurance costs, the full cost of tools under 
$250, and such inflation-adjusted limit as is set by regulation, 
and the capital cost allowance of tools over $250, set by 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the members' attention to the fact that the 
Commons finance committee had recommended, in its December 1997 
prebudget report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses. Special provisions in the Income Tax Act<I> 
</I>already apply to artists, musicians, chainsaw operators and 
farmers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to support this excellent amendment to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, at 
the beginning of my discourse I would like to seek unanimous 
consent to split my 10 minutes with the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have permission to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure 
today that I rise to speak to Bill C-205.  This legislation 
addresses the very important issue of tax deductibility for the 
tools of mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met and spoken with a number of people representing 
mechanics across the country.  As members of the House of Commons 
finance committee we have heard some very sound representations 
on behalf of these individuals.  The fact is that many of them 
have to invest between $15,000 and $40,000 initially as they 
enter this industry.  Every year their equipment needs 
replacement and updating, which is an ongoing expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that the average income of mechanics 
across Canada is about $29,000 per year.  It is very difficult 
for that industry to attract new people and to attract people 
with the skills and desire to succeed as mechanics with this kind 
of barrier to entry.  It is having a deleterious impact on the 
ability of the automobile industry to attract people to this 
important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially I had some concerns that this would further complicate 
an already too complicated tax code, but in many ways it 
simplifies the tax system because it equalizes the treatment of 
equipment necessary for one to do his or her job.  We heard other 
speakers this morning refer to the fact that other industries can 
claim tax deductibility on the equipment necessary to complete 
the job. 
This would equalize it to ensure that our mechanics have the same 
treatment.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a broad base of support from several national 
organizations.  As well, in 1996 and 1997 the House of Commons 
finance committee recommended that we move toward ensuring tax 
deductibility of the equipment or tools necessary for mechanics 
to do their jobs.  This is just part of the tax reform we should 
be seeing.  It is a very small but important part for the 
mechanics and the people they serve.  It is a step in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope in the upcoming budget to see a significant level of tax 
reform and tax reduction, no just tofu tax tinkering but some 
real red meat tax reform that will help benefit Canadians and 
provide them with a fairer, more progressive and innovative tax 
system to create more of a culture of opportunity in Canada. This 
would be a good place to start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I ask the member for Cumberland—Colchester to 
provide us with some of his erudite views as a former member of 
the Canadian automobile industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am certainly pleased to participate in this debate. As 
the last member said, I was directly involved in the car business 
for 18 years and probably another 5 years indirectly before that. 
I worked with mechanics for years and years.  I feel very close 
to this proposal and totally support it.  It is long past due and 
I hope all members will support it in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of unemployment in my area.  It has one of the 
highest rates of unemployment in Canada.  We have a group of 
people that want to work and train but are unable to do so 
because of the high cost of training and the high cost of getting 
into the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two problems that we could resolve with the bill.  It 
would be a tremendous incentive for people to go into the 
business.  It would help people to get off unemployment.  Any 
cost that the government would incur in lost revenue would be 
more than made up in unpaid employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched the car business completely change over the last 
15 years.  At one point people would come into the business if 
they could fix a carburettor or a distributor, adjust points or 
change them or the wires, and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carburettors are not in existence any more.  It is all 
electronic fuel injection.  Distributors are not distributors 
with points and rotors.  They are electronic ignitions. 
Transmissions, which used to be so simple to work on, are now 
very complicated because they are electronic and interrelated 
with onboard computers and everything else.  Brakes used to be 
the most simple thing. Almost anybody could change them.  They 
are no longer simple because they have sensors involved with the 
ABS or anti-lock brake and traction lock systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the exhaust systems are different.  Anybody used to be able 
to change a muffler and a tailpipe.  They cannot do it any more. 
They need special tools and training because the exhaust is an 
integral part of the pollution system in a car.   As cars change 
with new fuels, new standards and everything else, mechanics will 
have to change.  All the tools they have will be obsolete even 
though they have spent $10,000 to $20,000 to purchase the tools 
and were unable to write them off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all kinds of industries and professions people from musicians 
to plumbers can write off the tools and equipment they use in 
their businesses.  It makes absolutely no sense that mechanics 
cannot write off their tools.  It is an absolute necessity. 
Mechanics need these tools.  They need to upgrade them almost 
weekly.  They cannot take them home.  They are not a luxury. They 
are an absolute necessity to earn their money.  I applaud the 
member for bringing forth the bill, and I totally support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I hope all members of parliament will support the 
bill and vote in favour of it.  It is a wrong that needs to be 
righted.  It has been wrong for a long time.  I urge the minister 
to act quickly to implement the proposal when the bill passes.

listened with great interest to what my colleague, the member

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, and in the opinion of other members of the House, 
the idea behind this bill compels us to look for the best way to 
reduce the tax burden of our citizens.  Everyone agrees that the 
tax burden is too heavy. The question is: What is the best way 
to reduce it? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary said in his remarks, when one 
examines the question of what is the best way to reduce the tax 
burden on our citizens we always have to choose.  I was a little 
surprised by the remarks of the hon. member for Kings—Hants. 
Usually one looks to him for some sort of knowledge in these 
matters.  He is on the finance committee and speaks regularly on 
finance matters in the House.  I would have thought that he and 
other members of the House would recognize the wisdom of the 
words of the parliamentary secretary when he pointed out, if I 
can put it in a colloquial way, “You can't have your cake and 
eat it too”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot reduce tax burdens sectorally in individual areas and 
at the same time say we want broad based tax relief as well. The 
consequence of a continued sectoral approach is one of tax 
expenditure.  This will be followed by demands and important 
requests, as the parliamentary secretary pointed out reasonable 
requests for those who are artists, for those who are working on 
computers and for others to have reasonable deductions made for 
them in the name of tax equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equity is what we seek to achieve in the House, but it seems to 
me that the real equity we are seeking to achieve at this time 
when we are discussing taxes is equity in terms of a broad based 
tax relief.  That is what the government has been seeking to 
achieve with tremendous difficulty since our first mandate in 
1993 in bringing huge budget deficits under control and having 
broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have managed to achieve a balanced budget.  As a result in 
1998 we were able to take 400,000 people off the tax rolls.  That 
seems to me most important.  From 1998-99 we perhaps got 600,000 
Canadians off the tax rolls with a total of $16.5 billion in tax 
relief spoken to in the last budget, without thinking of what is 
ahead in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard about the issue of the mechanics.  I sympathize a 
great deal with it and with other sectors that also have certain 
tools for which they should have relief.  I talked with a single 
woman in my riding during the last election.  She earned $21,000 
a year.  She had two children to raise in downtown Toronto. She 
did not have any professional tools for which she could seek 
relief.  In my view she should not be on the tax rolls when we 
look at the type of problems of a person like that living in our 
downtown communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at broad based tax relief.  We have to look at 
moving the middle class, lifting its general levels and making it 
available to all Canadians.  This must be our first priority 
before we turn to specific issues in specific sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government has been doing.  We have managed to 
balance the budget.  We have kept our obligations to increase our 
social policies.  We have used the tax system to help those in 
need through the child tax benefit and we have been reducing the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this is what we have to do.  We must keep all 
priorities in view and not single out one group.  In the future 
we will see this done.  We have heard that the minister intends 
to have further measures designed to move more lower income 
people off the tax rolls; to increase the tax brackets so that 
the burden will not be so heavy on those who are in the middle 
class; to gradually approach the surtax issue; and to deal with 
the issue of capital gains, which addresses the question of 
productivity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, when he describes 
the problems faced by mechanics.  However, we need to strike a 
balance. There must be some investments in garages if we want 
mechanics to be employed.  The idea is that we have to look for 
the right balance in the system.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking for my constituents in Toronto Centre—Rosedale, I 
think that they are looking for that balance.  They want a system 
which alleviates the burden on those less able to pay, yet 
encourages entrepreneurship and creates a dynamic economy of 
benefit to all citizens.  I dare say that we have proven the 
qualities of this approach by the government.  We have gotten the 
economy back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is at its lowest rate ever.  That was not achieved 
by looking at sectoral issues; it was achieved by having a broad 
based and balanced approach for all Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the people of my riding want?  They want to see a 
continuation of those policies, whether they be mechanics, 
artists, theatre employees, lawyers or doctors, all of whom have 
special needs in their professions, in their work, or in other 
ways in which they carry on, benefit and create economic benefits 
for the country.  Ultimately what they want is a better system 
for everyone.  They want to bring the general tax level down in a 
way that will benefit all of society.  That is the present policy 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I congratulate the member for bringing forward the bill 
and while I recognize the merits of the comments of each of the 
members from the opposition who have spoken to the bill and the 
needs of mechanics, I believe in my heart that the mechanics and 
all other citizens who might make an equal claim for this form of 
personal tax relief directed to themselves would say that it is 
better that the general tax burden come down, that we address it 
in a way which guarantees a balanced economy such that all 
participate, that we create a sense of entrepreneurship and 
fairness in the system so that all sectors benefit and that we do 
not concentrate on one specific area in a way which would, as the 
parliamentary secretary wisely pointed out to us, create tax 
inequities, because it would create a need for certain types of 
supervision.  It would create a sense where one person would say, 
“Why are they able to deduct that?  Why cannot I deduct my dress 
which I bought for my work on television?  Why cannot I deduct 
this because I am an artist?  Why cannot I deduct that?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us concentrate on the main issue which is before us.  Let us 
concentrate on bringing down the general tax rolls, on bringing 
down the burden for all Canadians.  I am confident that is what 
we will hear from the Minister of Finance when he speaks to the 
budget in the House at the end of this month.  We will hear that 
balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business of the governing of the country requires focusing 
on the debt, the general tax burden and the needs of the economy, 
which must be dynamic, which must grow and benefit all for the 
benefit of all Canadians.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA ELECTIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 7, 1999, consideration of Bill 
C-2, an act respecting the election of members to the House of 
Commons, repealing other acts relating to elections and making 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee, and of Group No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
are debating the amendments in Group No. 2 to Bill C-2, which 
will revise the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Group No. 2 amendments include one from Reform which would 
alter the completely illogical 50 candidate rule for parties to 
have their name on the ballot down to 12 candidates.  In other 
words, a party that would have 12 candidates running in a general 
election would be entitled to have its party name on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That whole issue is the subject of a court challenge.  The 
communist party of Canada won its challenge to the previous 
elections act.  The court ruled that two members constitute a 
party, but during the committee proceedings, in my discussions 
with individuals from the small parties who appeared as 
witnesses, they all agreed that 12 was a logical number that 
represents what is recognized as a party in the House.  They 
agreed that 12 would be logical. 
Unfortunately the minister refuses to accept that as a 
satisfactory compromise.  He is pursuing this ridiculous 50 
candidate rule, which will be struck down again by the courts.  I 
just do not understand why he is doing it.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bigger issue in the bill which also has the potential 
to be struck down by the courts because of a ruling in B.C. 
during the last few days.  Last Thursday the Pacific Press 
announced the decision against the Attorney General of British 
Columbia in the Supreme Court of British Columbia concerning the 
British Columbia elections act.  The British Columbia elections 
act had a gag law in it, the same way that this elections act has 
a gag law, to prevent third parties from spending money over a 
certain limit during election campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read some of the details of the ruling from the B.C. 
court because that ruling really relates to this bill.  I think 
what is happening is that the minister's bill is imploding at the 
moment, based on this court ruling, and he really should hoist it 
right out of here and send it back to committee to have it 
consider what came out of the B.C. supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the court criticizes the Libman decision upon which 
the minister based his entire case for having the gag law built 
into the elections act.  The minister said that Libman had ruled 
that it was reasonable to have spending limits on third parties. 
However, let me read into the record what the British Columbia 
court decided.  It was pointed out in evidence to the court that 
Professor Richard Johnston, who is a professor of political 
science at the University of British Columbia, gave evidence that 
there have only been three studies done in Canada on the effects 
of third party advertising, two by himself and one by Tanguay and 
Kay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to go into the details of each of the studies, 
but suffice it to say that Mr. Johnston's initial report of his 
findings indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1990 Professor Johnston published a paper entitled 
“The Volume and Impact of Third Party Advertising in the 1998 
Election”.  In that paper he posited that third party 
advertising might have helped the Conservative recovery during 
the 1988 federal election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was used as the basis for the Lortie commission report and 
that was used as evidence before the supreme court judges in the 
case of Libman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the Libman case, in 1992 Professor Johnston 
and his colleagues published a book called <I>Letting the People 
Decide</I>.  As a result of additional study of the data from his 
original study, his conclusion was that it is now his opinion 
that third party advertising had no net effect on voter 
intentions over the course of the 1988 federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means is that the evidence presented to the Supreme 
Court of Canada in the Libman case was badly flawed, and that was 
confirmed by the judge in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, 
the hon. Mr. Justice Brenner, when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in these reasons I have traced the factual chronology 
surrounding Professor Johnston's 1990 paper on the 1988 federal 
election and his subsequent book, <I>Letting the People 
Decide</I>. I have outlined how he reached different conclusions 
with respect to the effect of third party advertising.  I also 
set out the manner in which Professor Johnston's initial paper 
was relied upon by the Lortie Commission which was, in turn, 
relied upon by the courts in Libman... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the conclusions of the Lortie Commission on this 
issue can no longer be said to be based on empirical findings. 
And of course Professor Johnston's later study in <I>Letting the 
People Decide</I> was not available to the court in Libman. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in Libman the pressing and substantial objective 
relied on by the government was not challenged by the plaintiff. 
Finally, the conclusions in Libman on the issue of pressing and 
substantial objective are a product of the evidence or its lack 
thereof in that case and cannot be dispositive of any evidentiary 
issue in the case at bar.  Accordingly, I conclude that Libman is 
not dispositive of the issues in the case before me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that really means, to sort out the legalise, is that if 
Bill C-2 passes in its present form it will be challenged in 
court by the National Citizens' Coalition and by the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation.  Both groups have said that they have more 
than enough funding to take it all the way to the Supreme Court 
of Canada. 
The minister must know that he will lose based on the evidence. 
There are now three high courts which have ruled that these gag 
laws are unconstitutional and there is no basis for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other things which was struck down in the B.C. case 
was any restriction on the publication of the results of polls. 
During the committee hearings on Bill C-2 newspaper people 
appeared before the committee and I asked them whether the 
government had ever approached them to discuss or to try to reach 
some sort of compromise on the publication of poll results during 
an election campaign.  They indicated that the government had 
never approached them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that committee hearing—and the records of that committee 
hearing show this is the case—I had a discussion and reached a 
compromise where the polls could be printed right up until the 
time of the election, but the methodology would have to be 
printed along with them.  That was agreed to.  But the minister 
refused to accept that compromise.  As a result, I have to tell 
him the bad news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Pacific Press continued with its case, the B.C. 
supreme court concluded that there is no place whatsoever for any 
restriction on polling.  There are no restrictions on the 
publication of the results and no restrictions or requirements 
with respect to the publication of methodology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the whole thing has been thrown wide open and 
there is no compromise.  There is no methodology to be printed 
and the newspapers are free to print polls right up until the 
time of the election without indicating how they conducted those 
polls or from where they got the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the mess to which the minister has brought us.  There 
are three separate court challenges of this bill.  The 50 
candidate rule is illogical and ridiculous.  We could have had a 
compromise reached with all of the parties concerned that would 
have been 12; not the same as the court concluded at 2, but it 
would have been logical and accepted by everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gag law provisions in the British Columbia Elections Act, 
which are basically the same as the gag law provisions in this 
bill, have been struck down.  It is obvious that this bill has no 
chance of remaining in place if it is challenged by the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation and the National Citizens' Coalition.  All 
of the polling restrictions have been struck down.  If the 
minister had sat down with the parties concerned and reached some 
sort of compromise we would not be facing this situation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of the government.  We see it time after time 
after time in bills it brings before the House.  It has no 
consultation with the affected parties.  It rams things down the 
throats of the people of this country and it ends up in court, 
having its restrictions cut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak a little further on what the B.C. supreme 
court said.  It made the point that in order to override charter 
rights—we are talking about freedom of expression, freedom of 
speech in the sense of an election campaign—it is necessary that 
there be more than a general hypothetical concern about a problem 
when there is no evidence to demonstrate that it has existed in 
the past or is likely to exist in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge found, based on all of the expert evidence provided at 
that court case, that there was no evidence whatsoever that third 
party advertising was the least bit harmful to an election 
campaign.  In fact, the judge concluded that from the lesson of 
the Charlottetown referendum it is exactly to the contrary, that 
there is a strong argument in favour of third party advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quoting from the judgment of the hon. Judge Brenner concerning 
the Charlottetown referendum, there are certain circumstances in 
which the goal of fairness in elections would support an argument 
for third party advertising.  The Charlottetown referendum 
provides an example.  If in a future election campaign in British 
Columbia all of the political parties were to agree on a 
significant policy point, the lack of an effective third party 
advertising campaign would be a detriment to the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling is 88 pages long.  I wish I could read more of it 
into the record.  The minister must have seen it.  He knows he is 
going to lose this case.  Why will he not withdraw the bill, send 
it back to committee and let us have another look at it?

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the content of this bill has been outlined by the 
previous speaker who has followed this bill very closely at the 
committee stage and here in the Chamber. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was sent to the committee for review and my colleague, 
the member for Chicoutimi, our whip, has worked very hard for 
the Progressive-Conservative Party, the riding of Chicoutimi and 
all of the country. This bill is very important, and our party 
wants to improve it as much as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I spoke to the bill at second reading, the member for 
Chicoutimi is the individual who has followed it throughout the 
committee stage.  He has spoken to the bill in the House on 
numerous occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were looking forward to working co-operatively in the 
committee with the government.  All opposition parties took an 
active part in proposing changes to this piece of legislation. 
Early on it was painfully obvious that the Liberal members of the 
committee had been advised to bulldoze this through.  This 
exercise was meant to eliminate any real attempts to improve the 
bill.  From witnesses to clause by clause it was a race to the 
finish line.  It was expediency at the cost of efficiency and at 
the cost of actually improving the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party had three substantial and substantive 
problems with the legislation from the very beginning.  For the 
record, none of them was even mildly addressed by the Liberal 
dominated committee.  There were problems stemming from elections 
finance, publication of opinion polls and third party spending. 
I will speak to those in some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to election and party finance, the Conservative 
Party has definite reservations concerning the extent of the 
changes to the reporting requirements for candidates and 
political parties.  At the very least there appears to be no 
compelling reason why the changes could not simply come into 
effect on a going forward basis only.  Most parties obviously 
will not have the resources of the governing party to spend on 
new administrative tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opinion is very similar with respect to the proposed 
controls on the publication of opinion polls contained in the 
bill.  In the 1993 amendments there was no attempt to regulate 
the publication of opinion polls beyond the brief blackout period 
at the end of the election. Trying to achieve the right balance 
in terms of the blackout of opinion polls was probably next to 
impossible in light of the supreme court's decision in the 
Southam case. Therefore we thought this matter should have been 
dropped altogether.  Instead, the bill goes much further and 
attempts to regulate the reporting of opinion polls and their 
results even outside the blackout period. It goes far too far and 
cannot be supported for that reason alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of third party spending, we are opposed to part 17 
of the bill almost in its entirety with respect to the regulation 
of third party groups and the limitation on third party 
advertising.  We believe that the provisions are too broad, 
unworkable, unnecessary and very possibly unconstitutional.  I am 
surprised that the government with its record of constitutional 
constipation would even go down this road. We have seen 
constantly from the government and particularly the justice 
department, efforts to tie itself in knots in order to avoid any 
sort of constitutional challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our key concern was the issue of advocacy.  By no means is this 
an issue of the rich maintaining access to the system.  It is 
quite possible that these new controls may affect smaller groups 
in a much more detrimental fashion.  There were no attempts to 
regulate the general issue of advocacy in the 1993 amendments and 
there still should not be.  Such detailed regulation of interest 
groups by Elections Canada is unwarranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notably, it appears that the government itself would be able to 
spend unlimited amounts of money on issue advertising during an 
election giving a very much competitive and unfair advantage to 
the governing party.  As a result of this legislation there would 
be no provision to address government or crown corporations 
during an election.  This is a definite loophole, one which I 
fear the governing party would exploit to its own unfair 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be known that the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada continues to have other reservations about Bill C-2.  The 
bill's restriction, regulation and limitation on participation in 
the democratic process by those other than political parties and 
candidates is unwarranted, cumbersome and far too broad.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of the restrictions controlling the reporting 
of opinion polls.  Similar restrictions have been tried and they 
do not seem to work. For that reason they cannot be justified or 
proven and they should be scrapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously stated, without significant amendments, the bill 
is not an improvement over the current Canada Elections Act. Even 
the government's modest stated goal of making election law easier 
to read and understand is not met.  Again far too often the 
government comes back with legislation that is more cumbersome, 
more lengthy, full of loopholes and more bureaucratic red tape 
than the legislation it was seeking to replace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious example which comes to mind is the new youth 
criminal justice act.  Although the intent is very much the right 
one and the direction is very much one which I think most 
Canadians would embrace, the legislation is thick, cumbersome and 
wordy. We should be attempting to streamline legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example which an old farmer gave to me back home is that when 
we reshingle a house, we take the old shingles off.  We do not 
just put more shingles on top. We should be trying to strip down 
some of the existing legislation, or at least have something in 
place that says if we put a new bill in, we take another bill 
out. This is not accomplished by the bill that is before us now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very fundamentally and importantly, the Conservative Party 
believes that the entire process that was undertaken to revise 
the elections act was flawed at the very premise.  The government 
should have tried to proceed by all party agreement. At the very 
least it should have attempted and allowed for adequate time for 
proper consultation on the provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, as we have seen time and time again, provisions were 
rammed through at the convenience and the wishes of the governing 
party to run roughshod over the opposition. Perhaps it was the 
Prime Minister himself who was behind this legislation, or the 
government House leader. The process to amend electoral 
legislation should not have to be adhered to on a very strict 
timetable based on the leadership rumblings of the governing 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to find the relevancy in having Bill C-2 dubbed as 
priority legislation.  There are so many other issues on the 
agenda.  So many dominant issues need attention and the Liberal 
government persists in ramming this piece of legislation through 
the House, further weakening democracy I would suggest by 
demonstrating its ability to do so.  It is not an attempt to 
strengthen legislation as it would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when so many other issues are screaming for attention 
the government once against puts its own personal political 
agenda ahead of the needs of Canadians.  Nobody will dispute that 
Canada has one of the strongest democracies in the world, so it 
begs the question, why are we doing this in such an undemocratic 
fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis in health care, the HRDC boondoggle, high taxes; 
these are all issues that need the attention not only of the 
House but of Canadians generally.  However, the government 
continues to fall short in addressing the issues that matter most 
to Canadians.  Its priorities are obviously skewed and quite 
different from those of the people on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this legislation was rammed through committee at such 
record speed that opposition parties had insufficient time to 
study the bill, propose reasoned and specific amendments or 
consult with individuals such as volunteers, poll captains and 
those who are most involved at election time and those who will 
be most affected by this new legislation. Nevertheless the 
Conservative Party did submit amendments and we were successful 
in having five of them pass.  On balance, without significant 
amendments, this bill is not an improvement over the existing 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Conservative Party truly believes that any 
changes to the elections act should have been done in a 
reflective and thoughtful way.  Input from all parties 
represented in the House would have resulted in a much more 
reasoned and much more effective final product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end I suggest that the bill could have had the support of 
all members of parliament.  It could have unanimously passed and 
we would have seen significant improvements perhaps in our 
electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the election law should not reflect simply the 
interests of the governing party.  Obviously that was not the 
case in the beginning and it should not be the case when this 
bill is passed. For those reasons and others I have referred to 
in my remarks, the Conservative Party will be opposing the 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-2, an act respecting the election of 
members to the House of Commons, repealing other Acts relating 
to elections and making consequential amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was read for the first time on October 14, 1999. After 
second reading, it was referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. The bill is back in the House today 
at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in the parliamentary process, one concludes from 
reading the report that the review by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs was not very fruitful, since what 
the government talked about initially was an in-depth reform. Let 
us take a closer look at what has been accomplished and at some 
of the reasons the Bloc Quebecois will not be voting in favour 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Government in the House wants this bill passed 
at third reading as quickly as possible, even if it means 
imposing another gag order, something that has become the 
trademark of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logic of the Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons must be clearly understood. 
Once the bill has received royal assent, the chief electoral 
officer will need at least six months to implement it. And, 
since the Liberals think this bill favours them more than the 
current legislation does, they would very much like to use it 
for the next general elections. Accordingly, it must come into 
force as soon as possible, thus allowing the Prime Minister to 
call if need be early elections, which some might consider 
premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee met about 15 times and heard over 30 witnesses, in 
studying the proposed amendments to improve the bill and to 
bring about an in-depth reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all that, one has to conclude that the government may 
have made a few cosmetic changes but has completely failed to 
make the in-depth reform it had indicated it wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government missed a wonderful opportunity to give more 
transparency to campaign funds by reviewing the rules governing 
the financing of political parties by corporations, in order to 
limit their contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the bank lobby contributed $815,000 to the federal 
political parties and, out of this amount, $400,000 was given to 
the Liberals. How can one think that, by adopting a $5,000 limit 
on corporate contributions, the Bloc Quebecois has given up its 
principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also have been essential to amend paragraph 428(2) 
concerning trust funds belonging to registered parties. The 
transparency here leaves much to be desired. I will remind 
members of what Allan Taylor, the former president of the Royal 
Bank of Canada, said during a speech on February 26, 1991, and I 
quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—financing of political parties by businesses did not encourage 
democratization and public participation in politics. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also missed a wonderful opportunity to review the 
process of appointing election officers.  When what is involved 
is implementation of the legislation on which the democratic 
system of the country is based, the process must be above all 
suspicion and there must be the greatest possible transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October 28, when Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre 
Kingsley appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, he said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go out on the international scene I do not recommend that 
the Canadian system be emulated where it comes to the 
appointment of returning officers. I clearly indicate, as I do 
in Canada, that the present system is an anachronism. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kingsley feels it is imperative for the method of appointing 
returning officers to be changed, so that they are appointed in 
a competitive process in order to ensure their total 
independence from the government and to give the appearance of 
fairness and neutrality toward all party candidates involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Former Chief Electoral Officer for Quebec Pierre F. Côté, 
when he appeared before that same committee on November 16, 
1999, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democratic system, not only must democracy be served, it 
must also appear that democracy has been served. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, volume I of the report by the Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and Party Financing, better known as the Lortie 
Commission, in addressing the need for independence of election 
officers reaches the same conclusion on page 483: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of public confidence in any democratic system of 
representative government is an electoral process that is 
administered efficiently and an electoral law that is enforced 
impartially.  Securing public trust requires that election 
officials responsible for administration and enforcement be 
independent of the government of the day and not subject to 
partisan influence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it would have been better for these persons to be chosen 
following a competition establishing that they have the 
necessary expertise to assume these functions instead of being 
chosen because of their affiliation to the political party in 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois proposed amendments to put an end to the 
control that the governor in council has over the appointment of 
these people, but the government rejected them. I am forced 
therefore to acknowledge that Bill C-2 does not contribute to 
promoting the democratization of the electoral process. On the 
contrary, the governor in council retains unacceptable power 
over the selection of election officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At report stage, we moved two amendments to clauses 13 and 14 so 
that at least the appointment of the Chief Electoral Officer, 
the person responsible the application of the Elections Act, 
would be done differently to reduce government control of over 
this appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object is to ensure that the Chief Electoral Officer is 
appointed with the support of at least the majority of the 
opposition members. So, we propose that the Chief Electoral 
Officer be appointed by a resolution of the House of Commons 
approved by the opposition parties and not simply by the party 
in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, who was 
one of the biggest organizers of the love-in in Montreal a few 
days before the 1995 referendum, should know that love is a 
two-way street and that actions speak louder than words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government had the opportunity to follow 
the lead of Quebec, which has put in place a system of public 
competitions for the appointment of the main electoral officers. 
But no. 
For the French Power, what matters is to badmouth Quebecers to 
gain popularity across Canada. Quebec French Power in Ottawa 
will never acknowledge what the Quebec government does right. It 
would mean lose its legitimacy and becoming suspect in the rest 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants a democratic and transparent federal 
elections act. It wants an act without any appearance of 
conflict of interest. Once again I am very disappointed in the 
government. What has become of the Liberals? Where are their 
integrity, their honesty, their keen sense of democracy? Why 
should we stay in a country whose government has only one goal: 
to stay in power no matter what and at any cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not have our own country, a country promoting at 
least four values that no longer prevail on Parliament Hill, 
namely honour, transparency, democracy and, above all, respect 
for the citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the government missed a great opportunity to deal with the 
issue of voters identification. When the bill was before the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the Bloc 
Quebecois asked for a voters identification process to be 
included in the legislation. The main reason for such a process 
being to prevent individuals from usurping someone else's voting 
right. Once again, the government denied our request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give the devil his due. 
The government made some changes to the transitional provisions 
to give political parties more time before the new rules apply 
in case the bill would come into force after June 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, when an amendment favours the Liberal Party, the 
government House leader does not hesitate to act quickly. But 
when we are talking about an amendment to foster transparency, 
democracy and the respect of citizens, the government House 
leader remains adamantly opposed to it. He finds all kinds of 
excuses to turn down the changes we would like to see, putting 
them off till hell freezes over or until the 12th of never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are many more reasons why we should work hard to promote 
Quebec's sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to have an opportunity to 
participate in the debate on the report stage of Bill C-2.  Some 
very major changes have been made to the Canada Elections Act, 
but this is the first major overhaul of the act since 1970. There 
have been changes over the years based on various court decisions 
and so on, but this is the first opportunity we have had to 
modernize the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some very notable improvements have been made to the act, but I 
do not have to list them because they are essentially well known 
now by most members of the House.  However there have been a 
number of real missed opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the top of the list of missed opportunities is one that 
perplexes me as we hear the rhetoric from all political parties 
about the value of today's young people, the need to involve more 
young people in the election campaigns of the various political 
parties, the need for young people to be more involved in the 
electoral process, and the need for young people to be paying 
more attention to the process of government and the process of 
politics in Canada.  Yet when the proposal comes forward to 
involve young people, particularly at an age when there is 
significant interest in becoming involved, the answer is no, a 
blatant and clear no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about this point.  Other countries, and I will use 
Brazil as an example, lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 a 
number of years ago.  The question was whether people of 16 and 
17 years of age would be interested in politics and the electoral 
process and whether they would join political parties and 
campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence in Brazil was very clear.  Given the opportunity, 
16 and 17 year olds participated in the electoral process in 
greater numbers on a percentage basis than did their parents or 
anyone else.  When the offer went out to young people asking if 
they were interested in politics and in joining in the electoral 
process, the overwhelming response was a resounding yes.  They 
wanted to get involved.  They were anxious and interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young people in Brazil want to get involved and young people 
in Nicaragua want to get involved, and I could list all sorts of 
other countries, why not send out an opportunity for young people 
in Canada to get involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that a proposal went out to lower the voting age 
from 18 to 16 as part of this legislation.  There was some debate 
but overall people questioned whether 16 year olds had the 
intelligence, the knowledge and the understanding of politics to 
cast a serious ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a terrible comment to make against young people of the 
country.  I suspect it is the same argument that was made against 
women years back in terms of whether they had the understanding 
and the intelligence to participate in the electoral process.  We 
know now how embarrassing it is to even raise this as an issue. 
It seems as absolutely stupid and silly as of course it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago the issue was with first nations people.  Up 
until 1960 we said that first nations people were not allowed to 
vote.  They could volunteer and die in World War I.  They could 
volunteer and die in World War II.  They could volunteer and die 
in Korea but they could not vote in this country.  They fought 
for democracy.  They died for democracy.  However, the minute 
first nations people came home from those wars we said that they 
could not vote, that they could not participate in democracy in 
their own country.  Let us imagine the signal that sent to first 
nations peoples across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect we are sending a similar signal today.  Young people 
who want to participate are not allowed to when it comes to 
voting.  Yes, they can choose leaders of our political parties. 
Yes, they can participate in campaigns.  They can do anything 
else they want in the political process but the one thing they 
cannot do if they are aged 16 and 17 is vote.  This is 
disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the age of 16 a whole number of things occur in people's 
lives.  They can get a driver's licence and drive a truck or a 
high powered vehicle on our highways.  They can join the armed 
forces and serve in Bosnia and other areas of combat. 
They can get married and raise children.  They can qualify for 
employment insurance.  They can be tried in adult court.  However 
they cannot vote in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are 16 or 17 and want to vote to choose the people who 
will represent them and future generations they cannot 
participate.  The people who have the most to win or lose in an 
election cannot participate.  This is one of those ideal 
opportunities for the House of Commons to acknowledge it, to send 
out a welcoming hand to young people who want to participate and 
to give them a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying everyone has to do so.  Perhaps the people who 
are listening to this speech could reflect back on the election 
campaigns of members of parliament and candidates that they 
worked on.  They went to local high schools to participate in 
debates and discussions.  In my experience the level of 
discussion, participation, knowledge and understanding of those 
young people was significantly greater than that of their 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the evening meetings—and God knows if they are a road show 
or some sort of political theatre—very seldom is there 
intelligent, sensible, meaningful debate like there is in high 
schools.  Young people are keen and knowledgeable.  They are far 
more knowledgeable than we were as young people.  They have 
access to information and knowledge.  Their teachers are much 
more open than ours were to discuss in classrooms the role of 
government and politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not extend a welcoming and open hand to young people across 
the country?  However the government decided that this was not 
appropriate.  I have a heavy heart when I have to say that.  I 
thought the government would say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering the new millennium, the 21st century, a century 
that represents changes of all sorts in terms of demographics, 
the economy, society and the way we debate budgets in the House. 
Everything is changing except this aspect of keeping young people 
pushed down and not permitted to participate in federal 
elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that we were not able to accomplish it, 
but I will not give up.  One day we will look back and think how 
stupid we were as a country for not allowing young people of 16 
and 17 years of age to vote.  One day we will do that but we are 
not quite there yet.  We will not give up the effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to mention another missed opportunity, the whole issue of 
voting through proportional representation.  Our voting system is 
rather goofy.  When a small number of Canadians choose the 
government that acts in a sense as an elected dictator for five 
years, is that the way the system should operate?  No.  I am not 
saying this is the fault of the Liberals.  Of course it is not. 
It takes place in provincial jurisdictions and so on.  It is our 
collective way of the first past the post approach to electing 
government.  It is absolutely bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at intelligent countries around the world.  We would 
be hard pressed to find a country that has a system like ours. 
Their systems are much more reflective of the population's wish 
as to who should represent them.  This place does not represent 
what people said in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, in the last election the majority of 
Canadians did not say they wanted half the House plus a few more 
filled with Liberals.  That is the way it turned out but that is 
not what the people said.  We have should looked at some other 
form of choosing members of parliament that actually reflected 
what Canadians say when they cast a ballot.  That was a missed 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made a number of amendments to the whole issue of campaign 
reform which basically said that more access should be allowed to 
smaller political parties to more accurately reflect what people 
in our country are thinking about.  We should ask for disclosure 
on spending limits on party leadership elections.  Let us face 
it. If somebody buys the leadership of a political party, should 
people not know about it as opposed to being elected in a fair 
and open democratic process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about numbered companies?  We have to do something about 
numbered companies.  When number company 12754 makes a huge 
contribution to a political party, should we not know who is 
behind the particular firm?  Of course we should. 
Let us get these numbered companies back on the transparency 
pathway so we know that when somebody makes a political 
contribution to a political party or an individual in our 
country, we know who is actually making that contribution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-2, the 
Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important legislation.  In fact, there are probably 
few pieces of legislation more important in a democracy than that 
which establishes the rules for election of the people's 
representatives to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such an important piece of legislation it is significant 
that the government decided to direct its passage through 
parliament by way of the more unorthodox method of proceeding 
directly to committee before second reading. The government 
indicated that it wished the committee to thoroughly study this 
legislation, to call witnesses, to hear concerns, propose 
significant amendments and return it to the House in a more 
complete and acceptable form.  I suppose that sounded good, but 
once again the government merely went through the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard major concerns.  Significant changes were 
proposed.  The committee did not listen.  It returned the bill in 
essentially the same format in which it was received.  Once again 
we are faced with legislation which leads us to believe it will 
be subject to a charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from various individuals about the 
unconstitutionality of third party spending limits in the bill. 
Powerful groups have threatened court challenges.  There has been 
little, if any, attempt to work out the differences.  Once again 
the taxpayer will pay for these court challenges because the 
government is not ready to do the necessary work to bring about 
resolution and agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending limits definitely favour the party in power.  All other 
parties are operating on unequal footing.  We all know that the 
amount of money spent on campaigns is not always a deciding 
factor but we also know that it can play a significant role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard a number of concerns over the publication 
blackout period provisions in this legislation.  The courts have 
struck down previous similar legislation, but the government is 
proceeding down the same path once again without even attempting 
to come to a compromise with media representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief Elections Officer of Ontario has challenged the need 
for blackout provisions.  He has pointed out the difficulties in 
enforcing them.  Constitutional law experts have indicated that 
our courts will again strike down these provisions.  Once again 
the taxpayers will pay for these court cases and really, for 
what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard a number of concerns over the 50 candidate 
rule for registered party status.  The courts have struck down 
this 50 candidate rule as being too oppressive.  The courts have 
suggested that as little as two candidates should be sufficient 
to be recognized as a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was discussion of coming to a consensus and agreeing on a 
more practical limit of 12 candidates to be recognized as a 
registered political party.  Instead of even considering 
compromise and agreement, the minister seems intent on 
maintaining the 50 candidate rule.  Once again this is another 
provision of this legislation that is subject to a court 
challenge.  Once again the taxpayer will be expected to pay for 
the government's refusal to consult, to consider change and to 
compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems intent on limiting the opportunity for new 
parties to grow from small beginnings.  The government is 
perfectly content to maintain the status quo.  The citizens of 
Canada are being deprived of new political initiatives and new 
choices.  Just as with recent moves with the airline industry, it 
seems to be all in favour of limiting competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the issue of political patronage appointments.  In 
something so crucial to a democracy of a country, one would 
expect that the presiding government should have little 
involvement in the selection of the personnel who run the 
electoral organizations.  In fact, Canada has often been asked to 
assist third world countries to supervise and report on elections 
to ensure that the presiding government operates in a free, fair 
and open manner.  Surely the presence of political appointees 
within the very organization tasked with counting the votes and 
reporting on the results should be independent of the presiding 
power in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even our Chief Electoral Officer testified that it is critical 
that he be given the power to hire returning officers based on 
merit.  If he is given the responsibility to properly operate our 
election process, he must be provided with personnel chosen by 
him, supervised by him and paid by him.  Political appointments 
are not beholden to him. 
They owe their allegiance to the governor in council, the Prime 
Minister and the party in power who put them into their positions 
and who decide on their remuneration.  That is not right. One of 
the interested parties to an election cannot have control over 
the employees who control the counting of votes and the reporting 
of results.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada has repeatedly asked the government to change 
this process of political patronage.  Elections Canada wants and 
needs to hire its own personnel to properly oversee an election. 
The government is intent on maintaining its system of political 
patronage.  This is certainly a sorry indictment against 
democratic principles and the status of Canada on the world 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of elections is also a major advantage to the party 
in power.  At present there is only a maximum number of years 
legislative bodies may operate without an election.  Section 4 of 
the charter of rights and freedoms states, “No House of Commons 
and no legislative assembly shall continue for longer than five 
years from the date fixed for the return of the writs of a 
general election of its members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 does not include an automatic date for Canadian 
elections.  The charter does not stop us from legislating an 
election every five years or some other lesser time period.  To 
do so would place all political parties on an equal footing as 
everyone would know the exact timing of an upcoming election. 
Every party would have the same opportunity to plan for the 
election, to generate war chests for election expenses and to 
expend funds to advertise the benefits of party policy or the 
detriments of government policy or opposition policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee that studied this bill heard about the advantage 
of present government members being able to distribute a 
householder just prior to the call of an election because of 
inside information. We can probably all remember a government 
which called a needless election at great expense to the taxpayer 
just because the governing party had the power to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislating the timing of an election to a specific period of 
time would not solve all of our problems but it would level the 
playing field and it would place greater controls on the 
expenditure of public funds.  It would also provide greater 
definition to all parties in the House of Commons. Our employees 
would know when an election is to be called and they would be 
able to prepare their careers and their lives accordingly. 
Members of parliament would know when their commitment to their 
constituents would end or when it would need to be renewed 
through a campaign. I imagine a number of companies and 
individual citizens would also be better equipped to react to 
parliamentary influences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 was an opportunity to vastly improve our electoral 
process.  Once again the government has taken the easy way out. 
It makes minor changes.  It ignores or refuses to introduce long 
overdue initiatives.  The government protects itself by 
maintaining the status quo or increasing the inequity of its 
position compared to the competition.  It ignores the 
pronouncements of the courts and continues to place the public 
purse at risk of considerable future legal proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of providing leadership and progressive thinking, the 
government has decided to stay the course and will only change 
when it is forced to.  This is unacceptable and it is 
unfortunate.  All that lies ahead is more litigation at great 
expense to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my words cause some members to reconsider their position 
on this important piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise this morning in support of the Bloc Quebecois amendment, 
which is also supported by at least one other party in the 
House, to the effect that only voters can make contributions to 
political parties. This is in keeping with the Quebec law on the 
public funding of political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that in Quebec, until that act was adopted in 
1977, many ordinary citizens felt that politics was rotten. 
When René Lévesque, along with others, created the Parti 
Quebecois, after the Mouvement souveraineté-association, he said 
“We will fund our party strictly and exclusively with people's 
contributions; we must avoid falling into the business 
contributions trap, as it spells corruption”.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Lévesque knew what kind of pressure major corporations 
could exert when the time came to implement government projects. 
He had experienced such pressure at the time of taking political 
stands and developing projects. In his mind, democracy was 
incompatible with the misappropriation of funds generated by the 
funding of political parties by corporations, because 
corporations never give money with no strings attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like in <I>The Godfather</I>, it may be free at first, but an 
order or a request invariably follows. It is these orders and 
requests that result in policies not being designed for the 
general public, but often for the rich and the most affluent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada and Quebec, especially with this crisis in 
the administration of the Department of Human Resources 
Development—in Quebec, funding for parties in Quebec has been 
cleaned up—feel that politics is rotten and serves politicians 
and that politicians and big business are as thick as thieves in 
looking after their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 provided an opportunity for the government to say, even 
though it can never be said definitively, that the political 
process must be the prerogative of the public who become members 
of a party or decide to fund a party, but that the important 
decisions are made for purely interest considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest may be seen in different ways, according to whether the 
party is the NDP, the Bloc Quebecois or the Liberal Party, but 
the public could at least have been assured that politics and 
not interests are at issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental issue, especially these days.  The public 
will not support politics with their minds, their hearts or 
their membership unless politicians are above all suspicion.  It 
may be said that that is far from the case and that the public's 
cynicism simply encourages individuals to stick their hand in 
the pot and take advantage of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that very many members are honest, but I also know that 
the temptation can be great—the opportunity, tantalizing—elections 
are expensive, and there are always good reasons for supporting 
so-and-so's project over another's, a private project over some 
other one, because that too can come into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada likes to say what it is and what it wants.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Economist</I>, which is not a social democrat periodical, 
contained a review for Europe of what constituted democratic 
control of party funding.  According to <I>The Economist</I>, whether 
or not citizens exercised democratic control depended on whether 
or not corporate funding was permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will recall, there were scandals in France because 
there was no legislation requiring grassroots funding. 
Since 1995, the legislation has allowed only voters as 
contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Germany was rocked by a scandal that damaged the 
reputation of someone thought to be a great statesman, Helmut 
Kohl, who worked to bring about the unification of Germany and 
who was one of the key European architects of the Treaty of 
Maastricht. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite his brilliant career, Helmut Kohl now finds himself 
caught up in a political and financial scandal which is 
destroying his reputation in a way that no one would have wished 
on him or themselves, for that matter.  Once again, at issue is 
secret corporate party funding, and many Germans—and I discussed 
this with members at the Council of Europe—are wondering whether 
they should not be considering having parties funded by voters 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issue of corruption, because that is what it 
is, we are automatically forced to the conclusion that there is 
only one way: have all voters on the same footing, have all 
citizens on the same footing when it comes to making decisions, 
and have parties funded by citizens, by voters.  That is 
democracy.  Otherwise, democracy takes a back seat to interests 
over which there is no control. In such cases, the policies 
introduced generally, if not always, do not reflect the wishes 
of the majority of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to liberate politics from what some like to call 
vested interests, we must ensure that parliamentary democracy is 
based on grassroots funding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
debate today is continuing on the report stage motions of several 
members and the government on the Canada Elections Act, Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I counted five interventions from the opposition benches 
just prior to my rising.  One might get the impression that the 
act, which is currently before the House, is seriously flawed. It 
will not be a surprise to anyone here if I take a different view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statute and the amendments in it are a substantial 
improvement to the old statute.  I just want to take a moment to 
outline, technically but very lightly, the amendments we are 
dealing with now in Group No. 2, at least for the record.  I 
realize opposition members often use the debate at report stage 
to deal with broader issues in the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, there are two categories of amendments in Group 
No. 2 that have been proposed by government members.  The first 
amendment deals with adding into approximately four sections of 
the bill the term “generally accepted accounting principles”. 
That term in the statute was originally proposed, I believe, by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois as a standard that would be useful 
in the statute.  Members at the committee agreed and the term was 
incorporated into the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had some time to read the bill following the committee 
study, there are approximately four other sections that, for the 
sake of consistency, would benefit by inclusion by reference to 
that term, and so that covers off four small areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area involves amendments that would make the English 
and French versions consistent.  I do not have to go into detail, 
but having adopted amendments at committee, one having to do with 
inclusion of amounts in candidates' personal expenses, amounts 
directed to child care or care for persons who are dependent 
normally on the candidate, there were some arguable 
inconsistencies between the French and English versions as they 
were put together at the committee.  Those amendments are offered 
as well.  I assume they were offered without objection.  I have 
not heard objection to them.  They appear quite appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard opposite references to the appointment process for 
returning officers and a description of the fact that Canada is 
often asked to act internationally to provide observers or advice 
on how to run elections.  That is true.  Canada is well 
respected, being one of the world's oldest democracies, in how to 
run elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to point out that our system of appointing returning 
officers has worked well.  We are well respected with our system 
now of appointing returning officers.  People do not say “We 
don't want you to help us out here because you appoint your 
returning officers the way you do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that the appointment system works well and it is 
very cost effective.  No one, in proposing changes to the system, 
has actually addressed the matter of the costs of implementing a 
whole personnel and recruiting selection process.  Perhaps we 
should think about costs sometimes.  We are supposed to around 
here when we propose changes. If the system works I suggest that 
we do not try to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice a certain inconsistency sometimes.  In debate that will 
happen.  I may fall victim to it myself from time to time, but I 
hope not.  It seems that some opposition members are only too 
quick to adopt the reasoning of the British Columbia courts in 
dealing with third party spending limits and other elements of 
the elections act in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain sense that the B.C. courts are right on the 
money here.  They are quoted extensively, but I could not help 
note that a few months ago the same parties were not so quick to 
quote the B.C. courts in dealing with the criminal code child 
pornography provisions.  Sometimes the courts serve the 
opposition parties' interest and sometimes they do not.  I will 
not get into a debate on the merits, but just because a lower 
court ruling is made does not mean the House must respond in a 
knee-jerk fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, all members of the House will make their 
decision and cast their vote on these amendments in the way they 
feel will be in the best interest of the public.

Taxpayers Federation.  The B.C. government, with its very 
heavy-handed approach, threatened to take him to court and charge 
him.  It told him that he could be facing a long jail sentence. 
This was a young man, working very hard on behalf of hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians citizens who sent in money, who was trying 
to educate the public on what he felt were the best options for 
the province.  I was with him when this was happening.  It was 
troubling for both him and his family.  He felt passionately that 
he was doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one issue for striking this bill down, that would be 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this new elections act, third party spending would be 
limited to $5,000.  I believe that parliament, not the courts, 
should write the laws for the country.  Right now it seems that 
the courts, not parliament, are the ones defending Canadian 
citizens.  Two decisions in Alberta have struck down gag laws. 
Just last week the British Columbia court struck down the gag 
laws.  I would argue that it is wrong for governments to stop 
small parties from running candidates and greatly limiting their 
party spending during election campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that the government is trying to ram this bill 
through parliament.  We have witnessed this many times before. 
The government is very content to just push this through 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue, aside from the gag law, is the number of 
candidates required to become a recognized party.  The government 
suggests the number should be 50 candidates even though the 
standing committee recommended 12 candidates.  A number of the 
witness groups that came before the standing committee 
recommended that it should be 12 candidates.  My colleague, the 
Reform member for Vancouver North put forward a private members' 
bill recognizing that it should be 12 candidates.  This came from 
all parties across the House.  Yet the government said that to be 
a recognized party it requires 50 candidates.  This is insulting 
to the Canadian voter.  We should be providing them with the 
information just like in the gag law.  To put a $5,000 limit, or, 
for a national campaign, $150,000 limit for a third party, is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many organizations, such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation 
and the National Citizens' Coalition, have members from across 
the country who raise money in order to inform and educate the 
public so that they can make very educated decisions when they go 
to the ballot box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not always agree with what these third party groups say, 
but it is insulting to the Canadian taxpayer that the government 
wants to keep this stranglehold, this noose on what information 
gets out there.  It wants to control what is out there in the 
public domain and what is in the media. 
I would argue that is why the government is putting gag law 
limits forward.  It is completely unacceptable that this is the 
direction in which it is going.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has virtually ignored all the work of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  It has 
refused to consult with the public by holding meetings across the 
country.  It does not want to listen.  It does not want input 
from various organizations, only the select few it invites to 
committee hearings in Ottawa to present their briefs.  Surveys 
across the country have shown that the Canadian people do not 
want spending limits on third parties so that they can get their 
message out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice my NDP colleague from Kamloops also supports this 
position.  He just rose in the House and said “Let them educate 
the people”.  There may be a group out there that does not agree 
with my viewpoint, but we cannot insult Canadian voters by not 
letting them make their informed choice.  They will sort out what 
they believe, who is putting credible arguments forward and who 
is putting a balanced position forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly remember the Canadian Taxpayers Federation listed all 
the arguments.  It firmly believes that we are overtaxed and if 
we are to move forward we should be reducing the size of 
government and reducing taxes.  Not everybody would share that 
view.  I obviously share that belief.  If it wants to spend the 
money from its supporters who donate to these campaigns then it 
should be able to.  I might add that the people who donate to the 
organizations that want to get this message out do not get the 
same political tax credit as when they donate to a party.  That 
is another debate for another day.  They do not get the same 
benefits as those who donate to the Liberal Party.  That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most disturbing to me that government had an opportunity 
to fix up the elections bill, to do something positive with the 
Canada Elections Act, and did not seize that opportunity.  It is 
a lost opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is old line partisan party politics: control, 
control, control.  The Liberals want to keep their noose on a 
dictatorship.  They want to control the amounts of money and the 
message that get out there.  That is patently wrong.  That is 
what we need to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer and the Canada Elections Act should 
be removed from partisan politics, as well as the whole 
appointment process and who the returning officers are.  It 
should not be appointments by the government.  It should be an 
all-party committee.  The political nature of this needs to be 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is anybody on the government side paying serious attention? They 
got a message from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on 
February 8 in Pacific Press v the Attorney General of British 
Columbia wherein the court completely struck down the gag law as 
unconstitutional.  I do not know how many times the government 
needs to hear it.  It has been struck down twice in Alberta and 
again last week in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government takes notice of this and wants to bring 
true accountability to the Canada Elections Act.  Unfortunately 
it has not this time.  Again it is back to the old style, the 
patronage stranglehold, controlling the message and the 
dictatorship.  That is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am also pleased to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-2 and in particular the amendments in Group No. 2 
specifically referring to some of the major provisions of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset let me pick up where the Liberal member left off. 
As the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River introduced his 
comments he asked why we on the opposition benches were debating 
the bill, was it not in effect a fairly perfect bill before the 
House, and what was all the fuss about. 
In fact he said:  “If it isn't broke, don't fix it”, implying 
that the bill was a pretty good collection of ideas which would 
make a difference in terms of elections law in the country today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to that member and to all other members of the 
Liberal government involves a couple of things.  How do they know 
it is not broken?  Does the bill represent an indepth systemic 
look at the situation in Canada today when it comes to elections 
law and elections provisions?  Why would they wait until it was 
broken before they fixed it?  Why would they not start looking 
into the future to see whether there are obstacles, problems or 
concerns that need to be addressed now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share a bit of Reform's concern with the fact that we had an 
opportunity to address some very serious problems in our Canadian 
political system.  We had an opportunity to take a hard look at 
elections law and to make some pretty fundamental and significant 
changes.  I share the concern of Reform and others when it is 
said that we have missed that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly believe we have missed an opportunity in reassessing 
how effective our elections act has been and where we need to go 
in the future to achieve what I think is the raison d'être, the 
underpinning, the root purpose of all of this work to create the 
rules and regulations that would allow everyone to participate. 
Our job and the role of government is to ensure a level playing 
field.  Our elections act and other complementary pieces of 
legislation must work to ensure that everybody has the 
opportunity, regardless of economic status, regardless of region 
and regardless of sex, to participate in Canadian politics today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an opportunity to do something meaningful and to look at 
a piece of legislation that has not been changed substantially 
since 1970.  Over that period of time a lot has changed.  We have 
learned a lot more.  We are faced with many new problems as 
Canadians.  We had a golden opportunity to make some important 
changes to our political system, beginning with ensuring that the 
laws determining elections financing and participation were up to 
date, relevant and meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where I have any kind of similarity to the Reform Party. 
We part company right after the notion that we had a great 
opportunity which has been missed.  We all agree that leadership 
has again been lacking from the federal government.  The 
government has again been fixated on tinkering with the system, 
on making small changes, on maintaining the status quo, and then 
on getting it through the House as fast as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we all share concerns about the way 
the government at every turn, with every bill, has tried to push 
through legislation as quickly as possible, just at the time when 
we need to be getting into indepth debate involving more 
Canadians and having really important dialogue across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I part company with Reform, a party that wants to take us in the 
direction of American style politics.  Its position on the bill 
and on the amendments is very much the same as its position on 
health care:  American style health care, American style 
politics.  Reformers are focusing on the gag law or the gag 
order, as they would put it, as opposed to seeing it from the 
point of view of the positive impact of restrictions on third 
party advertising for all Canadians and as a mechanism for 
ensuring participation by everyone in our political system today.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this party believe that the bill does not go far enough 
because it does not clearly set out a definite framework in terms 
of ensuring equal participation by Canadians right across Canada. 
We think this was an opportunity for the government to ask what 
are the barriers and obstacles to Canadians participating.  Are 
the limits on election expenses significant enough?  Are the 
reporting mechanisms in terms of donations meaningful enough?  Do 
we have a fair enough system?  Is it a level playing field?  Are 
we able to ensure that every group and individual feels they can 
participate if they are so inclined? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers, on the other hand, would like to take us further in 
the other direction.  From what I have heard in this debate and 
being at committee at one occasion, they would like to lift the 
rules and have a total free-for-all, an open door, a come as you 
go kind of approach to politics in Canada today.  Our position is 
that we need rules, regulations, limits and a way to ensure that 
every Canadian has a right to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take a look around us at the makeup of the House.  Is 
that not enough to tell us we have a long way to go with our 
Elections Act to ensure that kind of participation?  Where is the 
50% participation by women we thought we would see by the year 
2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may remember the history accounts of when Agnes 
MacPhail was first elected to the House in 1921.  She had fought 
long and hard for women to be involved in political life and said 
“I can almost hear them coming”.  She thought at that point in 
1921 that a breakthrough had been made, that barriers had at 
least in large measure been eliminated and that women would enter 
politics in as equal numbers as men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see there was no stampede.  What are we at today?  Is 
it overall 20% participation by women in the House today?  In my 
party we have at least raised that number up to 40%, but that 
took hard work and deliberate affirmative action measures.  That 
is the kind of provision, the kind of effort and the kind of 
action we need to see by the government as a whole when it comes 
to the Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the emphasis in the bill to address the kind of 
responsibilities that women face in society today and the 
barriers that prevent them from participating equally in our 
political arenas?  Have we looked at reasonable limits on 
expenses in a serious way in terms of the participation of women? 
Have we looked at the extra cost it takes for women to get into 
politics because they are juggling their work, their family, 
their household and community responsibilities?  Have we 
addressed all the financial, attitudinal and structural barriers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here was an opportunity.  We could have done it.  We could have 
made a difference.  Goodness knows we need to.  We are a long way 
from the goal of equal representation in the House.  We are a 
long way in the Chamber from representing the whole diversity of 
society today.  If anything, this should be a lesson and a signal 
to all of us that the bill is incomplete.  It takes some 
important steps.  It addresses the need for restrictions on third 
party advertising.  We are happy with that.  It looks at a 48 
hour blackout of polling.  It looks at some restrictions in terms 
of financing, but it could have done a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamloops mentioned in particular one issue 
which we are dealing with right now, the disclosure of all donors 
who register as numbered companies.  Why do we not know who these 
donors are?  Why do we not try to find out?  Why do we not make 
sure we have a level playing field?  I think that would be in the 
best interest of Canadian society today.

I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak to 
third reading and report stage of Bill C-2, the government's 
proposed changes to the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke in debate at second reading of the bill before the 
Christmas break.  At that time I said that my constituents and I 
were not supporting the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is a very important bill for our democracy.  The 
foundation of a strong democracy calls for our elections to be 
democratic, free and fair, offering an equal opportunity to all 
Canadians and all parties.  This bill continues to maintain the 
most objectionable provisions of the elections act which benefit 
the ruling party, in this case the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have asked for changes to the way we elect our federal 
government representatives.  With this bill we see clearly that 
the Liberals have once again failed to respond to the wishes of 
Canadians.  What a great way to start the new millennium, along 
with the billion dollar HRDC boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has wasted an opportunity to modernize and 
democratize the elections act.  The amendments we are debating 
today will not be adopted by the government.  Specifically, they 
have failed to deliver changes to a number of things; for 
example, patronage appointments, party registration requirements, 
campaign financing, third party spending issues, the 
reimbursement of election expenses, voter identification and the 
timing of elections and byelections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about third party spending limits.  Even though the 
hon. member for North Vancouver has done a marvellous job in 
analyzing the elections bill, which is so important for 
Canadians, let me go over it very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to limit third party spending to $150,000 during 
a federal general election, of which no more than $3,000 may be 
spent in any particular riding.  We on this side of the House 
believe that it is not the place of government to limit the right 
of individual Canadians, or a group of Canadians, to spend their 
own money in support of a cause or a candidate in a federal 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. we call this kind of manipulation a gag law.  It is an 
effort by government to prevent other, smaller political voices 
from engaging heavily in an election campaign.  The government is 
ignoring recommendations made to modernize our elections act.  In 
B.C. the government tried to do this recently. It tried to 
restrict third party advertising to $5,000.  It knows it will not 
form the next B.C. government so it is trying everything it can 
to prepare to win the next election.  It is toying with our B.C. 
election rules, and that is what the Liberals are going to do in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberals in Ottawa are even more cruel than the 
bankrupt, some would say corrupt, NDP government of B.C.  The 
Liberals only want to allow $3,000 to be spent in any riding in 
Canada by a fledgling third party.  That amount of money would 
not pay for a single advertisement on television.  What a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What all of this shows is that the Liberals are desperately 
afraid of losing the next election.  Can we imagine being so 
afraid of our opponents that we try to tie their hands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. supreme court ruled the limits to third party spending 
invalid.  The Liberals are challenging the hallmarks of our 
democracy.  For example, the ruling party, the Liberal Party, has 
free broadcasting time based on its number of members of 
parliament far and beyond what any other party is allowed.  Have 
the Liberals changed that situation with this bill?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from levelling the playing field, they are forcing a 
spending limit to be put in place of $3,000 per riding.  This 
would give a huge advantage to the Liberals by restricting the 
ability of any other person or group to counter government 
propaganda during an election.  Have the Liberals changed that 
situation with this bill?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs from B.C. know what desperate governments do to legislation 
affecting elections.  We wanted to see the Liberals adopt 
amendments to this bill.  They refused to do so during the 
committee stage.  Now we give them the opportunity.  This is the 
opportunity to adopt amendments at this stage.  We are holding 
the flashlight for them, but they are closing their eyes.  They 
are not looking when we show them the light through the darkness. 
That does not mean they will do the right thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are passing legislation that will immediately be 
struck down by the courts.  This is a waste of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have witnessed the B.C. NDP government's third 
party election limits legislation struck down by the court, but 
they will go ahead and pass the same legislation.  The B.C. 
supreme court found that there is no evidence to suggest that big 
money alone wins elections.  It said there was no evidence that 
third party spending affects the election process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows during the referendum on the Charlottetown accord 
that the yes side lost, even though it spent at least 10 times as 
much as was spent by the no side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election the PC Party spent significantly more 
than any other party, yet had only two members elected to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not adopt the amendments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, with respect to the requirements for registered 
party status, the elections act requires a political party to run 
50 candidates in an election to remain on the ballot.  The courts 
in Ontario say that only two candidates are needed to form a 
party.  It is the voters, not the government, who should decide 
whether a party and a candidate are worthy of their vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an attempt by the government to hinder the formation and 
growth of new parties like the Reform Party or the Canadian 
alliance.  The government is actually trying to limit competition 
on the ballot.  This is so undemocratic that it is 
anti-democratic.  It is almost a dictatorship.  The government 
should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other things which we could talk about.  For 
example, we put forward an amendment concerning voter 
identification.  A voter can now be asked to swear an oath to 
confirm identity.  That is ridiculous.  We need to use photo ID. 
If someone is evil enough to try to commit fraud in an election, 
surely we can assume that the same person would have no problem 
swearing an oath and lying to God or himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment concerns electronic voting.  Electronic voting 
could significantly cut the cost of running elections.  In 
Ontario electronic council elections can be run for one-sixth of 
the normal cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about reimbursement of a party's election expenses. 
Taxpayers should not be expected to fund activities designed to 
persuade the taxpayers themselves how to vote.  There should not 
be any reimbursement at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The candidate deposit of $1,000 should be much lower in the 
interests of encouraging Canadians to participate, regardless of 
their personal financial position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other areas where the bill can be criticized as 
being undemocratic, including fixed dates for federal elections, 
timing of byelections, government advertising or propaganda 
before an election, and many others.  Time prevents me from 
commenting on these matters.  My constituents know all about the 
bill.  We were fighting to have changes made to our elections act 
when dealing with this bill, which was Bill C-83 in the first 
session of this parliament, but the changes have not been made. 
The bill is a manipulation by the power hungry government in 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful.  When we send our representatives abroad to 
monitor elections we preach democracy.  We go to other countries 
to monitor their elections to ensure that they are democratic, 
fair and free.  But what is happening right here in our own 
country?  This gag law, this elections act which the government 
is forcing through the House, will create a situation where we 
will have undemocratic elections.  There will not be free and 
fair elections in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really pathetic.  It is so undemocratic that it is almost 
undemocratic enough to be a dictatorship.  Canadians will not 
support a political party that will force these types of changes 
on our democratic process.

exchange, has been the Achilles heel of western governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But contrary to Greek heroes, these democracies do not die—at 
least none has died yet—from the low blows to this weak point in 
their bodies. Each time, however, they are damaged and their 
image is severely tarnished, which could eventually throw them 
out of balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recall the series of scandals that shook France five years 
ago, when the public was at first astounded and then indignant 
upon learning how just about every national party was bending 
the law and accepting money from powerful corporations. The 
French government hastened to pass an act of indemnity to calm 
people down and save top political figures from legal 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks, France's top political figures have yielded 
their place in the pillory of public opinion to the 
once-respected, once-adulated Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, 
the father of a unified Germany, he whose party funding over a 
number of years now appears to be just the tip of an iceberg on 
the rough seas of German democracy, below whose waters lurks a 
huge mass of dangerous liaisons between politics and business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lax attitude in the western world's legislation on party 
funding, and worse yet the indulgence with which infractions are 
tolerated are, in my opinion, what lies behind the dangerous 
disrepute into which elected representatives today, in Canada as 
elsewhere, have fallen.  The end result of massive financing of 
parties by lobbies is, of necessity—you scratch my back and I'll 
scratch yours—nice little subsidies to generous donors, political 
favours, patronage, hush money, all of which quite properly 
scandalize public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent—and most juicy—illustration of this is the 
discredit currently being focussed on the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  Do you realize this, fellow citizens? 
We have just taken money from your pockets that will go to pay 
back—with heavy interest—the money lobbies have paid to the party 
that governs us, so that it may continue to reign over our 
province, when two-thirds of the population have rejected it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These dirty dealings are possible because of our electoral 
legislation.  In Canada, no one has to even put any effort into 
getting around it.  The Elections Act sets a limit on election 
expenditures, but there is no such limit on what amount of 
election funding can come from business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government announced that it was going to freshen up 
this legislation, when Bill C-2 came up on the floor of the 
House, we were perhaps incurably naive to imagine that the 
Liberals had decided to finally tackle a thorough cleaning of 
the Augean stables of party financing. 
It meant really not knowing these people and having 
underestimated the man leading them, the incarnation of vote 
winning gimmickry and political scheming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our Prime Minister did not have to look far for a model 
in this area.  The Quebec elections act prohibits corporate 
donations.  In shutting off this tap, it put a stop to the 
disgusting stench that rose from the trough of political favours 
because of the conniving about contracts and grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you see in Quebec this sort of endless scandal, which, in 
Ottawa, delights the columnists, but little by little, 
dangerously, adds to the up to now silent—regrettably—disdain of 
the public for its representatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has therefore moved an amendment to limit 
election funding of the parties to voters and to a maximum of 
$5,000 per contributor. 
This is the third time we have tried to change the law in this 
regard.  On the first two occasions, the Liberals rejected our 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is accepted this time—we can always dream and God willing—if 
such a miracle were to happen, it would put an end to the 
resolution we voted on at our convention to enable our party, so 
that it could fight as an equal, to accept corporate 
donations—with a $5,000 limit—as our adversaries can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if our amendment is rejected, Parliament Hill 
will remain the centre for the distribution of the billions of 
dollars this government has acquired improperly by rationing the 
provinces, overtaxing the middle class and the ransoming of two 
pension funds, by the barons of the system to their buddies, 
who, never disappointed in their expectation of the favour being 
returned, will finance their return to power.

is the only route of escape from the cesspool the federal system 
has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few more bills like Bill C-2, a few more HRDC scandals and 
those of us who hoped that Canadian federalism might yet rectify 
itself, will in the end recognize and understand that there is 
no hope for a rotten apple.  We pitch them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak 
to Bill C-2, an act to amend the elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young man I joined the Canadian armed forces.  I was very 
proud of our country's democracy and I still am today.  But as we 
look around the world we see that Canada still operates in some 
areas where we can improve our democratic system.  I think all 
people in the House would agree that the way in which senators 
are appointed should be changed.  That is why Bill C-2 is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Webster's Dictionary defines democracy as “a form of government 
in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised 
directly by them or by their agents under a free electoral 
system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation that governs the way in which people elect their 
representatives is a statement of how democratic a nation is.  If 
it is to meet these ideals of democracy, it must be as free and 
unhindered of restrictions as possible.  At the federal level in 
Canada, the elections act governs the way Canadians elect members 
to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the elections act has been criticized for having a 
number of restrictions that limit the ability of Canadians to 
exercise democracy.  The Liberal amendments have done nothing to 
address these restrictions.  In fact, they have strengthened them 
with the intent of ensuring that the Liberals as a governing 
party are re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will test three aspects of the bill to show they do not meet 
the definition of democracy.  They are the debate over third 
party spending limits, the blackout on poll results prior to 
election day, and patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first aspect I will test is the debate over third party 
spending limits.  Two separate court decisions in Alberta have 
struck down the elections act spending limits on third parties as 
unconstitutional and for good reason. Spending limits always work 
in favour of the governing party which in this case is the 
federal Liberal Party. It has a big advantage.  The Liberals by 
virtue of having the most MPs have the most free broadcasting 
time.  In their role as government they can use taxpayers' 
dollars to advertise for re-election under the guise of 
information from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party's election spending limit is close to $30 
million.  The official opposition has a spending limit of closer 
to $9 million.  Third parties cannot spend more than $150,000 or 
not more than $3,000 in any one riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one fail to see how spending limits enhance the freedom of 
Canadians to elect representatives.  The spending limits are 
obviously biased toward the Liberal Party with its massive 
spending advantage. Associations and private individuals can 
barely get their message across given the $150,000 spending limit 
in this bill.  The whole idea behind Bill C-2 is to curtail 
freedom of expression and the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect I would like to test to show that it does not 
meet the definition of democracy is the poll results publication 
blackout period.  In a recent court case, Thomson Newspapers v 
the Crown, previous legislation preventing the publication of 
poll results in the final 48 hours of an election campaign was 
struck down and for good reason. 
Canadians do not need a paternalistic government trying to black 
out information from the voting public.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to be foiled, this Liberal piece of legislation 
re-establishes a poll blackout during the last 24 hours of an 
election campaign.  The Liberals believe that if the polls are 
favourable for them on election day, voters will be more likely 
to vote for an alternative party to send a message of protest.  A 
blackout on polls during the final 24 hours limits the 
constitutional rights given to all Canadians while favouring the 
governing party. It will certainly be challenged by the media in 
another costly court case which of course again will be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has suggested a compromise that would see an 
end to poll blackouts.  Blackouts would end if the media 
disclosed their methodology, who paid for the poll, the number of 
respondents and the question asked.  The Liberals rejected this 
sensible solution, even though it better informed the electorate, 
because there is no advantage to the governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect of the bill I would like to test that it does 
not meet the definition of democracy is the continued use of 
patronage appointment.  There is not too much to examine because 
the continued use of patronage appointment fails the test 
straight off the mark.  It is unacceptable in a democracy for the 
Prime Minister to appoint Liberal Party loyalists to key 
positions like a returning officer in every riding of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary stood in debate and said that 
appointments were no problem.  Even the Chief Electoral Officer 
has asked that he be given the power to hire returning officers 
based on merit alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that when Elections Canada assists emerging nations 
during their elections it recommends avoiding a patronage ridden 
system like Canada's.  The Chief Electoral Officer has gone as 
far as to say that he would not recommend this elections act to a 
third world nation or emerging democracy, calling the appointment 
of returning officers in Canada an anachronism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This patronage system must be abolished.  Returning officers and 
poll clerks should be selected on the basis of ability, 
experience and impartiality and these positions should be 
publicly advertised.  By not eliminating patronage appointments 
within the electoral process, the Liberal government is blatantly 
trying to ensure it has the advantage in every riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Liberals had an opportunity to modernize our 
electoral process by increasing the freedom of the electorate to 
choose their representatives. This would have strengthened our 
democratic process making Canada the envy of the world.  Instead 
the Liberals have reaffirmed the regressive aspects of our 
elections act ensuring the governing party has all the advantage 
while limiting the freedom of Canadians to elect their 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These regressive measures not only fail to meet the test of the 
definition of democracy but have created the situation where our 
own Chief Electoral Officer would not export our system to a 
developing nation.  Instead of vesting the power in the people, 
the Liberal government is vesting it in itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

she was only briefed on her department's billion dollar 
boondoggle on November 17.  That is by no means certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at her first response to the scandal.  On November 
18 the minister hauled out her chequebook and signed off on six 
more grants worth almost $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister dole out another $1 million less than 24 
hours after receiving a damning audit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

are working on this issue.  We are taking it very seriously and 
taking a strong response to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general agrees that the approach we are taking is 
the right one.  We will fix this problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, here is how seriously the minister took the matter.  Her 
spending spree did not stop with the first 24 hours.  In the two 
weeks following the minister's official briefing on the billion 
dollar boondoggle she signed grant cheques totalling over $3 
million.  The minister had an audit on her desk highlighting 
gross mismanagement of public money in her department, but she 
just kept doling out millions of tax dollars anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister even stop signing cheques long enough to read 
the audit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed I read the audit.  That is why we 
have prepared a six point plan to implement across this country, 
that we have worked on with outside experts who have given us 
advice that we have included in the response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken this matter seriously.  The response is a strong 
one.  We will fix this problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has a very strange idea of taking things 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the first thing she did when the audit hit her desk? 
She shoved it aside because it was sitting on her chequebook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within 24 hours of receiving the audit she signed off on $1 
million worth of grants.  By December 3 the tally had reached 
over $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the minister so unconcerned about the mismanagement of 
$1 billion that she just kept cutting cheques? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, let us understand 
that the moneys we invest go to communities and individuals, and 
they make a difference in the lives of those individuals and 
those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that on that side of the House they do not accept that 
the federal government can have a role at the local level.  But 
on this side of the House we know how important these loans and 
contributions are.  That is why we are working hard to build a 
stronger foundation for this program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is interesting that the minister again has not answered a single 
question that has been put to her today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that when somebody hits the panic button maybe she 
would think that the boondoggle in her department has to come to 
a halt, but this minister did not skip a beat.  The boondoggle 
continued.  In fact, she cut cheques totalling $1 million the day 
after she found out about the problems, with no thought about 
trying to fix the system, no thought about freezing the spending, 
no plan, no concern and no one held to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was it business as usual for this minister when that audit 
sat on her desk damning her department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we received the audit.  We took it 
seriously.  We built, with the help of outside experts, Deloitte 
& Touche, with the advisory committee to the Treasury Board 
Secretariat and with the auditor general himself, over the course 
of time, a strong management response that will deal with this 
issue once and for all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
us remember what the internal audit which sat on that desk 
actually said.  It said that 15% of the grants did not have an 
application on file, 8 out of 10 did not have any financial 
monitoring, and 87% showed no evidence of supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the minister's response?  I would have thought it would 
have been a crisis, but she did not put an immediate freeze on 
spending, she did not argue that enough was enough, she did not 
say “Let us shut off the taps.  Let us stop it now”.  No, she 
swept that audit off her desk, got out the chequebook and started 
spending $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did she continue to spend money on these same grants when 
that audit said there was a spending control problem in her 
department?

</I></B></P><P align=left>My decision remains unchanged. This bill concerns all the 
provinces of Canada. Since we want to move along with this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there

all of Canada. This means that people would have to come to 
Ottawa not only from Quebec but also from all over the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, if it is important to travel across Canada to 
consider the issue of fishery and to visit prisons, and if it is 
important, as claimed by the government majority on the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, to travel to the Caucasus to 
define a Canadian policy, would it not also be important to 
travel to Quebec and to the rest of Canada to define a policy 
that appears to be rather important, according to the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

</I></B></P><P align=left>If a House committee can travel to take the pulse of Quebec on

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the letter I wrote to the House Leader of his party, we 
indicated that we were open to a broadening of the usual narrow

be reasonable would be for the committee to be able to come to 
Quebec to hear from them.  There are also groups in Canada who 
have said the same to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the increasing number of groups in Quebec and in Canada

why did she not just quit signing the cheques?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that we suspend these important programs.  What he did do was 
agree with our six point plan and agree that part of our six 
point plan and its implementation should include reviewing the 
files and ensuring that we have the appropriate paperwork before 
additional moneys are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The first thing we did was ask for a stronger

good money after bad.  She has doled out millions of dollars to 
profitable firms even though those companies would have set up 
shop anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the minister's motivation for all this generosity? In a 
word slush?  The Ekos audit showed there has been political 
interference in spreading the Liberal wealth.  That wealth is the 
taxpayer's.  Is it not the case that the human resources minister 
ignored that internal audit because she just could not bear the 
thought of losing that slush fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

if the hon. member would speak to his own colleagues he would see 
that the transitional jobs fund was a program that was made 
available for areas of high unemployment, including those 
represented by Reform members of parliament, those by the New 
Democrats, those by the Bloc, those by the Tories and, yes, those 
by this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program was there to help individuals.  It has done a good 
job of making sure that 30,000 men and women who were not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people would be concerned that maybe their boss would be 
mad about that, but the minister knew that her boss would not

air pollution in Canada.  This is a serious matter that requires

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today but, 
unfortunately, we will have to explain to those who are 
listening to us how business is conducted in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear that it is a parliament that works in a very 
democratic fashion, that everyone has an opportunity to rise and

Quebecois has been very serious and open during the proceedings 
of this House and of all of its committees. I feel we have made 
an effective and constructive contribution, as was pointed out 
many times in the House and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the situation deteriorated a great deal when the report 
on the Export Development Corporation was tabled. Let me briefly 
explain to what happened. The last meeting of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on the EDC 
was held on December 14, a few hours before the government 
decided to adjourn the House until February 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House adjourned well before the scheduled date, probably 
because the government was so embarrassed by the fact that Bill 
C-20 was an insult to the democratic rights of Quebecers and by 
the uproar caused in Quebec by the introduction of this 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This key element in the debate is of concern to us today because 
it eloquently shows the Liberal government's contempt not only 
for the population as a whole, but also for the legislative 
process and the work of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and Quebecers as a whole, I 
accuse the Liberal government, especially the Liberal members of 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, of having acted in bad faith with regard to the last 
segment of the review of the Export Development Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois has always been very open 
and has contributed to the smooth running of House proceedings. 
However, on December 14 things changed for the worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must deplore and condemn in the strongest possible terms the 
cavalier, contemptuous and expeditious attitude of the Liberal 
majority, based on more than dubious procedural considerations, 
which, in collusion with the Reform Party, approved the report 
now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the significance of this report and the time the 
committee spent listening to the many witnesses who enlightened 
its members, it is unacceptable that the report was adopted in 
less than 10 minutes. You heard right, Mr. Speaker, it took the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs less than 
10 minutes to have the report adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> This is horrible. I cannot believe it. It is 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> This is scandalous. It leaves us 
speechless. It sends shivers down our spine. We are dealing with 
an organization worth $34.7 billion. In 1998 its net profits 
amounted to $135 million. And yet it only took 10 minutes to 
expedite the matter. It makes no sense whatsoever. I see, Mr. 
Speaker, that you are nodding in agreement. You are right, it is 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet—I see that the Chair is listening very carefully—the 
Liberal members of the committee had been replaced by members 
who had not followed the committee's proceedings and who were 
acting on the orders of their whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did they take ten minutes to adopt the report on the 
EDC, an organization with activities totalling nearly $35 
billion, but most people who were there had not even followed 
the work of the committee. We can see what kind of attention 
that report was given. Like you, I am outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this shows contempt for the business of the House. Also, 
the chair of the committee insisted on holding meetings on the 
very day Bill C-20, which deals with the clarity issue in a 
future referendum in Quebec, was debated in the House. It is 
outrageous. As a Quebecer, as the representative of a Quebec 
riding, it was my duty to speak out against Bill C-20 on behalf 
of my constituents and to support the Bloc Quebecois, whose 
mandate it is to defend democracy for Quebec here in the federal 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what was the committee doing at the same time, in the 
building next door? It was ramming through a report which, after 
all, did not have to be adopted so hastily. It could have been 
studied more thoroughly, but no. While Bill C-20 was being 
debated here, the Liberal majority was in another building 
ramming through this committee report with people who had not 
even followed the work of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are listening to us at home have every reason to 
be disgusted by the way parliament works when the Liberal 
majority decides to ignore democratic rules in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Since I have been here, we have always 
worked closely with other parties in committee. 
We often disagreed, but we could still talk, exchange views and 
try to advance ideas that sometimes were contradictory. But the 
clash of ideas often generates the spark of understanding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed on a number of points, and there was the possibility 
of talking and taking time to reach a consensus in this 
committee.  But no.  This highly undemocratic government 
violates not only the rights of Quebecers to decide their 
future, but also the democratic rights of the members of this 
House to express their points of view properly, democratically, 
thoughtfully and coherently. 
All of this warrants the sharpest criticism possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, which drew on invaluable testimony gathered 
at public hearings, considers that there is an obvious lack of 
transparency in the operation of the EDC.  There is a serious 
lack of access to information.  Discussions could have continued 
at the report stage of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that some members of the Liberal majority, had they 
simply not followed the orders of their whips like robots, would 
have agreed with us.  But no, to use a latin expression, they 
rubber stamped it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said “That is what the government has decided to do”.  In 
any case, for the Liberal majority, everything from the 
government is good.  In my opinion, it is overly injurious. 
I expected the work of the committee to be conducted in a way 
that would allow Liberal members to freely express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberal members, even those who were sitting on the 
committee, often came to the meetings unprepared. They simply 
followed the minister's orders, passed on by the parliamentary 
secretary, while opposition members, particularly Bloc Quebecois 
members, came prepared. In fact, in the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes, who was 
there at the very beginning, the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, and my colleague for Mercier have always 
been among the best prepared. We took our responsibilities 
seriously, we were prepared— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> We are the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> We are the best, as the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But then what happens? Liberal members are mere bodies. They 
come unprepared; they are just like puppets. They often ask 
totally inane questions. They rubber stamp a report like that 
one in ten minutes. It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> I am pleased to see that members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party agree with my assessment of the 
Liberal performance in many committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings, witnesses expressed their delight that the 
EDC was not required to make public potentially damaging 
information about deals.  The Bloc Quebecois is sensitive to 
these concerns.  However, we find it entirely unacceptable that 
such a situation persists and we are worried that maintaining 
these standards will undermine the positive effect of the Export 
Development Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, since I am certain that this is the case, I would 
like to repeat that we could have convinced the few Liberal 
members of the committee able to think for themselves that our 
view was the right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is entirely normal and legitimate to worry that, with such a 
lack of transparency, the ECD's activities could serve ends 
entirely inappropriate and even contrary to the objectives of 
the bill. 
As an example, even as the bill was being reviewed by the 
committee, it was impossible for a Bloc Quebecois member to 
obtain a breakdown of the EDC's financial activities in Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one place such information should have been 
available, it is in committee.  When a bill is being examined in 
depth, it should be possible to get the answers to such 
questions. But despite repeated requests, the hon. member for 
Mercier was unable to obtain a breakdown of the EDC's activities 
in Quebec.  Once again, it sends shivers down one's spine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore think it essential that the government retain the 
proposal of its task force to the effect that the EDC should be 
subject to the Access to Information Act.  In my opinion, that 
is a minimum requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in our opinion, this report is incomplete and the 
committee has not fulfilled its mandate properly, because the 
connection between the activities of the EDC and the question of 
human rights was pushed aside in favour of issues that were 
mainly economic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has some serious reservations about how human 
rights are respected by the EDC.  I would like to address this 
touchy point a bit further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the EDC does provide financing services, it is 
particularly active in credit insurance.  Among the risks it 
assumes are political factors.  Even in assessing political 
risks, the EDC does not take the human rights situation into 
account, which leads us to say that, before providing its 
support to a company, the EDC should, as a bare minimum, ensure 
that the company in question subscribes to the OECD code of 
conduct relating to human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that a country that boasts of being a beacon for 
the world as far as the respect of human rights is concerned 
should ensure that one of its arms, namely the EDC, is making 
sure that companies with which it does business ensure that 
human rights are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unacceptable for the legislation to be used as a way 
to evade the precepts that guide our society in order to provide 
largesse to companies that are very often involved in developing 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, there is another aspect of the report we 
cannot let go without comment: the delicate issue of 
environmental standards.  I can sense that the hon. member for 
Jonquière is riveted to her seat, because for her the 
environment is something that is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> That is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> The Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that 
the committee's recommendations on the environmental 
responsibilities of the EDC are limited to wishful thinking.  We 
think, rather, that they should be based more specifically so as 
to further reflect the EDC's duties in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House of what is written in the report. We 
shall see the best recent example—there are a number;  we could 
have chosen others—of Liberal blah blah in such matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At pages 52 and 53 of the report, I will read their 
recommendations.  Mr. Speaker, if you are able to understand 
what these recommendations say, I would like to speak to you. 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee accepts that EDC's environmentally-related plans 
are a good start but agrees with the Gowlings review that they 
are insufficient in themselves. At the end of Part I of this 
Report, we suggested a general amendment to Section 10 of the 
Export Development Act<I> </I>which would add language requiring EDC to 
give due regard to “the commitments and obligations undertaken 
by Canada under international agreements”. In our view, this 
would include internationally-affirmed principles of sustainable 
development and obligations under multilateral environmental 
agreements. If there is any doubt on that point, wording to this 
effect could be added to Section 2 (Interpretation) of the Act. 
We also see merit in adding language elsewhere in the Act<I> </I>which 
would impart statutory weight to EDC's environmental review 
framework and establish some basis of environmental criteria on 
which to determine the eligibility of project proposals for EDC 
support. While EDC may see such measures as “redundant”, in 
light of the perceived weaknesses in its present Environmental 
Review Framework, we believe that EDC could further enhance its 
public credibility by conducting—

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in 
the House of Commons, on a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member has moved concurrence in this particular 
committee report.  I can only think that he is arguing against it 
now.  He is actually reading the report instead of debating its 
concurrence.  All I am hearing is him reading the report.  I 
would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to direct your attention to that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think the hon. member was 
intending to read the report.  I trust he was quoting from 
something in it that we wanted to refer to in debate.  I know he 
will do that, very briefly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am only quoting one 
recommendation, Recommendation No. 21. I think I am allowed to 
quote. I see that the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader is gesturing to tell me that it is a very long 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted it shorter and we wanted it stronger on environmental 
rights. Thank goodness they are not the ones who will draft the 
next referendum question in Quebec, because their recommendation 
does not even pass the clarity requirement they want to impose 
on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons has something against the 
length of the recommendations of his Liberal majority, let him 
say so. We wanted it shorter and also stronger on the issue of 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I continue to read the recommendation; it is only one 
recommendation. I feel like starting all over again, because he 
does not seem to have understood anything, but I will continue 
for the benefit of those who are listening to us. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that independent public oversight—reporting to 
Parliament at regular intervals on EDC's performance in respect 
of the implementation of its Environmental Review Framework—would 
be enhanced by adding a provision to the Auditor General Act<I> 
</I>establishing the Office of the Commissioner of Environment and 
Sustainable Development as the Government's designated agent for 
that purpose. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still quoting the recommendation. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to disclosure and accountability issues, the Committee 
takes the view that disclosure of environmental impact 
assessments which allows sufficient time for preventive 
action—i.e., identification and mitigation of potential problems 
as early as possible in the course of the proposal approval 
process and the project cycle—should be the operating rule, 
subject only to any commercial confidentiality and viability 
requirements that the Government deems essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing 
this matter in its forthcoming public disclosure framework, we 
would urge EDC to carefully consider all of the arguments and 
relevant international experience. Finally, as we suggested in 
the previous section, EDC should explore the option of creating 
an ombudsman post within its organization to respond directly 
and in a timely fashion to public inquiries and appeals 
regarding sustainable development impacts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one recommendation, and the government hopes, with this 
kind of mumbo-jumbo, to advance the cause of international 
environmental rights.  It is ridiculous and proves, as the 
member for Jonquière said, that they do not want to do much when 
it comes to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see you are asking me to hurry up, Mr. Speaker.  That is 
unfortunate, because I could go on for hours about the 
disgraceful way the Liberal majority has behaved in this 
business.  Not only is the report so much lip service, but when 
it came time to adopt it, ten minutes was all it took, when we 
were talking about a entity with some $35 billion in business. 
Puppets who had not followed the committee's work were brought 
in to rush the bill through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, to those who are listening, and I am addressing you, 
Mr. Speaker, as much as I am addressing those listening, it is 
very unfortunate that, when it comes to things as important as 
this, the Liberal majority has decided to trample any semblance 
of democracy.  But who can be surprised? 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am quite surprised both by the tone and by the content of the 
member's speech for whom until now I had a lot of respect as a 
member of our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little astonished for a number of reasons. First, he rose 
to move that the report be concurred in by the House, but he 
spent his time not so much attacking the report as attacking the 
behaviour of our Liberal colleagues on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret what he said all the more because, until now, I thought 
that members of our committees worked rather well together. 
Attacking the behaviour of other committee members seems to me 
somewhat out of place in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the substance of the report is concerned, I believe it 
stands on the strength of its very responsible recommendations. 
I might remind members of what was happening when the House was 
about to rise, last year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will recall what occurred at the end of the 
last session.  The committee met with the intention of adopting a 
serious report which had been the subject matter of a long series 
of reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally disagree with the member's analysis as to the 
comportment or attention of any of the members.  Many members 
followed these debates with a great deal of interest.  All 
members on all sides were very interested in ensuring that there 
was a balance in the report of the role of the EDC both in 
guaranteeing that corporations and individuals who export from 
this country receive adequate financing to enable them to carry 
on their business globally and at the same time ensuring that the 
EDC respected human rights values and the other concerns members 
rightly raised before the EDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report strikes a good balance between the needs of the EDC 
to ensure that Canadian exporters are well served by financing 
tools outside this country and at the same time to ensure that 
the human rights and environmental concerns of our citizens are 
met. It is a balanced report.  It is a responsible report which 
has the support and the concurrence of members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member saw fit to challenge the way in which the 
report was adopted, let me remind the member that the report was 
adopted in the absence of members of the Bloc Quebecois.  They 
knew that the meeting was taking place.  They were aware that it 
was taking place and they chose not to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me disingenuous to say that the report was approved 
by the Liberals in attendance, the Reform members and the other 
parties present, in the absence of our Bloc colleagues. Bloc 
members were boycotting the meeting precisely because at the 
time they did not want any committee report to be approved 
before the House adjourned for the holidays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of problems with what the member said. I respect 
his opinion as far as the substance is concerned. I am ready to 
debate it on its merits, but as far as the form is concerned, we 
can criticize neither the committee nor the procedures it adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comment of the 
hon. member for Rosedale. We did not choose to boycott. We were 
in the House because we were debating a fundamental bill, Bill 
C-20, which is an unprecedented attack on Quebec's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not boycotting the committee, far from it. My assistant 
in committee was even calling me to let me know when it was time 
to go there. In the meantime, I had to attend the House. I was 
not boycotting, and neither was any other member of the Bloc, 
because the Bloc never did. We participate in committee work in 
a productive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously, I was a member of the Standing Committee on Justice, 
which is said to be a committee where tempers sometimes flare 
up, because it deals with issues that affect very directly the 
lives of Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always made an effort, along with all the other Bloc members 
who sat on the Standing Committee on Justice, to ensure the 
bills move forward reasonably fast when we were in agreement. In 
a few minutes, I will address Bill C-7. The five political 
parties gave their support to this bill. We all worked together 
to move forward a bill whose objectives we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was appointed to the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, I was told this was the least partisan of the House of 
Commons committees. I was pleased, because I do not like it when 
it is too partisan and I like it when we can work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was most surprised and disappointed to see this was not the 
case when the report was adopted, on December 14 of last year. I 
was disappointed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can disagree with the substance of the report, and I am 
prepared to debate it further, but I find it totally 
unacceptable that it was adopted in ten minutes, at a time when 
we had to be in the House to counter an unprecedented attack 
against the democratic rights of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding ask me “Mr. Marceau, what can we give you as 
a Christmas present?” I always ask for the ability to be 
everywhere at the same time. But I do not yet have that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to be here, in the House, and therefore I could not attend 
the committee meeting at the same time. But I ran all the way, 
and my colleague from Repentigny will recall that he and I ran 
from this House to the East Block to try to make it in time. But 
between the time we received the call saying “Come quick, you 
need to come” and the time we got there, the report had already 
been adopted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to ask some questions on the review of 
the Export Development Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and his party are committed to the separation of 
Quebec.  Given the fact that they want to pursue it and that one 
of their objectives is to ensure the strength of the French 
language and French culture in North America, what would happen 
if Quebec gained independence and was trying to engage in 
bilateral economic relations and trade with the United States, an 
entity many times larger than the province of Quebec?  What would 
this do to the strength of the French language and culture in 
North America? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague think that one of the things that prevents 
Canadian companies, be they in Quebec or in une autre province, 
from being as competitive as they can be is the fact that high 
taxes and egregious rules and regulations are making Canadian 
companies less competitive than what they could be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be the fate of the French language and culture when 
Quebec is forced to engage in trade as an independent entity with 
the United States?  Are the taxes, rules and regulations as they 
currently stand choking the life out of companies in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
astounded to see that the members of the Reform Party are for 
the first time showing some interest for the French language. It 
is a bit surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be brief. Since 1760, and even before, Quebecers have 
always been challenged to excel, if I can put it that way. Being 
a minority people in North America and living right next to the 
world's biggest economic, cultural and military force, Quebecers 
are challenged to excel. Since the Quebec people began to exist, 
this challenge has always been addressed by Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the debate on free trade became an electoral fight in 1988, 
Quebecers were the ones who made it come true. Quebec supported 
free trade while our friends on the other side were against it. 
But, what did they do as soon as they were elected? They began 
to support it. As members can see, if we repeat things often 
enough to them, they finally see the light, at least this is 
what I hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of Quebecers are in favour of free trade. The 
sovereignist movement wants to be at the crosspoint between the 
two main movements, the end of the 20th century and the 
beginning of the 21st century, which means political 
independence and economical interdependence. This is why we were 
in favour of the free trade in 1988, why we were in favour of 
NAFTA in 1992 and why we were in favour of the Free Trade Area 
of the Americas until 2005, because we will take up the 
challenge to excel. 
We have done it before and we will do it again.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL RECORDS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 11, 2000, consideration of the 
motion relating to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-7, 
an act to amend the Criminal Records Act and to make 
consequential amendments to another act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
minutes ago, I took the floor in order to show how a committee 
can be a little mean. I think it was a sad day for 
parliamentarism and for parliamentary committees in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 is a very different story. Initially, this bill was 
introduced during the first session of the 36th Parliament. It 
was then called Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois made an outstanding contribution on that 
bill. In fact, that contribution was acknowledged by the 
parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general. I have to tell 
the House he also did an excellent job. For once, he did not 
have to obey the Liberal majority. He was willing to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate on Bill C-7, the five political parties have shown 
openness, flexibility, and diplomacy. 
Thus, the bill got the support of the five parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not say how regrettable it is that 
the government does not show openness more often in parliament, 
whether in committee or in this House. Lack of openness and 
narrow-mindedness are the main features of this government, as we 
can see with Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal majority showed a bit more openness, if it took 
off its blinders and stopped being so highly partisan, as it is 
all too often, I believe we would see more often bills like this 
one, which has the support of the five parties in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not a worthy cause to bring all the political parties to 
support a bill? Is it not worthy cause to try to reach a 
consensus on a given subject? Should any government, any 
parliamentary majority not have as a rule to get opposition 
parties to support everything that can be supported, all 
elements upon which there can be some agreement? This is what I 
call leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government should always reach for the widest consensus 
possible. But because of its lack of leadership, its lack of 
vision and its narrow-mindedness, this Liberal government refuses 
to reach for a consensus even if it would be much better to do 
so, as was shown in the case of Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 14, 1999, this bill got the support of all the political 
parties in this House, it was deemed to have been read a third 
time and passed. 
Through a motion passed on October 14, 1999, the House permitted 
that bills that had not yet received royal assent be 
reintroduced during the second session and, on October 18, 1999, 
what is now Bill C-7 was passed by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, last fall, the government had decided to 
postpone the opening of parliament, because of its very poor 
legislative performance. Indeed, its legislative agenda was so 
thin that it was not sure it would take us to the Christmas 
recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister took advantage of this to keep his patronage 
machine rolling and appoint a friend of the government as 
governor general, as well as several other cronies. 
Thus. Bill C-7 came back from the Senate with several amendments. 
It is now again before the House to be read a second time as 
amended.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of Bill C-7 is both very simple and very 
noble. Its purpose is to prevent serious cases of sexual 
re-offending against children or vulnerable members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If protecting young people, children and the less advantaged 
members of society is not first and foremost for lawmakers, I do 
not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings of the Standing Committee on Justice, we 
heard and listened with great interest and a lot of respect to 
the opinions of social groups involved in rehabilitating 
criminal offenders. 
We had to properly determine the safeguards included in this 
bill in order to ensure the preservation of society in general 
and at the same time of the reputations of those who have 
committed serious offences and have been pardoned.  It is the 
balance between protecting human rights, including those of 
pardoned offenders, and protecting society, particularly its 
weaker and younger members, that we had to seek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders whose record include criminal acts of a sexual nature 
are therefore directly concerned by this legislative measure. 
Although there is a relatively low proportion of repeat 
offenders, even the slightest doubt is too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who send their children to day care, to a playground, to 
school, to Scouts, to a club for children or teens need to be 
sure that these places are not teeming with sexual deviants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no worse thought for a parent that the prospect of his 
or her child being the potential victim of a sexual aggressor. 
There is nothing worse.  It is essential for every parent who 
decides to hand over responsibility for a child to any kind of 
organization to have absolute certainty that this child will be 
safe and cannot be preyed upon by some sexual pervert.  And this 
does not only apply to the present. We are aware of all of the 
physical and emotional scars borne by adults who were victims of 
sexual abuse as children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also covers vulnerable members of society as well as 
children.  These are some of the weakest members of our society, 
people of sometimes limited capacity who could also, like our 
children, fall prey to sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases as recent as this very week of sexual predators 
in positions of trust or authority with children, and these 
justify rapid passage of this bill. 
It is not a question of limiting the right to privacy of those 
who have been granted a pardon, far from it, but rather of going 
beyond lip service and taking concrete action to keep our 
children safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee deliberations, the Bloc Quebecois was assured 
by government members that the solicitor general's authority 
would be used with the greatest circumspection.  The Bloc 
Quebecois also supports the amendments proposed by the Senate 
and hopes that the implementation of these new legislative 
provisions will make it possible to ensure that our children and 
other vulnerable persons are protected effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators and guardians of democratic legitimacy, it is the 
duty of all members of the House to protect society's weakest 
and most vulnerable members, and the children who are its 
future. 
This bill is a concrete, first step in the direction of this 
laudable and noble objective, which should be paramount in our 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois wholeheartedly supports the bill, 
why the Bloc Quebecois is glad to see that the five opposition 
parties support it, and why the Bloc Quebecois is disappointed 
that the government has absolutely no interest in taking a 
similar approach to other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we operate by consensus, when we, as a society, set a goal 
that cannot fail to meet with general agreement, all Canadians 
and all Quebecers stand to gain, as do the weak and 
disadvantaged members of our society.

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud and honoured to speak in favour of 
this bill.  I want to congratulate all the previous speakers, 
particularly my colleague for Charlesbourg who gave a very 
impassioned and very eloquent speech.  He cares deeply for 
children. Recently having had two young sons, twins, he knows of 
what he speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7, formerly Bill C-69, will further protect the public 
upon the release from prison of a pardoned sex offender with the 
disclosure of what would be relevant information should the 
circumstances so dictate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that children are the crown jewels of our 
country and our future.  A number of young children have appeared 
here on the Hill.  I am speaking of young people like Ashly 
MacLean of Hopewell.  They have so much to offer, so much promise 
and need our protection in every possible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 is a step in that direction, a step toward protection 
of our most vulnerable citizens.  It amends the Criminal Records 
Act and makes criminal records for pardoned sex offenders which 
would normally be sealed available for background checks from 
interested parties.  It uncovers information that is of vital 
importance to those individuals and organizations who work to 
protect children.  Information is certainly power in these 
instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard of the high profile cases involving the 
horrific crimes of the Bernardos and the John Robys and the 
public outcry for tougher legislation to protect children and 
protect society in general.  Tolerance is at an all time low, I 
would suggest, for deviant sexual abuse of any kind but 
particularly that involving our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual assault is often not an issue of sex; it is an issue of 
power and control, the dominance of an offender over an 
individual.  This dominance, this sexual violence or perversion 
and the exploitation of children is perhaps the most cowardly and 
heinous act that one can imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to disclose information and protect children, those who 
are most vulnerable, and expose to individuals information of a 
past record will allow the relevant and connected organizations 
to do everything in their power to prevent the contact which 
could lead to this type of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, recidivism occurs often with those who involve themselves 
in this type of activity.  It goes without saying that the 
lasting effects are almost incalculable in both the long and 
short term.  It is not the physical but the emotional and 
psychological scars that individuals carry throughout their life 
when they have been subjected to this kind of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high rate of recidivism among sex offenders in particular is 
most troubling. The potential for unknowing parents, 
organizations or individuals for leaving their children in the 
care of a pardoned sex offender is addressed to a large degree by 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently community organizations or police departments would be 
prohibited from accessing files that involve the names of 
pardoned sex offenders.  Bill C-7, in vetting each request and 
striking a balance between those who have the right to know and 
those who have the right to be protected and the right to 
confidentiality, is certainly a bill that we can all embrace. 
Access to previously unavailable information on pardoned 
individuals in these circumstances is what we strive to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year all members of the Conservative Party supported this 
bill as did all members of the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successful passage of the bill through parliament before the 
recess was again a strong signal of non-partisanship and the 
co-operative effort that can result in very positive change. 
Previous members have spoken to it, and it was certainly a 
feeling that prevailed at committee and in the House, given the 
level of support the bill has received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of 1999, Bill C-7 returned from the Senate with 
amendments.  The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and 
Constitutional Affairs cited some obvious and very reasoned 
concerns.  One of those was the lack of expressed reference to 
the intent of the bill to pertain to records of pardoned sex 
offenders.  Therefore the word sexual was added to clause 6 of 
the bill in order to make it clear that only sexual offences 
would be flagged under this proposed system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definite rules are then put in place, listing the sexual 
offences that may be flagged and the making of notations with 
respect to the records of those convictions.  Police must have 
the consent of the offender and the solicitor general for the 
release of offender's records to potential employers or inquirers 
if the offender is in fact applying for a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedule of offences and the important terms such as children 
and vulnerable persons were removed from the regulations and 
placed in the bill.  This allows these offences to again be 
subject to parliamentary scrutiny as opposed to being left to the 
discretion of the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term handicap has also been deleted from the definition and 
replaced with vulnerable person.  It goes without saying that the 
term handicap is no longer acceptable in today's society, and it 
is more than just semantics to ensure that this bill reflects a 
modern view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate's position set out some very useful and poignant 
amendments that put a greater emphasis on what the bill seeks to 
achieve.  It ensures a clear, narrow and limited exception in the 
Criminal Records Act.  The changes with respect to sections 7 and 
8 of our constitution and charter to protect privacy are 
reflected in the changes proposed by the Senate that maintain the 
balance between rehabilitation and the objectives of the pardon 
system and the need itself to protect children and others who are 
vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now quote from Senator Beaudoin, a very renowned 
constitutional expert and prominent Conservative senator, who 
spoke to the bill when it was in the other place: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing these remarks, I must state that, when the committee 
studies any matter relating to criminal records, as is the case 
with this bill, or some related subject such as DNA, we always 
step up our efforts to be assured of compliance with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  As we all know, sections 7 and 8 
of our Constitutional Charter protect privacy.  This is a 
fundamental value of our system.  I believe that it can be stated 
that Bill C-7, which we have before us, respects the 
Constitution, including the 1982 Constitutional Charter, to the 
best of our knowledge. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As acknowledged by members who have spoken previously, it 
demonstrates that the Senate has made a very significant and 
important contribution in the amendments that we are speaking to 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child care organizations, those hiring new volunteers or paid 
employees, will now be able to identify a candidate who has 
received a pardon of a sexual offence.  It is only permitted if 
the position is one of authority or trust relative to those 
children or vulnerable persons and the applicant has consented in 
writing.  This is a very important safeguard that has now been 
inserted into the bill by our senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations such as Scouts, Guides, Big Brothers and Big 
Sisters, coaches, day care workers and others will benefit 
directly where there is an implicit element of trust in the good 
work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flagging these sexual offenders will also alert police doing 
background screening checks to submit fingerprints with a request 
for any pardoned record that may exist.  If the existence of an 
applicant's pardoned sexual assault record is confirmed, the RCMP 
or the police force that did the screening can request the 
commissioner then provide the solicitor general with any record 
of conviction of that applicant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed subsection 6.3(5) allows the solicitor general to 
dispose of all or part of the information contained in that 
record if he so decides.  The RCMP or police forces may disclose 
the information to the organization that requested this 
verification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in accordance with new subsection 6.3(7) the 
organization may only use this information in relation to its 
assessment of the job application. 
Also the new subsection 6.3(3) stipulates the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except as authorized by subsection (2), no person shall verify 
whether a person is the subject of a notation—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very technical in nature but I would suggest very 
important because these safeguards and the balance sought are 
addressed by these very useful amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to the offender's information is limited to authorized 
police officers and law enforcement personnel.  The consent form 
must be signed pursuant to subsection 6.3(6) by the affected 
individual.  By requesting consent the applicant could choose to 
either agree or refuse to allow the record to be unsealed. 
Refusal would be a signal to the organization wishing to conduct 
the search that the applicant may not be the appropriate person 
for the position.  If the applicant gives consent obviously the 
authority of the solicitor general would still be needed to 
unseal the record in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many volunteer agencies engage in a screening process of the 
applicant's background.  However, screening is not done with the 
same degree of precision or thoroughness that we know occurs with 
a police check.  Under Bill C-7 we will be permitted to put this 
information into the hands of those most in need, the 
organizations that by their very nature can potentially set up a 
situation where a young person could be exposed to a person with 
a prior sexual assault conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police record checks are not always effective.  The CPIC system 
has been gutted in many instances in terms of the funding. 
Although the solicitor general has spoken with great ballyhoo 
about the injection of new funding, this is less than half of 
what is needed to bring the CPIC system up to par. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said, there is a sad reality to all of this.  Research 
confirms that the vast majority of people who perpetrate sexual 
abuse against children are often those who do not seek out 
employment in that area.  Oftentimes there is no prior 
conviction, that is to say they have never been convicted of a 
crime and therefore they would not show up on a police record 
system.  This highlights the need for education and the need for 
participation in a public education effort to let people know 
there is more that can be done to protect children.  The bill 
therefore is not a panacea by any stretch of imagination but it 
is certainly significant progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteer organizations throughout the country are obviously 
aimed at the enhancement of children's lives.  To this end I 
believe the legislation very much enhances the ability we have as 
legislators and people of this country who have been entrusted 
with the responsibility to put into effect laws that will help 
our law enforcement agencies.  This will enhance protection for 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardons themselves are very much an important part of the 
justice system.  They serve a very important purpose.  They are 
obviously of great benefit both to the pardoned offender and to 
society in terms of the stigma in allowing an individual to get 
on with life after having served a debt to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to sexual offences the new legislation very much 
strikes that balance.  In terms of priority and where we in this 
place should be focusing our attention the bill puts it very much 
in the hands of our legislatures and very much in the hands of 
our law enforcement and volunteer agencies to protect children in 
every possible way, to use all means, to use extreme caution, to 
go that final step to see that children will always be first and 
foremost in our efforts to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a universal remedy or solution that can be found in 
the legislation but it can offer this additional mechanism of 
protection.  It does not erode the integrity of the parole 
system.  The exceptions it now provides in the parole system may 
appear small but they are very justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 28 years nearly one-quarter of a million pardons 
have been granted for all offences in Canada.  In relation to 
Bill C-7 only 4,500 of those pardoned concerned sex offences. The 
need to protect society has to be given greater strength. The 
bill moves us in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate the government of the day would not put 
forward the same effort, the same resources and the same strident 
timetable that we have seen with respect to the bill.  It should 
somehow rebalance its priorities in putting its resources into 
efforts such as this instead of into efforts such as gun 
registration which obviously do not seek out and do not 
particularly protect society in the way it would have us believe.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of public protection initiative and the support it has 
received here is an indication of the type of co-operative effort 
that can occur in parliament.  It should renew some faith and 
restore some lost hope that we can, when the cause is right, 
rally around to pass legislation quickly and effectively that is 
aimed at protecting society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the government can ensure systematic and effective 
scrutiny of the police control processes and ensure that Bill C-7 
is used only for checking criminal records and those involved in 
sexual offences, Bill C-7 is very much acceptable and necessary 
as a violation, a minor infringement, I would suggest, of the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  It is certainly one that can be 
exercised in the interest of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the age-old adage that talk is cheap.  This is action 
that speaks volumes.  It is an unusual occurrence when we can do 
so in such a unanimous and unified fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater good is what we must constantly strive for.  Law 
enforcement agencies must strike a balance of equal treatment 
under the law always with a mind to protecting the innocent.  We 
can do that in this place.  A Progressive Conservative government 
would very much like to see the opportunity to move on laws such 
as this one, laws that put the emphasis on protecting society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, from St. John's, Newfoundland, to St. Peters, 
P.E.I., to Victoria, British Columbia, and all places in between 
in this vast country, this is a positive and laudable piece of 
legislation that the Conservative Party supports whole-heartedly.

amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-7, an act to amend the 
Criminal Records Act and to make consequential amendments to 
another act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have just returned from a very enlightening meeting with about 
200 young people who are here with Encounters with Canada. They 
were asking very reasonable questions, having just spent some 
time in the Speaker's gallery watching question period, such as 
what in the world is going on.  Why is there so much hostility? 
Why are we always going at each other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It therefore gives me a tremendous deal of pleasure to speak 
very briefly to this bill and just recount how we arrived at this 
point.   The bill and the co-operation there has been within the 
House of Commons among members of parliament are examples of some 
of the good legislation that we can work together on, that we can 
co-operate on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give special acknowledgement to my colleague from Calgary 
Centre who entered the House in 1997.  He became the critic for 
the Reform Party responsible for issues surrounding families.  He 
arrived without any parliamentary experience and very quickly 
studied and came forward with a very useful piece of legislation 
not dissimilar to this one.  As a matter of fact, I suggest in a 
spirit of co-operation with the government that perhaps it was a 
catalyst on the part of my colleague from Calgary Centre that 
this legislation saw the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went through the Private Members' Business process and was 
referred to committee following second reading. 
The solicitor general's department came forward with legislation 
that was very similar to my colleague's bill.  Again, through a 
spirit of co-operation in the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, an agreement was struck to co-operate and ensure 
that the same process being used for the solicitor general's bill 
would be used for the private member's bill, while negotiations 
went on behind the scenes to try to blend these two together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not infrequent for members of my party and perhaps some 
Canadians to have nothing complimentary to say about the other 
place, but today I will say something complimentary.  The other 
place is part of the Canadian government and the government 
process as it presently stands in Canada, and whether we have 
questions about that or not is irrelevant.  It is there and it 
does a do its job with this bill.  I think it made improvements 
to the bill which has now been referred to us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows the kind of work that can happen when there is 
unanimity and agreement on vital issues such as this.  This shows 
that even when a bill like this comes forward from an opposition 
member, my colleague, the member for Calgary Centre, that the 
House can respond in a positive way to his initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unseemly for me to take any partisan shots at this 
point in talking about the actions behind the scenes and the 
negotiations that took place.  The bottom line to this exercise 
is that everyone in the process should be complimented for having 
seen it come to this point, and that the protection of children 
in Canada will be stronger as a result of this.  As I said, I 
particularly want to acknowledge the tremendous hard work, 
dedication, perseverance and foresight of my colleague from 
Calgary Centre.

collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by 
providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or

Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on 
Bill C-6, the personal information protection and electronic 
documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by putting things into perspective.  The government 
is committed to fostering the growth of an electronic based 
economy in Canada, to prepare all Canadians for a new global 
economy and electronic commerce and to ensure that we are ready, 
willing and able to compete against the best the world has to 
offer.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada to do that and to become a leader in the knowledge 
based economy and in electronic commerce, consumers and 
businesses must be comfortable with the new technologies and with 
the impact that these technologies will have on their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trust is very crucial.  Canadians want to know that their 
transactions are private and secure, that legal and financial 
networks exist to support transactions and that the information 
infrastructure works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent survey by Angus Reid found that 80% of Canadians think 
that their personal data should be kept strictly confidential. A 
1998 Ekos survey also found that four out of five Canadians want 
the government to work with businesses to set rules for privacy 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have called for legislation that would define a single 
set of rules and establish a level playing field where the same 
marketplace rules apply to all.  The direct marketing industry, 
information technology companies, telecommunication companies and 
banks all realize that we need a clear federal legislative 
privacy framework in Canada.  They also recognize that flexible 
but effective legislation will help customers accept electronic 
ways of doing business and, of course, less expensive for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
apologize for interrupting the member's speech.  On the last vote 
that was carried unanimously, I believe the Reform members had 
five members standing and they wish a recorded vote, 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I accept your point 
of order.  However, I was in the Chair at the time and I did not 
see five members standing.  We were very careful to make sure of 
that case.  The motion was carried unanimously.  If there was to 
be a point of order on that it should have been made at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously through unanimous consent we could revert back.  If 
the hon. member cares to move a motion requesting the Chair to 
ask for unanimous consent to revert, I will do so.  It is up to 
the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this only happened a few 
minutes ago and it appears that there will be no unanimous 
consent.  There were five members standing and, as you can 
appreciate, I consulted with you on the proper procedure.  We 
have taken a few minutes to bring this point of order forward 
because it appeared that you had not observed the five of us 
standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I appreciate that 
but I just said that I did not see five members standing.  If 
that was the case, and I could very easily have been wrong, it 
seems to me that the member should have made the point at that 
time.  However, I will be happy to put the question to the House 
if the member requests it.  If not, it is over and done with.  We 
are not going back.  We are on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just before the 
interruption I pointed out some data.  It was in response to 
demands such as this that the government developed a strategy for 
electronic commerce that the Prime Minister announced in 
September 1998.  This strategy, designed to establish Canada as a 
world leader in the development and use of electronic commerce, 
was built around seven firsts in the areas of: consumer 
protection, tax neutrality, cryptography policy, standards, 
secure electronic commerce, digital signatures and privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am proud to report that with the final passage of this 
bill we will have achieved the seven firsts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of personal information has been recognized as a 
fundamental pillar of the global information society.  For 
example, the European Union has a directive that came into force 
in 1998 that requires member states to block the flow of personal 
information to countries without adequate data protection.  They 
are looking for the same elements that we have included in Bill 
C-6. 
The EU and Canada consider that legislative frameworks for the 
protection of privacy and personal information are a vital 
component of electronic commerce strategy and are beneficial to 
the evolution of the information society. Internationally, the 
European Union and Canada have committed to supporting a standard 
based approach to complement national frameworks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 has already cleared the House and many hours have been 
devoted to its debate and passage.  However, I would be remiss if 
I, on behalf of the Minister of Industry, did not take a moment 
to personally thank the Standing Committee on Industry for the 
excellent and exhaustive work it did to ensure that this 
legislation met the needs of all the stakeholders, including 
industry, consumer groups and Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate unanimously supported the bill's principles and 
agreed with its broad based approach to the protection of 
personal information.  The standing Senate committee on social 
affairs, science and technology, the committee that studied the 
bill, described the bill as a masterpiece of electronic commerce 
that struck a very significant and delicately drawn balance 
between business and consumer interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill was being examined by the Senate, Canada's health 
sector voiced serious concerns.  This sector, uncertain as to the 
scope and applications of the bill, was concerned that it would 
not be able to get its systems and procedures under way in time. 
Many within the health care sector felt that they should be 
excluded from the legislation altogether.  In response to these 
concerns, the Senate has proposed amendments to the bill that 
will allow the health sector one extra year from the time of 
proclamation to meet the requirements of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be stressed that the health sector is not being 
exempted from the legislation, nor should it be.  Personal 
information is just too sensitive to be left unprotected.  In no 
way do these amendments change the basic tenets of the 
legislation.  The health sector is simply being given more time 
in which to prepare.  As the bill is scheduled to be proclaimed 
and come into force on January 1, 2001, the amendments will give 
the health sector until January 1, 2002 to prepare for the coming 
into force of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this additional transition period, Industry Canada is 
ready to work with the entire health care sector, including 
commercial organizations, the provinces, Health Canada and other 
stakeholders to clarify any uncertainties on how Bill C-6 applies 
to them.  Reasonable and practical solutions exist within the 
framework provided by the bill to ensure that the personal health 
information that is collected, used and disclosed in the course 
of commercial activities is protected by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is of the essence.  This is a message that the government 
and stakeholders, including provincial and federal privacy 
commissioners, have voiced repeatedly.  The Minister of Industry 
recently a received a letter from the Information Technology 
Association of Canada.  Letters were also received from Canadians 
in support of Bill C-6, which included the Public Interest 
Advocacy Group, B.C. Civil Liberties Association, B.C. Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Association, the Canadian Health 
Coalition, Electronic Frontier Canada and Democracy Watch.  The 
Canadian Marketing Association and the Insurance Council of 
Canada have also recently written to the federal government 
urging it to give royal assent immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with these stakeholders who are supportive of the bill. 
Consumers, businesses and the government are calling for royal 
assent of Bill C-6.  The bottom line is that Bill C-6 is too 
important for the future of Canadians to delay it any further. 
For that reason, the government concurs with the amendments made 
by the Senate.  Let us all work together to make this happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-6, the privacy 
in electronic commerce bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the thrust of the bill, but we had a 
couple of concerns which we put forward in the form of 
amendments.   Had the government seen fit to adopt these 
amendments they would have strengthened the bill.  However, the 
government chose not to adopt them.  One of the reasons we put 
these amendments forward was the importance they had to social 
concerns, particularly in health care and welfare.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, this bill the government has put forth really is 
comprised of two bills.  One deals with electronic commerce which 
we ardently support. The Reform Party recognizes that the 
government unfortunately has failed to support our business 
sector in the world of electronic commerce. Our e-commerce 
business is falling far behind that of our colleagues to the 
south.  The government needs to do much more to give business the 
ability and power to compete internationally in the global 
e-commerce market. We support the parts of the bill that deal 
with electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to strengthen the first part of the bill that deals 
with privacy.  There is a need to deal with the privacy aspects 
of the bill, in particular the aspect that deals with health care 
issues.  The bill does not do that at all.  In the coming era of 
e-commerce, globalization and sharing of information by 
electronic means, it will become increasingly important for the 
government to introduce legislation that protects individuals and 
records concerning them, particularly in health care issues. 
Privacy in this area is a right of Canadians.  Unfortunately that 
is lacking in the bill.  We put forth amendments to deal with 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for calling in 
the members on this riveting Bill C-6.  I am disappointed at the 
Bloc members who have left after they chose to call quorum. It 
shows their interest in e-commerce and Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health would find this very interesting because 
he has proposed plans and solutions to develop a mechanism 
whereby patient records can be shared by medical practitioners 
across the country.  This is a good idea. However, it is very 
important that the medical information on these records be 
protected.  There is very little in the bill to protect patient 
records from individuals who have no business whatsoever getting 
that information and dealing with the personal medical records of 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Reform Party proposed amendments to Bill C-6. 
They would have ensured the personal health care records of 
Canadians remained protected so unscrupulous individuals who have 
no business whatsoever in knowing about another individual's 
personal medical records would not have access to them. This is 
not included in this legislation. The Canadian Medical 
Association and civil liberties groups have asked the minister 
repeatedly to amend the bill so it will protect the personal 
health care records and personal information of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things have to be drawn up since the feds have 
failed to do this.  The provinces should take the bull by the 
horns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A code of conduct, a code that governs personal health care 
information should be implemented.  It should involve the 
following aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care information should be defined. Who owns this 
information?  Individuals should be permitted to identify 
specific aspects of their records as sensitive.  Patients could 
indicate that certain aspects of their records are sensitive and 
absolutely nobody could have access to that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would require restructuring the health care records to allow 
different levels of access by different individuals.  It would 
require electronic health care records to separate the fields 
that can be used to identify individuals.  A uniform consent form 
to release personal information should be established.  The 
keeping of audit trails would be required.  Obligations 
respecting the security of information should be imposed. 
Protocols for third party access to personal information must be 
developed.  Oversight mechanisms should be established or 
existing data protection oversight bodies should be used to 
review legislation and policy issues relating to this. 
Transparency of the collection, use and disclosure of personal 
information must be ensured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those holding personal health care information would be required 
to inform individual patients of their rights relating to their 
information and provide civil rights to redress the statutory 
penalties and misuse of this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only should this be applied to health care information, but 
it is important that it be applied to banking information, 
personal information relating to finances, welfare payments and 
other social issues the federal government relates to 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the larger issue of e-commerce in Canada. 
Our country is significantly lacking in our ability to compete in 
the dot-com world.  Dot-com companies are taking the world by 
storm and they are on the cutting edge of the new economy today. 
The vast majority of dot-com companies are in the United States. 
We can see by corollary that very few of the dot-com companies 
are in Canada.  Why is it so few of the dot-com companies are in 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks to a lack of innovation.  It does not rest with the 
people in our country; it rests with a structural problem in 
Canada which starts with the education system which has provided 
many of our finest individuals.  Individuals who have studied and 
taught in Canadian universities such as McMaster which has an 
excellent program, or Waterloo which has a better one.  Students 
on the cutting edge of information technology are flocking to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People at these universities and in the private sector tell us 
that they yearn for these people to stay in Canada. 
Unfortunately very few of them do, not because they do not want 
to stay in Canada and not because they do not feel compelled to 
contribute to our economy. 
They find that Canada's economy and the environment under which 
they work in the information technology field are so far behind 
those of the United States and other countries that they leave 
Canada. They leave with a broken heart. They would like to stay 
here but we are very far behind.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critically important for the Minister of Industry to work 
with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National 
Revenue.  They must develop an acute strategic emergency plan to 
ensure that our students who are graduates from our fine 
universities and are experts in computers and information 
technology stay in Canada. The government must address the issue 
of taxes, the rules and regulations which are choking off the 
ability of our companies to compete in this new IT world. If we 
fail to do that, we will have a serious problem on our hands in 
the future and there will be a vacuum in our economy which will 
be very difficult to fill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I impress upon the government the urgent nature of dealing with 
the privacy issues that I have mentioned.  It must institute with 
the provinces rules and regulations to govern privacy issues.  It 
is also equally important to develop an urgent strategic plan of 
action to work in connection with the private sector and the 
educational leaders, the academia.  An integrated program must be 
developed with the government and educational facilities on the 
tax structure and rules and regulations at the federal, 
provincial and municipal levels to ensure that Canada can take 
advantage of today's IT wave.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,  we are again 
debating Bill C-6 or rather the amendments by the Senate.  This 
bill is important to the government, which promised it in its 
throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided to speed up the process and hurry the 
bill through in the fall. It has decided now to adopt the 
Senate's amendments.  Bill C-6, it must be remembered, is 
legislation to protect personal information, but its primary 
intent is consumer or individual protection.  In fact, in nine 
provinces in Canada, with a few exceptions, there was no 
legislation where the parties could be covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, there is a consumer protection act.  The 
federal government decided to bring in a personal information 
bill, which is a bit misleading.  The intent behind it all is to 
promote, particularly, from what we have seen in the 
definitions, to promote the development of e-commerce, even if it 
means at times rounding off corners and not properly protecting 
personal information that an individual might provide in the 
course of such transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, the situation was examined in the bill. The debate 
began over two or three years ago—at the time my colleague from 
Mercier was shepherding the matter within the Bloc Quebecois—and 
many groups told the federal government they were not in favour 
of its meddling in this area.  Why?  For a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, as far as Quebec is concerned, we have to 
understand that a consumer protection legislation is in place, 
which has been regulating for a number of years the whole issue 
of protecting personal information, among other things, in the 
context of e-commerce. Naturally, this area is evolving fast, but 
there are definitions, including those of consent and signature. 
A signature on a traditional document is no problem, but consent 
in the context of electronic transactions is something else. We 
have our own definitions, based on the tradition of civil law. 
Our approach is clearly different from that of the federal 
government, which is based on the common law. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1730

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its legislation, the federal government has to define these 
concepts. What is a consent? What is a signature? There are many 
terms to define. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first difficulty arises from the definitions being 
different. Our approaches are different. It is important to know 
that, in Quebec, every business and person was covered by the 
consumer protection legislation. Even businesses and 
institutions under federal jurisdiction complied with that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say “Look, it is clear to everyone that federal 
legislation applies to everyone”. 
What is not clear is, in the absence of a federal legislation, 
do they legally have to comply with the Quebec one? They did not 
take a chance and they did so. Of course, they did not take the 
risk of going to the courts, being turned down and being told 
that Quebec had jurisdiction in this area and that, because the 
federal government did not take up this jurisdiction, the Quebec 
government had been able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different supreme court decisions, and I do not want 
to get into the whole technical debate on this, but some people 
say it is possible they were legally subjected to the 
legislation; others say no, the courts should decide on the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would have been a good opportunity for the federal 
government members, these great champions of flexibility, such 
as the intergovernmental affairs minister and those in front of 
us here, who are telling us they have an extremely flexible 
regime. If that is the case, why then does the federal 
legislation not say that, in the case of provinces, such as 
Quebec, that have consumer protection legislation, such 
legislation applies? It would then take precedence. It was 
becoming clear for everyone in Quebec tthat it was the Quebec 
legislation that applied, including for federal institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be understood is, it is very rare that businesses are 
not engaged in commerce elsewhere: in the Canadian market, in 
the American market and everywhere else in the world. 
Most of a company's activities can be subject to provincial 
jurisdiction in some cases, and to federal jurisdiction in 
others as a result of this bill, because there are some aspects 
that deal with foreign trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practical terms, we will have many problems because 
businesses will sometimes be subject to one jurisdiction and 
sometimes to another. If the government wants to protect the 
consumer, surely it is not by making things more confusing that 
it will provide better protection. People will have great 
difficulty understanding their options; when someone feels he 
has been wronged, he must understand what remedies are available 
to him. And things are much clearer and simpler in Quebec's 
legislation than they will be in the federal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, depending on the type of information involved and on 
the legislation to which it is subject, people will have a 
particular recourse against a business, a different type of 
remedy or another organisation to turn to defend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we will have a concrete example of the problems we face 
when two jurisdictions are involved in one area. There are many 
problems. First of all, for the consumers we want to protect, 
but also for businesses that have to abide by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business people tell us constantly “Look, let us do our work. We 
are entrepreneurs. Stop bothering us with all this paperwork”. 
But now, in Quebec, this bill will add a second level of 
jurisdiction regarding personal information protection. 
And businesses will have to deal with both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the Liberals want to push Quebec aside. They want 
sole jurisdiction, as they will have outside Quebec. They want 
to legislate for Canada as a whole. The fact that Quebec already 
has legislation is the least of their worries. Indeed, none of 
the Liberal members on the other side has risen to remind this 
House that Quebec already has a solid jurisdiction that deserves 
to be recognised. They probably did not know about it. They did 
not say anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And these are the people who speak of flexibility, who tell us 
that things must be clear. These people, who are also apostles 
of clarity, are the ones who give us legislation that will make 
the protection of personal information very confusing. 
One need only read the minutes of the most recent hearings of 
the Senate committee, to see that the experts do not agree on 
jurisdiction, on the scope of the legislation and of the 
definitions. It is a real jumble.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the so-called experts were saying, those lawyers 
from whom we will be seeking advice. Businesses that need advice 
go to legal firms. The people we heard all had different 
versions of what that meant in practice. But we should not worry 
about that. The federal government did not wait long to go all 
over the world claiming that it had an act protecting privacy 
and electronic documents. That was the objective. Then, they can 
say “Look at how good Canada is”. They will go and brag all over 
the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not supposed to worry if the system does not work in 
practice. This is the least of their concerns. 
All they want is to be able to say that there is something in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from the health sector in Ontario have been critical of 
the bill from the beginning. They were very worried about the 
transfer of personal medical files, and they ought to be since 
the objective of the bill is to promote electronic commerce. 
They were saying that the commercial approach does not exist in 
the medical field and that the bill would not have any 
application in their sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government that said no will support the Senate amendments 
and exempt the health sector for one more year. This decision is 
a direct consequence of the lobbying by the Ontario health 
sector. We will wait one more year. Finally, that will give the 
health sector almost two years to think of ways to better define 
consent in the context of the electronic transfer of personal 
medical data. 
The amendments exclude the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning, we said that there were a lot of 
problems with this act. The government was in a rush. It wanted 
to act fast. We have known that since the beginning. These 
groups from Ontario who have won their battle in the Senate had 
come to the committee to say so. They had written to all the 
members sitting on the committee. They had repeatedly phoned our 
offices to tell us that it did not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was in a great hurry. It did not want to talk 
about such amendments here in the House, or as little as 
possible. It wanted things to move quickly. It wanted the whole 
thing submitted rapidly to the Senate where they have a bunch of 
friends controlling the situation. There are not too many 
problems on that side. They wanted to allow them to give the 
impression that they do work from time to time. So they 
suggested amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very curious to know who wrote those amendments. Let us 
presume that they were done in the Senate, although they could 
very well have been inspired by the Department of Health or the 
Department of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have the Senate amendments. We cannot support those 
amendments, even if they represent an improvement over the 
present act, because this act makes absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were all sorts of things. Later, I will quote the Minister 
of Industry. It is true that, in theor, the act could allow the 
minister to exempt certain sectors or areas of activities. It is 
not in the act. The minister is keeping some leeway to do so— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Behind the scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Exactly. Cabinet could, behind closed doors, 
exempt certain sectors. 
It might say “Quebec will indeed have jurisdiction over that 
area, and we are recognizing your ability to make such a 
decision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person responsible for this in the Quebec government is 
David Cliche, the minister responsible for the information 
highway and government services. He wrote to the minister, and 
his letter was not filled with insults, to request a meeting, 
saying “I wish to meet with you to review the situation, which 
is of concern to you as it is to us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out that, among the organizations that 
appeared before the committee during the hearings—not the Senate 
committee hearings but those of the House committee—were groups 
from Quebec, including the Commission d'accès à l'information, 
the organization supervising the Quebec legislation, which came 
to tell us “We already have legislation in Quebec; be careful of 
what you are going to do. We do not think your bill is a very 
good idea, it will cause confusion”. This warning was ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other organizations came, organizations like the Conseil central 
de la CSN, which the minister referred to as “mothball clubs”. I 
do not know that expression also applied to the Conseil du 
patronat. It too came and it told us that our legislation did 
not make sense. A group of friends of the minister came to say 
that the legislation would cause problems. They presented a 
brief to this effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chambre des notaires came to say the same thing. The bar, 
the organization representing lawyers, those who advise 
businesses and interpret this legislation, said “No, do not do 
that, do not pass Bill C-6, or else exempt Quebec from its 
application”.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups went as far as to ask that Quebec's jurisdiction be 
recognized in the federal legislation. They said “Everything 
will be clear. We will know what to expect. We will know what to 
do and we will comply with Quebec's legislation. If Quebecers 
wish more or less rigorous legislation, they will put pressure 
on their provincial government. We have a democracy in Quebec. 
There are election campaigns. There are pressure groups. There 
is a public consultation process with parliamentary committees, 
for example. We live in a democracy. Groups will be heard. But 
it will be clear that there will be only one piece of 
legislation”. But, this advice went unheeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that, on October 19, Mr. Cliche wrote to the 
Minister of Industry. But the government made sure the bill 
passed second and third readings first. Then the minister 
replied “I wish to thank you for your letter”, and went on to 
explain how Canada badly needed the legislation. “The bill has 
already been read a third time in the House of Commons, he said. 
It has just been passed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How unfortunate, the minister had not read his mail earlier. He 
had just realized that the bill had been passed and wrote “I 
agree that we should meet to talk about this”, once the bill had 
been passed. Could he not have met with the minister to list his 
arguments or even just to hear what the minister had to say, 
incorporate amendments into the bill at that time, and come back 
with more amendments, as required? 
He could have kept some leeway and told us: “Whatever can be 
done through order in council will be done that way.” Instead, 
he says: “Our officials should work together in order to discuss 
the exemption that will apply to organizations subject to the 
Quebec legislation”, because he would be in a position to grant 
some exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning, the industry minister said: “Yes, Quebec will 
be exempted.  We could meet to find out which sectors could 
receive an exemption.”  The speech has taken a very different 
turn.  In a few weeks he will be telling us: “In the end, 
nobody was exempted; the legislation will apply to one and all.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know them.  It is always the same process and the same 
conclusion.  These people are steely-brained. According to them, 
the federal government has a monopoly on truth, efficiency, etc. 
and it knows best what is good for us and what it should impose 
on us, in that area as in others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that before.  I have been here for six years and 
for six years things have been the same.  Some have witnessed 
that for much longer.  It has always been the case and things 
are even getting worse.  I could speak about many other areas, 
but, in this case, we are talking about a statutory area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the areas where the federal government can spend its 
money. The temptation to control is even greater, even more so 
because the federal government holds the financial levers. That 
is why, for example, the federal government is withdrawing from 
areas like health and education and has almost stopped making 
the transfer payments it used to make before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government itself decides how the moneys will be 
primarily allocated in education and health. It leaves the 
provincial governments stuck with major administrative problems 
in the management of basic services, including in health. I am 
also concerned about education, because with the whole debate on 
health, we must not forget what is happening in the education 
sector, which is just as important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But their one concern here is visibility, visibility and 
visibility for the federal government. As for the rest, 
including effectiveness, the provinces will administer the 
programs and, therefore, will be the ones criticized if things 
do not work. The federal government is saying “We are keeping 
what is good to manage, they can have the rest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support the various amendments, particularly those 
that are in response to the pressures of the Ontario lobby in 
the health sector. Such criticism was not voiced in Quebec. Why 
is that? It is because we have a consumer protection act. We 
also have, through the supervision that can be done by Quebec's 
access to information commission, processes and recourses, which 
means that the communication of personal information is already 
regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, no one phoned our offices to say “Listen, we need 
federal legislation to protect personal information”. This is 
clearly an area that people must know about. The Quebec 
government will have to increasingly promote an awareness of its 
act and of the possible remedies for individuals, because 
electronic commerce is developing at an incredible rate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, from time to time there are problems, as we saw last 
week—there will always be smart guys, faster than technology, who 
can paralyse the system—nevertheless e-commerce is bound to expand 
at a phenomenal rate. It is all right to have regulations, but 
we have ours already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada wants its own, this is all right too, but why impose 
its views, its way of doing things on us, especially in an area 
that comes under what the Prime Minister himself calls the 
Napoleonic Code, that is to say the Civil Code. The Prime 
Minister is still stuck in the past, but true enough, it is 
inspired by the Napoleonic tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that we, in Quebec, are distinct, that it has been 
recognized, and that there is even a resolution of this House 
recognizing the distinct character of our institutions and the 
Civil Code. And yet, the bill before us does not recognize the 
Quebec government's ability to manage something which clearly 
comes under, which should directly come under the Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is worrisome because it is probably the beginning of an 
increasing trend on the part of the federal government to move 
in in a roundabout way. A nudge here and a nudge there, and it 
occupies more and more space, a little bit in the area of 
health, a little bit here and a little bit there. What is 
worrisome with regard to the amendments concerning health care 
is that when the federal government comes to an agreement with 
Ontario in a couple of years, will it come up with an new way to 
deal with transmitting personal information that it will then 
impose on Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen? It is very worrisome. Are we going to give the 
government a blank check and say “Yes, in a couple of years, not 
necessarily through legislative channels, cabinet will make 
regulations in the area of health care, which could have an 
impact on what we do in Quebec”. This government is telling us 
it wants to give the provinces enough leeway in the area of 
health care, but it will not do it in this particular instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we will vote against these amendments. Mr. Speaker,

rise on a point of order. In the Standing Orders, I found this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turtlenecks are not permitted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has already indicated to a member wearing a 
turtleneck that his vote could not be recorded.  I therefore ask 
you to ask the member wearing a turtleneck to leave the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The House has a new book of 
procedure and I refer the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis, and all 
other members, to the citation on page 514, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contemporary practice and unwritten rule require, therefore, 
that male Members wear a jacket, shirt and tie as standard 
dress.  Clerical collars have been allowed, although ascots and 
turtlenecks have been ruled inappropriate for male Members 
participating in debate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to note 86, which says:  “On occasion, male Members not 
wearing a tie have been permitted to vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, for the time being, we may continue with the practice 
described in the new book.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am up tonight in relation to a question I asked the 
Minister of Health in the House in December 1999, just a few 
short months ago. 
It was on the drug approval process, the very cumbersome time 
delayed process that we have in the country.  In that question 
for the minister I was talking specifically of a cancer drug 
called Rituxan, which has been approved in 40 other countries of 
the world but not yet in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my hand I have a number of letters supporting the approval 
process of this drug.  We have patients in Canada who could use 
the drug at this very moment, but it is not available to them 
simply because of the very cumbersome time delay that the drug 
approval process has to go through at Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drug in question, Rituxan, is what we call an 
immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody which has a unique ability 
to bind itself to cancer cells without the toxic effects that are 
often associated with other cancer treating drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so disturbing about this process is that other countries 
have had this drug for the last couple of years.  I want to go 
through the 40 some countries that I mentioned previously.  Some 
of the countries that presently have the drug are Australia, 
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.S. 
In total 40 countries can now use this drug to treat patients 
with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument could be that we can get the drug under special 
warrant in Canada, which is absolutely true, but that is a very 
cumbersome process and a very expensive one.  Until that drug is 
approved by Health Canada no insurance company will cover the its 
cost.  Nor will any health jurisdiction in the country cover it 
through the medicare system in Canada.  In other words, the drug 
is denied simply because it is not approved.  We have to improve 
upon that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always have to exercise caution in the approval of any drug, 
but we are talking about a drug that was approved in 40 other 
jurisdictions.  I want to give the minister credit as well 
because I did speak to him on this privately outside the Chamber 
in addition to the question that I asked and he has paid some 
special attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information I am now receiving from Health Canada—and we 
have to be very careful on this because there is no way of saying 
for sure that this is going to happen—indicates that probably 
within the next couple of weeks this drug will be approved.  I 
hope this is the case.  I am going to give the minister credit 
for speeding this process along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is we have to come up with a better way of doing it, 
realizing that safety always has to be paramount.  I want to 
suggest that we take a very close look at the—

Madam Speaker, members are entitled to a warning when they have a 
minute left.  I want unanimous consent to have a chance to finish 
my remarks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are authorized for sale in Canada once they have 
successfully gone through the drug review process.  This process 
is the means by which a drug application is reviewed by 
scientists in the therapeutic products program of Health Canada 
to assess the safety, efficacy and quality of a drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process the safety and well-being of Canadians is 
the paramount concern.  Health Canada strives to make significant 
therapeutic advances available to Canadians as quickly as 
possible consistent with public safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's objective is to be competitive internationally 
with respect to drug review and approval and, during the past 
five years, it has cut in half the time needed to review the 
average presentation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has been and continues to be committed to ensuring 
the greatest efficiencies in the drug review process.  To do 
this, the therapeutic product program in consultation with 
stakeholders is pursuing several initiatives to further 
streamline the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Rituxan is a new drug for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma. So far, it has not been approved in Canada, but 
patients can obtain it through the special access program. 
Practitioners sometimes resort to drugs not approved in Canada 
for the treatment of serious or life-threatening illnesses, when 
conventional treatments have been unsuccessful or are not 
appropriate.

Canada has a mandate to authorize the sale of these drugs to 
practitioners.  This mandate is administered by the special
