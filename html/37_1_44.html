</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to 
amend the criminal code in order to prohibit the genetic 
manipulation of a human cell, a zygote or an embryo with a view 
to preventing human cloning. Any person guilty of 
such an offence would be liable to a fine, imprisonment or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the pace of scientific discoveries and technical 
advances in biotechnology has accelerated over the last few 
years which forces the legislator to take note of the 
situation.

countries in the world have put on a spurt and, over the last 
few months, quickly passed legislation to prohibit human cloning 
or at the very least to strictly regulate genetic research. In 
Canada, there is nothing at all, there is a legislative vacuum. 
That is why I am introducing this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present two more petitions from citizens of the Peterborough 
area and beyond, including Ajax, Durham, Victoria, Haliburton and 
Brock.  They want the re-establishment of VIA Rail service 
between the city of Peterborough, the county of Peterborough and 
Toronto.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out the environmental advantage of a 
reduction in greenhouse emissions and the health advantages which 
also result from reducing emissions.  They point to the benefits 
to Peterborough in terms of it being an educational and tourist 
destination and a commuter base and the advantages to Toronto in 
terms of relieving traffic in that area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
another petition on behalf of people suffering from end stage 
kidney disease.  The petitioners point out that whereas kidney 
dialysis and successful transplantations have helped and 
certainly do help, there are not enough organs for 
transplantation and dialysis services are very limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore they urge the federal government to support the 
development of the bioartificial kidney which will replace both 
dialysis and transplantation as a source of relief for people 
with end stage kidney disease.

decided to give the hon. member the benefit of the doubt. 
Therefore, Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted upon.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTIONS IN AMENDMENT

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK40">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No.1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-9, in Clause 
2, be amended by replacing lines 31 to 33 on page 1 with the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“committee of the House of Commons that normally considers 
electoral matters, after consultation with the committee of 
the Senate that normally considers those matters.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, the aim of this amendment is to prevent 
our being obliged to consult or include the Senate in amendments 
to the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a bit of a paradox, in the case of a law that 
applies to elections that apply to members of the House of 
Commons, to have people not elected involved.  I would point out 
that I personally have nothing against those who make up the 
other House. 
We meet them fairly regularly and many of those I have met are 
competent and nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But one thing must be remembered.  We must not forget that they 
are often appointed by the Prime Minister of the House of 
Commons.  Who does the Prime Minister appoint?  Generally, he 
appoints people he knows well and whose work, often partisan, he 
values.  One way to compensate them for the work they have done 
is to appoint them to the other House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we cannot rule out the fact that they have experience 
in a number of instances, but sometimes the subjective criterion 
is left up to the Prime Minister.  There was the vote we had 
yesterday calling for a public inquiry on the conduct of the 
Prime Minister in his riding, especially given the fact that he 
himself appoints the ethics counsellor who reports to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the people in the other House should not be 
consulted on this.  They are just more people who would offer an 
opinion on ways to change the ridings and electoral boundaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When an election is involved, members of the opposition are 
entitled to speak, but if the dice are loaded from the start, if 
things are decided by friends of the Prime Minister or by people 
he considers his supporters, in principle, these people will 
tend to support the recommendations of the party in power, the 
party of the Prime Minister who appointed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am moving this amendment.  It is out of respect 
for the people and because I am concerned about the continuity 
of this institution, which in our opinion, has become obsolete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time we have taken such a stand. 
In 1993 it was part of our election platform. We have 
consistently held that position since we first came here in 
1993. We have always been opposed to having joint committees 
that include elected members of parliament and non-elected people 
to discuss, particularly in this case, electoral issues. Most of 
these non-elected people are not former members of parliament. 
They have not been confronted to electoral reality and they 
do not know what they are talking about in this regard even 
though they may have contributed, in a partisan way, to getting 
someone elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois feels that the proposed amendment 
is very relevant. Mr. Speaker, we thank you for having accepted 
it and thus allowing the House to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invite our colleagues from all political parties, and 
particularly opposition parties, to support it. I am thinking 
more specifically of Canadian Alliance members. 
Even though we do not necessarily share their view, we arrive at 
the same conclusion. They are hoping for an elected Senate 
while we want to get rid of that institution. But we agree on 
the problem which is that the people in the other place are not 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully we can get the support of the other two political 
parties, namely the New Democratic Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party. Members of these parties have already said 
that we should examine this issue among elected representatives 
and consult the public. We should get people's opinions because 
we work for them first and foremost. It is important to know 
what the public thinks because it is the public who elect us 
to this House. This must be done in the best possible 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People must be confident that this parliament works in the best 
possible democratic spirit. 
Since I have a few more minutes, I might add in this connection 
that this government sees itself as the great champion of 
democracy on the international level.  We must admit that it has 
acquired a certain reputation for this, so much so that some 
MPs, even opposition ones, are occasionally called upon to 
monitor elections in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the subcommittee on human rights, I know that 
Canada sees itself as a promoter of human rights.  On occasion I 
have trouble adding my voice to those who say Canada is a 
champion in this field, when I see the major shortcomings that 
still exist within the country, particularly as far as campaign 
funding is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the rules stand at present, big business can make campaign 
contributions. 
We have long opposed this and our last suggestion was that it 
at least be restricted to $5,000 or less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with the people across the floor, or anyone in 
this institution, ministers in particular, and the Prime 
Minister, making a contribution internationally with delegations 
or on other occasions making statements about how other 
countries ought to operate more democratically, ought to respect 
human rights more.  However, we must ensure at the same time 
that we here in Canada really respect this evolution or, how 
shall I put it, this affirmation of these democratic concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason behind my amendment this morning which 
was seconded by my colleague the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
That is the reason behind this representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank in advance all opposition members and 
those in the Liberal ranks as 
well who dare to support us.  A number of them have often told 
me that they are not always totally thrilled—like last night—to 
toe the party line.  They are sometimes obliged not to follow 
their convictions.  In this case, since elections are concerned, 
I trust they will be faithful to their convictions and 
think of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the hon. 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. By this amendment and 
by this motion, he is showing that he is capable of expanding his 
horizons and that he is an extremely versatile member of 
parliament. We know the work that my colleague from 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has been doing in the 
shipbuilding area, in shipyards not only in Quebec but also in 
Canada. Our colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has 
managed to get all shipyard owners and unions throughout Canada 
to reach a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the fact he has moved this amendment to Bill C-9, an act 
to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act, shows that he is capable of speaking out on 
other issues. Thus, the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière is not a one issue man; he is a 
versatile man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, during the short time that has been allotted to 
me I would still like to add for our viewers and for our 
colleagues here in the House who are listening very carefully to 
my speech, that this amendment is being made to page 1 of the 
bill. It would amend section 18.1 of the elections act and would 
boil down to changing the role of the other House with respect 
to adopting amendments to the elections act. Specifically, the 
chief electoral officer would be able to use an electronic 
voting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
About ten days ago, Mr. Kingsley tabled his report on the last 
general election held on November 27, 2000. We will have the 
opportunity to come back to it and to suggest further 
amendments to the elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I can say that it is in several ridings of Quebec and 
Alberta— and I know this has not happened by chance because 
there is a majority of Alliance members in Alberta and a 
majority of Bloc Quebecois members in Quebec— that there were 
the most problems during the last election held November 27.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In only 10 minutes I do not have time to list all the 
problems with unco-operative returning officers and unsuitable 
polling stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a space no bigger than 10 square feet there were six or 
seven polling divisions. According to the elections act, 
candidates can visit polling stations, shake hands with the 
representatives of all parties. We could literally see for whom 
people would be voting. Some polling stations were located very 
far from the homes of elderly people whose mobility is 
sometimes reduced and that was to discourage them from voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell the House that the Bloc Quebecois is drawing up a 
list of the problems from the November 27, 2000 election and 
we will have an opportunity to come back to them.  I personally 
advised Mr. Kingsley that there will have to be improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduced by the government House leader gives 
returning officers authority to try alternative voting means, 
including electronic voting.  The bill provides that the 
introduction of such a process would require the approval of 
both Houses, the House of Commons and the other chamber, whose 
members as we know are not elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being upfront.  The purpose of our amendment is to take 
away the right of the Senate—the other chamber—to give its 
approval and amend the clause such that only consultation is 
required.  We realize that there is a difference between 
consulting and obtaining approval. 
We are aware of this difference and we have moved this amendment 
deliberately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done so because 301 members of this House, whatever 
their political stripe, recognize that members of this House 
were all democratically elected—some races were tighter than 
others—by the people of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what goes on in other countries, nobody in Canada or 
in Quebec voted in the November 27 election with a machine gun 
to their back.  People expressed their choice freely.  The 
result is the 37th parliament.  In my view, the 301 members here 
are entirely legitimate, regardless of their political 
affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem arises when a non-elected House is given the power to 
decide how elected representatives will be elected. 
I do not know whether that is clear; I am getting lost myself. 
There may have been too many “elected's” in my sentence, but I 
think the House understands.  The problem is giving to another 
appointed body—a body that is rewarded, therefore not 
elected—the power to decide how elected representatives will be 
elected.  This makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be consulted because it is supposed to be a House of 
sober second thought.  We know that under British parliamentary 
tradition the House of Commons represents commoners.  We are 
the representatives of the common people, while the other 
chamber represents the aristocracy, the lords in the British 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but I prefer to be a member of the House which 
represents the population, the ordinary people, those who every 
four years can tell us “You are doing a good job, we will keep you” 
or “You are not doing a good job, you are out”. This is 
democracy and this is why, in democracy, we go from one 
government to the other, which is called state succession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important to take away from the Senate the power 
to decide about electronic voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> It should be abolished.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> As my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has 
just said, the solution would be to abolish the Senate. But we 
must not forget that in the present system, when pollsters ask 
Quebecers about the Senate, 84% are in favour of abolishing it. 
In the other provinces, they want a triple E Senate, a Senate 
with more powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will probably not see the abolition of the Senate in this 
lifetime. We in Quebec, however, could go about it differently 
through sovereignty for Quebec. Once we are sovereign there 
will be no more Senate, no more Governor General, no more 
lieutenant-governor, but only government of the people by the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I am running out of time, but I would like to talk 
about a number of members of the other place. Are we, as elected 
representatives, prepared to give non-elected parliamentarians 
like Lise Bacon, a former Liberal minister appointed by 
Liberals, John Bryden, a Liberal senator from New Brunswick, 
Ross Fitzpatrick, a bagman from British Columbia, and the list 
goes on, the power to decide for us, we who represent the people 
and speak for the people in this House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to speak today in favour of the amendment put forward 
by my hon. colleague, the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggests that the committee reviewing any possible 
electronic voting or voting changes would only seek consultation 
from the Senate and that the committee of the Senate would not 
exercise a veto over any proposed changes to the voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent idea.  A similar amendment, which I thought 
was a good idea, was proposed by members of the Bloc 
Quebecois in committee.  I believe the suggestion was actually an 
improvement over what was suggested when the bill was being 
reviewed in committee because it allowed the committee of the 
Senate to actually provide some guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can benefit from the wisdom in the Senate.  The Senate was 
originally understood to be, as we all know, a chamber of sober 
second thought.  In fact, this might be sober first thought, as 
it were, but nonetheless a sober commentary, not an actual veto. 
I think that is a very profitable thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, giving a veto over changes, which is the way the 
relevant section of the proposed law is currently worded, would 
give a committee of an unelected chamber actual control under the 
law of Canada over a part of the election law of the country.  I 
think that is a precedent that has already been set, but it is a 
slippery slope down which we do not want to continue where 
unelected people have greater and greater control and those of us 
who are elected, and therefore those who elect us, are less and 
less in control of the political agenda.  This is particularly 
true when we are speaking of the actual election law of the land, 
surely the most sacred of all our democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion I would make is that the Senate actually would 
have a valuable role and a Senate committee ought to have a veto 
over any election law changes if the Senate itself were elected. 
When the amendment came up at committee meetings, I raised the 
point that it would be very advantageous if in the future we were 
to allow for greater control from the Senate if it were ever 
elected. 
I know I differ from my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and the 
New Democrats in favouring an elected Senate as opposed to the 
abolition of it, but there is a valuable role a second elected 
chamber can play, particularly when it is elected on a different 
basis from the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many countries around the world have an elected second chamber. 
I am thinking here for example of Switzerland, the United States, 
Australia and Germany which use different systems.  We forget 
sometimes that prior to 1867 the united province of Canada did 
have an elected second chamber.  Perhaps one of the greatest 
steps backward that occurred at the time of confederation, when 
so many other good measures were put forward and set in stone, 
was that we went from an elected to an unelected second chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois are particularly sensitive 
to the problems of having an unelected body practising a veto 
over the electoral law because of the fact that Quebec has not 
that long ago had the experience of having its own unelected 
second chamber.  It was only in the 1960s that a constitutional 
amendment was passed removing that unelected second chamber in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently had the experience of going through an old issue of a 
magazine, I think it was the French version of <I>MacLeans</I> 
published around 1965, which listed all the then incumbents in 
Quebec's second chamber.  It included the dates members were 
appointed and their ages.  One member on that list had been born 
in the 1870s, a man practically as old as confederation itself. 
This was an unelected member sitting in that chamber and serving 
out his time.  As it turned out, he was a very long lived 
gentleman who had been appointed back in antediluvian times and 
continued to serve as a member of that chamber.  I have no idea 
of his attendance record or of his mental state but he continued 
to function and, along with a small group of colleagues, to have 
the ability to block all the laws of the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact that upper house sometimes did block laws when its own 
privileges were being attacked.  It was very concerned about its 
own privileges.  I do not think we want to see that kind of 
power, which already exists to some degree in the Senate, in 
Canada.  We do not want to see that kind of power being used by 
committees over business that relates purely and entirely to this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we have that distinction as long as 
this is the only democratic Chamber in the country.  As long as 
the country does not have any form of referendum law, citizen 
initiative, recall law or any of the basic accoutrements of a 
democratic society, as found in the more democratic societies of 
the world, then surely we do not need unelected bodies having 
direct control over changes that would make this place more 
democratic and the manner in which members are elected to this 
Chamber more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly refer to the concept of electronic voting and 
other types of voting that was suggested in the original text of 
the bill.  That is actually a very valuable provision.  We should 
be considering the possibility of electronic voting for citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was seeking election there were a number of people 
unable to cast ballots because they were ill, incapacitated or 
out of the country.  Proxy voting allows to some extent for this 
problem to be dealt with, but it is an awkward system.  It is 
possible that it could be improved upon.  I know all members 
would want to see any improvement in access to voting for 
Canadian citizens to go forward.  The idea of having some 
provision that permits for the potential for electronic voting 
for Canadians is something that should be encouraged. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words in support of the motion put 
forward by the member from the Bloc Quebecois. It is really to 
remove the veto from the Senate in terms of legislation we are 
debating today concerning the Elections Act of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the most perverse power we could give the Senate is a 
veto over election laws because its members are unelected.  Why 
the government would insist on doing that is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Senate of Canada are appointed.  The Senate is 
not democratic and its members are not elected nor accountable. 
Its members do not have constituencies.  They do not face voters 
and they do not get swayed by public opinion.  However the Senate 
does have veto power in terms of changing the electoral law of 
the country for those of us who are elected, who have 
constituencies and who go back to our ridings and face our 
electorate time and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very perverse type of democracy if one were to define 
what democracy is.  I therefore certainly support the Bloc 
Quebecois in terms of the amendment before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate issue has been around for a long time.  My 
recollection of history is that when the country was founded 
every province had an upper house and a lower house, whether it 
was Ontario or Quebec, the Atlantic provinces, Prince Edward 
Island and so on.  I think even Manitoba had that.  I think six 
or seven of the provinces had upper and lower houses.  One by one 
their upper houses were abolished.  I think Quebec was the last 
one to abolish the upper house. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1968. The Quebec Legislative Council, Quebec's senate, 
was abolished. It was the red chamber and it was abolished in 
the province of Quebec. The same thing happened in every 
Canadian province where there was a second chamber. It was 
abolished because Canadian provinces did not need two 
chambers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have an anachronism in the House of Commons.  About 
an hour ago, while speaking at a public policy forum here in the 
city, one of the questions that came up was that of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have an unelected Senate.  All the polls I have seen show 
that about 5% of the people support the Senate and yet the 
government across the way does nothing about it.  There is a 
debate in the country whether or not we should reform the Senate, 
elect it or abolish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years many attempts have been made to change the 
Senate, to elect the Senate.  I remember back in 1991-92, right 
before Charlottetown, when there were committees of the House of 
Commons, the Beaudoin-Edwards and the Beaudoin—Dobbie 
committees. The most difficult issue we had to face was what to 
do with the Senate.  That was the very last issue with which we 
dealt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the three parties of the House of Commons 
came to an agreement about reducing the powers of the Senate, 
ensuring it had equal representation, not from each province but 
from the five regions of the country.  We had the Atlantic, 
Ontario, Quebec, the prairies and British Columbia, along with 
the north. It would have given each of the five regions in the 
country 20% of the seats in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we all agreed, which was difficult for some New Democrats, 
but I was the party spokesman at the time, to elect the Senate 
and to elect it entirely by proportional representation.  That 
was a three party agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a great Liberal Party enthusiast from Hamilton cringing in 
his seat, but that is the record of the House.  If he goes back 
to the Library of Parliament he would see where his party stood. 
His spokesperson then was André Ouellet, the former minister of 
external affairs from Papineau who is now the chairman of Canada 
Post.  The Liberal Party, led by the present Prime Minister, 
endorsed the idea of an elected Senate by PR, with reduced powers 
and equal representation, not from each province but from the 
five regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to that unanimous proposal of parliament was that 
it went to that great Canadian institution, which is also a 
little bit undemocratic, called the first ministers' conference. 
The first ministers, Prime Minister Mulroney and the premiers, 
took only a few minutes before they rejected the idea proposed by 
the House of Commons and came up with the proposal in the 
Charlottetown accord which was still an appointed Senate with 
reduced powers and an increase in the number of seats in the 
House of Commons. It was a convoluted dog's breakfast that was 
turned down by the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are back in the same place.  During Meech, as 
well, there was an attempt made around that time to change the 
Senate.  I think at that time there was a proposition that the 
Prime Minister would appoint senators from a list provided to the 
Prime Minister by each of the provinces.  That actually did not 
make it into the Meech Lake accord but it was one of the 
proposals at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been all kinds of different proposals on the Senate. 
The triple-e movement, which was spawned in part in western 
Canada, requires that every province have an equal number of 
senators.  We would have a powerful House of Commons and a 
powerful Senate and the two would balance each other off.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That never got off the ground and never will because Ontario and 
Quebec with their population and their power cannot agree, will 
not agree and have never agreed to an equal Senate where Prince 
Edward Island has the same power as Ontario and where New 
Brunswick has the same power as Quebec, if indeed the Senate has 
any powers at all.  If the Senate does not have any powers, why 
even have a Senate if it is just to become a debating chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been all kinds of attempts to reform and change the 
Senate.  Another idea pushed by the Alliance and the Reform Party 
is to start on an ad hoc basis electing senators one by one.  I 
think that would be a great mistake.  If we start electing 
senators one by one at the present time, we would empower these 
people.  We would enshrine in perpetuity the present extremely 
unfair representation in the Senate where British Columbia with 
around three million people would have six senators and New Brunswick 
with 500,000 or 600,000 people would have ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also enshrine the existing powers which are almost as 
strong as the powers of the House of Commons.  It would be 
locking into our constitution a vision that was drafted back in 
the 1860s.  That is not the right vision to pursue.  That is a 
vision that would discriminate, for example, against western 
Canada.  British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
would have six senators; New Brunswick and Nova Scotia would have 
ten; Newfoundland would have six; and Prince Edward Island would 
have four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the position of many people in the Reform Party is that we 
should start electing these senators on an ad hoc basis, as was 
done in the United States many years ago and led to an elected 
senate in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think many Canadians would want province by province 
representation in the Senate today because it does not reflect 
today's population.  It does not reflect the large populations in 
Alberta and British Columbia.  It does not reflect the tiny 
populations in some of the Atlantic provinces.  I do not think 
many Canadians, if we had an elected Senate, would want to have 
the Senate exercise its existing powers, which are pretty awesome 
powers compared with those of the House of Commons.  They are 
very seldom exercised today because the Senate does not have 
legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a dog chasing its tail.  It is a never ending debate. 
It goes on and on.  To get the triple-e we would need a 
constitutional amendment.  At the very best we would need an 
amendment supported by the House of Commons, the Senate and 
two-thirds of the provinces reflecting 50% of the population, a 
never ending debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister at one time played around with the idea of 
Senate abolition.  John Crosbie's biography states that when 
Brian Mulroney was first elected prime minister the first thing 
he wanted to do was to abolish the Senate.  He never got around 
to doing it because of the complexities of the present system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come full circle.  In the final analysis there is no way 
we will ever reform the existing Senate.  There is no way the 
existing Senate will be elected with any significant powers to 
make it worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we elect the existing Senate it will not cost the existing 
$60 million it spends.  Once it is legitimate and elected with 
powers, we could double and triple the cost of the Senate as it 
empowers itself because it is legitimate, because it is elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question whether we need two big, powerful elected bodies. The 
way to go is to abolish the existing Senate and bring the checks 
and balances into the House of Commons by empowering 
parliamentary committees and creating more independence for each 
and every member of parliament through fewer confidence votes, as 
is the case in most parliamentary democracies around the world. 
That is the direction in which we should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we had a backbench revolt on this issue.  It is time 
we empowered ourselves as parliamentarians and said to the 
government that enough is enough, no more of the charade of 
unelected people parading around pretending they have all this 
power and yet have no legitimacy, no democracy and no 
accountability to anyone in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a national disgrace.  It is an eyesore.  In the name of 
democracy, let us change that situation and change it now.  This 
modest amendment by the Bloc will go part way to doing that by 
saying it wants a veto over the election bill.  Instead all we do 
is consult with the Senate, but we cannot veto it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stand and vote for this change.  To hell with the party 
whips.  Let us make that modest change by ourselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
always interesting to see how we grapple in the House with issues 
involving the other place.  I want to put on record my position 
and what I believe to be the position of the government in 
relation to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation governing elections allows the chief 
electoral officer to undertake studies and test or pilot projects 
involving the use of electronic voting in elections.  That was an 
innovation put into the Canada Elections Act adopted by 
parliament last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would agree it is a useful device.  It allows the 
chief electoral officer to alter the way Canadians might vote in 
a test or pilot project without having to change the legislation 
first.  It is forward looking and a little bold.  Parliament 
decided that if we were to allow this test or pilot project to 
occur, we would want the House to approve it first.  I am sure 
Canadians would agree with that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was passing through the other place senators made 
the point that they had been excluded from the process which in 
part pre-empts the existing law on how elections are held. The 
government through the minister gave an undertaking to the Senate 
that when the bill was passed there the government would 
introduce an amendment to address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current bill before the House there is an amendment which 
provides that before such a test or process takes place approval 
would be obtained from both the committee of the House and the 
committee of the Senate that normally deal with those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment before the House now would alter that approval 
process in the bill.  It would call for the House to give its 
approval but for the Senate only to be consulted.  That is the 
proposed change to the bill, but I also point out that a plain 
reading of the motion before us suggests that the House must 
consult the Senate before it gives its approval to electronic 
voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not entirely sure that is what the mover intended.  I am 
not sure it was intended that the House be restricted when it 
gives its approval; perhaps only that the Senate be consulted. In 
any event the amendment as it is now drafted is unclear on that 
point because of the apparent absence of the conjunctive word 
and.  I will not inquire further into that except to say that as 
I read it the proposed amendment may not accomplish precisely 
what the mover wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate wanted the amendment to ensure that its approval was 
obtained before the test or pilot project was adopted.  As all 
members know, the Senate, the other place, wishes to deliver on 
its role as an equivalent house of parliament.  It would not in 
the ordinary course want to be excluded from legislative matters. 
I suspect it would never even permit itself to be excluded from 
the legislative process, but it certainly did notice when the 
bill was passed that it had been excluded from the approval 
process which would allow the pilot project to pre-empt the 
otherwise prevailing laws governing elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in good faith that the Senate requested the amendment. 
The Senate continues to have a strong interest in how elections 
in Canada are run.  It wants to be involved in any change.

should have an exclusive right of approval and the Senate should 
not have any role in making changes to the Canada Elections Act, 
not all but many would say that the Senate could probably make 
some good, objective commentary in the process.  The Senate would 
not be involved in elections.  At present senators are definitely 
not involved in elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House might take umbrage at any suggestion that 
they have a role in elections. but the Senate has a role to play 
when it comes to the framework legislation that governs elections 
and delivers on the charter based rights of Canadians to vote to 
ensure their constitutional democratic system is operating 
properly.  Many experienced senators in the other place 
understand how elections are run and can participate 
constructively in that type of approval process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In delivering on its commitment the government at this point is 
quite certain that the amendment in the bill, not the motion in 
amendment proposed by the hon. member, reflects the undertaking 
given at the time of the passage of the bill last year.  For the 
other reasons mentioned in my remarks I cannot support the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Bloc member for bringing forward 
this motion in amendment.  It is a sincere attempt to improve 
upon a bill which is rather narrow and rather focused in its 
content.  It is a response to a supreme court decision in Queen v 
Figueroa that basically looked at the definition of a political 
party as it appears on a ballot and at the requirement to have a 
certain number of candidates in an election to qualify for the 
right to have a name denoted on a ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is somewhat digressing into a broader issue.  A 
number of members have a very legitimate interest in the issue. 
The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has been a longstanding 
abolitionist of the Senate.  He brings a great deal of knowledge 
and history to the debate.  We have heard his facts as well as 
the comments of other members about what they would prefer to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Conservative Party I am quite proud of the 
fact that real efforts were made to reform, improve and modernize 
the Senate.  Major initiatives were put before the country.  The 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords dealt in great detail with 
the ways in which we could approach the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are recent converts to the cause who suggest the 
Conservative Party has perpetuated the existence of the Senate. 
There were very legitimate attempts to bring the Senate into the 
modern era.  In fairness, when we look at the model in Great 
Britain, the mother of all parliaments, we see that country 
struggling with its upper house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle also talked about the history 
of the provinces, particularly the province of Quebec which most 
recently went through this debate and in its wisdom decided to do 
away with its upper chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very legitimate basis to the motion that has been put 
forward today.  On behalf of the Conservative Party I would 
reluctantly say that this is not the way to go about it.  It 
should not be done in a piecemeal fashion.  I do not say that in 
a derogatory sense, but to exempt the Senate from certain 
legislation while allowing it to continue to perform its function 
on other legislation is not the way to go about changing the 
current system.  It is not the approach we would advocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a legitimate concern when we are talking about 
elections.  This legislation is about elections, yet senators do 
not subject themselves to elections.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to suggest that we simply exempt them from the process 
of sober second thought, of examination of legislation on this 
one bill as opposed to other bills, is not the approach we would 
advocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Conservative Party I do not shy away from 
involving myself.  The party has never shied away from looking at 
how we bring the Senate into the modern era, if at all.  There 
are many members in our party and many senators who realize that 
the system cannot currently bump along and continue to exist in 
its present form.  It is not acceptable.  It is not something 
that the overwhelming majority of Canadians accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate, as it has in the past, continues today to perform a 
very legitimate service, although the fashion in which it is 
constructed is not in favour with most Canadians.  It is not 
popular or politically correct to praise senators, but there are 
many in the Senate who currently take their role extremely 
seriously.  They serve the country with great distinction.  They 
come to the Senate with skills that are of great assistance and 
they continue to be a great asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong to suggest that because senators have never been 
elected it is illegitimate that they sit in the upper chamber and 
preside over medicare improvements, justice issues or issues that 
affect Canadians in a fundamental way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a gathering this morning in the foyer of the Senate 
where they were discussing ways in which the medical community 
could work closer with politicians, both elected and unelected, 
to improve our health care system.  Liberal Senator Kenny 
presided over a Senate committee that has brought forward many 
good ideas which form the basis of the upcoming study that will 
be chaired by the prominent former premier, Mr. Roy Romanow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  If we 
rush headlong into Senate abolition there is a risk of losing a 
great repository of information, knowledge and ability.  That 
would be a shame if that were to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in favour of the amendment.  There is a time and a 
place to go into the issue of Senate reform and the ways we can 
improve our entire democratic system.  There are ways we can 
improve our electoral system and the voting process which is the 
basis of how this place exists and how we interact with Canadians 
at election time.  However, to vilify the institution in its 
entirety and to denigrate individual members is not the approach 
that I would put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are recent converts.  The Canadian Alliance has a senator. 
It is quite interesting how its approach has softened so much, 
now that there is a senator in its midst.  We have to be at least 
intellectually honest when we are discussing this issue.  There 
have been offers in the past for members of the New Democratic 
Party to join the Senate.  To their credit they have remained 
consistent in their position on how they would approach the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion focuses on removing the Senate from how legislation 
would proceed.  If we are to do it, we should do it in an overall 
fashion, not by exempting Senate deliberations on singular bills, 
which is what the amendment would accomplish.

House.  The Canadian Alliance or Reform Party at the time opposed 
the bill.  The Liberals should be ashamed because Bill C-2 had so 
many serious flaws in it that it was not only undemocratic but 
almost anti-democratic.  Bill C-2 made Canada look like a 
dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other technical matters Bill C-9, which is an amendment to 
Bill C-2 passed in the last session, stipulates that if the chief 
electoral officer wishes to examine certain things like 
alternative voting processes such as electronic voting, the 
alternative cannot be used without the approval of both House and 
Senate committees.  Clause 2, which we intend to amend, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief Electoral Officer may carry out studies on voting, 
including studies respecting alternative voting means, and may 
devise and test an electronic voting process for future use in a 
general election or byelection.  Such a process may not be used 
for an official vote without the prior approval of the committees 
of the Senate and the House of Commons that normally considers 
electoral matters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term Senate is used and that is why the amendment is being 
proposed.  I congratulate the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière who moved an amendment which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-9, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing lines 31 to 
33 on page 1 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“committee of the House of Commons that normally considers 
electoral matters, after consultation with the committee of the 
Senate that normally considers those matters.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the amendment because it takes 
the role of the Senate out of the bill.  Our policy book, which 
is dictated by grassroots members of the Canadian Alliance, 
states in section 71: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the election of senators who would then have a 
democratic mandate to carry out their constitutional 
responsibilities.  We will further support the distribution of 
Senate seats on an equal basis determined through constitutional 
discussion with the provinces and territories. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance advocates Senate reform.  Senators try to 
do their job the best way they can.  As co-chair of the Senate 
and House of Commons Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations I 
had the opportunity to work directly with senators.  There are 
senators who work very hard.  There is wisdom in the other 
chamber and we look forward to the sober thought from the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are senators who want to have a veto in our elections act 
on how Canadians elect members to represent them in the highest 
chamber.  The Senate wants to have a veto in the bill, a veto the 
weak and arrogant Liberal government is allowing in the bill. 
That is a serious concern. 
Senators are elected in other countries.  Our largest trading 
partner, the U.S, elects its senators.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point which would motivate us in the Chamber to support the 
amendment is that senators are not accountable to constituents 
because they do not have any constituencies.  They do not 
represent constituencies.  They are appointed by the Prime 
Minister of Canada and tend to be accountable to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend B.C. Senator Gerry St. Germain, who has offered, and 
who is prepared to resign from his senate seat provided the Prime 
Minister appoints an elected senator to the Senate.  That senator 
has made a bold step and I appreciate his intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance members support the amendment.  Under the 
current legislation, only approval of the House of Commons 
committee is required.  Giving the Chief Electoral Officer the 
freedom to examine innovative alternatives that could help to 
modernize our electoral process is a good thing but it should be 
limited to the elected members who represent Canadians in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, our ears perk up when we see the use 
of the word Senate, particularly in reference to it interfering 
in the election process.  Are the Liberals preparing to have the 
Senate kill any innovative ideas the Chief Electoral Officer may 
propose?  Maybe we cannot trust the Liberal government.  The 
Canadian Alliance believes that the voters, not the government, 
should decide whether a party or a candidate is worthy of a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all opposition parties will be supporting the amendment, it 
is now up to the Liberals.  If they do not accept the amendment, 
it would be another example of how they are making Bill C-9

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion in amendment 
put forward by my colleague for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. It 
seems to me that it is totally relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my speech I may have the opportunity to respond to a 
number of the assertions made by my colleague for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, which, notwithstanding all the 
respect I have for him, appear to be slightly false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons has best described a moment 
ago in his speech how things have been done so far and why we 
are putting forward this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He explained how this provision of the elections act, within 
Bill C-2, came to be, to ensure that if new voting techniques 
were to be tried it would be only after the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs, which normally looks into these 
matters, approved the implementation of such a pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything was going well. The amendment proposed in Bill C-2 
was passed. It was included in the Canada Elections Act which 
was used, need I remind members, in the last general election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 corrects a series of small errors that had gone 
unnoticed because Bill C-2 was passed in such a hurry. Again, I 
need hardly remind the House that if this legislation was rammed 
through in such a hurry, it was essentially due to political 
considerations as the government wanted amended electoral 
legislation as quickly as possible in order to call an early 
election, which is precisely what happened and which confirms our 
opinion in this regard. The government has now introduced Bill 
C-9 to correct a series of small errors that had gone unnoticed 
in Bill C-2 given the haste I have just talked about and also to 
correct another element of the bill that is more substantial as 
it gave rise to a court ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that certain recommendations were made 
to the government following the Figueroa case. The government 
preferred to take the case to court, at taxpayers' expense, 
rather than consider the opinions expressed. It lost the case. 
It is coming back to us now to introduce a more substantial 
amendment in order to comply with the court decision in 
Figueroa concerning the number of candidates a political party 
must field in order for the name of the party to appear on the 
ballots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among those technical amendments they proposed one, amendment 
No. 2, which modifies section 18.1 of the Canada Elections Act 
to ensure that before any pilot project can be implemented to 
modify the voting process, the chief electoral officer will have 
to obtain not only the approval of the House of Commons 
committee that normally considers electoral matters, that is the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, but also the 
approval of its senatorial counterpart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit respectfully that it is surprising that we would have 
to consult a non-elected institution to determine the relevance 
or 
the opportunity of any pilot project concerning an election. 
That is why we thought it was appropriate to propose that this 
reference to the Senate be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that this amendment which we proposed in 
committee was rejected because the government House leader 
argued that ours is a bicameral parliament. Therefore we have 
two Houses, and as long as there are two Houses, as long as we 
do not decide otherwise—which brings us back to the debate of the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle—we must face that reality and take 
into account the fact that the Senate must concur in any 
legislation. Very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not particularly in favour of the Senate in its present 
form or of a second chamber within Canadian parliament, but 
I nevertheless agree that since we respect the institutions as 
they are right now we must involve senators in the passing of 
any legislation, until further notice.  But this is not what we 
are debating now. 
What we are taking about is consultation, opinion and approval 
regarding the implementation of a pilot project, a new method of 
voting.  If I have the time I shall return to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply a technical opinion. How is a group of 
unelected representatives in a position to provide an opinion on 
such a matter?  I ask you, Mr. Speaker.  I know that you are not 
going to give me any answer, Mr. Speaker, but I am asking anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has to be asked eventually, as my colleagues for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough have 
suggested.  Ultimately, we will have to look at the role of the 
Senate, at whether it is appropriate to maintain that 
institution.  That is not however what interests us in this 
debate.  The purpose of the amendment is not to exclude senators 
from the legislative process. 
It merely requires the chief electoral officer, when he wishes 
to test new voting methods, to consult those who being elected 
themselves are perhaps in a position of being able to provide 
him with appropriate feedback.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the government House leader has been doing the rounds 
and trying endlessly to convince us that the amendment presented 
by our colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière does not say 
what that member meant it to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the government House leader has the 
extraordinary gift of being able to read people's thoughts and 
thus knows what my colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière had 
in mind when he drafted this amendment and when he introduced it 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think that this amendment says exactly what the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House said earlier, namely that it seeks to ensure that before 
testing new voting processes, the chief electoral officer must 
get prior approval of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs of the House of Commons and must consult the 
Senate committee that considers these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claim made by the government House leader, which goes 
against the view of his parliamentary secretary but is 
supported, seemingly, by the Privy Council's learned legal 
officers, is that this amendment would require the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to consult its 
counterpart in the Senate before giving its approval to the 
chief electoral officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that I cannot figure out which version 
makes Privy Council's legal officers come to that conclusion. 
Perhaps it is the English version which, incidentally, is a 
translated version since the motion was originally drafted in 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the French version a comma replaces the word “et” in an 
enumeration. In the current text, if we replace the comma with 
the word “et”, the amendment is very clear and specific. The 
purpose of this amendment is to provide that the chief electoral 
officer must get the approval of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs and must consult its Senate 
counterpart before implementing a new voting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I am running out of time and I will not have the 
opportunity to express my view on electronic voting. 
However I must say, with all due respect for the other 
place, that we chose not to exclude it from this technical process, 
but to get it involved through a consultation process. This is 
why I am asking all hon. members to support this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is one of these occasions when I am 
a little puzzled by what happens in this place because if I were 
an opposition member of parliament I would be firmly opposed to 
this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than serve the opportunities of parliament in general in 
making sure that the government does not dominate, what this does 
is it gives back to the government enormous power over whether or 
not an official vote using electronic means will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally in Bill C-2, there 
was a clause, the clause that is under debate right now, which 
basically said that the chief electoral officer can experiment 
with electronic voting, but if he wants to actually undertake an 
official vote with electronic technology he has to get the prior 
approval of the appropriate committee of the House of Commons. 
That committee, incidentally, we would assume to be the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the amendment in Bill C-9 does is it takes away this 
exclusive power of the committee of the House of Commons to 
decide whether an official vote will be taken with electronic 
means and adds in a committee from the Senate.  So now under Bill 
C-9 there would be two committee approvals required.  The motion 
before the House would again revert us back to Bill C-2 by taking 
away the approval of the committee of the Senate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that what we are talking about 
here is an official vote.  That is what the clause says, an 
official vote.  That means somebody is going to be elected or not 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the original clause read, by giving the decision on 
whether electronic voting should be used or not in an official 
vote, it was giving it exclusively to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, a committee that is dominated, 
always dominated, by the government.  Basically, the original 
clause guaranteed that if approval was sought government approval 
would be given, either side.  Or if the government disagreed with 
the possibility of using electronic voting, let us say it is a 
byelection, the government, using its majority on the procedure 
and house affairs committee, could stop it from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I get really puzzled.  Basically, what the 
amendment does is it takes away some of that government power. It 
dilutes it by requiring approval to come from the appropriate 
Senate committee as well.  That is not such a bad thing because 
the Senate is indeed not an elected body and it is not under the 
same direct pressure that MPs are from their own governments.  I 
can tell you, Mr. Speaker, on a standing committee it is very 
difficult for members on any side to buck the basic policy of 
their party, and you would not expect it to happen on the 
procedure and house affairs committee in this particular 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for a Senate committee, even if every member is 
appointed by the government, it would not matter because the 
senators are still unelected and when it comes down to a matter 
of having to use their conscience, their discretion on something 
that is extremely important, we are talking about someone being 
elected officially to the House by a certain means, so, Mr. 
Speaker, it seems to me, on the opposite side, on the opposition 
side, every MP should be opposed to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Canadian Alliance speaker that spoke just before 
me made a mistake because he suggested that all opposition MPs 
were in favour of this particular amendment that is proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois, but in fact I did note that the speech from 
the Conservative member was opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the opposition members 
reconsider because, while as a government MP I am happy to give 
my government lots of power and lots of things, I can tell you I 
am very nervous about giving my government, which could be the 
government of another party in the future, any kind of exclusive 
control over deciding whether or not an official vote should be 
taken by one means or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out, and I emphasize this to all members, that we are 
talking about approvals that come in committee.  We are not 
talking about something that is debated in this entire House.  We 
are not talking about a vote in the House or a vote in the 
Senate.  We are merely talking about approvals in committee and I 
suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, the way the clause was written in 
the original bill, Bill C-2, was seriously flawed because 
basically it gave the power of approval to a committee of the 
House which is dominated by the government, which would have 
meant it would have been a rubber stamp approval anyway, and the 
amendment which the government itself is introducing goes a long 
way toward diluting this power and making sure that, as best we 
can, there is another calculation, another evaluation of the 
issue by the members in the other place, who I think we could 
trust in a situation like something as important as a vote that 
would bring a new member to the House of Commons, that we could 
count on the senators no matter what their original party 
affiliations to act in their very best judgment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to address this topic. 
I certainly concur with my Bloc colleagues that there is a very 
distasteful feature to having the Senate in its current form have 
a hand in deciding our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have said that the Senate has had nothing to do 
with our electoral process.  I think they are wrong.  Many of the 
people who are in our Senate today are there because they had a 
very direct hand in our electoral process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were excellent at raising and collecting money for parties. 
They ran very effective election campaigns for key people who 
would have had trouble winning without their assistance.  There 
was a payoff from the electoral system for good work done for the 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also suggested in the House that the Senate is the only 
appointed place that has anything to do with our electoral 
system.  I remind members opposite that the current Supreme Court 
of Canada, armed with a new philosophy of judicial activism, has 
made major decisions about electoral law that have outraged the 
public.  Ninety-five per cent of the public was totally outraged 
that a prisoner serving a life sentence would have the right to 
vote in an election.   Perhaps prisoners would be able to run for 
election if we carried it far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day decided it would not use a safeguard 
that is in our constitution, the notwithstanding clause.  To say 
that appointed people have nothing to do with this is a little 
off base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the debate in the House since I have been here has 
centred on one issue: the concentration of power into one 
person's hands or one office.  Everyone has heard Lord Acton's 
famous statement about corruption and how it can corrupt.  I have 
heard some good speeches in the House in the last while.  It is 
too bad they had to be misinterpreted for political purposes. 
People have pointed out historical experiences where Lord Acton's 
dictum could be shown to be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Canada assume those sorts of things cannot happen 
here.  I do not want them to happen here either but we would be 
off base to ignore the lessons of history.  We should be 
implementing safeguards to make sure we do not have that sort of 
concentration of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual for whom I have a lot of respect, Gordon 
Robertson, served under four prime ministers and was Clerk of the 
Privy Council.  I think members opposite would be quite familiar 
with Mr. Robertson.  He is a highly respected person.  Mr. 
Robertson is very concerned about what has happened to parliament 
and about the concentration of power in the Prime Minister's 
office.  He has stated that we have an elected dictatorship and 
that the cabinet has become nothing but a focus group for the 
Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those statements, I find strange some of the comments my 
NDP colleagues have made about the Senate.  Their comments are 
out of sync with this place.  If I understand my NDP colleagues, 
and they have supporters on the Liberal side, they want to 
abolish the Senate.  They say that an elected Senate with 
regional representation would be good for the country but that 
Ontario and Quebec would not accept it.  They say that it would 
take a constitutional amendment to change the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it ever occur to them that it would take a constitutional 
amendment to abolish the Senate?  If we must go through the 
exercise we should do the right thing and not the wrong thing. 
Abolishing the Senate in its present form would only give the 
Prime Minister one more power card.  It would complete the 
picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two very good reasons we should have an elected, 
independent and powerful Senate.  First, it could deal with the 
issue we are confronted with in the House: the concentration of 
power into one person's hands.  Concentration of power leads to 
abuse of power.  There are no checks or balances in our system to 
effectively deal with it.  That is the dilemma.  Everyone is 
looking at the issue and asking what mechanisms we have to deal 
with wrongdoing, and there are none.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a powerful, elected and independent Senate would do first 
and foremost is put in the system a badly needed check and 
balance, a counterbalance to the concentration of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised my colleague in the NDP does not recognize that 
an elected Senate that fairly represents the regions would go a 
long way toward alleviating the regionalism, alienation and 
fragmentation in the country.  It would make people in all 
regions feel they had a powerful and effective voice in the 
federal government.  Many of the folks in various regions of the 
country, believe it or not, do not believe they have any say or 
input into the system.  They do not have connections to the Prime 
Minister's Office and they are left out of the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address certain other matters that were said in the 
House.  Somebody mentioned that the Charlottetown accord had a 
provision for an elected Senate and implied that the public had 
rejected the Charlottetown accord because of that provision.  I 
think that is wrong.  The Charlottetown accord, had it been any 
longer, would have been competing with <I>War and Peace</I> for 
length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the accord one province, and I am surprised the province 
did not support the referendum, could have vetoed anything that 
affected culture.  Culture to me is a mile wide and a mile deep. 
It probably deals with everything we do as parliamentarians. That 
proposal would have given one province a loaded gun.  Some 58 
things were open for further negotiation and discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Is this <I>Cross Country Checkup</I>? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Yes, it is.  We are giving 
government members a check up.  We are educating them.  We are 
seeing if their listening skills are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also implied that we do not elect senators.  Alberta 
elected one very good senator, Mr. Waters, an outstanding person. 
The people of Alberta voted for that person to be their Senate 
representative.  The prime minister at the time had the courage 
to respect the democratic will of the people of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad the Prime Minister who followed him ignores that 
procedure.  We have elected senators-in-waiting in Alberta, whom 
the people want to be their voice in the Senate, being denied 
representation.  There are people in Alberta who have worked hard 
for the party opposite, have collected money and have done good 
things for it.  They are the people who have been elected and 
should be in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the country wants to go into the next century with a proper 
system of government and a proper system of checks and balances, 
it needs a powerful, elected and independent Senate, whether it 
wants to admit it or not.  If we do not bring in that necessary 
reform we will one day regret not having seized the opportunity 
to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
should like to participate very briefly in the debate today on 
Bill C-9.  I support the modest proposal put forward by the Bloc 
to restrict the power of the unelected Senate to have a veto over 
elections.  It is impossible to escape the irony of an unelected 
Senate somehow having a veto over what we do to further democracy 
in the land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to some of the previous speakers.  I agree with 
the speaker who immediately preceded me regarding the almost 
absolute power of the Prime Minister's Office.  It has far more 
power than that of the president of the United States where there 
is a system of checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that many attempts have been made over the years to 
reform the Senate and that all attempts to date have met with 
abject failure.  I see this proposal as a very modest one to 
limit the power of the Senate.  It proposes to consult the Senate 
on issues rather than give it a veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has made a reasonable suggestion.  I listened with care 
as well to the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who 
cautioned against doing anything in a piecemeal fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern of a number of us in this party is that past 
attempts to make broad changes and to have an elected Senate, as 
we have seen in Charlottetown, Meech Lake and other attempts, 
have all ultimately met with failure.  We are grappling with the 
need to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members get up from time to time to talk about an elected Senate 
and they ask the Prime Minister, when a vacancy occurs, whether 
he would allow an election in the province where the vacancy has 
arisen.  The answer is always no, with some qualifiers about 
Meech Lake and about Charlottetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is proposed here is simply a modest way to curtail the 
power of the Senate.  As I said, it is totally ironic that 
unelected senators should have a veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous speaker from the government side questioned whether a 
conjunction existed in English or whether the bill was lacking a 
conjunction.  If that is his only problem why does he not move a 
friendly amendment and let us get on with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week I had occasion to meet with someone from 
Bolivia, which we would normally consider a third world country. 
He was very interested in our political system.  He wanted to 
know about elections to the House of Commons and then he 
innocently asked how our senators were elected and for what term 
of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is embarrassing for most parliamentarians, and probably for 
many Canadians, to have to say that we appoint senators rather 
than elect them.  We do not do the appointing.  The Prime 
Minister appoints the Senate and each member therein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He looked at me in a strange way, as do a lot of guests to our 
country when we reveal that we have one of the few bicameral 
systems in the world where one House is elected and the other is 
appointed.  The upper chamber is appointed by one individual and 
has no checks and balances.  There is no opportunity for a 
committee to decide whether a Senate candidate is suitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister can simply wake up one morning and say it is 
time to appoint so-and-so.  That is why people like Gordon 
Robertson and Donald Savoie are concerned about the absolute 
power of the Prime Minister's Office and the almost total absence 
of checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to the amendment, it is a very modest one.  It is 
trying to address the difficulty we have in dealing with 
electoral reform and whether we should have a Senate. 
The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle makes a very good point.  He 
has come full circle on this issue and now believes that the way 
to go is to abolish the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the previous speaker, that would only give more 
power.  If we were to have a system of proportional 
representation where we would perhaps have a first past the post 
system for some members and then proportional representation for 
some others, we could achieve the best of both worlds.  However, 
we would do it in one institution, in the House of Commons, as 
opposed to having a House of Commons and a Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much support this modest amendment made by the Bloc this 
morning and I encourage other members to do so as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to make a few comments on the amendment because it is an 
opportunity for us to reflect on the role of the other place in 
general, but also to reflect on the irony of a procedure 
established by the bill whereby the other place would have a 
decisive role to play in something having to do with elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment does not completely leave out the Senate.  It 
talks about consulting the other place.  That is appropriate.  We 
can consult the other place.  We can consult Canadians.  We can 
do a lot of consulting.  The question is whether or not the other 
place, which is an appointed chamber and not an elected chamber, 
should have a decisive say in something having to do with 
elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways, it seems to me, that the argument for the 
amendment can be established.  One is simply the argument based 
on democratic principle, that being the fact that elections have 
to do with democracy and the Senate, being an appointed body, 
should by definition keep its nose out of things having to do 
with elections out of respect for the fact that senators are not 
elected themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is something which I suppose has always been 
the case but has become more aggravated in recent years, that is, 
generally election law is something that is decided on by all the 
parties in the House of Commons through a House of Commons 
committee or by consultation with parties outside the House.  By 
involving the Senate in this way, we are basically saying that 
after all the work is done among the five parties in the House, 
and perhaps even after consultation with parties that have not 
been able to elect people to the House of Commons, a decisive 
role is going to be given to a chamber where really only two 
parties are represented.  I know there is now an Alliance senator 
but that does not really take very much away from my argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Senate is a chamber made up of Liberals and 
Conservatives.  It is made up of people who have been appointed 
over the years by those parties that have formed the government 
in the country.  When the Liberals are in power, Liberals are 
appointed.  When the Conservatives were in power, Conservatives 
were appointed.  Sometimes there is the odd exception and an 
independent is appointed, but by and large the Senate is a 
chamber made up of people who belong to the two political parties 
in this country that have formed governments over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have a five party House, it seems a little odd to me 
that a chamber or a House in which three of the parties are 
unrepresented should have this kind of role to play.  That is one 
of the reasons I think this amendment is just not in order 
procedurally and also politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the apologia for the Senate that was 
given by the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
He was being a faithful Conservative and defending many of his 
colleagues in the Senate.  That is understandable, but it seems 
to me the argument he made, which is that there are good people 
in the Senate and they do good work, is just not sufficient.  It 
is true that there are good people in the Senate and they do good 
work.  It is not the work they do:  it is the role they have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has a decisive constitutional role in our democracy 
which we say is inappropriate given the fact that senators are 
appointed.  There are all kinds of people throughout the country 
in various contexts who are good people and do good work, but 
they do not have the constitutional power that the people in the 
Senate have, who are good people and do good work.  If they want 
to be good people and do good work they can do it somewhere else. 
They can do it where they do not have the constitutional power 
that should be vested only in people who are elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our point and it is the reason why for so many years the 
NDP and, before that, the CCF have been for the abolition of the 
Senate.  It is an affront to our democratic principles to have 
this appointed body in our midst with that much power.  I say 
that with all due respect to the many senators whom I know who 
are very dedicated to the country and do very good work.  That is 
beside the point, and that is the point I am trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that abolishing the Senate is not on and that 
reforming the Senate, as many have suggested over the years, is 
what we need to look at.  We in the NDP have been open to that. 
We supported Meech Lake and we supported the Charlottetown accord 
even though those accords did not abolish the Senate, but because 
they went some way toward reforming the Senate and making it 
democratic or in some cases such as Meech at least making it more 
responsive to provincial input and in Charlottetown actually 
making it elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP supported that kind of Senate reform.  We are not 
absolutist in our demand that the Senate be abolished but we are 
absolutist in our demand that it be changed and in our demand 
that ultimately the Senate be made a democratic Chamber rather 
than an appointed Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that one of the ironies of recent Canadian political 
history is that the very same party that has made a political 
career out of exploiting the need for Senate reform, particularly 
as it relates to western and regional alienation, is the same 
party that in my judgment and in the judgment of others has 
actually stood in the way of Senate reform on a couple of 
occasions.  While I am sure that there are people in the reform 
alliance political constituency who genuinely wish for Senate 
reform, it almost seems to me sometimes that if we ever did have 
reform, it would be a disaster for them because it would mean 
that this great hobby horse of theirs would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some evidence to back this up, because on two occasions 
there was opportunity for Senate reform.  In Meech the provinces 
were going to be given the opportunity to provide a list that the 
Prime Minister would have to pick from in order to appoint 
senators, until such time as there was genuine Senate reform, so 
that there would be pressure on the federal government to reform 
the Senate.  If there was no reform, then the provinces in 
perpetuity would have the power to influence who became senators 
in this way.  However, that was not on.  That was another 
occasion for outrage on the part of people in the reform alliance 
political constituency.  Then in Charlottetown we had another 
opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these things are worth saying because it may well be 
that when the history of our democratic institutions is written, 
unless something dramatic and hopeful happens in the next little 
while, the very people who have made so much out of wanting to 
reform the Senate will be shown to have been the people who stood 
in the way of that very reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was not going to rise on this occasion, but after the speech 
from my colleague from the NDP I cannot help but respond to some 
of the things he has said.  Imagine putting at our feet the 
responsibility for preventing reform of the Senate when we have 
been the champions of it.  I cannot believe he would even try to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to set the record very straight.  So often when we 
talk about the unelected Senate, the Prime Minister in particular 
loves to do what the member for Winnipeg—Transcona just did, 
which is to say that we had the choice and we were against the 
Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to you, to other members in the 
House and to all Canadians who have ever heard our story that we 
were against the Charlottetown accord for 100 reasons. 
Unfortunately, the few tepid movements in that accord toward 
reforming the Senate were not sufficient for us to say that we 
would eat all the gravel, the dirt and the stinkweed in that meal 
and call it a pie.  No, we were not ready to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the accord did say that there was some measure of voting 
for the Senate.  If we look at it more carefully, it did not give 
the right to the people to elect the Senate.  That was an option, 
but as I recall, the Charlottetown accord said senators could 
also have been put forward by lists from the legislatures of the 
provinces.  What we have there is just another way of getting an 
unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed, and we stand by it, that in our modern society in 
Canada, where we call ourselves a democracy, there should be 
nothing less than a Senate that consists of members elected by 
the people they represent, just like we are sent here by electors 
in our ridings.  That is how senators should be elected.  When 
the Prime Minister and members of the NDP tell us they are 
against an elected Senate because our party did not accept the 
Charlottetown accord, that is a misstatement of our 
representations in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I have to say on this issue of the Senate is that 
we believe the House of Commons is properly constituted when it 
represents the population in the country.  Right now we have the 
situation, and we have had it for many years, where, because 60% 
of the population of the country is in Quebec and Ontario, 60% of 
the members of the House are from Quebec and Ontario.  We accept 
that.  That is representation by population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Senate has 24 members from Ontario and 24 members 
from Quebec.  What does British Columbia have, which is the third 
most populous province in the country?  It has six senators.  Did 
the Charlottetown accord correct that?  No, it did not.  Not only 
do we have the overbearing weight of legislative authority by two 
provinces telling the others what will be done in the country, 
but we have it duplicated in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely positively true that what we need is a Senate 
that is proportional to the provinces, not the populations of 
them.  It is done in the United States and in a number of other 
countries.  Maryland has two senators and California has two 
senators, which is not in proportion to their populations but 
because the role of the U.S. senate is to balance the interests 
of regions and states against the predominant majority, and in 
our case it would be the House of Commons and a predominant 
majority from the two most populous provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the amendment putting the Senate in control, in 
any way, of affecting our legislative outcomes in elections, it 
is almost an oxymoron. 
These members are not elected but are going to become involved in 
our elections.  How absurd.  I simply say, loud and clear, let 
them be elected.  Let them represent the people who they are 
supposed to represent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Alberta, from which I come, has 23 out of 26 
members of parliament who are Canadian Alliance members.  That is 
a simple fact.  Alberta people believe most strongly in the 
policies, the principles and the integrity of our party so they 
voted for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had senatorial elections, whom did they select in our 
province?  With more votes than any member of the House of 
Commons got, they selected two members who happened to be 
associated with the Canadian Alliance.  Those are our senators in 
waiting.  Are they getting respect?  No.  Who does the Prime 
Minister appoint when there is a vacancy in Alberta? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no disrespect at all, because I know that it is against 
the standing orders, but I say this genuinely.  I have the highest 
respect for people who are in the Senate from our province.  I 
happen to know Tommy Banks a bit.  I have admired some of his 
works for many years.  Now he is a senator which is great.  Had 
he run for election and the people said that he was their 
selection, then fine.  However, we had an election for the Senate and 
he did not even run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard it said in the United States that to be a senator 
one has to win an election.  In Canada to be a senator, one has 
to lose an election.  People who run for the currently governing 
party, if they lose in their riding, end up getting appointed to 
the Senate instead.  That is absurd.  It does not sit with 
modern day democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a Senate which balances the powers of this 
place by one in which senators are equally represented across the 
country, in terms of the same number of senators per province. We 
are talking about an elected Senate, elected by the people. We 
are talking about an effective Senate which basically would 
continue with the powers that the Senate has now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge members, especially the Prime Minister, to watch 
his tongue when he says that we rejected an elected Senate 
because we did not support the Charlottetown accord.  One just 
cannot give a guy a little bit of a dirty stick with some icing 
on it and say “Here, eat the whole thing”.  We would have taken 
the icing all right but it was covered with so much other totally 
objectionable material that we had no choice.  The Canadian 
people proved that we were the ones who were right.  When an 
analysis was done across the country, the Canadian people were 
the ones who rejected the Charlottetown accord.  It was not us. 
All we did was get into the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just talking about the Charlottetown accord debate, I remember I 
was a recently elected nominee for our party at that time.  I was 
elected in June 1992 to represent our party in the next federal 
election which we thought would possibly be that fall.  Of 
course we know that the Conservatives postponed it because all 
indications were that they were going to lose, and how they lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I was a neophyte, a math and computer teacher, and I was 
asked to go to a forum in one of the towns in my riding to debate 
the Charlottetown accord.  I was on the stage with no less than the 
woman who until recently was the leader of the Liberal Party in 
Alberta.  At that time her name was Nancy Betkowski.  She was an 
Alberta cabinet minister in the Conservative government of the 
day.  Next to her was Brian O'Kurley, the previous member of 
parliament for Elk Island.  He was of course a Conservative 
member.  There was a Conservative member of parliament, a 
Conservative member of the cabinet from the province and me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my introductory speech, which was one of my first public 
speeches, I remember clearly saying I never thought that I would 
see the day when I would be standing on the platform with two 
other people and they would be considered the heavyweights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate to support the amendment moved by the 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.  Under the proposed 
electoral reform, the Senate, that group of wise individuals who 
represent the financial interests of Canada's economic elite 
more than they represent the Canadian people, is to be 
consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that these people, who are not elected, should not 
impose their view of how members of this chamber should be 
elected.  This would give them a power and authority that they 
do not legitimately have because they are not elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor can I let pass without comment the views of the Canadian 
Alliance member who is all for what was described in the 
Charlottetown accord as a triple-e Senate:  elected, effective, 
and I forget what the third e stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to give this some thought.  The Bloc 
Quebecois is saying that the Senate should be abolished; it no 
longer has a role to play.  The Senate had a purpose in the time 
of Caesar in ancient Rome.  But I ask the member who is waxing 
on about the beauty and grandeur of an elected Senate what 
happens when an elected Senate opposes a policy of the governing 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have experience of this in Quebec.  At one point there was 
an independence party in power in Quebec and 75 federalist MPs 
representing Quebec in Ottawa.  The federalist MPs said “We 
represent the views of Quebecers just as well as MNAs do”.  What 
happens when an elected Senate tells the elected representatives 
of this House “We represent the Albertans who elected us just as 
well as the Canadian Alliance, 23 of whose 26 candidates were 
elected. 
We are just as legitimate as the Alliance”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where things get tough and complicated when a second 
elected House wants to have its authority recognized and 
sometimes claims to have greater authority than the elected 
members of this House. Instead of solving the problem we are 
inviting squabbles between elected members in both houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to have that situation in Quebec. This is nothing new. 
Until 1965 when it was abolished, we had a second chamber 
called the executive council. Nobody in Quebec has ever asked 
for the reinstatement of this provincial institution. It has 
never been said in print or elsewhere that this was a great 
loss for democracy or for the Quebec people. For all intents and 
purposes, this assembly of unelected members did not represent 
in any way the day to day interests of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that my distinguished colleague of the Alliance who spoke so 
highly of the triple-e Senate has finished his discussion with 
his colleague, I would ask him to think this over. He said that 
in Alberta his party won 23 seats out of 26. If we had an 
elected Senate, senators elected in Alberta would be able to 
work against the elected Alliance members of Alberta. We would 
end up with the same kind of situation we had with Trudeau. He 
was a member from Quebec in Ottawa and he said that he 
represented Quebecers as well as the Quebec government did. He 
even said we were a tribe and many other things besides.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see the dichotomy this created within the population 
of Quebec between the federalists and the sovereignists.  At 
this point there would be a similar split between the Alliance 
partisans and the Senate partisans, if we can put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Bloc Quebecois is to abolish this outmoded 
institution which dates, as I said, from ancient Rome before 
the time of Caesar.  It is very costly, adds little and defends 
little or rather does not represent the day to day interests of 
the public.  These are people who are, more often than not, 
being compensated for services rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member who said that in the United States a 
person has to be elected to become a senator.  In Canada, a 
person has to be defeated.  A person must have run in a riding 
during an election, lost or been rejected or revoked by the 
public.  This is the way to become a senator.  This is the 
history of the Senate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of those who sit in the Senate are being thanked.  It is a 
way of recognizing service which, at times, has nothing to do 
with the administration of a country.  It is pure and simple 
recognition for support, a hand up, a kind word with respect to 
the Prime Minister during an election, for example, or an 
attempt to influence the public during a vote which is 
compensated by an appointment to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are appointments in other areas. 
I learned that my adversary in 1993, the person running against 
me in Chambly, is now the president of the Canada Post 
Corporation.  I am delighted at his appointment as, he is a 
competent individual.  This is perhaps not the usual way to get 
this sort of job, but luck arranges many things.  The current 
president of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is, in 
my opinion, a competent individual, and I am delighted at his 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I know lots of others who had absolutely not one ounce 
of administrative ability or anything else.  As a reward for 
running or for getting absolutely slaughtered in the 
polls—because they knew in advance that there was no hope of 
victory in a given riding—they were told “Run, and you will get 
your reward”.  Depending, I presume, on people's qualifications, 
they ended up at various levels of government bodies or agencies 
or crown corporations.  Some of them are here on the Hill in 
ministers' offices when their only qualifications are to have 
been a defeated candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that this change to the Elections Act, 
is necessary.  The chief electoral officer, a neutral citizen, 
must be given authority.  Until now his neutrality in 
performing his duties has never been questioned.  The Elections 
Act contains many shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members here are elected.  As the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans has said, no one 
has ever been elected to this place after campaigning at gun 
point in his or her riding.  We are all representatives of the 
people, democratically elected and entitled to hold a seat in 
this place, even if this does not always suit those who are 
seated on the opposite side of the floor.  The opposition has a 
right to be here under our parliamentary system and it plays 
an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, there are many things that need changing.  Surely 
electronic voting will be one of those changes.  The bill 
permits electronic voting to be used, but there are some other 
points that are questionable.  For instance, for the owner of a 
nursing home to be able to vote for all his residents is 
somewhat undemocratic, in my opinion.

are people who vote eight, ten, twelve, fifteen times on the 
same voting day.  Unfortunately the legislation governing the 
last election was new as well. It had been substantially amended 
and instead of improving matters it made them worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, I hope that electronic voting or some other 
process will bring about an improvement instead of the opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting debate today. 
When it comes to democracy most politicians have something to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some background on the proposed legislation from the 
standpoint that it all derives from what happened to the 
Communist Party when it was running candidates and what happened 
in the courts when it was stripped of its assets because it ran 
less than 50 candidates.  The government, in my mind, went 
overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done everything it could to have a monopoly 
on politics and to find a way to exclude parties that it 
considers potentially troublesome.  That is not democracy.  It is 
not acceptable for the government to take the actions that it 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only accommodation that the Liberal government has made 
toward the response of the courts in this whole action is that it 
is now saying that a party only needs to run 12 candidates in 
order to have a party label on the ballot. That is a precious 
small concession when one considers what it takes to run a 
political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Candidates need the ability to raise funds and to mobilize for 
byelections.  They need the ability to secure party assets that 
continue from election to election and to have a continuous 
stream of revenue for political activity.  They need to be able 
to carry out those activities without being hampered by a size 
determined by the government.  It is very anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be looked at not from the standpoint of a start-up or 
smaller party but from the standpoint of being a member of the 
public.  Does the public not deserve to know, according to label, 
what that person wishes the label to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of it makes sense when it is looked at in the true spirit 
and sense of democratic principle.  It only makes sense if one is 
trying to restrict the political spectrum in some way and trying 
to create a monopoly on politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes to the posture and attitude of government and of 
governance.  It is one more reflection, after being in this place 
for eight years, of a government that enjoys governance too much. 
It is prepared to dismiss anything that may disquiet its 
enjoyment of governance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reflected in many ways.  I must conclude that government 
members, whether they are on the backbenches or in cabinet, are 
so immune to other people's feelings that very often they do not 
actually even recognize other points of view.  Nor do they 
recognize the toxic ramifications of some of their actions.  They 
may not today or tomorrow but they do filter into our society and 
into our so-called democracy in ways that chip away day after day 
at basic democratic principles and basic individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being done now will be challenged and it will go to the 
courts again.  The government has attempted to control third 
party spending limits on advertising and that kind of thing.  It 
is a whole attitude posture, positioning to increase the comfort 
zone of the government, fortifying its monopoly on politics and 
excluding criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very consistent in how it approaches all these 
issues.  When there is pressure for change the status quo is 
worse than standing still.  The status quo is going backward 
because most of the other western democracies are not retaining 
the status quo.  They are moving forward.  Considering where we 
stack up on basic democratic principles, we are having a much 
more difficult time justifying that we are a true democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to something that is near and dear to my heart. 
Some members did bring into the debate some of the experiences 
they shared in terms of the Charlottetown accord and all the 
discussion, debate, heat and light that led up to that whole 
exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was highly motivated as a citizen in 1992 to do something 
about what I saw as an imposition by all political parties in the 
House and by all provincial premiers.  We were not here.  We only 
had one member.  The comfortable political elite of the nation 
tried to ram down the throat of Canadians an agreement that would 
have changed the country forever and would have made it even more 
difficult to make effective, progressive and democratic change in 
the future.  However we have been going backward even without the 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very motivated personally and that is what led me into the 
political arena.  If I had not been motivated in that regard I 
would not have been motivated to run for federal politics and I 
would not be here today.  It is that simple.   Maybe that is 
good.  Maybe it is bad, but I have enjoyed my time here.

Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on behalf of the 
constituents of Calgary East.  I had no intention of speaking to 
the bill, but as the debate carried on and the points of view 
were put forward I thought it would be appropriate to join the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points that were raised have strong ramifications.  There is 
a plea from members on this side of the House for the government 
to look at the way parliament is functioning, at the way elected 
officials are functioning and at the way power is concentrated in 
the PMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two points to make.  Before I speak about the Senate and 
the way our democracy works, I would like to make a small point 
about elections.  When I was signing my final returns the 
returning officer brought to my attention complaints that she and 
other returning officers had received when the chief electoral 
officer had made comments regarding his consultation process 
during the last general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer said that he had met with DROs and 
key players to prepare his report.  Unfortunately he made 
comments in his statement concerning DROs whom he had not 
consulted.  He did not explain why he had not consulted them.  It 
raised unhappiness with the DROs who were not consulted.  By 
addressing the issue here I would hope that the chief electoral 
officer would address it with the DROs who were not consulted and 
who were not very happy with those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about democracy in our country.  In 1999 I 
had the privilege of being asked by the former Governor General 
of Canada to join him on a state visit to five countries in 
Africa.  I was informed that the purpose of the state visit was 
to promote democracy in these countries where democracy was 
slowing taking root. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at who was going on the state visit I found out 
that we would be accompanied by two senators.  The comments that 
I am about to make have no bearing on the two senators or their 
characters.  I am sure they are very fine gentlemen.  I know them 
very well and I have great respect for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the institution we are talking about and not the 
individuals.  I was puzzled and disturbed to be going on a state 
visit to other countries to talk about democracy accompanied by 
the symbols of what is not a democracy in this country.   These 
are people who sit in a chamber.  They are not elected by the 
people of Canada but are appointed by one individual at his whim. 
How can we call that a democracy?  That institution represents a 
power that is in one office.

about democracy and how democracy works in our country.  I found 
that very contradictory, so I wrote back to the Governor General 
and told her that.  I asked if she would perhaps allow me the 
opportunity, when meeting with parliamentarians in other 
countries, to tell them that there was a problem with democracy 
even in our country and that reforms were needed.  After some 
pause I was given permission by the Governor General to bring up 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henceforth, everywhere we met with parliamentarians, I made sure 
they understood that there was not a full-fledged functioning 
democracy in Canada, that Canada also had problems and that 
Canadians were demanding reforms to make it a truly functioning 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I brought up this subject, it was amazing that 
parliamentarians in other countries stopped, looked and listened. 
They could not believe we had an upper house in Canada that was 
not elected, that it was appointed and appointed by one person. 
They could not believe that was possible, and that we call that a 
parliament of Canada.  The more I talked about it the more they 
shook their heads.  I told them they should not do this.  I told 
them that as they were laying the foundations of democracy not to 
import to their countries the mistakes, those cracks in 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I meet with foreign delegates who come to Canada, the first 
thing they ask is how can we have a chamber that is not elected. 
Democracy means the voice of the people, not the voice of the 
elite.  The people can only be heard through elections, not 
through appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a fundamental flaw in our democracy.  That is 
why the voices of Canadians across this nation are demanding that 
this parliament be reformed so that it can truly represent the 
voice of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our provinces have asked that their voices be heard.  That is 
why the province of Alberta went through an election and elected 
two senators.  This is the choice of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage I would like to commend the former senator, Mr. 
Ghitter, who resigned from the Senate because he felt it did not 
reflect the will of the Canadian people. I hope that is the 
reason he quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator St. Germain is still in the Senate but has publicly 
stated that he would like to be an elected senator.  I am sure 
those senators would.  I have met nice senators.  There are good 
senators and hard working senators.  I am sure if all senators 
ran for election and got the legitimacy of the people, they would 
be far happier to sit in that chamber than they are right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the comments I wanted to make.  I hope the words 
spoken by the members in this place will have some impact on the 
government to see that there is a reform of parliament and that 
there is a voice of the people in this parliament.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK57">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 2 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget Implementation Act, 1997 
and the Financial Administration Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank you for that clarification.  I appreciate that 
you compensate for my inabilities.  I am surrounded by people who 
do that for me and I really am appreciative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say at the outset that Bill C-17, the act we are 
now debating, is an act to amend the Budget Implementation Act, 
1997.  This is an act that has been around for almost four years, 
and we are now going to amend it.  It deals with the 
implementation of the 1997 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years we have had a number of these 
bills.  About a year or so ago we debated an implementation bill 
that extended back 10 years.  It just so happens that the 
finances of the government are done with the announcement of them 
in a budget by the finance minister and that makes them law. 
Then afterward we do it.  We tax the people and take the money 
from them.  If the budget includes the giving of grants the money 
is given, and so on.  Eventually we get around to passing what we 
have actually done.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that perhaps some of these things should be done 
in a more expeditious manner.  We would not have the problem of 
people not really knowing where they stand on different issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit about Bill C-17 and about the whole 
idea of budgets and finances of the government in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of the features of the bill is it increases funding 
for research and development.  I do not think there are very many 
Canadians who would not acknowledge the importance of research 
and development.  As a matter of fact over the centuries our 
standard of living has increased based on the things that people 
have invented and discovered.  Sometimes these discoveries are by 
accident and sometimes they are very methodically carried forward 
with years of developmental research.  Finally, they zero in on 
exactly what needs to be done to achieve a certain goal, for 
example, in the health area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many decades ago I remember reading about Madame Curie who 
invented the x-ray.  An interesting thing happened.  She put a 
uranium source in the same drawer as some film and lo and behold 
the film was clouded.  Therefore, she was able to deduce from 
that that the radiation from the source caused an effect on the 
film which is of course a chemical reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the beginning of being able to analyze what was going 
on in a person's body, whether healthy or ill.  Usually of course 
this is done for reasons of illness or for injury.  We are able 
to examine what is happening without having to perform surgery. 
Many times, especially over the last 40 or 50 years, it has still 
been necessary to perform surgery to see what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a very pivotal event in my life when I broke my ankle 
on July 1, 1968.  I was out with a bunch of boys at a children's 
camp.  I was acting as a counsellor for a couple of days.  I took 
these boys out for a hike and we jumped a fence.  I do not know, 
Mr. Speaker, if you even want to contemplate that.  It conjures 
strange images I am sure when thinking of me jumping a fence, but 
I did.  Unfortunately, when I landed I was in a twisting motion 
and my ankle broke.  I had to hobble back to camp.  It was quite 
a task for a guy my weight to get back since I have always been 
heavy.  It was probably close to a kilometre from where we were 
to get back to camp.  I had to go all that distance on one leg 
with a makeshift crutch because these little boys could in no way 
carry me.  I am sure everyone understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I got to the hospital, my leg did not have to be cut off. 
Although one of the guys at the youth camp had suggested it as 
soon as I hobbled into camp.  He said to some of the others “Hey 
guys, get the axe.  We have to amputate”.  We had a little laugh 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing they did at the hospital was to x-ray my leg. 
They determined the ankle was broken and proceeded to put it into 
what turned out to be an extremely painful cast.  I suffered for 
six weeks in a cast.  It was almost two years before my ankle was 
back to normal.  At the best of times my ankles have to work 
pretty hard in order to carry the burden that is assigned to 
them.  As a result of research they were able to determine how 
bad my ankle was damaged without having to cut the skin open and 
get in there and probe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in my own short lifetime I remember a number of 
occasions where people have had an illness or an injury. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to diagnose it they had to do what was in those years 
called exploratory surgery.  It is still done occasionally but 
much less now.  What started out as medical research leading to 
x-rays many years ago has since developed into other diagnostic 
tools, including audio diagnosis, CAT scans and magnetic 
resonance imaging or MRIs.  All these different techniques for 
getting a picture of what is inside a person are very useful. 
These techniques are a result of very careful research, 
development and testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is where the money for the research should come 
from.  I was an academic earlier in my life.  I went to 
university and those were probably the best years of my life.  I 
had more time then, and I say that with all due respect to the 
pages who are very busy now as students.  I had more time then to 
read books just for the fun of reading them than I have now with 
the business of life that happens when one accepts adult and 
family responsibilities and all other things that go with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my career as a student and later on as an educator in a 
technical institute I always felt that there was a proper role 
for the use of public funds to fund research and development. One 
example would be the academic research environment in a 
university working in conjunction with perhaps the Medical 
Research Council of Canada.  In Alberta we have a very strong 
Alberta Research Council in Edmonton and Calgary.  I am 
specifically familiar with the one in Edmonton but there is also 
one in Devon.  Each one does different kinds of research and some 
of it is the medical research I have already talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of research goes into the processing and refining of 
oil products in Alberta.  The council looks at more efficient 
ways of using energy so that our non-renewable resources are 
treated carefully and we do not run out of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These research projects are very worthwhile.  Although there is 
a proper role for the funding of many of these projects by 
private enterprise, and that happens big time, there is a role 
for the use of public funds through the universities, through the 
research councils and through all the different granting 
institutions we have developed in the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that has happened in Bill C-17 is that there will be 
an addition to the Canada foundation for innovation.  Whereas 
before it had $500 million in its budget based on the mini budget 
of the Minister of Finance last fall, the bill would now add 
another $750 million, making the total $1.25 billion for 
research.  That part of the bill is very worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rather surprised that you are giving me a signal for time, 
Mr. Speaker.  It was my impression that I had a 20 minute time 
slot and I am prepared to speak for 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Price):</B>  It was a 10 minute speech 
and the hon. member split his time with the speaker who spoke 
last on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not aware that I was 
splitting my time.  I thought I was the first recognized speaker. 
May I have consent to continue my speech for another 10 minutes 
as I have only finished half of the introduction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If I could assist the hon. member for 
Elk Island, the colleague with whom he was sharing his time was 
the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  He would have had a few 
minutes left on questions and comments. 
He was not able to be here at this time and so we continued 
debate with the hon. member for Elk Island for the remaining 10 
minutes of that period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island was also asking if he could have 
unanimous consent to continue his speech for 10 minutes.  Does he 
have unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening with quite an interest to what my 
colleague from Elk Island was saying.  Since members on the 
governing side would not give him any time to continue with his 
speech, and I do not know what they are afraid of, I would like 
to hear what he has to say in the remaining five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
bailing me out because I do wish to address some of my concerns. 
I have spoken in support of the idea of funding research and 
development, especially with respect to medical research that 
improves our standard of living.  That is something we have to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize the fact that Canadians right now are 
in dire straits when it comes to research and development.  The 
bill does not address that and the government should start 
addressing it big time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pouring money into research and development is one thing, but 
one also has to develop the whole culture of research and 
development.  That happens in an academic environment by being 
surrounded with people of like mind and of equal great ability. 
It occurs when we have places of research which are outstanding 
in their ability and which attract the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our huge problems is that researchers get paid in 
Canadian dollars.  The bill would increase the initial funding of 
$550 million by $750 million, which is more than doubling it. All 
that does is compensate for the fact that our researchers and 
scientists are paid in Canadian dollars.  It means the increase 
is necessary to compete with our American neighbours, for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currency is a very important aspect of the bill, but the 
expenditure is nothing but a cover-up by the government.  It 
covers up the government policies which have brought us such an 
extremely low Canadian dollar.  It puts us at a disadvantage when 
competing for the brains and bodies of the brightest in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make a point about the bookkeeping process. 
Over the seven or more years that I have been here now, I have 
seen too often how the government uses the opportunity to put 
into budgets things that would use up the current surplus without 
properly accounting for them.  No other businessperson in Canada 
could do that.  I could not as an owner of a trucking company say 
that in the next five years I need 10 new trucks, buy two trucks 
per year for the next five years and bill them all in this year's 
budget because I have a surplus and thus reduce my income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accounting principles and the income tax law do not permit it, 
yet the government does it over and over again.  This one time 
expenditure extended over the next five years will be totally 
billed to this year's budget.  That is a sleight of accounting 
hand and the finance minister should be chastized.  The 
government has done that too often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did the same thing with the millennium 
scholarships.  In 1998 the government introduced a $3 billion 
millennium scholarship fund which it was to use to help win the 
next election.  It seems to have worked.  It was billed in 1998, 
spread out over the next three years and very little of it paid 
out until the election year.  Most of it was spent during the 
election year or leading up to the election.  I take personal 
umbrage at that.  It is offensive and it ought not to happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we support the objectives of the Canada foundation 
for innovation.  We believe the money expended should be properly 
accounted for, not just booking it in the fiscal year just 
ending.  We believe the government is wasting time in parliament 
bringing in amendments that should have been done properly if it 
would have done the legislative work correctly, because some of 
the other amendments addressed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some happiness with the fact that the minister has pulled 
back from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board but I deeply 
wish the Canada pension board would be subject to an audit by the 
Auditor General of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must be clear from the beginning on what we are debating here 
today.  We are debating an anti-democratic, unparliamentary, 
omnibus bill.  The two parts of the bill have absolutely nothing 
to do with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of the bill appropriates funds for the Canada 
foundation for innovation.  The second part makes amendments to 
the Financial Administration Act, which has nothing to do with 
the Canada foundation for innovation.  Both issues are separate 
and should be dealt with in two separate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time that I have had the honour to serve my constituents 
and the Canadian people in the House, I have worked on quite a 
few bills.  Currently I am my party's critic for industry, 
transportation and infrastructure.  I have also been the treasury 
board critic and housing critic and have worked on bills in those 
areas.  I have also worked on bills, which were of particular 
interest to the constituents in my riding:  everything from 
health and justice to aboriginal affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked on a lot of bills, and what concerns me is that 
the more bills I see the more common it is becoming for the 
Liberal government to introduce these kinds of omnibus bill. This 
is not a rare occurrence.  This is not something the government 
does once in a while.  It does this all the time now, although it 
says it is for very good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not want to let parliament properly 
debate and scrutinize its legislation so it just slaps a bunch of 
completely unrelated items together and makes us vote on them all 
as a package.  This is not a transparent and democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so anti-democratic about the bill?  Well, as I said 
earlier, it has two parts.  The first part would appropriate 
funds for the Canada foundation for innovation and the second 
part would amend the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we, in the NDP, support part one, dealing 
with the Canada foundation for innovation, but we oppose part 
two, the amendments to the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting these two completely unrelated items together in one 
bill, we are being forced to vote against something that we like 
and support, the Canada foundation for innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To register our opposition to the government's changes to the 
Financial Administration Act, we must vote against the whole 
bill.  Members in the House, not just from the New Democratic 
Party but from all parties, cannot accurately represent the views 
of their constituents by voting on these two completely different 
issues together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now say a few words about the parts of the bill that we 
would otherwise support before I move on to the reasons that we 
will be opposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support increasing the funding for the Canada foundation for 
innovation.  The foundation does important work to support 
research and development in Canada's universities, hospitals, 
community colleges and other public and non-profit agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a clear deficit in the area of research and 
development compared to most other members of the G-8 and this 
deficit has been made worse by the Liberal government's massive 
cuts to post-secondary education.  The Canada foundation for 
innovation helps in a small way toward overcoming the research 
and development deficit.  My fellow New Democratic Party MPs and 
I support the work it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from representatives of different areas of science 
and research on the industry committee about the money that was 
finally put into research and development.  I was extremely 
impressed with the work they have done in such a very short 
period of time to promote Canadian research and development in 
science and technology.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been truly impressed by the fact that 75% of people 
involved in these areas are educated in Canadian schools.  It is 
extremely impressive, I must admit.  I did not realize it until I 
was part of the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone in the right direction and put federal dollars into 
research and development.  We do not risk creating an environment 
where, as in the U.S., only the commercialization of science and 
research and development is able to succeed.  We will finally 
support those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice if the federal government had kept this issue 
separate from the other.  We have a few ideas on how to improve 
the foundation's work and I hope we will be able to address them 
as the bill progresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Alliance has mentioned, it would be 
nice if the foundation were reviewed by the auditor general. That 
is what the auditor general recommended, but it is not the case. 
As a result there has been criticism that the process is not 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that representatives from the foundation who came 
before the industry committee were working among themselves to 
ensure a transparent process.  We heard questions from my 
Alliance colleague about the improper spending of government 
dollars.  There were suggestions that there is government 
intervention as to where the dollars go.  We therefore need a 
transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of Canadians not having faith in our democratic system, 
politicians, the government and specifically the Prime Minister, 
and believe me they do not, I would wager a fair chunk that they 
have faith in the auditor general.  They have faith in the 
integrity of the past auditor general and I hope they will have 
faith in the new auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not hear criticism of the auditor general's reports or 
of his integrity.  Canadians have faith in the auditor general 
and in the position that he holds, and I hope that will continue. 
We should listen to the auditor general's recommendation to have 
the foundation reviewed.  As I said, there is not necessarily a 
problem.  However to have faith in the system and ensure public 
dollars are spent wisely and legally we must do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 of the bill, the changes to the Financial Administration 
Act, governs the rules for borrowing by government departments, 
agencies and certain crown corporations to make them more 
accountable to the Department of Finance.  That is a good thing. 
It closes a loophole that needs to be closed.  What we in the New 
Democratic Party object to specifically and very strongly is 
clause 6 of the bill which adds the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board to the list of crown corporations exempted from 
the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fellow NDP MPs and I do not support exempting the CPP 
Investment Board from the Financial Administration Act.  The CPP 
Investment Board is not like the CBC or the Bank of Canada.  It 
does not need to be arm's length from the government.  We believe 
that the crown corporation entrusted with investing the hard 
earned pension money of Canadians should not be exempt from 
democratic oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said the same thing when the CPP Investment Board was created 
by the government a few years ago and we stand by that today. 
This is the pension money of Canadians.  It is what many 
Canadians will rely on in their retirement years.  For many 
people it is pretty much all they will rely on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation entrusted with that money ought to be 
responsible to the Canadian people, not to a government appointed 
investment board.  However it is not.  The way the Liberals have 
set up the corporation, the only people it will be responsible to 
are bankers on Bay Street.  That is a dangerous way to treat the 
hard earned pension money of Canadians.  By the time my three 
kids reach retirement age they will look back on how today's 
Liberal government handled the Canada pension plan and say that 
it was a mistake to set up it up as the CPP Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party colleagues and I indicated that we believe pension 
dollars should be invested into ethical funds and ethical 
investments.  What is the reasoning of a government which 
promotes healthy living and anti-smoking but allows the CPP to 
invest in tobacco companies?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reasoning behind that?  What is the reasoning behind 
the board's investment in Talisman, the energy company which is 
tearing itself through Sudan and which is, from my perspective, 
certainly a part of the carnage taking place within that country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take offence to even a penny of my pension dollars going to 
Talisman, Imperial Tobacco or any fund like that.  As a citizen 
and a payer of pension dollars, I should be able to tell the 
government it cannot invest at least my share of CPP payments 
into those kinds of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, some of us feel strongly enough about the 
issue to forsake the increased profit of selling tobacco to 
people in China.  As the domestic tobacco market shrinks due to 
growing public awareness of its health risks, I do not want our 
dollars to promote it anywhere else in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I reiterate my party's opposition to the bill 
even though there are parts of it we like.  It is extremely 
disheartening that we cannot support the setting aside of money 
for the Canada foundation for innovation.  We are not able to 
support it because we must vote on the bill in its entirety. 
Although we support the setting aside of money for science, 
research and development, we stand clearly and strongly for a 
democratically accountable CPP investment board which answers to 
parliament, and the bill does not provide for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I restate once again my profound displeasure with the government 
for bringing forward these measures in an anti-democratic and 
unparliamentary omnibus bill.  It should have brought in two or 
three separate bills to allow each issue to be voted on 
separately.  It once again shows the Liberal government's 
profound contempt for democracy.  It is something Canadian people 
will not let the government get away with forever. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents 
of Calgary East to speak to Bill C-17.  My colleague from the NDP 
quite rightly pointed out that a lot of things are wrong with the 
bill.  We agree with many of the issues she raised today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said the bill was anti-democratic.  I will make this 
observation.  My colleague from Elk Island spoke prior to her. He 
addressed his concerns about the bill.  Due to a mix up he 
thought he had 20 minutes to speak but he did not.  As he did not 
have time to make all his points he asked for unanimous consent 
to be allowed to do so.  Members from the government side 
refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government afraid of?  This is the house of 
democracy.  The Liberals should let people speak.  They are the 
governing party.  They should show by example what is democracy. 
For the Liberals to deny my colleague his right to speak 
indicates they are afraid of something.  They are afraid we will 
be able to show what is glaringly wrong.  They are afraid of this 
coming out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the NDP stated very clearly, the bill is 
anti-democratic because it has two parts, the Budget 
Implementation Act and the Financial Administration Act.  She 
rightly pointed that it creates a problem for the opposition as 
to what it should support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the Canada foundation for innovation, let me 
quote the Canadian Alliance policy of the last election.  It 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will appoint a Senior Advisor on Technology with private 
sector technology experience to report directly to the Prime 
Minister...We will bring the best ideas in business, government, 
and universities together to facilitate the transition to the new 
economy and position Canada as a global leader...We will increase 
support to Canada's research granting councils, and appoint a 
Chief Scientist of Canada to co-ordinate science activities in 
all government departments and ensure that science, not politics, 
prevails...We will increase Research and Development funding by 
$500 million. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Canadian Alliance and its members are concerned, 
we recognize the importance of technology and of supporting 
research with public dollars.  Our nation has a proud history of 
producing excellent scientists.  Our record shows we are quite 
capable of being the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in Canada is extremely proud of Drs. Banting and Best 
who invented insulin for the treatment of diabetes and changed 
thousands of lives around the world.  That is highly commendable 
and Canada is quite rightly proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not lack brains.  We do not lack men of distinction in our 
nation.  We agree with the government that it should support 
technology and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is becoming smaller.  Borders are disappearing.  We 
are moving into an era of globalization and fewer borders.  As 
borders diminish competition increases.  As competition 
increases, nations that are poised to take advantage of 
innovation and new ideas are the nations that will progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should position itself to take advantage of globalization 
in the coming years.  If we do not, someone else will and at the 
end of the day we will be the losers.  It would be a tragedy not 
to support it when we have such an intelligent workforce and such 
illustrious persons in our universities and research councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problem supporting the first part of the bill, 
although we have some questions as to the amount.  We say $500 
million.  The government says $750 million.  There is a slight 
difference there but the objectives are the same.  We feel that 
our overall policy of lower taxation, freer markets and less 
government interference would eventually see more dollars put 
into research facilities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the NDP stated, the second part of the 
bill, the Financial Administration Act, is where we have 
difficulty and why we will not support the bill.  If the bill had 
been broken into two sections we would have supported the Budget 
Implementation Act with reference to the Canada foundation for 
innovation.  However we have a problem with the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our difficulty arises with a lot of issues.  First, the bill was 
brought forth to correct a legislative error.  It is amazing that 
with all the bureaucrats, research staff and huge departments at 
the government's disposal it still makes legislative errors.  It 
spends billions of dollars and cannot even make a bill that is 
right.  It then must bring in another bill to correct the 
mistakes.  When opposition members have the opportunity to show 
what is wrong, the government cuts debate short and does not 
allow us to speak.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we are opposing the bill is that the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board would be exempt from the Financial 
Administration Act.  However, we do like the fact that there will 
be less ministerial intervention.  We have been asking for less 
government and ministerial intervention.  When there is 
government intervention, it spoils the good intention of a bill 
because it is packed with patronage.  Good programs usually 
develop implementation problems due to unnecessary ministerial or 
government intervention.  We are happy when we see less 
ministerial intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have difficulty with the fact that the board would not 
be subject to the auditor general's review.  The auditor general 
should have every right to do an audit when public funds are 
being used.  Public funds have been sent to the government, in 
trust, to be used wisely and the only person who can advise the 
Canadian public that the money has been used wisely is the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the auditor general's report because he has 
shown time after time where the government has failed to use 
taxpayer money wisely.  We are concerned that the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board would be exempt from the Financial 
Administration Act.  The bill would also take away the auditor 
general's right to audit the board and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar to what was said by my colleague from the NDP, we have 
difficulty supporting the bill because it has two parts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bill is undemocratic.  This is 
the second time today that I find myself standing and talking 
about legislation that is undemocratic.  That is the direction of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to paraphrase a famous phrase because I do not remember 
the words exactly.  Winston Churchill once said that democracy 
was very hard work but that it was the best governance system 
that we had.  If we choose not to work hard at democracy then we 
will lose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill once again displays a malaise coming from the 
government in terms of how it approaches very important 
initiatives.  There is nothing more important in what we do in 
this institution than to look after the revenue that is collected 
from taxpayers and purportedly spent for the greater good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to accept legislation that deals with two 
unrelated things. It was unnecessary.  If we had dealt with the 
Canada foundation for innovation initiative separately, we could 
have approached it in a very professional manner.  We could then 
have dealt with the rest of the bill, which would have been the 
appropriate way to do it.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude that the government is using this as a political 
instrument.  It would like the opposition to vote against it 
because then it could say that the opposition is opposed to the 
Canada foundation for innovation.  That is absolutely not the 
case.  We are opposed to the way that this came about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Canada foundation for innovation was included in the 
deficit as if it were a liability even though the foundation did 
not exist at the end of that year.  The government chose to 
include the $800 million as a liability.  It was a total 
departure from previous accounting policies, practices and 
principles for the third year in a row, and in contrast to public 
sector accounting and auditing board guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general was very kind as he called it inappropriate 
accounting and a parliamentary oversight.  Inappropriate 
accounting is a very strong criticism to come from an auditor and 
parliamentary oversight is very kind indeed, because we are still 
doing it. That criticism, which should be of major concern, is 
being ignored.  It is being ignored deliberately and not just in 
this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have here?  We have the Minister of Industry making 
an announcement of a $750 million spending initiative.  We are 
not sure whether it is over ten years, or ten years plus or minus 
one or two, or some other factor.  The government wants to set it 
all up as current liability and that is inappropriate accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has now gone from the days when it was trying 
very hard to balance the national books, because we had a crisis 
in the making if we did not, to a position where we are spending 
$35 billion more than we did the year before last.  Thirty-five 
billion dollars out of Canada's budget is a very steep increase. 
A lot of it is going out in end of fiscal year spending sprees 
that are not subject to the normal course of scrutiny which 
happens when we have a budget in the spring with all that goes 
into the preparation of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have ministers near the end of the fiscal year making 
spending announcements prior to any parliamentary or legislative 
authority and operating under the assumption that they will get 
whatever they want out of this place because this place is just a 
rubber stamp.  That is the way the government treats this place 
and that is very destructive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of bolstering, boosting and creating a progressive 
dynamic democratic institution, we are going backward.  It 
happens time and time again.  We have not had a government 
committed to democratic principles for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be some historical reasons for that.  We were a much 
more homogeneous country early in our history.  We have always 
been a country with a small population in a large land. 
Governance was easier and it was more consensual.  We were also a 
very centralized country, whereas today it is very clear that we 
are becoming less centralized because we are getting a lot more 
economic growth from outside central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a young man we were taught that our major city was 
Montreal, Toronto was second, Vancouver was third and Winnipeg 
was fourth.  Things are very different today.  At least three of 
the top five financial cities in Canada are in western Canada. 
There has been a complete rejockeying of positions in cities like 
Montreal and Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has changed the dynamics of the country much faster than 
our central bureaucracy or federal governments up until now have 
recognized.  We need a government that works hard to make 
legislative initiatives and other initiatives fit into a modern, 
progressive and democratic model.  Unfortunately that is not 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party would like a simple amendment to be made to the 
legislation.  We would like to have the auditor general oversee 
on an ongoing basis the Canada foundation for innovation.  That 
is not in the legislation.  Unfortunately that is consistent with 
where the government is coming from.  We would make that 
amendment to the bill and I would hope that government members 
would support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 27 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-22, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax 
Application Rules, certain acts related to the Income Tax Act, 
the Canada Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and another act 
related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the second time and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure people will be surprised to see me get up for 
the third time within two hours.  This is a unique happening in 
the House.  I would like to remind people that this is happening 
because the governing party is refusing to debate these issues 
and is refusing to defend its bills.  As such, the bills are 
going through more rapidly because only the opposition is 
pointing out what is wrong with the legislation.  The government 
is refusing to defend itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Calgary East to speak today to Bill C-22, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the 
Excise Tax Act and the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations 
Act.  This bill, like many dealing with the tax code, is an 
omnibus bill, meaning that it deals with a number of issues at 
once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned in the title of this bill, acts included are the 
Income Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan and the Excise Tax Act. 
While each of these acts deserves attention and has important 
consequences for Canadians, I would like to address my thoughts 
to how this act impacts on Canada's competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been appointed chair of the advisory committee on 
globalization and competitiveness by the Leader of the 
Opposition.  The mandate of this advisory committee is to advise 
and to get input from business leaders, academics, 
non-governmental organizations and Canadians from all across the 
country on the possibilities and pitfalls of globalization for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countless ideas about how to make Canada more 
competitive in a more interconnected world.  These ideas need a 
voice in parliament and the public sector.  It is hoped that the 
Canadian Alliance will be that voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the Liberal government has ignored the reality that 
Canada is losing valuable ground to our neighbours to the south 
and to our major international competitors.  We know that the new 
U.S. administration won a mandate based on the promise of 
substantial tax relief and a targeted plan of debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that income taxes are not the sole indicator of the tax 
divide between Canada and the U.S.  Canadians face other taxes 
that push the total tax burden higher.  The total tax burden 
includes sales taxes, payroll taxes and other levies by all 
levels of government, which create a Canadian tax burden that is 
up to one-third higher than that of the U.S.  It is clear that if 
Canada does not follow U.S. tax reductions, the country will fall 
further behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mexico, our NAFTA partner, also has vigorous plans to become a 
major centre for North American investment.  Canada will face 
increasingly tough competition from Mexico in our plans to 
attract foreign investment.  Mexico enjoys a unique position as a 
member of NAFTA.  It is the only North American country that has 
a free trade agreement with the European Union as well as with 
Mercosur, the free trade bloc with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and 
Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges presented by Mexico and the U.S. are just two 
examples of why Canada cannot afford to continue making negative 
public policy decisions that impact our competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the current foreign affairs minister was the Minister of 
Industry, while he was curtailed because he was representing the 
government, he did at times manage to raise warning signs about 
our country's tax bracket and competitiveness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey of the world's most competitive economies by the 
Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development 
has placed Canada at number 11, a drop of one place from last 
year.  The institute praised Canada for its infrastructure, legal 
framework and human resources, but gave poor marks for its record 
in science and technology and for uncompetitive taxes.  Just 
before speaking on this bill, I spoke on another bill in 
reference to welcoming the government's initiative in helping 
science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years many of Canada's most successful companies and 
business people have argued that high taxation impacts Canada's 
ability to be competitive in a more interconnected world.  High 
taxation discourages investment and innovation and it is a major 
cause of the brain drain.  These issues have been pointed out 
time after time to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Cleghorn, former chairman and CEO of the Royal Bank, said 
that higher taxation has diverted savings into the government 
sector that would earn higher productivity returns for companies 
and societies at large in free markets.  He went on to say that 
higher taxation also hits living standards more immediately by 
cutting off what is left in our pockets at the end of the day to 
spend on our families and ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian business leaders and academics will agree that for 
Canada the challenge is to build a more innovative economy that 
is well positioned for competitive success in the new global 
market.  To succeed, Canadian firms must take full advantage of 
the opportunities created by greater economic integration and 
increased cross border flows of goods, services, technology, 
ideas and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility for building a more innovative and 
competitive economy falls primarily on Canadian managers and 
entrepreneurs.  However, government has a role to play as well. 
Government can reduce taxes.  It can ensure that Canadian 
students are some of the most highly educated in the world.  It 
can provide the conditions necessary to make Canada the final 
destination of foreign direct investment from all regions of the 
world.  The government can and must do all those things, but 
sadly the government does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims in the bill that it has cut taxes by 
$100.5 billion over five years.  This is what it is saying based 
on its list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us look at reality.  The reality is that we must 
subtract $3.2 billion over five years for social spending.  The 
child benefit is a spending program delivered through the tax 
system and it is an increase.  It is not a tax decrease, it is a 
spending increase.  However, the government says it is a tax 
decrease.  It does not recognize that it is a tax increase.  As 
well, indexation is accounted for separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next we must subtract $29.5 billion over the five years for 
increased CPP premium hikes.  We all know that CPP premiums have 
been increased, yet the government refuses to say that is part of 
its tax cuts and puts it separately.  In reality, when we look at 
the competitiveness for everything, it is a burden.  The burden 
comes out of the government's mismanagement of the CPP.  I was 
part of the debate on CPP premiums.  What is interesting is that 
when CPP was first introduced the government was saying the same 
thing that it is now saying after 20 years of CPP premium 
increases.  Nothing has changed over that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, indexing personal income taxes is meant to hold the tax 
burden constant over time, so it should not be counted as a tax 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, when we take out all these things, there is only 
$47.1 billion in net tax reduction provided over five years. 
Let me repeat that:  it is only $47.1 billion over five years, 
not the $100.5 billion that the government is claiming.  We can 
see innovative accounting here, with the government giving the 
illusion to Canadians that they are facing major tax relief over 
the next five years when in reality that is not happening.

decreased.  I asked him to take a closer look to see if his CPP 
premiums had increased.  Sure enough, CPP had increased.  That is 
why he is taking home a smaller cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's current policy does not create the competitive 
environment that we need to position ourselves for taking 
advantage of the global economy.  The Canadian Alliance has 
proposed further reductions in taxes, which would create an 
environment that businesses are looking for on behalf of 
Canadians in order to poise themselves to take advantage of the 
21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I am not sure if 
the member opposite has actually read the budget or the economic 
update but he seems to have missed a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I could start with some of them.  The $100 billion tax cut 
announced in the economic update is the largest tax cut in 
Canadian history in dollar terms.  Let me provide some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite seemed to indicate that there is no real tax 
cuts or that they are minimal.  Of course he mixes up, as the 
Alliance Party always does, the Canada pension plan.  The Canada 
pension plan is a contribution based program, an investment in 
the future.  It consists of contributions from employers and 
employees, so it is not a tax at all and the member knows that. 
Of course the premiums do not go to consolidated revenue.  Let me 
read an example: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A two-earner family of four has a combined income of $60,000. 
Last year they paid about $5,700 in federal income tax.  Next 
year, their taxes will fall by over $1,000—a first year tax cut 
of 18 per cent.  In less than four years their taxes will fall by 
34 per cent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another example, a one-earner family with two children that 
makes $40,000 will see income taxes decline by 59% from what 
otherwise would have been paid in federal taxes, which I think is 
a pretty reasonable measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member opposite realizes as well that by 
the end of June the CPP contributions will have maxed out, as we 
say, as will EI generally.  Any small impact of the increase in 
the CPP will of course disappear at the end of June.  In terms of 
net disposable income this will be a huge boost to Canadians. 
They will have more money in their pockets and more again in the 
years to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member has actually calculated that and what 
that would mean to Canadians in a very positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, finally the government 
side has asked me a question.  I have been up on three bills and 
this is the first time the government has asked a question. 
Obviously something is bringing them to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way has brought up the same point I just 
mentioned when I said the government is claiming $100.5 billion 
in tax cuts while in reality the cuts are only $47.1 billion. 
Whether it is a CPP increase or whether it is the other indirect 
increases the government has put in, the examples the member 
cites are examples of ideal conditions, which impact a very small 
number of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that when the member goes back to his riding 
constituents will phone us and find out that contrary to what 
government members have been saying, that is not what the tax on 
their take home pay is. 
As a matter of fact they are taking advantage of provincial 
governments such as the governments of Alberta and Ontario that 
are reducing taxes.  The take home pay increase is coming from 
the provincial governments and they want to take credit for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we should ask all Canadians what their 
take home pay is and they will say it is contrary to what government 
members are saying.  That is not the reality out there.  It is 
similar to the home heating fuel program they brought in which 
resulted in criminals getting the cheques.  At the same time they 
were saying they were helping the poor.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I resume debate I would 
like to address myself to the hon. member for Elk Island.  When I 
was last in the chair, I believe it was late Tuesday afternoon, 
he rose on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had conflicting views on the standing orders regarding the 
matter of the vote on the business of supply being deferred and 
whether debate should have continued.  The member for Elk Island 
was correct. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since the very beginning of 
time it has been a practice for citizens to pay tax to support 
the services they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Book of Genesis tells us that both Abraham and Jacob paid a 
tax of 10% on what they owned and this tax was called a tithe. 
Later the Council of Vienne which sat from 1311 to 1312 approved 
giving the money from the tithe collected over a six year period 
to the King of France to finance the crusades.  The concept of a 
simple tax on revenue has been with us for a very long time, as 
has been the concept of directing tax money to fund the costs of 
a war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came as no great surprise when the federal government in 1917 
introduced the Income War Tax Act as a temporary measure.  The 
act was 10 pages long and used relatively simple language.  The 
basic obligation to pay income tax was clearly stated in 
subsection 4(1) where it said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There shall be assessed, levied and paid, upon the income during 
the preceding year of every person residing or ordinarily 
resident in Canada...the following taxes: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) four per centum upon all income exceeding fifteen hundred 
dollars in the case of unmarried persons and widows or widowers 
without dependent children, and exceeding three thousand dollars 
in the case of all other persons. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time university educations were a rarity and one 
certainly did not need a degree to figure out whether or not one 
owed taxes and, if so, exactly how much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the tax act is a case study in bafflegab.  It stands in 
violation of one of the most basic rights of Canadians: the right 
to know and understand the laws that affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, like most other Commonwealth countries, has specific 
legislation requiring the publication of our laws.  The 
Publication of Statutes Act requires that our laws be printed and 
distributed to the public so that the public may know the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as our legal system has long held that ignorance of the law 
cannot be a defence, it requires that citizens be able to access 
the laws and therefore know exactly what they are.  This includes 
the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about it, every citizen should know their rights 
and obligations.  That is a basic tenet of a proper running 
democracy.  The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms meets 
this standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Department of Justice website the charter prints on to 
seven neat pages and can be downloaded in seconds.  It has clear, 
concise wording.  For example, subsection 6(1) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and 
leave Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who have completed a grade three education will 
understand this sentence and, more important, will understand 
their rights and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By stark contrast the Income Tax Act is there as well.  The 
Income Tax Act is also on the Department of Justice website.  A 
warning lets would-be downloading taxpayers know that the act is 
a whopping 5.3 megabytes in size, relative to the seconds it 
takes to download the charter.  One can only assume that this 
warning is so users can make room on their hard drive and/or 
prepare themselves for a lengthy wait by reading <I>War and 
Peace</I> or building a ship in a bottle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one finally receives the completed file one is also in for 
a very nasty surprise.  Actually one is in for two surprises. The 
first surprise is that the act is not really written in either of 
our official languages.  Turning to subsection 2(2), I will read 
the first paragraph which is written in both English and French: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350
<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In English it reads as follows: “The taxable income of a 
taxpayer for a taxation year is the taxpayer's income for the 
year plus the additions and minus the deductions permitted by 
Division C”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have chosen one of the more straightforward paragraphs.  In 
order for taxpayers to answer the basic question “How much do I 
owe” or “combien dois-je au gouvernement”, Canadians who own 
mutual funds or who have invested in an RRSP need not only a 
profound knowledge of arcane English but a mind which is 
sufficiently powerful to follow the logistical gymnastics of the 
basic calculations.  It is amazing how far we have regressed 
since 1917. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The version of the Income Tax Act which is on the Department of 
Justice website was last updated on August 31, 2000.  That means 
that the web version does not reflect the changes to the act made 
by the October 18 pre-election mini budget.  Even after wading 
through thousands of pages of linguistic fog, the taxpayer would 
still not have a clear answer to the question “How much do I 
owe?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the private sector is willing to help.  The problem 
is that the tax act is so complicated that the books which try to 
explain it are nearly as thick as the act itself.  Arthur 
Andersen's <I>Preparing Your Tax Return</I> is 1,264 pages with a 
40 page index.  Let us think about that.  The index to the guide 
is four times the length of the original temporary Income War Tax 
Act.  It is, however, the authoritative guide, the one that the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency uses to understand the act that 
it must administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authors of this book accurately summarize the problems with 
the Income Tax Act in the book's foreword.  They write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complex nature of the Canadian Income Tax Act, the 
fact that relatively few of its provisions have been interpreted 
by the tax courts, and that some of its provisions have not even 
been interpreted by the CCRA, it has not been possible to provide 
answers to all of the questions which may arise. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexity of the tax act is such that an entire industry 
now exists to help Canadians navigate the minefield the act has 
become.  Accountants, tax guides and online tax filing services 
multiply like yeast in a warm oven in an effort to help the 
average person answer that simple five word question: “How much 
do I owe?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the complexities of the tax code that Bill C-22 adds, just 
imagine if other government obligations were crafted with the 
same complications.  For example, how many traffic deaths would 
result if the rules of the road were as complicated as the tax 
act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many Canadians would never travel abroad if a passport 
application form were nearly as difficult as a tax return?  How 
many Canadians would watch Peter Mansbridge if he used taxspeak 
in his newscasts?  How many Canadians would drink water from a 
public drinking fountain if the state could not affirm the 
cleanliness of that water in fewer than 120,000 words? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of the lunacy and the complexity of our tax code, I 
suspect that the fog the Canadians face in understanding their 
tax code is deliberate on the part of the Government of Canada. I 
think there is an agenda here, a hidden agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the relief that average Canadians feel upon 
successfully filing their jungle gym tax returns probably acts to 
dull the rage taxpayers feel working eight weeks longer than 
their American friends to pay their federal taxes.  Let us not 
forget that even as the finance minister postures and smiles in 
the House, American workers pay their tax bill on May 3 while it 
takes Canadians until June 30.  Perhaps it is the relief of 
actually working for themselves on July 1 that puts so much of 
the glee into Canada Day celebrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of those taxes has driven the Canadian dollar into a 
downward spiral.  It is now hovering between 63 cents and 64 
cents.  The tax cuts that President Bush is considering in the 
United States will both affect the value of our dollar and 
further widen the income gap between working class Canadians and 
their neighbours south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members continue to posture and smile around their 
mini budget's tax relief but it hardly gives them bragging 
rights.  It is like the Trabant claiming to be the best built 
east German sedan.  It may be true, but it is of little comfort 
in a world where other countries are doing much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of even less comfort when we realize that we are paying 
far more federal taxes today proportionately than our 
grandparents paid in 1917.  In 1917, a family of two with a 
single income of $3,000 paid $120 in taxes.  In today's money 
that is roughly $1,349 in taxes on income of $33,373.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1917 Canadians started paying taxes when they earned in 
today's dollars almost $16,800.  Today individuals under the 
Liberal government start paying taxes when they earn less than 
$8,000.  In other words the tax code has become more regressive: 
more Liberals, more regressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year a Canadian family of two earning that same $33,000 
will pay $3,422 in personal income tax after the finance 
minister's biggest tax cut in history.  That means for every $3 
in taxes in 1917 today's taxpayer will pay $7.61. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think back, in 1917 Canada was deeply involved in the 
great war.  Hundreds of thousands of Canadian men were fighting 
in Europe.  Canadians supported and subsidized 100% of their 
patriotic effort.  Their existence was 100% subsidized through 
tax dollars.  The government introduced the Income War Tax Act to 
finance the war and help those brave Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in times of unprecedented peace and stability the 
government needs more than twice as much tax revenue from the 
average person just to run the status quo, and it does not even 
run that very well or outside debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a scary thought and really demonstrates the need for 
genuine tax relief.  Other countries have figured it out.  The 
government has not but other countries have.  Places such as 
Ireland have learned that cutting taxes means job growth, 
increased competitiveness and a higher standard of living.  The 
Celtic tiger has outpaced Canada in both standard of living and 
competitiveness since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to do two things to convince my generation 
to stay in Canada and to lure other workers here.  It needs to 
simplify the tax system and it needs to cut taxes overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplifying our tax system is needed because it lets people know 
directly how much they owe and because it focuses the debate not 
on the language of the act but on the amount paid in tax.  In 
other words, how big is the government and how much do we have to 
ante up for it?  That is a healthy debate for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once people get a clear avenue of calculating their real tax 
burden they will demand tax cuts with the same zeal they now 
demand for balanced budgets.  When that day comes the government will 
have no choice but to limit its voracious appetite for tax 
dollars and offer meaningful tax relief.  On the same day 
Canada's standard of living will rise and our international 
competitiveness will be boosted if the government shows this kind 
of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the most overtaxed and debt saddled generation in 
Canadian history, I will celebrate that day when it comes.  In 
the meantime I will continue voting against and speaking against 
Liberal halfsteps and increased tax code complications such as we 
see embedded in the bill we are debating today.

Speaker, I just want to say that was the best speech we have 
heard from that riding in about three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend there was an article in the <I>National Post</I>. 
It was quite a lengthy editorial about the things Canada could do 
to get ahead of the U.S. as far as economic policy is concerned. 
There were a number of really broad based, thinking outside the 
box kinds of scenarios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member what he thought of a particular 
scenario.  It was suggested that young people starting in the 
workforce should be able to earn the first $250,000 of their 
lives taxfree to give them a head start in building their homes, 
raising their families and educating their kids.  What does the 
member think about a scenario like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a proposal allowing people 
to earn $250,000 before they owe their first nickel to the 
finance minister is the kind of progressivity we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a former student.  Rather than giving a GST rebate cheque 
for home heating fuel expenses to students who do not pay those 
expenses, who do not need it and do not deserve it, why does the 
government not give broad based tax relief that really means 
something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Lethbridge knows, in modern Canada today 
a totally obscure bureaucrat who knows nothing, has invented 
nothing and has created nothing has more power in our economy 
than a Canadian who creates 10,000 jobs.  That is the reality and 
we need to change it.

Mr. Speaker, the disgraced junior multiculturalism minister's 
hurtful smears and remarks contradict her own government's 
foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she smeared Kamloops and Prince George she also compared 
Northern Ireland to ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Macedonia. She 
is seriously undermining Canada's efforts in the peace process in 
Northern Ireland. Canada has contributed over $5 million of our 
tax dollars to peace building efforts in Northern Ireland.  The 
Prime Minister must replace this minister before she does more 
damage.  The minister is subverting international efforts in the 
peace process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is inflicting injuries not only at home but also on the 
world stage.  Her smears not only contradict her own department's 
mandate but also work against the government's foreign affairs 
agenda.

South Africa for the United Nations world conference on racism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
official opposition has gone too far.  On Tuesday in this

Minister to Slobodan Milosevic, the butcher of the Balkans. 
This former president of the former Yugoslavia is to face the 
international tribunal accused of war crimes and genocide.

No comparison may be made between him and Milosevic.  The member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every year for the past 40 years spring brings back 
Cancer Awareness Month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>April 5 is Daffodil Day, a day that will in fact last three days 
and help cancer societies collect several millions of dollars to 
be used primarily to fund research on that disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, the daffodil, which looks both fragile and 
strong, has become a symbol of hope and determination against 
all types of cancer. That disease could affect one person in 
three by the end of the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>April is designated to bring awareness to this particular 
disease. 
That is what the Fondation québécoise du cancer, which works to 
alleviate the plight of those who are affected by the disease, 
is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the next three days let us stop at the daffodil booths 
and contribute generously to the fundraising campaigns of the 
Quebec and Canadian cancer societies.

Speaker, on Tuesday this week we debated an opposition motion 
calling for a public inquiry.  That motion was defeated, but 
during the debate a most regrettable comparison was drawn between 
Slobodan Milosevic and the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times in this House the passion of some members for the 
subject of debate causes them to personalize their remarks and 
say things they should not.  This is an occupational hazard for 
people such as us, who spend a lot of our time in politics 
working with our mouths.  Occasionally we make mistakes.  The 
appropriate resolution of a verbal mistake, no matter why it has 
occurred, is a verbal apology, and our House accepts them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparisons between our Prime Minister and Slobodan Milosevic 
should be seen as odious to all of us in the House and hopefully 
to Canadians at large.  I ask the member to reconsider her 
remarks and to put this matter right in the way we all have to do 
here from time to time in this great place:  with an apology.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the debate in this place has been acrimonious at best, but it hit 
an all time low on Tuesday when a member tried to draw a 
comparison between our Prime Minister and the butcher of the 
Balkans, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member may think that is just insulting Liberals, but in 
fact it is insulting to all Canadians who have moved to Canada 
from the former Yugoslavia and to Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should withdraw the words and apologize.  The member 
has shown a total lack of morals, sensitivity and understanding 
in a blind zest to destroy our Prime Minister's reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not forget this repugnant example of a member who

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canada Post has announced that it is celebrating the summit of 
the Americas in Quebec with a special postage stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ironic because Canada Post is one of our public 
services that is very vulnerable to challenges under these free 
trade agreements.  In fact, UPS is suing it right now for $230 
million in lost opportunity because it says Canada Post is a 
monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly are we celebrating here?  The loss of our economic 
sovereignty?  What is the stamp going to show?  Perhaps a nice 
picture of Hughie pepper-spraying a bunch of college kids would 
be appropriate, or perhaps a picture of riot police strong-arming 
peaceful protesters.  How about a picture of a UPS truck 
delivering our mail?  That would be the vision of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does Canada Post get off being a cheerleader for what 
amounts to a charter of rights for foreign corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is nothing more than cheap political propaganda.  It is 
using a stamp to celebrate a trade deal that threatens to stamp 
out democracy.

something to make our shipyards more competitive with those of

also declared open season on directors of public commissions.  A

commissioner.

dealing with the real business of the nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

anything to do with it and that he wanted his MPs to express 
their own views.  Is he telling us that nobody from his office or 
the whip's office communicated to the MPs at all in terms of 
telling them to vote against the majority of their constituents 
last night?  Yes or no.  He had nothing to do, the whip had 
nothing to do and nobody told MPs how to vote.  Is that true?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing I would like to say to the Leader of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

did not answer, yes or no, so that was very instructive to 
Canadians.  He did not answer again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the former Clerk of the Privy Council who served under 
Mr. Pearson and Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Gordon Robertson, who literally 
wrote the book on ethics.  He recently said that the Prime 
Minister had lowered the bar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with the quashing of a public inquiry and these constant 
orders to their MPs to vote against their constituents, he has 
dropped the bar even farther.  We are wondering how far this 
Liberal limbo will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has lowered the bar on public ethics.  Is 
this the legacy that he is happy about leaving to Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, because the Leader of the Opposition had foot in mouth 
disease he forced taxpayers of Alberta to pay $700,000. After 
that there was a payback to his party by the law firm of $70,000. 
Two months after this action by the law firm, it cooked the 
books to pretend that one individual, two months after the 
election, willingly gave $70,000 to a losing leader and a losing 
party.  It is absolutely unbelievable and probably scandalous.

and Auberge Grand-Mère affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister claimed in this House that he had not read 
the September 1999 agreement until last week.  Yet when the 
ethics counsellor—or the so-called ethics counsellor—testified 
before the standing committee on industry, his reply to my 
question as to whether the Prime Minister was directly involved 
in the negotiation was “Oh yes, he was directly involved in the 
negotiation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whom we are to believe, the Prime Minister 
who tells us he was not aware, or the ethics counsellor who says 
“Oh yes, he was directly involved in the negotiation”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> So, Mr. Speaker, 
the ethics counsellor has, I take it, not exactly told us the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, however, whether the Prime Minister read the 
document or did not read the document makes no difference.  The 
document exists and is signed by his company.  In this 
document we find that the Prime Minister renounces all 
ownership rights which means he had such rights.  Also, that he 
offers a seller's guarantee which means he had something to 
sell.  What is more, he makes a commitment to pay the legal 
costs of the purchaser, Michaud.  What big-heartedness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what it is is the tabling of a document.  That document is the 
contract of a sale that took place on November 1, 1993.  And after 
that date I was no longer the owner of the shares. I no longer 
had any interest whatsoever in the golf club.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the Prime

property in 1993 end up six years later a signatory to a 
document giving the vendor's guarantee, promising to assume the 
legal costs and transferring his property rights.

<A NAME="LINK225">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application 
Rules, certain acts related to the Income Tax Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and another act 
related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we were in the questions and 
comments phase of the discussion.  I have largely concluded my 
comments so I would entertain any questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I did want to remind the government of the issue of 
brain drain and the further complications in the tax code that 
Bill C-22 presents.  I will give the example to the House of my 
own family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother-in-law lives in Louisiana.  My sister lives in 
Atlanta.  They are part of the brain drain.  In the 19th century, 
the great exodus of Loyalists to Canada on the underground 
railway had a song they used to sing.  It was called <I>Follow 
the Drinking Ground</I>.  The chorus of the song is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long old master<BR> 
Don't come after me<BR> 
I'm heading north to Canada<BR> 
Where everybody's free 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the chorus of the song they sang when they came to 
Canada because Canada was the place where everybody was free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then it is astonishing how things have changed.  The 
underground railway has turned into a highway heading south, by 
which the best and brightest leave the country.  They leave this 
country for better opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own sister is an example of that.  She has a degree in 
communications in French from Simon Fraser University and she is 
in Louisiana helping Canadian firms that are trying to sell 
Canadian products in the French Bayou country.  She is a Canadian 
earning her keep in the United States because this country does 
not treat her the way she thinks government really should treat 
its best and brightest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has a better environment for cultivating, 
sustaining and taking care of the best and brightest in their 
country.  The Americans treat young people as a resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we do not get that.  The finance minister brags 
in the House of Commons day after day about the fact that we have 
a balanced budget, but he does not give credit to the people who 
balanced the budget:  young people, entrepreneurs, the best and 
brightest, small business owners, families, the people who 
sacrifice, and people in the university departments like the 
small university I went to, the University of Northern British 
Columbia, which has a crisis in its entire financing structure 
because of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a balanced budget for a whole host of reasons, like the 
hospitals that get shut down because of this government and like 
the overtaxation of small businesses.  The government stands atop 
a dustbin of bad decisions.  It stands atop the rubble of bad 
financial decisions and atop the shoulders of small businesses 
and says that because of the government and its decisions Canada 
has a balanced budget.  Canada has a balanced budget because of 
nothing government has done.  We have a balanced budget because 
of a whole host of reasons, which frankly the government does not 
control.  The finance minister and the Prime Minister do not 
appoint Alan Greenspan.  They do not decide the economic growth 
rates of the United States.  They opposed free trade.  They 
increased taxes.  They increased the payroll taxes that kill jobs 
and the Canada pension plan.  They are driving the best and 
brightest out of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk and brag about balancing the budget and about bills 
like Bill C-22 that we are debating today, but Bill C-22 goes in 
the wrong direction.  It further complicates the tax code.  It 
makes it less likely that people, entrepreneurs and builders, 
will want to stay here because they see that this country will be 
something they want to be part of in 20 or 30 years.  That is not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to see the day when we go back to that chorus of 
the underground railway, where Canada is an enterprise state, 
where we can sing that chorus again and be proud of it.  For the 
government members who just walked in, I will remind the House of 
what that chorus is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long old master<BR> 
Don't come after me<BR> 
I'm heading north to Canada<BR> 
Where everybody's free 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need economic freedom and political freedom.  We do not have 
them, we deserve them, and if we do not, we are only sacrificing 
our future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before question period the member was commenting on a suggestion 
that the first $250,000 of income be tax free.  I believe the 
member's response to that suggestion was that that was the kind 
of progressivity that we should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me reflect on the issue of progressivity in our tax 
system.  For members information, progressivity is a 
principle by which the ability to pay is a founding principle. It 
means that at certain thresholds as our income grows the rate of 
income taxation would increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southeast once explained to the House 
that a 17% flat tax or single rate tax was a progressive tax 
because the more one would make the more one would pay.  That is 
kind of interesting.  Mathematically it is true but progressivity 
it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member square the fact that he is a proponent of 
progressivity in our income tax system, yet his party continues 
to suggest that we should not have different rates of taxation 
depending on how much we make.  Rather we should lower it so high 
income earners pay less money under a flat tax or single rate tax 
and in fact pay the same effective tax rate as low and middle 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is what happens in 
politics when a political debate is dumbed down into catch 
phrases that are supposed to represent entire economic thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The progressivity that the member talks about is nonsensical. He 
is describing progressivity as progressive larger chunks of 
income that the government takes away.  Our concept of 
progressivity is moving the economy forward, rewarding the best 
and brightest and letting people keep more of what they earn so 
they can have a better future.  That is progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is broken, flawed and unproven in almost every 
jurisdiction it has been tried, there is an economic argument 
presented in <I>Das Kapital</I> that says “The harder you work, 
the more you build, the more people you employ, the more you 
innovate, the more entrepreneurial you are, the more the state 
should punish you”.  Yes, there is an argument out there for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking as a young Canadian, and I hope I am not alone, it is 
rather progressive to say to people that the bigger the risk they 
take, the more successful they are, the more people they employ, 
the more ingenious they are, the more creative they are, the 
bigger sacrifices they make, the more the state is going to 
champion them as the kind of people that ought to live here, not 
the kind of people we are going to target and punish because we 
can take money from them and give it to the Secretary of State 
for Multiculturalism.  That is not progressivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the Liberals seem to define progressivity as the 
progressively larger chunks that the government can take away 
from the builders, producers, entrepreneurs and the people who 
make the country work.  I would suggest that the Finance Minister 
spend more time out there talking to small business people and 
telling them that in Canada they are worth something because they 
make the country work.  They employ the people and they make the 
country work.  The government should reward them not punish them 
for being the best that this country has. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would have to disagree with 
the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.  I miss the 
kind of passion and energy that the previous member from that 
riding had.  I find it strangely ironic that a member would stand 
up in the House and say that Canadians will not like $100 billion 
in tax cuts because it is going to complicate things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the flat tax or single rate tax.  Of course 
what it did was shift the burden of tax from high income 
Canadians to middle income Canadians, and close to the election 
campaign the Alliance changed it to a 17%, 25% tax.  We are not 
sure where it is going with its single rate tax but I am not sure 
anybody cares very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about complexity in the income tax system.  We 
might all agree that the Income Tax Act is complex. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However if the Alliance Party were to introduce a flat tax or 
single rate tax, does that mean that all the various deductions 
such as RRSP, medical expenses over a certain amount, charitable 
donations in certain circumstances, et cetera would not apply, or 
would he simply have Canadians take a number and multiply it by 
17 or 25? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of Canadians think that might be the case, but many of the 
member's colleagues in the House said that it will not be that 
way.  They said we would have all the same deductions because 
that was what Canadians wanted and expected.  Could the member 
clarify that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, along with the language of 
progressivity, it speaks again to what I said before about the 
contortions taken to distort a position of a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single rate tax is not a flat tax.  There is a big difference. 
There is also a big difference between $47.1 billion in tax 
relief which is what is actually happening, not $100 billion in 
tax relief.  He is not factoring in the Canada pension plan. 
This is what Canadians do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made reference to the previous member for my constituency and 
said he missed him.  The 70% of people in the riding who did not 
vote for him sure do not miss him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speaks to Liberal math.  It is not $100 billion in tax 
relief.  It is $47 billion.  There is a bottom line net amount. 
The net amount is not good enough.  Young Canadians are still 
leaving the country.  Businesses are still closing down. 
Provinces are not better off.  The welfare state gets larger and 
larger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I would like to see a lot of government departments have 
smaller budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  The hon. member says to name one.  The 
Secretary of State for Multiculturalism deserves a smaller 
budget.  There is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Because she does not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on 
Bill C-22.  I find it intriguing, listening to the debate, the 
completely different psychologies of our side and that of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to some of the comments made about the tax structure. 
Our party is for a progressive tax structure, not a punitive tax 
structure which is what we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have a system where the more one earns, the greater 
chunk is taken away?  Our party has always fought for the ability 
of individuals to take care of themselves and for a fair tax 
structure that takes the same percentage from the amount people 
make as they grow older. Therefore the more one makes, the more 
one pays, but the more one pays is not a greater percentage of 
what one makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also what is not as well known perhaps is that our party stands 
for radically and dramatically improving the health and welfare 
of the poorest and most impoverished people.  How would we do 
that?  Simply by raising the amount of money that people would 
have to make before they pay taxes.  That is progressive, 
innovative and demonstrates ingenuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly wants to help those who are most in 
need, then it would look at our single tax rate, look at the way 
we have articulated it and understand very clearly that it 
strikes a balance between helping those who are most impoverished 
while enabling those who are innovators to have the tools to 
innovate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one major complaint that I think all members in the 
House hear when they talk to small and medium sized businesses in 
their ridings.  That is the government takes too much money from 
their pockets.  They generate jobs, innovate and are the major 
engine of economic growth in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They ask us why the government is not listening.  There have 
been reports and committees at federal and provincial levels for 
years.  Report after report says the same thing.  Canadians want 
the ability to provide for themselves, to pay a fair share of tax 
but not a punitive share of tax.  Businesses want to generate the 
funds to hire people, to do research and development and engage 
in the actions that build a strong economy which enables us to 
have strong social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the mythologies that has always been connected to the 
right of the political spectrum is that the right does not care, 
the left does and that the right only cares for the rich, the 
left cares for the poor.  This is completely nonsensical. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have shown and demonstrated over the years that the budgets 
put out by the members of New Democratic Party have been abysmal 
and the arithmetic has not added up.  Instead of helping the 
poorest people in our society, they would actually hurt them. 
What they would do is raise taxes up to such a level that the 
ability of the private sector to function would be constricted 
and restricted.  This leads to brain drain, the exodus of 
businesses from Canada and the lack of ability for businesses to 
get on the cutting edge in their chosen field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say we need to raise taxes even more.  If we look at 
the European models of Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and countries 
that have historically been the bastions of socialism, countries 
that have been looked upon from the socialist left, as being the 
nirvana of economic thought, they not only damaged and destroyed 
their social programs, they gutted the soul of their countries 
and severely compromised their economies.  This has been proven 
in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage members of the NDP to listen very carefully 
and look at their history books.  What they ought to do is come 
over to the Canadian Alliance, as should members from across the 
House, and listen to what we have fought for over a long period 
of time.  Indeed, the former leader of the Reform Party was an 
individual who was at the forefront of this and deserves a great 
deal of credit for doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major reasons I joined the party in 1993 was out of a 
deep concern over the state of our social programs.  I did not 
look at the NDP for that.  I chose the Reform Party.  Why? 
Because the Reform Party articulated constructive economic 
solutions to enable us to have a fairer and a lower tax rate 
which would give our private sector the ability to generate the 
funds to expand.  It would also provide the moneys for our social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A healthy economy and a healthy private sector means strong 
social programs.  After all, the best social program any 
individual could ever have is a job.  Whatever we can do to 
strike that balance between enabling our private sector to be 
strong, aggressive and competitive, as well as ensuring that we 
have tight, strong social programs that are targeted and fair, 
will create the right balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the public who is watching and members from across 
party lines will understand very clearly that this is something 
we have striven for throughout our entire professional careers 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only need to look at the tax differential between ourselves 
and the United States to see what it has done.  We heard about 
the brain drain.  We heard about the exodus of companies. Perhaps 
what we have not heard about is a more subtle and perhaps more 
insidious problem in our society.  That is what this has done to 
the soul of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Punitive tax rates erode the deep, inherent desire that all of 
us have to strive to better ourselves.  It destroys that edge of 
innovation that every country needs to be competitive in a global 
environment.  Let us not forget that we are not only competing 
among ourselves, within provinces and between provinces, more 
important we are competing with other countries.  As the barriers 
to trade come down, which is a good thing, we will have to find 
our niches and be more aggressive in how we capitalize on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also re-articulate the issue of a single tax rate, not a 
flat tax rate, but a single tax rate that lowers and simplifies 
the tax system while still allowing many of the deductions that 
we have enjoyed in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest, and this is a personal issue, that we 
lower the GST.  The government has never looked at lowering 
it, although it promised to, or simplifying it.  One of the major 
complaints we all hear about back home is that the GST is far too 
complex.  The amount of money that goes into managing it 
chews up about one-third of all the moneys received from GST. 
That is not an efficient system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I would implore the government to look at ways to 
simplify the GST, make it a single one time per year reporting, 
make it more comprehensive and lower the amount by 2%.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of payroll taxes, the EI moneys that companies pay 
are in many ways just another tax.  The government has generated 
billions of surplus dollars from the EI fund that we have said 
time and time again must go back into the hands of the Canadian 
people and the companies that hire them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI, under the guise of being a social program, is actually a 
tax.  Payroll taxes by and large are another form of tax.  What 
we can do is ensure fair EI payments and restructure EI into a 
true insurance policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also speak about charitable donations.  There is a theory 
that the higher the taxes, the greater the desire of individuals 
to donate in order to receive a tax benefit.  The facts prove the 
opposite to be true.  The United States has done some interesting 
studies to show that the more money people have after tax, the 
more they donate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1982 and 1989 the marginal top tax bracket in the United 
States dropped substantially.  The amount of money people had in 
their pockets increased dramatically and there was a 29% increase 
in the amount of money people donated.  That is a huge amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days, when people have less and less money and 
non-governmental organizations have more and more responsibility 
to raise money, is it not fair and equitable that the government 
give them a chance to take care of themselves?  Is it not fair 
that organizations like the Canadian Cancer Society, Juvenile 
Diabetes Foundation Canada and others have an opportunity to 
raise money from the public and that the public derive the 
benefit from that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot take money away from non-governmental organizations 
while denying them the ability to raise money.  The government 
should look at what the U.S. did in terms of enabling people to 
increase their donations.  Again, it is about more money at the 
end of the day in people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government can do is enable NGOs and the 
people who donate to them to derive the same tax benefit as a 
person who donates to a political party.  Why do people who 
donate to the Liberal Party or the Alliance Party receive a 
higher tax benefit than if they donate to the Canadian Cancer 
Society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ensure there is equitability, that a person who 
donates to an NGO receives the same tax benefit as someone who 
donates to a political party.  I encourage the government to look 
at that.  It is quite innovative work.  People in Canada who rely 
on non-governmental and charitable organizations would benefit 
enormously from such a progressive move on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government can do in an age of so much new 
wealth is enable people in the top tax bracket to create 
foundations.  Foundations can be an enormous generator of funds 
for charitable and other non-governmental organizations.  Why 
does the government not put provisions into the tax structure 
that enable people to create foundations which give them control 
and ownership and, I would argue, efficiency in ensuring those 
moneys get to people in need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another innovative program is energy tax incentives.  The United 
States in its budget last year put through some innovative energy 
tax incentives aimed particularly at reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Many of those tax benefits rest on the ability of 
individuals to invest in other forms of non-fossil fuels and 
non-greenhouse gas producing energy sources that benefit both the 
environment and the individuals themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to look at what the U.S. has done. 
Solar power, new ways of heating homes and hybrid cars that use 
non-fossil fuels would all provide our environment, individuals 
and the organizations producing them the tax incentives that 
would wean us away from fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our demand for energy will increase substantially.  We will need 
alternative fuel sources.  Nuclear power is a clean source, but 
it has an obvious downside.  Fossil fuels are limited.  Since 
greenhouse gas emissions will only increase, we must look at 
alternative measures.  We could learn from the U.S. energy tax 
incentives to greatly improve our environment at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the education system I encourage the government to look at 
another proposal from our side, the income contingent loan 
repayment plan.  Students today face increasing difficulty in 
finding the money to pay for their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a physician, but I could not have gone to medical school if 
costs had been what they are today.  Tuition fees at my alma 
mater are now more than $12,000 per year.  There is no way, given 
the socioeconomic conditions I grew up in, that my family could 
have afforded the fees.   That is the situation students across 
the country are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing a very dangerous situation in which 
professional faculties are becoming the purview of the rich.  A 
recent study looked at family incomes at various schools, and I 
will take the University of Western Ontario as an example.  The 
study found that over the last four or five years the average 
family income went from $60,000 to more than $120,000 for 
students entering medical school at the University of Western 
Ontario.  That pattern is borne out across the country and in 
other professional faculties like law and dentistry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in lower socioeconomic groups who want to enter 
professional faculties face an economic obstacle.  Gaining access 
to professional faculties is no longer an issue of merit or 
competence.  It is becoming an issue of how much money one's 
parents make.  This is a critical issue that must be dealt with 
now.  It is an matter of fundamental fairness for a country that 
prides itself on equality for all people regardless of 
socioeconomic condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation will only get worse.  I encourage the Prime 
Minister to call together the ministers of education across the 
country to urgently look at the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shortage of professors and faculty members is also an issue 
now and will be one in the future.  Across the country the dearth 
will become critical.  It is so bad now that universities and 
post-secondary institutions have sent out a clarion call for 
help.  We must find innovative ways to train and retain 
individuals who can teach and work in our post-secondary 
institutions.  A professor cannot be trained overnight.  It takes 
at least seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to raise the issue at a first 
ministers conference as soon as possible.  It will take years to 
deal with it, but it must be done for the sake of our youth and 
our economy.  The economy is predicated on hiring and training 
good, competent individuals.  If we cannot train people of 
excellence our economy will face a fate we do not want to 
contemplate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly I will address the issue of accountability.  My 
colleagues have raised the issue time and time again.  A 
backbench member of the Liberal government articulated a solution 
with which it is difficult to disagree.  The individual quite 
intelligently raised, as have my colleagues, the fact that we do 
not know where our money has been spent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know the amount of money going in, where it is spent 
and what the output is.  Whether we are talking about health 
care, agriculture or the environment, we need to measure this. 
There are ways it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every ministry ought to be on a spreadsheet so that a deputy 
minister would know, if asked, where the money has gone, how it 
was spent and have a way of measuring the output.  That is what 
we want and what the public wants.  If we are to build an 
effective public service we must do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been very clearly asked to do this by the 
Clerk of the Privy Council.  He has asked for an urgent indepth 
look at our public service and how we can make it more efficient. 
The good people who work in our public service urgently need that 
as well.  We must find ways of innovating and allowing members in 
the public service to put their incredible talents and 
intelligence to the best use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again draw attention to something Mr. Gore did when he 
was vice-president.  President Clinton asked Mr. Gore to 
rejuvenate the public sector.  Mr. Gore did something I thought 
was quite innovative.  He told public sector members they had 
carte blanche to do the right thing but with certain 
restrictions.  He then gave them a card listing the restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be able to unleash the power of our public service. 
We need to increase its efficiency and accountability.  We need 
to streamline it so we have an efficient public service that 
works for the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is up.  I will close by saying that the bill, 
while it moves in the right direction, should have come out three 
years ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
one item the member talked about in his speech was the 
differential between the tax benefit for political donations and 
the tax benefit for charitable donations.  That issue has been 
with us for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a quick calculation.  The member will probably know that 
if someone were to make a political donation of $1,400, his or 
her income tax rebate, all other things considered, would be $500 
because it is limited to that amount.  If the same person 
contributed that $1,400 to a charity, received the 17% tax credit 
on the first $200, the 25% credit on the next $200 plus the 
provincial income taxes which are calculated on the federal, the 
person would get a bigger tax refund on a $1,400 contribution 
made for charitable purposes than on one made for political 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not black and white that political donations are more 
beneficial than charitable donations.  There is a crossover 
point.  The benefit continues to rise for charitable donations 
whereas there is a cap of $500 on political donations for all 
contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that there is a rationale behind 
political donations having a higher tax credit rate for the first 
$200.  The reason, as I understand it from the discussions that 
led up to providing the credit, is that it provides all Canadians 
an opportunity to seek public office at the federal level and to 
be able to raise money in a way which would allow them to compete 
in a federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very expensive proposition, as the member knows. 
Members of parliament have limits in the range of $60,000 to 
$70,000 to run an election campaign.  It is a very expensive 
proposition.  The credit encourages individual taxpayers to 
contribute to the democratic process so that all Canadians, 
regardless of their state in life or their economic condition, 
have an opportunity to run in an election campaign.  I raise that 
with the member simply for his information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have is on a related matter in the sense that the 
member is talking about equity and progressive taxation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be a difference in the discussion when we talk about 
progressive taxation versus progressivity.  The member's 
colleague who spoke previously addressed the issue of providing a 
tax free amount of $250,000 of income that would somehow 
encourage or stimulate people's investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was described as being the kind of progressivity that we 
would like to have in Canada.  If the Canadian Alliance is 
talking about progressivity, not progressive taxation but 
progressivity, as a desirable aspect in our income tax system, 
could the member help the House understand how it could also 
propose a single or flat tax of some rate that would lower the 
income tax burden of high income taxpayers and put that burden on 
middle income taxpayers?  This is not progressivity but quite the 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, most Canadians do not 
have $1,400 to donate to any charitable organization including 
political ones.  The member should take back to his cabinet that 
the government should be increasing the amount of tax benefit 
individuals receive at the lower level because most people donate 
less than $200, not $1,400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the tax structure, our party's tax benefits and 
deductions are progressive.  The current tax structure is a 
punitive tax structure.  As an individual earns more, the system 
takes away more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that does to an economy was seen profoundly in the United 
Kingdom prior to Margaret Thatcher.  Prior to Mrs. Thatcher the 
tax structure was similar to ours.  The government member would 
call it progressive but in fact it was punitive.  What it did was 
gut its economy.  Mrs. Thatcher reduced taxes and managed to 
rejuvenate the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland is another example.  It had a punitive tax structure 
such as the one that Canada has versus the more progressive one 
that it has today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also has very sly methods of taking money away 
from individuals.  I draw the attention of the House to one very 
important point.  The government is giving money to our soldiers 
on the one hand and on the other hand it is yanking the money 
away with increased rents on their private married quarters and 
forcing them to pay for things they did not pay for before.  It 
is giving money with one hand but taking money with two hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government is doing to the men and women in our 
military.  It is disgusting.  These people put their lives on the 
line for us and the government is shafting them.  I will be 
raising that again with the Minister of National Defence as soon 
as possible.  I have raised repeatedly in the past.  I encourage 
the member to raise it and fight for it within his own caucus 
because this stone will not be left unturned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I should like to make a comment on something that 
was said before I get to my question.  In the 1980s U.S. tax 
policy was to lower taxes, simplify them and flatten them in a 
major way.  It is called efficient market theory.  Today the U.S. 
produces 35% to 40% of the world's GDP with 5% of the world's 
population.  Whether we are talking about autos, softwood lumber 
or whatever, Canada is very dependent on the robust healthy 
economy of the U.S.  I would like to see Canada get that economic 
growth participation and the population base to go with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have 30 million people.  The U.S. has 300 million.  Very 
often we forget that point.  Our population is not growing and we 
do not have a very large market.  We have to find a way of 
getting a market in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague raised something that I do not know a whole lot 
about.  I would ask him to enlighten the House on it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan, the Bill Gates Foundation contributed something 
like $20 million.  The money was invested in remote communities 
in rural Saskatchewan, which include a lot of first nations 
communities, to provide computers and get individuals on the 
Internet.  It is something the government talks a lot about, but 
we do not have a lot of evidence of it.  However Mr. Gates and 
his foundation made that a reality in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very interested in the whole idea of foundations.  Rather 
than bureaucrats and government dictating and determining where 
investments go, we could get those people who have shown they can 
create wealth and produce goods and services to get the economy 
going.  To have people like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett, or someone 
along those lines with a foundation making those sorts of 
decisions in our economy could spawn some things.  I was very 
interested in the hon. member's comments in that regard.  Maybe 
he would enlighten us on how the bill would encourage that sort 
of development in our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, the fact of the matter 
is that we do not have that kind of tax structure.  The bill does 
not have that kind of provision.  The member raises the very 
interesting example of an American philanthropist who has decided 
to donate a substantial amount of money to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are missing an enormous source of innovation, energy and 
money that could be applied to some of the neediest people in our 
country.  Many individuals who have made large sums of money in 
business would like to do that.  They are very successful and 
intelligent people who could use the skills they applied in 
business to provide such a public service through their 
foundations.  The government does not need to do anything about 
that.  It just needs to give them the chance to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am almost finished drafting a private member's bill that deals 
with the issue.  When I introduce it, I look forward to support 
from all members of the House.

<A NAME="LINK239">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application 
Rules, certain acts related to the Income Tax Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and another act 
related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of Surrey 
Central to state our case in opposition to Bill C-22, the Liberal 
government's proposed changes to the Income Tax Act, the income 
tax application rules, the Canada pension plan, the Customs Act, 
the Excise Tax Act and many other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this morning I spoke in opposition to the Liberal's 
proposed changes to Bill C-9, the Canada Elections Act.  That act 
creates a two tier electoral system.  Among other things, it 
discriminates against smaller political parties.  The Liberals 
are eroding our democracy with that bill and we cannot support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 seeks to amend the Income Tax Act and statutes 
originally included in Bill C-43 and to put into place key 
aspects of the last two budgets.  The bill has 31 amendments 
touching on a number of tax deductions and their definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main reasons the official opposition and my 
constituents oppose the bill.  First, the bill fails to address 
the enormous complexity of the tax code.  It adds further 
complexity to an already complex tax code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT72"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT72"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it undermines the family, particularly one income 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the tax cuts provided for in the bill fall far short of 
what the Canadian Alliance proposed and what the government must 
do to increase our nation's productivity, competitiveness and 
standard of living.  I would like to elaborate on those three 
points beginning with the complexity of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be moving toward simplifying and 
broadening the base of the tax code.  Lowering the taxes of all 
Canadians would be easier and it would have a far more positive 
impact for everyone.  If the tax code were simplified and if it 
had less exemptions, further clarification would not be 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill adds to the enormous complexity of the Income Tax Act 
with its numerous amendments.  Rather than simplifying the act as 
the Canadian Alliance would do, the Liberals continue to maintain 
a costly and complicated tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for my opposition to the bill deals with measures 
in the bill that assist the tax position of families with some 
minimal tax reductions.  Nothing is done to address the 
longstanding inequality between single income and dual income 
families.  The bill increases the inequity by increasing the 
child care tax deduction which is only available to high income 
or dual income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also erodes the legal position of marriage.  By 
changing references of spouse to common law partner it is 
including same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after the changes proposed in the bill, Canadians would 
continue to pay far too much in taxes.  The mini budget claimed 
to cut taxes by $100.5 billion over five years.  However here is 
the reality.  It is a bit technical so I would like to go into a 
little detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the $100.5 billion claim of gross tax relief we must 
subtract $3.2 billion over five years for social spending, 
chiefly the child care tax benefit.  The child care tax benefit 
is a spending program delivered through the tax system.  The 
increase in the tax benefit should not be confused with being a 
tax decrease as it is a spending increase.  The figure above 
excludes indexation because indexation is accounted for 
separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then have to subtract $29.5 billion over five years for 
increased CPP premium hikes.  We then have to subtract $20.7 
billion over five years for cancelled tax hikes, namely 
indexation.  Indexing the personal income tax system is meant to 
hold the tax burden constant over time so it should not be 
counted as a tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore when we take into consideration all those deductions, 
the net tax relief is only $47.5 billion provided over five 
years, not immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of the Liberal Party's 2000 tax relief package is 
that it is less than half of what it claims it is and half of 
what the Canadian Alliance proposed during the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the realities when we do a little math and we go into 
detail.  This is how the tax relief would work in contrast to the 
image of tax relief the Liberals are projecting through their 
propaganda.  We are watching a smoke and mirrors show by the 
government with respect to the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 is a 500 plus page bill.  I will read it later on 
because it will take too long.  The Liberals say the bill is 
concerned with administrative, technical and implementation 
measures.  They say it implements about $100 billion in tax cuts 
over five years.  As I demonstrated it does not.  It is less than 
half of that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more people study the bill, the more problems they will 
find.  The more people study the bill the more complexities it 
creates in the minds of Canadians.  I will take the time to go 
over some of the points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 31 amendments in the bill.  One amendment is about 
non-resident film and video actors.  It would apply a new 23% 
withholding tax on payment to non-resident film and video actors 
and their corporations, with an option to have the actors and 
corporations pay regular part 1 tax on the net earnings instead. 
This provision alone hurts my beautiful province of British 
Columbia where film making has become popular and is contributing 
to the economic well-being of my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Citizenship and Immigration has also imposed restrictions 
on issuing visas to those who are trying to come to Canada to 
make films and make the best use of the beautiful British 
Columbia scenery and its facilities.  This hurts B.C.  Those 
people then go to other countries to make films.  Why should they 
come to B.C. to make films?  Many people are hoping the film 
industry will contribute to the prosperity of my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with limited liability partnerships, replacement 
property rules, types of property to be considered, stop-loss 
loans and a capital tax.  An additional capital tax would also be 
imposed on life insurance corporations.  Foreign affiliate losses 
would determine the affiliate or accrual property income for a 
particular taxation year.  It deals with a foreign affiliate held 
by a partnership with simultaneous control in a chain of 
corporations and the control of their stake.  It deals with 
advertising expenses concerning periodicals and magazines between 
Canada and the United States.  It also deals with trusts and the 
tax treatment or property distribution from a Canadian trust to a 
non-resident beneficiary.  Further, it deals with mutual fund 
trusts, RRSPs and adjusted retirement income funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go into the detail of the bill, we will notice that 
there are more complexities, more anti-family type situations and 
many other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is taxpayer migration which is the ability to tax the 
gains accrued by immigrants.  It will affect the projection of 
the country's image with respect to future immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to foreign branch banking, there would be a 15% 
investment tax credit for certain grassroots mineral exploration. 
There is the foreign exploration and development expenses and the 
value of foreign resource property owned.  It would impose a 30% 
restriction for the annual deduction of new foreign exploration 
and development expense benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other points.  Here is another one.  There would 
be a foreign tax credit on oil and gas production sharing 
agreements.  Another one is weak currency debt that limits the 
deductibility of interest expenses and adjusts foreign exchange 
gains and losses in respect of weak currency debt and associated 
hedging transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many points in the bill which will further make the 
tax codes very complicated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since capitalization, it reduces the acceptable debt to equity 
ratio from 3:1 to 2:1 and it repeals the exemption for 
manufacturers for aircraft and aircraft components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as CPP contributions on self-employed earnings, these 
amendments introduce a deduction from business income for one-half 
of CPP contributions on self-employed earnings with the 
other half of the contributions remaining eligible for the CPP 
tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is something regarding students and scholarships, 
fellowships and bursaries.  The exemption would be increased by 
$3,500 for scholarships, fellowships and bursaries received by 
the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer's enrolment in a 
program and in respect of the taxpayer claiming the education tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one for the education tax credit.  It would 
double the monthly amounts the tax credit allows to full time and 
part time students based on $400 and $120 respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also affects the medical expense tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one area that does not affect families, caregivers, 
infirm dependant tax credits, disability tax credits, child care 
expense deductions and so on.  Therefore, I assume this bill will 
not only be affecting families but also those individuals and low 
income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Mining Association supports some aspects of this 
bill.  It supports the definition of mining property, yet it was 
not aware of the changes until the official opposition contacted 
it.  The association was not consulted.  It had to learn from us 
that the definition of mining property was being tinkered with by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government from behind closed doors.  Surely if the 
government was sincere in its intention, it would have contacted 
stakeholders and various groups in Canada.  It would have 
listened to Canadians.  It should have understood that Canadians 
want the tax credits to be implemented sooner rather than up to 
2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill guarantees that the basic personal exemptions will hit 
a minimum of $8,000 by the year 2004.  The credits and relief 
provided in the bill are a step in the right direction, but they 
are baby steps nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts have been made to reduce the capital gains tax, deficit 
surtax, marginal rates, raise marginal income thresholds and 
tighten up various other rules surrounding deductions.  The bill 
would increase and clarify the disability tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good points and some bad points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Canadian Alliance members would restore public 
confidence in the fairness of the Canadian tax system by reducing 
its complexity.  We would restore indexation and move toward a 
simpler tax system built around a single rate of taxation to 
ensure lower taxes for all Canadians.  We believe all Canadians 
above a minimum income level should share in the cost of the 
services provided by the government, which benefit all of us 
irrespective of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the government will consider the amendments and what 
witnesses have said at the committee hearings on this bill.  At 
this point the Canadian Alliance will not be supporting this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Surrey Central 
along with his previous colleague made the argument that 
Canadians would not be very happy with the tax package because 
even though it was $100 billion it would complicate things. Of 
course even their own tax proposals do not uncomplicate things, 
as they have said in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we all agree that tax simplification is perhaps a good 
objective, with respect, I believe the member is missing the 
point.  Canadians do want tax relief.  They embrace this tax 
relief, the largest tax relief package in the history of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member for Surrey Central, along with previous 
colleagues, argued that the tax relief package was really not 
$100 billion and was somewhat less. 
He argued, for example, that Canada pension plan increases should 
come off that amount.  He and Canadians know that the Canada 
pension plan is an employee-employer based contribution pension 
scheme where Canadians are investing in their future retirement, 
health and well-being.  It is not a tax.  The premiums do not go 
to consolidated revenue.  It never was a tax, never has been and 
never will be.  He knows that is disingenuous at best.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also argued that by reindexing the tax system that that was 
not a tax saving.  I used some examples earlier.  A one earner 
family with two children today is making $40,000.  By the end of 
this tax relief package their federal tax burden will be reduced 
by 59%.  That is 59% less federal income tax that they would pay 
compared with what they would have paid if this was not 
implemented.  To say that cannot be counted as tax relief is 
absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put this question to the member for Surrey 
Central.  Leading up to this budget, Alliance members invariably 
stood up in the House and said that the Liberal government had 
increased taxes a multitude of times.  We had not increased taxes 
at all.  They were really saying that because we did not reindex 
the tax system we were effectively increasing the tax.  I think 
that was their point.  When asked to name the tax increases, they 
could not because taxes had not been increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they now claim that because we have reindexed the tax 
system, before it was a tax increase, but we cannot now say it is 
a tax decrease?  Could the member explain that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know that the hon. 
member spoke to this bill earlier and I listened to his concerns. 
I intended to address some of the concerns he mentioned during 
his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues to insist that the bill is a simplification of the 
Income Tax Act and various other acts.  Why then are the 
amendments needed?  The Income Tax Act is very complicated.  The 
new bill has over 500 pages and is further complicating the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the bill would offer huge tax relief. 
However, it is too little too late.  He bragged about the 
government's tax relief.  According to the hon. member he said 
that it would be the largest tax relief in Canadian history.  I 
have to contradict him on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the member that the tax decrease which 
the government is proposing is not an actual tax decrease.  I 
showed through the calculations that it would be less than half 
and would be over a number of years.  I would like to remind him 
that the largest tax increase in Canadian history took place 
during this Liberal regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked me to mention one example. There was a 73% tax increase 
in CPP.  That is the largest tax increase in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Canadian Alliance Party which talked about bracket 
creep.  The government finally listened to us.  Whenever I talk 
to my constituents I always tell them that our party is not only 
holding the Liberals' feet to the fire, but our party has been 
carrying a flashlight for a long time.  We show the Liberals the 
darkness and they keep walking behind us.  However, the Liberals 
do not listen.  They do not get it right.  They steal from our 
party policy from time to time but we wish they would steal more. 
Unfortunately, they do not get things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various tax increases, including levies, show that there is a 
tax increase.  I mentioned CPP.  The hon. member mentioned that 
the CPP was arm's length from the government.  If that is the 
case, why did the government grab the surplus from the CPP fund? 
The CPP premiums were paid by employers and employees and should have 
been lowered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does not have it right.  He should probably take 
this point into consideration.  That is why our party proposed 
those amendments.  The government should listen to Canadians 
because probably that will help to simplify our Income Tax Act 
and various other taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum (Markham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rushed over here to ask a question because I cannot agree with 
very much that the hon. member has just said.  In fact, I have a 
triple-barrelled question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what I cannot understand is what one might call 
opposition ingratitude in the face of what the whole world has 
described as the impeccably timed tax cuts, the largest in 
Canadian history, praised by the IMF and OECD, et cetera, which 
came into effect at exactly the right moment, January 1 of this 
year.  Second, I would like to ask a question with respect to the 
hon. member's complaints about the Canadian pension plan 
contributions and indexation.  Finally, I would like to ask a 
question with respect to the Alliance proposals.  If I may, I 
will go through each of these very briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the Americans are now talking 
about tax cuts which the Canadian government has already 
implemented at precisely the right time, at the moment of the 
slowdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  But not over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum:</B>  Over five years, but in the first year 
there is a big chunk of tax cuts.  If we add up the federal 
contribution and the provincial contribution, it comes to 1.5% of 
GDP, which is an extremely large number, among the largest in the 
G-7.  No other country's timing is as good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is open to debate whether this impeccable timing is a matter 
of good luck or good advice last year by private sector 
economists or the brilliance of the finance minister.  I will 
leave it to the opposition to allocate the credit.  Whatever the 
reason, these tax cuts have come in at just the right time, just 
when the doctor ordered them, just when this slowdown began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my first question:  why is the hon. member not more 
grateful for this impeccable timing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I will leave out the CPP, Madam Speaker, to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member claims that the Alliance program was superior to 
the Liberal program that has given us the biggest tax cut in 
Canadian history.  I would be the first to acknowledge that the 
Alliance tax cuts were bigger than ours.  However, there is a 
double problem.  With regard to the Alliance tax cuts, according 
to Department of Finance officials and bank economists—not me, 
because I know I am tainted now, being a politician—had we gone 
with the flat tax or single rate tax cuts, we would have had an 
$18 billion fiscal hole.  I would ask the hon. member to explain 
what he would have done about that fiscal hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way out of it would have been Draconian expenditure 
cuts, including cuts to core programs, because that $18 billion 
exceeded the so-called frivolous spending, according to the 
Alliance.  The cuts would have had to be to core spending 
programs, which would have made the slowdown slower than it has 
been.  Not only that, but the Alliance program with its flat tax 
would have, in a single leap, taken us to the most unequal, 
unfair tax system in the whole of the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this:  why does the hon. member not accept the 
fact that we had this impeccable timing, for whatever reason, and 
how can he explain the fact that his admittedly larger tax cuts 
would have either given us an $18 billion fiscal hole or would 
have required Draconian tax cuts to core social programs, 
including health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member, who is a former banker and economist, for this 
triple-barrelled question.  However, my time is short and I think 
he talked about the whole economy.  It would probably take six 
hours to answer this question in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I appreciate the hon. member's question and I 
appreciate his acknowledgement that the tax cuts in the Canadian 
Alliance plan were greater and that they were the largest tax 
cuts in Canadian history.  I compliment the hon. member for being 
honest and straightforward in acknowledging that.  When a Liberal 
member acknowledges that the tax cuts our party was proposing 
were the highest, I consider it a compliment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he went further in talking about that $18 billion hole. 
However, let me remind the hon. member, who is an economist and 
who has a huge amount of experience in working with banks, 
that we would eliminate the waste in the government and cut 
spending by government as well.  The hon. member knows that nine 
cents of each tax dollar is wasted by the government.  That alone 
reduces by a significant amount what he is talking about if we 
take that 9% off the $142 billion revenue of the government that 
goes to wastage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about taxation and other things.  I would remind the 
hon. member that it is his party that has been governing this 
country for quite a long time.  It is his party that has 
contributed considerably to the debt in this country, with 42 
cents of each tax dollar going toward debt payment.  The Liberals 
are responsible for putting us at an economic disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the low dollar.  The hon. member will agree with me that 
it is this government that is responsible for lowering our 
dollar, increasing our taxes and increasing our debt.  In 
particular, our personal income taxes are the highest of the G-7 
countries, even after this tax relief by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should give serious thought to recognizing that 
the tax relief given by the government is not enough.  As he is 
an expert on this issue, I urge him to lobby the government and 
to give his advice to the government to lower taxes, not in five 
years and not by half of what they are telling us, but by the 
right amount, which Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  That was the last 
speaker on the bill.  However, earlier I saw three members rise 
to ask questions.  Is there unanimous consent to allow the three 
members to ask their questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It has been a very interesting debate and we have had an 
encouraging response from all members.  It is very good to have 
discussion from all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, I would like to point out that Canadian 
Alliance members did not oppose that consent.  I would ask you to 
seek unanimous consent of the House again, because Canadian 
Alliance members will say yes to extend the question and comment period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Unfortunately it did 
not receive unanimous consent, so I am assuming that we will put 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  All I wanted to do was to pay tribute to a Canadian 
who won the Nobel Peace Prize, Robert Mundell, who would not 
agree with anything that my learned friend— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The House has heard 
the terms of the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  All those in favour 
of the motion will please say yea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

a foundation to fund sustainable 
development technology.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development involves balanced development, an 
approach that avoids either/or outcomes, that does not sacrifice 
one essential value for another.  The goals are complex, not 
simple, for example, not just electric power, but power without 
pollution, not just industrial growth and busy factories, but 
these without environmental damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the history of the last 30 years that these 
balancing acts are achievable.  We need only think of the 
reduction of automotive emissions, the abatement of air 
pollution, improvements in energy efficiency, and technologies of 
enhanced oil recovery that squeezed new oil from old wells and at 
the same time reduced the environmental footprint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common factor in every case has been innovation:  new 
thinking and new technologies that transform the equation, 
effective technologies, affordable technologies and sustainable 
development technologies.  Innovation has helped us progress as a 
society and it will continue to do so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innovation of this order is what Bill C-4 is about.  The 
legislation is straightforward.  It would authorize the 
establishment of the Canada foundation for sustainable 
development.  The foundation would administer the sustainable 
development technology fund of $100 million announced in budget 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial focus of the foundation would be on climate change 
and clean air because these are two major environmental 
challenges of our time, particularly as recent events in the U.S. 
have dictated.  Under the climate change heading, it would 
concentrate on the development of new technologies to slow down, 
arrest and eventually roll back the threat of climate change, for 
example, technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to make 
carbon energy systems less carbon intensive, to increase energy 
efficiency, and to capture, use and store carbon dioxide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the clean air part of its mandate the foundation would focus 
on the development of technologies to reduce the level of 
contaminants in the air we breathe:  volatile organic compounds, 
nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological innovation is by nature adventurous, pioneering 
work that will always involve some form of risk.  That makes it 
particularly important that we achieve the best possible ratio of 
inputs to outputs, of investments to results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill would require that the foundation concentrate 
its funding support on collaborative efforts rather than on 
projects by single entities.  This requirement reflects a strong 
emphasis throughout the legislation on teamwork.  It would also 
help ensure that funding goes to projects that receive technical 
review and peer support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the foundation would plan its activities to complement 
and to dovetail with those of other federal and provincial 
government programs on climate change and clean air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the terms and conditions in the funding agreements 
would require the foundation to use the fund to lever investment 
from other sources to get the ball rolling, not to play the whole 
game.  The foundation would fund up to 50% of eligible costs of 
any project but never more than 33% of eligible costs on average 
across the program.  This requirement too is consistent with the 
promotion of teamwork.  It is also a consistent maxim that a good 
predictor of a project's success is the willingness of proponents 
to put up some of their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to another aspect of the proposed foundation: 
the arrangements for governance as visualized in the bill. 
Ultimately the extent to which the fund advances the cause of 
sustainable development depends on good targeting, good 
management and good administration.  The machinery of government 
for the foundation that the bill proposes meets this requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would require the foundation to operate at arm's 
length from the government and hon. members will see that the 
governance structure matches that requirement.  Essentially it 
has two components. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One component would be a board of directors, an executive body 
that would be responsible for the management and services of the 
foundation and would exercise all its powers subject to the 
foundation's bylaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component would be a committee of stakeholders, 
potential clients of the foundation and other entrusted parties 
or members of the foundation as we call them.  Their role would 
be analogous to those of shareholders in a private corporation in 
the sense that they would scrutinize and comment on the 
activities of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 15 directors of the board, 7 would be government 
appointees.  Members of the foundation would appoint the 8 other 
directors.  None of the directors or the members of the 
foundation would be from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an accepted principle of sound design that form should 
follow function and it does in this case.  The ultimate function 
is sustainable development, a process in which the trajectory is 
away from narrow perspectives to broad vision.  That applies with 
full force to the development of sustainable development 
technology.  It must be effective, environmentally benign and 
affordable.  The form of the governance machinery proposed by the 
bill supports that breadth and balance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, the members of the board of directors and of the 
foundation represent the experience and expertise of every sector 
linked to the development and implementation of sustainable 
development technology: the public sector, the private sector, 
academic institutions and non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have balance in the geographic sense, members will 
be drawn from all regions of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also prescribes measures to ensure due diligence and 
accountability, requiring the foundation to establish sound 
financial and management controls and to appoint an independent 
auditor to verify the effectiveness of these controls.  The 
foundation must submit an annual report to the Minister of 
Natural Resources, to members of the foundation and to the 
public.  The report must include an evaluation of results 
achieved through the funding of projects and must be tabled in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The detailed terms and conditions associated with the management 
of the fund will be set forth in a funding agreement between the 
Government of Canada and the foundation.  The Auditor General of 
Canada will scrutinize the funding agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to begin implementation of the mandate of the 
sustainable development technology fund as soon as possible, Bill 
C-4 also contains conditional clauses that provide for the 
governor in council to designate a private sector foundation to 
serve as the foundation in accordance with the requirements of 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation stipulates that in this eventuality the assets 
and liabilities of the private sector foundation would be 
transferred to the foundation and its board of directors and 
corporate membership would dissolve, thus triggering the 
appointment of the board and members of the foundation as 
stipulated in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditional clauses are also contingency clauses, 
insurance against unnecessary slippage of schedule in the start 
up phase.  In the event of administrative or other delays of 
process, they would allow the government to fulfil its promises 
to establish the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring hon. members up to date on the history of 
the bill.  The legislation is based upon more than two years of 
the most open, transparent and comprehensive consultation that 
involved the provinces, municipalities, the private sector, 
academic institutions and non-governmental organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every aspect of Canadian life was consulted in that two year 
process and the sustainable development technology foundation is 
a product of that process.  However we did not stop there.  The 
consultation process continued even after the bill was tabled in 
the House on February 2.  We have had the opportunity to discuss 
the bill in detail with directors of private sector foundations. 
We agreed that one or two issues related to the roles of members 
and the timing of their meetings could use clarification.  We 
therefore prepared amendments to the bill to achieve those 
clarifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented the bill and the amendments to the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development 
and Natural Resources.  After vigorous and constructive 
discussion the legislation and clarifying amendments received 
approval.  During report stage we debated a further seven motions 
in amendment.  One consequential technical amendment was adopted 
to ensure consistency of all amendments throughout the bill.

was held. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I repeat what the Minister of Natural Resources 
has said to the House on other occasions.  He said that we could 
not rely on technology alone to meet the challenges of climate 
change and clean air or to achieve the balancing act of 
sustainable development but that a constant flow of new 
technology, effective technology, affordable technology and 
sustainable development technology were indispensable to our 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know from experience, this is an area in which the right 
investment of dollars, effort and expertise directed at the right 
target at the right time could cut the largest problems down to 
size.  It is the right legislation directed at the right targets 
at the right time.  I urge hon. members to speed the legislation 
on its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Palliser, Human Resources 
Development; the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette, Taxation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Surrey 
Central.  I thank my colleague across the floor for the heartfelt 
presentation he just gave.  It moved me deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise once again on Bill C-4.  I will begin my 
presentation, as I have at every stage of the bill, by expressing 
support for the concept of bringing a group of experts together 
in green technologies.  Our party supports the concept of 
creating a foundation and leveraging a fairly significant amount 
of dollars in the big scheme of things many times over in the 
private sector through partnerships to help in the development of 
new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a concept worthy of support.  Our party was ready to 
support the bill if we could have had a simple amendment to it, 
just one amendment to provide some transparency and 
accountability.  It was denied unfortunately at report stage when 
the government decided not to allow it.  It makes me wonder why 
it would do that.  It makes me fear that the concerns I have 
expressed about the bill are true and there is a reason the 
government does not want transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a simple continuation of a process started three 
years ago in December 1997 when the Kyoto protocol was signed and 
Canada agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 
levels for the period 2008 to 2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many experts who feel that such a dramatic reduction 
is not possible or feasible as the goal of a 6% reduction 
represents about a 25% reduction from projected 2008 to 2012 
emission levels, using a business as usual trend of rising 
greenhouse gas emissions as the basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further complicate these projections Canada's levels of 
greenhouse gas emissions have risen steadily in the last few 
years to a much higher level than was previously projected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these complications the government continues to attempt 
to meet the Kyoto commitments with a variety of actions.  For 
example, one such action was the government's action plan 2000 
which proposed what strategic actions the government would take 
to meet our Kyoto commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the plan only aims to reduce the emissions 
by 65 million tonnes per year during the commitment period of 
2008 to 2012.  That is only one-third of the way toward the Kyoto 
commitment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a good discussion this morning in committee with the 
climate change secretariat.  It was obvious that the government 
would have great difficulty even reaching the one-third milepost 
toward the Kyoto commitment.  There was also increasing evidence 
that climate change however much it was influenced by man's 
activities was inevitable.  The government should move to some 
degree toward helping Canadians to adapt to climate change rather 
than perpetuating the myths that somehow the Kyoto commitment 
would prevent it, would reverse the trend and would save the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 2000 Environment Canada reported that the United 
Nations revealed that Canada's greenhouse gas emissions were 13% 
above 1990 levels in 1998.  These levels have risen consistently 
due to factors such as the greater use of coal to produce 
electricity.  If natural gas prices remain high, and we have seen 
evidence of that in Alberta, coal could be used even more than it 
is now.  If Canada continues its business as usual, it is quite 
possible that the gap between projected emissions and the Kyoto 
target would be 26% or significantly higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government documents regarding the bill state that Canada is a 
world leader in many climate change and energy efficiency 
technologies with emerging strengths in other areas.  That is a 
term that the minister uses often in committee and in the House. 
I have to question why, if what he says is the case, Canada is 
relying so heavily on sinks and tradable credits in its Kyoto 
strategy? If we combine the increase in emission levels with the 
fact that the Kyoto protocol has virtually fallen apart over the 
issue of carbon sinks, it is clear that much needs to be done 
before Canada can consider itself well on the way to a significant 
reduction in emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in serious trouble and serious trouble calls for 
serious solutions.  If Bill C-4 lays out the groundwork for a key 
part of the government's climate change plan then we are all in 
trouble.  The government should be providing a solid, 
accountable, transparent and responsible plan that would 
translate into a foundation.  That plan should be producing real 
benefits to Canadians rather than the current legislation that 
plants the seeds to grow an enormous patronage plum, and I do not 
mean a tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of problems with the bill that I hoped to see 
addressed either in committee or at report stage in the House. 
For example, the issue regarding the accountability of the 
foundation and its reporting practices.  I would like to see the 
auditor general have access to the foundation's books.  The 
auditor general should bring forward regular audits to ensure 
that the foundation is being run in a reasonable and responsible 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand now, rather than having the auditor general 
perform an audit of the foundation's books, perhaps the 
foundation could use the government's demonstrated standards of 
bookkeeping.  Members must forgive me if I do not find that a 
particularly comforting thought.  After all, for the last 10 
years the auditor general has given his opinion on the financial 
statements of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period the government has flunked the exam seven 
times.  Only three times has the auditor general been able to 
give a passing grade to the government's bookkeeping.  That is a 
terrible average.  It gets even worse if we look back further 
than just 10 years.  The former auditor general could give only 
one clear opinion during his entire 10 year term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is to hold the foundation to those standards 
we are in for more mismanagement and bungling, for we know how 
fond those Liberal members are of spending money without 
requiring any sort of framework, authorization or even paperwork. 
I had hoped they had learned their lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one doubts the intention of the bill.  It is sound.  I would 
have supported an organization that exists to promote the 
development of new technologies to assist in sustainable 
development, including those technologies that address climate 
change and air quality issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has some serious climate change issues that need to be 
addressed.  Since the government is already committed to a 
certain course of action, we had better start producing rather 
than just talking about it.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Descriptions of the bill contain all sorts of glorious sounding 
intentions.  For example, the fund will encourage innovation by 
helping companies develop new technologies and bring them to 
market.  The fund will complement other federal programs, build 
on efforts to engage external partners, and promote the efficient 
use of resources and technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government new technologies developed by this 
fund will provide the opportunity for Canadians to access the 
opportunity side of the climate change equation.  Again I have to 
question the bill.  The government is making taxpayer dollars 
available on extremely vague criteria.  Is that what it means by 
opportunities being created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My impression is that the opportunities being created were 
supposed to be for the development of new technologies that would 
benefit all Canadians, not for the friends of the government to 
benefit simply from the receipt of Canadian tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will be composed of fifteen members.  The fifteen 
members of the foundation are assembled first and seven are 
appointed by the governor in council who then appoints eight 
other members. The chair and six members of the board are then 
appointed by the governor in council, and those seven people 
appoint eight other members for the board.  Both the foundation 
and the board have fifteen members and fourteen of the total 
thirty members are handpicked by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair and directors of the board are eligible for five year 
terms.  Directors and members can be reappointed for one or more 
terms.  It all sounds rather cushy to me.  If someone has a 
friend in the right place, he or she could be appointed to the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two rather frightening aspects to this process.  Just 
as the chairperson, directors and members are appointed by the 
governor in council, they can also be removed for cause by the 
governor in council.  Notice that reads cause, not just cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the foundation are to be kept on at the whim of 
cabinet or the Prime Minister, what are the chances that they 
will ever make a decision independently?  For example, what if 
the chairperson makes a reasonable but unpopular decision and 
turns down a grant to a friend of the Prime Minister?  Will that 
person then be removed from the board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if a director recommends that a project be denied but the 
chairperson is a Liberal crony?  Would that be considered cause? 
What if a member is doing a terrible job but is a close friend of 
the Prime Minister or the privy council?  Does the member then 
get to keep the job and the money and cannot be removed by 
anybody but the Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have certainly heard many examples in the House recently 
about the Prime Minister and how he can assert his influence over 
those he personally appoints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I have to tell anybody about the issue of the 
governor of the Business Development Bank and about the billion 
dollar boondoggle in Human Resources Development Canada where 
ministerial interference directed money to constituencies and to 
organizations that did not meet the criteria of the program. 
Those issues are fairly well known by everyone in the House and I 
would expect fairly well known by everyone across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped that at least there would be some safeguards 
against this practice in the bill, but unfortunately those 
safeguards are sadly lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern regarding the way the foundation will be staffed 
relates to the provisions for expertise in its chairperson.  The 
bill states that the appointment of directors is supposed to 
ensure expertise of its directors and that the board should be 
representative of persons engaged in the development and 
demonstration of technologies to promote sustainable development. 
Curiously, though, the bill makes no such provision for the 
appointment of the chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the bill is just leaving the door wide open 
for patronage and just waiting for some friend of the Prime 
Minister to walk through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some concerns regarding how members of the 
foundation will be compensated for their contributions.  The bill 
states that the directors may be paid remuneration that is fixed 
by the foundation's bylaws and that they are entitled to be paid 
reasonable travel and living expenses incurred by them in the 
performance of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the board is setting their own bylaws, where are the checks 
against unreasonable salaries?  It sounds like a great 
opportunity for these appointed cronies to find themselves a 
tidy, new source of cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will remember Ted Weatherhill and his expense account. 
He is the bureaucrat who charged Canadian taxpayers $21,000 in 
three years for his travelling expenses. Certainly he was 
entitled to collect reasonable expenses for the job he was doing 
for the government. 
Perhaps the possibility of that happening exists under this 
foundation.  Those could hardly be considered by anyone to be 
reasonable expenses.  Even the Liberals who fired him over the 
issue did not think his expenses were reasonable.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least there is some mention of the salaries of directors in 
the bill.  Bill C-4 makes no mention of the chairperson's salary 
and how it will be determined.  Quite frankly with the way the 
government likes to throw money at its friends, I would just as 
soon not leave this sort of thing up to chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my comments I made mention of my concerns 
regarding the financial operations of the foundation.  I would 
like to take some time to expand somewhat on those concerns.  The 
bill is terribly vague on how its financial operations will work. 
I have to question exactly how the foundation intends to sustain 
its financial viability without an ongoing infusion of taxpayer 
dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that the board shall establish investment 
policies, standards and procedures that a reasonably prudent 
person would apply with respect to a portfolio of investment to 
avoid an undue risk of loss and obtain a reasonable return.  I 
wonder if the same standards of investment will be used as those 
that guide Canada pension plan investments.  If so, the financial 
stability of the foundation is doomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 15, 2001, the CPP fund, made up of $41.6 billion in 
assets invested mostly in bonds, reported a $453 million loss on 
stock investments in its fiscal third quarter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill currently before the House the government is trying 
to prevent public scrutiny of how the Canada pension plan fund is 
performing.  It seems to me that this fund made up of billions of 
taxpayer dollars is just a bit too large to sweep under the 
carpet.  At the very least it would make a large lump in the 
carpet that would be pretty tough to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the pattern that the foundation will follow, we might 
as well go ahead and buy ourselves some gas masks because there 
will be little progress on the development of climate change 
science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many serious problems with the legislation.  I would 
like to know why we need this new Liberal friendly and expensive 
bureaucracy when there are many other funding vehicles already in 
place that could accomplish the same goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are regional development groups that receive federal 
funding and have local boards which approve high risk investments 
and give loans.  There is also the Federal Business Development 
Bank.  All these groups are under the purview of the Auditor 
General of Canada.  They could cover the responsibilities of the 
foundation and prevent establishing another expensive 
bureaucratic mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am sure the Prime Minister would like to ensure that his 
friends retire comfortably, when it comes to taxpayer dollars I 
would like to see a better guarantee of an open, accountable, 
transparent and responsible organization than what this confusing 
legislation would suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before my colleagues across the floor accuse me of being 
anti-environment, I should like to quote from the Canadian 
Alliance policy which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to protecting and preserving Canada's natural 
environment and endangered species, and to sustainable 
development of our abundant natural resources for the use of 
current and future generations.  Therefore we will strike a 
balance between environmental preservation and economic 
development.  This includes creating partnerships to promote 
meaningful progress in the area of environmental protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Canadian Alliance is in favour of taking steps to 
ensure cleaner air through new technologies.  However, as I have 
already mentioned, this foundation has the potential to be so 
riddled with patronage that little if anything meaningful will be 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes, as the auditor general indicated 
in his latest report to parliament, that government agencies, 
boards and commissions must be staffed with competent, 
experienced people who are appointed through an open and 
accountable process based on merit.  Quite frankly there is sadly 
little merit present in either this bill or the foundation it 
will create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the lack of merit shown in the many ways I have 
mentioned that I will be voting against the legislation.  I urge 
other members of the House to do the same.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK255">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-4, an 
act to establish a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the people of Surrey Central are pleased to have 
me participate in the debate today concerning the establishment 
of a foundation to fund sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 federal budget the Liberals announced that they 
would be creating a sustainable development technology fund. They 
earmarked $100 million as the amount of initial funding. They are 
proposing a foundation to administer these funds.  In the debate 
today we are disappointed that the committee hearings on the bill 
did not result in the Auditor General of Canada overseeing the 
books of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly review what the foundation is supposed to do. The 
sustainable development technology foundation is allegedly to 
operate at arm's length from the government.  It is to be 
operated as a not for profit organization.  It will administer 
funding primarily to projects related to greenhouse gas reduction 
and improving air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will dole out funds on a project by project 
basis.  The foundation will accept proposals from existing and 
new collaborative arrangements among technology developers, 
suppliers, users, universities, not for profit organizations, and 
organizations such as industrial associations and research 
institutes.  The government originally expected that the 
foundation would be in place by March 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central support this initiative.  We 
believe that this is the kind of thing where our government 
should be taking the lead.  I would venture to say that members 
on all sides of the House want to protect Canada's environment 
and work on projects related to greenhouse gas reduction and 
improving air quality.  Our children certainly want that.  We 
want our children and grandchildren to have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Alliance policy supports these kinds of sustainable 
development initiatives.  I want to make that absolutely clear by 
stating our policy.  We are committed to protecting and 
preserving Canada's natural environment and endangered species 
and to the sustainable development of our abundant natural 
resources for the use of current and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we will strike a balance between environmental 
preservation and economic development.  This includes creating 
partnerships with provincial governments, private industry, 
educational institutions and the public to promote meaningful 
progress in the area of environmental protection.  That is the 
policy we have pledged to follow when we form the next 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government the Liberals have mismanaged our environment and 
failed to provide sustainable development.  This weak Liberal 
government has signed international treaties including Kyoto, 
Beijing and Rio, with no intention whatsoever of carrying out 
those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made political decisions about matters that 
require scientific decisions.  The conservation of fish species 
was based on political decisions, not on scientific evidence or 
scientific research.  The safety of the bovine growth hormone was 
influenced by political pressure and political interference 
rather than by scientific evidence and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is too busy trying to garner votes and counter 
Canadian Alliance policy rather than allowing scientific 
principles and evidence to drive the efforts to protect our 
environment and meet our international commitments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberals have been promising Canadians that they 
were going to pass endangered species legislation, which of 
course died twice on the order paper.  After seven or eight 
years, what do we have?  We have another bill they are promising 
to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The endangered species bill they are proposing is an assault on 
property owners in Canada.  It is confiscation without 
compensation.  It is hard to imagine.  It is so undemocratic that 
it is anti-democratic, but that is another story for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weak Liberal government that lacks vision really has done 
nothing in terms of initiatives for our environment and 
sustainable development since 1993.  Other countries have passed 
legislation and are way ahead.  Even the United Nations itself 
has a sustainable development office, but the Liberals allow 
Canada to once again be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was originally introduced as part of budget 2000, 
delivered almost a year ago.  Now, after a year of doing nothing, 
the government wants the bill to pass through the House and the 
Senate as soon as possible and receive royal assent so it can 
dole out $100 million.  Is this simple mismanagement or is it 
indicative of the usual way the government operates?  It could 
not care less about debate in the House.  It does not 
hesitate to use closure or time allocation to ram any bill 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, it is important to note that the official 
opposition wants to support the bill today, but we wanted to see 
some amendments as well.  We would have supported the 
bill one year ago, but the government did not allow it to go 
forward until this month, at least one year late if we use the 
Liberal government budget 2000 agenda, and seven or eight years 
late according to the red book one promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about suggestions we have for the Liberals 
concerning the bill.  Our suggestions really do not have anything 
to do with the sustainable development aspect of the bill.  The 
amendments needed do not have anything to do with the projects 
related to greenhouse gas reductions or improving air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments have to do with the Liberal Party's arrogance. 
Canadians are very uncomfortable with patronage, which denies 
them transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read a simple paragraph from Canadian Alliance policy: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, an independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are proposing to turn the sustainable development 
foundation into a Liberal patronage pork barrel.  The people of 
Surrey Central and I are dismayed.  We are disappointed that 
the government would take such a wonderful initiative of 
supporting projects related to greenhouse gas reductions and 
improving air quality and turn the efforts into some kind of 
Liberal Party payoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are trying to arrange it so that the chairperson 
and a minority number of directors and members are appointed by 
the governor in council.  They then appoint the remaining members 
to complete the 15 person board of directors.  Obviously the 
foundation will become another Liberal patronage plum.  When will 
the Liberals evolve in the new millennium and put a stop to these 
kinds of 17th century old boys' club practices?  When will they 
abandon the politics of exclusion?  When will they stop 
implementing their systems of disenfranchisement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The patronage practices of the government are virtually fascist 
by strict political definition.  The Canadian Alliance will put a 
stop to this sort of thing when it forms the next government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a sustainable development foundation is 
something all Canadians have wanted for years.  The Liberals are 
turning it into some kind of arena for political payoffs.  What a 
shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the auditing of the foundation.  Again, while 
the foundation would provide an annual report to parliament, the 
foundation would appoint its own auditors and have final approval 
on the financial reports before they are made public.  While the 
legislation does not set out rules as to who would be eligible to 
be the auditor, the government refuses to allow the Auditor 
General of Canada access to the foundation's books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the government does not want the office of 
the Auditor General of Canada involved.  It knows that the 
auditor general has been very critical of its practices.  The 
Liberals have had a difficult ride with the outgoing auditor 
general.  His most recent report was probably his most scathing 
indictment yet of the government.  Each auditor general's report 
on the mismanagement of the Liberal government is worse than the 
previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition wants these issues, the question of who 
will audit the foundation and the question of how appointments 
will be made to the foundation, dealt with.  We ask the 
government to look at these issues seriously.  These are 
non-partisan, good suggestions.  We will not allow these two 
concerns to be swept under the carpet by the Liberals.  Based on 
these two things, we have to oppose the bill and we do not want 
to have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue, our environment, is the most important thing that 
the House of Commons could be dealing with.  Debates on the 
environment speak to the very future of the human race on this 
planet.  All else really pales in comparison when we view what 
other subjects we could be debating in the House of Commons. Bill 
C-4 is a good example of the weaknesses of the government when it 
comes to the issue of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that in regard to the idea of creating a 
new foundation of this sort the government does not really talk 
about where it would be based and what centre it would be working 
out of.  It actually puts into question the future of the 
International Institute for Sustainable Development, located in 
Winnipeg.  We already have one institute for sustainable 
development and its future is in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I participated in the second reading debate of the bill and was 
very interested in the remarks of my colleague from Winnipeg 
Centre.  He has some serious concerns about the hidden agenda of 
the Liberal government when it comes to the future of the 
sustainable development centre in his riding.  I share his 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institute was created years ago and has had its funding 
reduced year after year, to the point where it is really a shadow 
of its former self.  There was a time when it had a staff of 140 
people and its own building.  It now occupies a very small 
office, with maybe a handful of people, on the third floor of a 
nondescript office building in the centre of downtown Winnipeg. 
We wonder if the government has completely forgotten it already 
has an institute for sustainable development.  Maybe the Liberals 
are threatening to axe what is left of the International 
Institute for Sustainable Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to compare the $100 million figure that the Liberals 
have given us in Bill C-4 to cover the issue of sustainable 
development with the government putting $1.3 billion into a very 
narrow and fixed program, a one time payment to offset energy 
costs for Canadians.  The government missed the target with that 
one as well, sending cheques to students, prisoners, MPs and 
deceased Canadians but not to those who pay the heating bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the institute in Winnipeg, if there is $100 
million to spend, why would the government not restore the 
institute to its former stature, that of a world leader, research 
centre and resource library for anyone interested in the whole 
concept of energy conservation or sustainable development? 
Why not enhance the Winnipeg facility as a centre of excellence 
right in the centre of Canada and become world leaders so we can 
export the technology?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, once again we have the Liberals taking an 
initiative, one that everyone would want to support, the creation 
of a sustainable development foundation, but what do they do? 
They turn it into a venue for patronage payoffs and they close 
the books to the auditor general.  They want to control the $100 
million they are giving to the foundation without anyone else 
finding out which Liberal Party donors receive the bulk of the 
$100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be amazing if it were not so sad.  The people of Surrey 
Central, who want to support the creation of the sustainable 
development foundation, do not want to support the bill because 
of the way the Liberals are playing politics with it.  If the 
Liberals are prepared to fix the flaws and the corruption they 
have written into the bill, then we would be more than happy to 
support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, why a law to 
establish a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology? The question arises: Why establish a foundation, 
especially one outside the government? I think this kind of 
question is totally relevant, especially since two things 
happened since yesterday which made me wonder even more about 
the reason for this foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing happened yesterday during the debate on Bill 
C-209 brought forward by my distinguished colleague from 
Jonquière, for whom I have the utmost respect because of her mind 
as well as her heart. The member for Jonquière presented a bill 
calling for a tax deduction to encourage greater use of public 
transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance said that it was an excellent initiative on the part of 
the member. I was amazed to hear him say that. I thought it was a 
great start. It was great, but it did not last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He immediately went on to sing the praise of all government 
policies regarding the environment, air quality and so on, to 
brag about the hundreds of thousands of dollars and even the 
billions of dollars invested in these areas, all that to say, in 
the end, that he would not support the bill because it was too 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As simple as Bill C-209 may have been, it could have had a major 
impact on climate change, thus on sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous political life, as an alderman in Sherbrooke, I 
sat for several years on the Sherbrooke area transport 
commission. Many studies were carried out on road 
transport—especially on motor vehicle transport versus public 
transit—and I noticed that the impact was significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending on economic cycles, ridership varied according to 
the subsidies the public transit system got. Of course, there 
were operation subsidies and capital grants. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promoting public transit, but ridership varied depending 
on the economy cycle. When subsidies started to drop and the 
price of cars started to go down or rebates were offered with 
no freight fees and 0% interest, people stopped using public 
transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spending millions of dollars to establish a 
foundation, the government could have supported or should 
support the bill brought forward by my colleague from Jonquière 
in order to improve ridership. But I gather that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance does not 
understand a thing about the Hygrade sausage principle: the more 
you eat... 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>The more you eat it, 
the more you like it, and the more you like it, the more you eat 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Even I had forgotten how it went. 
I had a memory lapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Increase the supply and the demand will 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> That is right. And the same applies to public 
transit. We must encourage the use of public transit and make 
sure that when Bill C-209 is brought back to the House for 
debate in a short while, the government will invest in the 
proposed initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing surprised me. This morning at the Standing 
Committee of Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and 
Natural Resources, we heard the parliamentary secretary. He 
talked about climate changes. We also heard about the Kyoto 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is prepared to invest hundreds of 
millions, even billions of dollars in some areas. It will also invest 
$100 million in the foundation. We were supposed to achieve major 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions based on 1990 levels. But 
the fact of the matter is that there has been a 13% increase 
based on those levels. Not only did we not reduce our emissions, 
but we increased them by 13% even though the government told us 
that it had invested huge amounts in support of sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that only one-third of the reduction objectives 
set in 1997 for the period between 2008 and 2012 will be met. 
We can see that on one hand the government refuses 
initiatives, as small as they may be, that would be highly 
effective in dealing with climate change, but, on the other 
hand, with the hundreds of millions and even the billions of 
dollars it has spent, it has not even managed to stabilize 
greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it has only managed to 
increase them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill to establish this foundation raises a lot of questions 
besides what we were able to observe in a relatively short time. 
In less than 24 hours we were able to see that the government 
is saying two different things but is not getting any results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Bloc Quebecois is against the establishment of 
this foundation because it raises a lot of concerns, to which I 
will get back later on. 
I could go through them quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the division of power and the fact that Quebec already 
has such a foundation. There is the concentration of power and 
the fact that the bill is rather vague in its definitions, which 
I would describe as risky, and so are the expressions used. 
There is also a huge disparity between the recommendations from 
the issue table and the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course if we talk about the foundation itself, the objective 
pursued is certainly a lofty one. Sustainable development, the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, are 
all lofty goals, but this bill is obviously not the tool we need 
to achieve results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the situation in Quebec, I said earlier that there 
is indeed a concern with regard to the division of power. This 
bill seems to be another roundabout way for the federal 
government to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this bill is so broad in scope that it could 
enable the federal government to invest in an area that should 
be under Quebec and the other provinces' jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first representatives from the other provinces 
could be supportive of the bill. They never take exception to 
the fact that the federal government gets involved in their 
jurisdictions and manages things for them. For Quebec, however, 
this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During consideration at committee stage we prepared amendments 
effectively asking that Quebec be allowed to opt out of that 
foundation, with full compensation, because our province already 
has a foundation, the Fondation d'action québécoise pour le 
développement durable. The government invested close to 
$45 million in that foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to digress for a moment. 
Earlier I referred to our discussions this morning at the 
standing committee on natural resources regarding the Kyoto 
protocol. It was mentioned that greenhouse gas emissions had 
increased by 13% in Canada. However, Quebec is the province with 
the lowest increase, with 7%. This is almost seven times less 
than the province with the highest increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we feel that the foundation is effective. If it had an 
additional $25 million or so to promote technologies, the results 
would be even more conclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we are concerned the issue of the foundation is 
settled: we do not need it. All we need is money, because the 
needs are in Quebec. One also wonders about a foundation that is 
outside the government. The government would hardly have any 
control over it. 
Automatically there is also the element of concentration of 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation can look after its own business itself, but we 
know that there is always an important link with the 
government—not with parliament—because it is the government that, 
to all intents and purposes, appoints the 15 directors.  The 
bill provides that the first seven are appointed by the 
government and eight others by the directors themselves.  We 
know that ultimately the government will be appointing all 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, certain people reminded me that when the government, the 
Prime Minister in particular, began establishing foundations or 
agencies with directors he himself appointed, he seemed to be 
rewarding his friends with plum appointments.  If he has a lot 
of such appointments to hand out before leaving, maybe he should 
be leaving soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here are another 15 friends he can introduce to the board of 
directors, 15 who, for all intents and purposes, will be 
accountable to the government.  The government even has the 
right to remove them for cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is rather vague with respect to the definition of 
“eligible project”.  Does an eligible project to improve air 
quality mean that they will also fund projects having to do with 
nuclear technology, for instance?  Nothing would appear to 
prohibit it, although this would run counter to the Kyoto 
agreement and nothing would indicate the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will, indirectly, draw up the eligibility criteria?  The 
government as well, but the foundation will never be accountable 
to parliament.  It was this that prompted a major amendment. 
This amendment called for the auditor general to be able to 
audit the foundation in order to evaluate its performance 
against objectives, the way in which funds were distributed, and 
whether such distribution was cost-effective.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before that amendment was proposed a request had been made 
to ask the auditor general to appear before the standing 
committee on natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the impact that visit would have had on the drafting 
of various clauses and changes to be made to the bill. The 
auditor general has repeatedly criticized the fact that 
appointments made by the Prime Minister and the government are 
more often than not based on partisanship rather than merit. The 
risk is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the auditor general appeared before the committee to assess 
the bill, he could have suggested changes to avoid these near 
conflicts of interest that can exist between the government and 
a so-called independent foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Yes, as my distinguished colleague and member 
for Jonquière just said, it goes to a matter of transparency. It 
could have ensured some degree of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these various reasons the Bloc Quebecois will not be 
supporting the bill. We could perhaps have supported it had all 
our amendments been accepted in committee. At any rate, with part of 
them not having been approved, we already knew then that we 
would not be supporting this bill. Quebec has its own 
foundation. 
The only thing we would be willing to accept is a transfer of 
available funds for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 
promote sustainable development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, before I start to debate 
I would like to raise a point of order.  You recognized me to 
speak earlier and I sat down because the Bloc member had not 
actually put his name on the debate schedule.  I believe I did 
have the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have my 15 minutes to speak.  I am the only 
opposition member of parliament who has an amendment to the bill. 
I feel I have some things to add to the debate on the bill.  I 
would ask unanimous consent of the House to finish my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I would advise the 
hon. member that this is not the end of debate.  This is the 
first round of debate on the bill.  The hon. member will have 
whatever time is left from the two minutes or one minute to 
continue when the bill comes back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will take my two 
minutes to thank you for asking.  If we will be able to debate 
the bill when it comes back to the House, I would certainly take 
my 40 minutes at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  We only have 20 minutes.  Now we get 
into trouble.  It is a slippery slope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Let me clarify 
something in terms of the point of order the hon. member raised. 
To be clear, there is no list.  It is a courtesy that has been 
decided upon by the House leaders.  It is true that we go through 
a certain rotation that has been agreed by the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that the hon. member from the Bloc did not stand 
at the same time, but he did stand and it was his turn.  He had 
the 40 minutes if he wished to avail himself of them.  The hon. 
member will have 20 minutes beginning the next round. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
think I have about 30 seconds left to add a few comments today. 
It would certainly be a mistake if I did not take full advantage 
of the minute and 30 seconds or so that I have today to speak at 
least briefly to the bill being debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that we will be able to come back to the 
bill at another time, shorten our speaking points a bit and be 
able to get another kick at the proverbial can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Conservative Party would applaud a number of things in 
Bill C-4.  The whole idea of sustainable development and a 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are commendable projects that 
everyone in parliament would tend to support.

a slightly better job but it did not go all the way.  For that

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me to introduce a

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to have this time in the House today to discuss 
something of such importance to today's society.  This motion is 
calling upon the government to require alcoholic beverages to 
carry a warning label as part of an all-out campaign against 
fetal alcohol syndrome. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by expressing some thanks for the work that has 
been done leading up to the debate here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to express appreciation to members of the 
all party subcommittee of the House for agreeing to make the 
motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to pay a special tribute to a member of the House 
who has worked long and hard on issues pertaining to fetal 
alcohol syndrome and who has in fact pioneered the notion of 
labels on alcohol beverage containers here in Canada today.  I am 
referring specifically to the work of the member for Mississauga 
South.  It is very important that we recognize the work of that 
member because he has led the way in the House for many years in 
pushing very hard for education programs pertaining to fetal 
alcohol syndrome and in pursuing the idea of labels on alcohol 
beverage containers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are no doubt fully aware, Madam Speaker, of the work of that 
member in terms of a book he wrote.  I refer specifically to 
<I>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: The Real Brain Drain</I>, and a 
campaign he initiated called “Drink Smart Canada”, which lists a 
number of conditions that are either directly or indirectly due 
to alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the work of the member for Mississauga South 
in pursuing this matter before the House.  In fact, I am not the 
first one to bring the matter here.  The member for Mississauga

parliament and dealt with at the Standing Committee on Health two 
parliaments ago.

support on this issue.  There has been support and encouragement 
from representatives of every single party in the House today.  I 
think we have the basis for a non-partisan approach to a very 
serious issue.  It is my hope that we have a real possibility in 
society and in parliament to achieve something that until 
recently we thought was impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea has not only been pursued by the member for 
Mississauga South in parliament, but it was pursued actively by a 
standing committee of parliament back in 1992.  I am referring 
specifically to a comprehensive study done by the then standing 
committee on health and welfare entitled “A Preventable 
Strategy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations of that report was to add warning 
labels to alcohol products informing Canadian consumers of the 
danger that drinking while pregnant could cause birth defects. 
That was a very useful document that shed tremendous light on a 
very serious issue in our society today.  It created tremendous 
public support and interest for pursuing the idea of labels on 
alcohol beverage containers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the past decade, numerous members of 
parliament and activists have been involved in building awareness 
around the issue.  It is important for all of us to acknowledge 
the extent of the work done by the professionals, volunteers and 
other advocates who have worked for many years, first to have the 
condition of fetal alcohol syndrome recognized and then for 
programs to assist individuals and their families to cope with 
this disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many others have worked to sensitize teachers and other 
professionals, and still others have focused on educating the 
public.  Among those, many have campaigned for warning labels on 
alcohol as a means to raise public awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are dealing with today.  We know that this is 
not the be-all and end-all in terms of a solution to a very 
serious problem in our society today.  We are presenting it as 
one element of a comprehensive education strategy to address a 
very serious problem in Canada today, fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have asked me why I am bringing this issue forward.  I want 
to give a little background.  First, this is a continuation of 
work I did when I was a member in the Manitoba legislative 
assembly and is a follow up to our attempts in that province to 
achieve some form of labelling on alcohol products.  That work 
demonstrated for me the difficulties in pursuing labels on a 
provincial jurisdictional basis, being informed fairly early on 
in that debate that we needed a national strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some jurisdictions have taken steps to put labels on alcohol 
beverage containers.  I want to mention the work in both the 
Yukon and the Northwest Territories that pursued this and 
implemented a form of labelling back in the early 1990s.  They 
recognized early on that there had to be some notification, some 
attempt to make women aware of the dangers of drinking while 
pregnant and how it could lead to birth defects, and the 
possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba we did not win the battle for labelling but we at 
least achieved the ability to put messages on the brown paper bag 
in which alcohol bottles were placed.  It was a step.  It was my 
hope to continue that fight here.  It is great to be able to 
follow in the footsteps of others who have done this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel an obligation to represent my constituents on 
something as important as fetal alcohol syndrome.  No community 
is spared the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome.  Some 
communities have a higher incidence than others.  In parts of my 
constituency of Winnipeg North Centre there is a very high 
incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is related and tied directly to poverty, despair, depression, 
unemployment, poor economic circumstances, lousy housing and lack 
of nutritional food.  That reflects the demographics in my 
constituency.  It is understandable how that leads to a greater 
incidence of drinking and a higher incidence of fetal alcohol 
syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I bring to this Chamber the expressed intention on the 
part of constituents is to have me pursue this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency there are a number of organizations that are 
working very hard on some groundbreaking projects that are making 
a difference bit by bit.  They have to be acknowledged.  We have 
to in this place do whatever we can to acknowledge those efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking specifically of a school by the name of David 
Livingstone which is in the heart of the inner city of my 
constituency, where the problems of economic and social 
insecurity are enormous.  The school has taken up the challenge 
of putting in place a program that will help identify the problem 
of FAS and help develop programs that will meet the needs of 
those children.  There are no textbooks.  There is not a lot of 
help out there in terms of how to actually work with kids with 
fetal alcohol syndrome.  However it is making a difference, and I 
wanted to acknowledge the work of the David Livingstone school 
and its principal, Angeline Ramkissoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reason I bring this matter before the House today is a 
very personal one.  I happen to have a son with a disability.  My 
son is 16 years old.  He was diagnosed with a rare genetic 
disability when he was three years old.  As a result of that, he 
has severe learning disabilities, profound developmental delay 
and lives with uncontrollable seizures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of my personal experience, my son's disability is 
not related to fetal alcohol syndrome but that is neither here 
nor there.  The issue for me is that having the experience, as a 
parent, of living with and caring for a child with a disability 
reminds me each and every day that we have to do everything we 
can in this place to help parents, families and children who are 
dealing with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about this debate and the work that is involved, 
we have to remind ourselves that we are talking for a lot of 
families who are struggling on a day to day basis with some very 
difficult challenges and we have to play our part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes hard to separate the personal and the political. 
In my case, I do not think I can.  The personal is the political. 
The challenges I deal with on a day to day basis, the experience 
I have learned through working with my son, have made me a more 
effective member of parliament and have driven me to pursue 
issues such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I learned, in terms of addressing the needs of my son 
Nick, is that we must do everything possible to help children 
with disabilities but we must also, whenever possible, find ways 
to prevent disabilities, if they are preventable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are dealing with a disability, with a syndrome that is 
entirely preventable.  Let us make no mistake about it.  We are 
talking about fetal alcohol syndrome which is a condition that 
can be prevented.  It is caused by a woman drinking while 
pregnant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can do anything to inform women to take precautions during 
pregnancy and to try to prevent any child from being born with 
fetal alcohol syndrome, then we will have done a great service. 
There is no pretence here today that we are going to wipe out 
fetal alcohol syndrome.  There is no suggestion here today that 
every child born with a disability is the result of drinking 
while expecting.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that there is a link between drinking 
while pregnant and fetal alcohol syndrome.  If we could make 
women aware of the dangers of drinking while pregnant, then we 
would have made a big difference.  Even if one child is spared 
fetal alcohol syndrome because we have taken action through a 
measure as simple as putting labels on alcohol beverage 
containers, then we would have served our constituents and the 
people of the country well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to say about fetal alcohol syndrome, and I know 
other members will talk about it today.  I hope the member for 
Mississauga South has a chance to speak because he is truly 
familiar with the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that we are talking about a syndrome that is 
the most severe in a spectrum of abnormalities found in the 
children of women who have consumed alcohol while pregnant.  It 
is the leading cause of developmental delay.  No accurate 
statistic exists on the total number of individuals with FAS but 
estimates indicate that there may be as many as three children 
per 1,000 births. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add the whole question of fetal alcohol effects, a 
related syndrome to FAS, we are talking about many more and the 
numbers rise significantly.  There is no cure and the damage 
cannot be undone.  The main feature of the condition is that it 
can be totally eliminated through prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My plea today is for the House to build on the work of other 
members who have come before me and who have tried to accomplish 
something that is fundamental to a comprehensive strategy on 
fetal alcohol syndrome:  to provide warning labels on alcohol 
beverage containers.  That does not seem like a big deal, 
especially when we consider that labels have been required by law 
in the United States for over 10 years.  The United States 
government has, since 1989, required all alcohol beverage 
containers to contain warning labels.  No dire consequences 
flowed from that decision.  The alcohol industry is still alive 
and well.  Everything that we have heard about the reaction to 
that decision has been positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are not addicted to alcohol and women who are 
pregnant have taken note.  People who would not otherwise be 
aware of the link between drinking while pregnant and fetal 
alcohol syndrome are taking note.  It does help and it does make 
a difference. That is the point of today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South referred the following 
quotation to me which says it all.  Denny Boyd, who wrote an 
article in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on November 27, 1995, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intended purpose of warning labels on alcohol containers is 
to act as a consumer lighthouse, sending a signal of impending 
danger. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that not say it all?  We are a lighthouse sending a 
warning, sounding the alarm bells about the possibility of the 
dangers that can occur when drinking while pregnant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to make a difference and there is a real 
possibility of that.  In the last number of years, since the 
member for Mississauga South and others in the House worked on 
the issue, there has been a growing awareness about what fetal 
alcohol syndrome really is and what kind of consequences it can 
have for all of us.  We know more today about the millions of 
dollars society spends to support one child with fetal alcohol 
syndrome.  We also know more about the links between fetal 
alcohol syndrome and juvenile delinquency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that probably over half the cases we are dealing with on 
a day to day basis in terms of juvenile delinquency are directly 
related to disabilities.  Some of those disabilities are related 
to fetal alcohol syndrome.  If we understand the consequences for 
society then should we not take whatever steps we can to make a 
difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are proposing today.  I look forward to hearing 
from members of all parties about the value of the motion and 
about whether we can continue the work started by the member for 
Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not only consider it because it makes good public 
policy sense, but we should consider it because we have the 
backing and the support of many thousands of Canadians right 
across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent survey indicated that Canadians in large numbers 
supported the idea of warning labels on alcohol beverage 
containers.  An Environics poll conducted for Health Canada and 
released in January 2000 found that 90% of people approved of 
warning labels and that two-thirds of those asked strongly 
approved of warnings on alcohol beverage containers.  The report 
on the poll concluded that there was substantial public support 
for initiatives to inform people about the risk of alcohol use, 
including warning labels on alcohol products and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have public support and the support of other provincial and 
territorial jurisdictions.  We have the commitment and the 
dedication that we bring to this place.  We should not lose this 
moment.  We should act today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
speak to Motion M-155, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of requiring that no person shall sell 
an alcoholic beverage in Canada unless the container in which 
the beverage is sold carries the following visible and clearly 
printed label:  “WARNING: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can 
cause birth defects”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before beginning, I wish to congratulate the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre most sincerely on moving this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the motion itself I should like to recognize 
the longstanding efforts of my colleague, the member for 
Mississauga South.  Members on both sides of the House will be 
aware that he has been involved with the issue for many years. He 
has been an advocate for efforts to combat fetal alcohol 
syndrome.  I applaud his tenacity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this tenacity was reflected in certain undertakings 
by the Prime Minister in his Address in Reply to the Speech from 
the Throne on January 31. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to stand in support of the motion.  I agree that 
warning labels on alcoholic beverages should be considered. 
Currently Yukon, Australia and some U.S. jurisdictions require 
alcohol warning labels.  While research studies demonstrate that 
it may not be the most effective way to reach groups at a high 
risk of alcoholic use, it is timely to review these findings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, warning labels on alcohol must not be taken in 
isolation.  They must be part of a comprehensive strategy to 
combat alcohol abuse, which in turn can lead to fetal alcohol 
syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. An effective comprehensive 
strategy must include a number of elements: awareness-raising 
campaigns, research, life-skills based approaches, and substance 
abuse prevention programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline quickly what the Government of Canada is 
doing to address the tragedy of fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wide variety of measures have been and are being implemented 
in Canada to address this syndrome.  These measures have 
included extensive attempts and many programs to educate the 
public about the dangers of drinking while pregnant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 28, 2000 a fetal alcohol syndrome-fetal alcohol 
effects initiative received $11 million for three years.  This 
was an announcement that we made at the time and the program is now 
under way.  This initiative builds on the excellent work 
currently being done in the provinces and territories and in 
communities by parents and support groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $11 million in funding is being used to enhance activities in a 
number of areas, including public awareness and education, 
surveillance, early identification and diagnosis, fetal alcohol 
syndrome and fetal alcohol effects training and capacity 
development, co-ordination, integration of services, and a 
strategic project fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has established a national advisory committee 
on fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects.  The 
committee will provide independent strategic advice and 
expertise to Health Canada on fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects and promote collaboration and partnerships 
across disciplines and sectors. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is also working with the provinces and territories 
to develop a national public education and awareness campaign on 
this syndrome and on fetal alcohol effects.  A joint launch of a 
poster and pamphlet is expected in May 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch is also 
developing a fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects 
public awareness campaign that reaches out to first nations and 
Inuit populations in a culturally sensitive manner. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure access to appropriate treatment for pregnant 
women with substance use problems, Health Canada also provides 
funding to the provinces and territories through the alcohol and 
drug treatment and rehabilitation program.  Also through this 
program, Health Canada promotes best practices, evaluates model 
programs, and disseminates leading-edge information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is also providing funding to the Canadian Centre 
on Substance Abuse to enhance the national information service 
and the On-Line Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-Fetal Alcohol Effects 
training project for frontline workers in the Canadian prenatal 
nutritional program and the community action program for 
children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada, working with key stakeholders, will be 
conducting a national survey of physicians to determine current 
knowledge, beliefs and attitudes with respect to fetal alcohol 
syndrome and diagnosis.  The First Nations and Inuit Health 
Branch of Health Canada is working with the Indian and Inuit 
health committee of the Canadian Pediatric Society to identify 
diagnosis criteria.  The information will be used as a baseline 
measure for policy and education initiatives geared toward health 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Health Canada will be hosting a national forum in the 
fall of 2001 for the purpose of developing a national action plan 
for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects involving 
the relevant sectors:  education, corrections, social services 
and jurisdictions across Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives are just a few of the many activities taking 
place across Canada to combat this syndrome, but they give a 
good picture.  Although Health Canada recognizes that the 
majority of adult Canadians use alcohol in a way that is not 
harmful to their health, it is we who must combat this serious 
problem on behalf of Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is passed by the government, as we hope it will be, 
the consideration by the House of Commons of the 
desire expressed in Motion M-155 will no doubt contribute to 
raising public awareness and go a long way to improve the 
situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this 
very important motion, Motion No. 155.  I compliment the member 
for Winnipeg North Centre and the member from Mississauga for 
bringing the issue up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the reasons children incur 
brain damage in utero.  It is the leading cause of preventable 
brain damage in Canada.  It is extraordinary.  In some 
communities the rates are very high and exceed 12 children per 
1,000.  The cost is about $350,000 per child up to the age of 18, 
not to mention the massive human cost to the individuals and 
families involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the fact that it is not only alcohol that 
causes children to be born with brain damage.  Other substances, 
such as glue, gasoline and illegal drugs, can poison the brain of 
a growing fetus and the damage in many cases is irreversible.  We 
must therefore look at the issue in a much larger context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the parliamentary secretary that the evidence is 
out on whether labels are a solution.  However, I strongly urge 
the government to look at the issue in a larger context to see 
how we can more effectively prevent substance abuse and the 
incidence of FAS and FAE.  As I said before, the damage is due 
not only to alcohol but to glue, gasoline and illegal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my clinical experience, every pregnant patient I have ever 
met who consumed these injurious substances knew full well that 
they would damage the baby.  Every one of them knew this. Fifteen 
year old girls accompanied by their caregivers have told me they 
did not care what happened to their baby.  They said that they 
would keep the baby if it was cute and give it up if it was not. 
When asked if they cared whether the child had been damaged by 
the chemicals they said that they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is less a question of knowledge than of other issues.  Much 
of the alcohol consumed by pregnant women who will deliver FAS 
and FAE children is produced at home.  They throw potato peels, 
yeast and a few other things into a big vat, let it ferment and 
the result is beer of sorts.  That is what is consumed, not the 
brand names bought in the liquor store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do to address substance abuse problems and reduce 
the incidence of FAS and FAE?  New medical technology shows 
clearly that substances in the neuropathways of the brain travel 
around in a circle.  We must therefore deal with the neuropathway 
of the addict's brain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People must be taken out of the drug environment.  New medical 
tools work very well along with the usual detox and counselling. 
Some European models, particularly Switzerland and the 
Netherlands, have a 60% cure rate after one year for substance 
abusers, particularly hardcore narcotic abusers.  That is 
absolutely extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from personal experience that many of the things we do 
today make people go around in a circle.  They do not address the 
problems in a substantive way.  I therefore encourage the 
government to work with its provincial counterparts and to look 
at some of the European models with high success rates.  An 
effective approach involves not only detox, counselling and 
medical therapies but also skills training, jobs and a secure 
environment away from the drug environment these people are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about prevention.  We can look at the head start 
program.  We passed the program in 1998.  It works.  It is not 
only cost effective but has brought about a dramatic reduction in 
substance abuse.  It will reduce fetal alcohol syndrome.  There 
will be less chance that the baby the woman carries will be 
marred by FAS, FAE or other brain damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have put forth a bill that would enable the courts to put a 
woman in a treatment facility against her wishes if she is 
consuming substances that are injurious to her fetus.  It is not 
an abortion bill, and would apply only to cases where the woman 
has chosen to take her pregnancy to term.  If the woman has 
repeatedly refused all treatment and is of sound mind she can be 
put into a treatment facility against her wishes.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parallel to this is what is done for psychiatric patients 
who are a danger to themselves or to others. It is not a punitive 
action against women.  It is merely a last ditch effort to try to 
help prevent those fetuses from suffering the problems of FAS and 
FAE.  When I put the bill forward, and I have put it forward 
three times in the last three parliaments, people who said they 
supported it were individuals who work with children with FAS and 
FAE and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member made an articulate description of the social 
issues surrounding these problems.  She could not be more 
correct.  In many aboriginal communities with extraordinarily 
high rates of FAS and FAE, we must determine how we can enable 
them to have the best social program of all, which is a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately our country has chosen to compartmentalize 
aboriginal people.  We have chosen to treat them differently.  We 
deal with them differently through an Indian Act which creates a 
form of apartheid.  It has been highly disruptive to these 
communities.  It has eroded them from within and it has prevented 
them from being able to be masters of their own destiny, as well 
as capitalizing on the economic opportunity that should be 
available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High rates of unemployment and poverty have contributed to the 
high levels of FAS and FAE.  Matthew Coon Come, grand chief of 
the first nations, has made some very articulate statements that 
should be supported for aboriginal communities to get their own 
house in order and for aboriginal leadership to do so as well. 
That would be a welcome change in many communities and one that 
we would support as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must deal with the issue of substance abuse in a much broader 
range.  We need to deal with prevention through the head start 
program.  We need to deal with new treatments that we have today 
such as the European model that works with detox, counselling, 
medical therapy, skills training and getting people out of their 
drug environment for an extended period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latter is very important because we know that if addicts go 
back into the drug environment a chemical cascade takes 
place within their brains.  They become excited and are prompted 
to resume the substance abuse consumption they were doing before. 
We also need to look carefully at private member's bills that 
have been put forth on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the case of Miss M in the home province of the 
member from the NDP.  She was a young woman who as a result of 
glue sniffing had two children with brain damage.  She was put 
in a treatment facility against her wishes.  A court challenge 
took place and after a period of time she was released.  However 
she was off her drugs and she got her life back in order.  She 
delivered a baby that was the first baby she had that was not 
brain damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she was asked whether or not the short period of time in a 
treatment facility, albeit against her wishes, had an impact, she 
said that it did.  She said that it was probably the most 
important thing that had happened to prevent her from having 
another child that would be irreversibly brain damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only prompt the House to look at it from the context of 
our judicial system too because we know that almost 50% of the 
people in our jails have some form of FAS and FAE.  They have 
severe problems with cognitive skills.  They have severe problems 
trying to acquire the skills necessary to be an integrated 
member of society.  As a result many of them get into the 
unfortunate cycle of crime, punishment and incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the challenges of today that have not been 
dealt with in a very pragmatic way.  However, these are the 
opportunities that the ministers of justice and health can use 
their skills toward by working with their provincial 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would require a national approach involving the provinces, 
the Government of Canada and other communities to deal with this 
scourge.  I am very happy and I compliment the member from the 
NDP and members from all sides who have brought to the attention 
of the House the problems of FAS and FAE as well as some of the 
issues and challenges that we must address to solve this 
important problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues to 
congratulate and thank the member for Winnipeg North Centre, 
whom I know very well since we work together on the Standing 
Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the well-being of people in her riding and of 
Canadians in general has always been her first priority. 
Obviously, being pragmatic, she wants to take concrete measures 
to deal with an important problem for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our colleague from the Canadian Alliance said, we are the 
protectors of children in a way because the problem we are 
debating is certainly detrimental to mothers, but it is even 
more detrimental to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that as parliamentarians we have a responsibility to 
make sure that we do all we can in the area of prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion brought forward by the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre is interesting because it forces us to reflect on 
the balance between coercion and prevention that must exist in 
the legislative tools available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in the House we have been reflecting a lot on these 
issues. Last Friday, another member of the NDP proposed that the 
month of May be dedicated to the prevention of hepatitis. He 
reminded us that there are seven types of hepatitis and that one 
way to prevent this disease is, of course, through information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, his colleague from Winnipeg North Centre is taking over 
to remind us that fetal alcohol syndrome is preventable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know people afflicted by illness. Some suffer from 
cerebral palsy, others from severe diabetes, others yet from 
heart disease. This is obviously very tragic on a personal 
level, but it is different perhaps from fetal alcohol syndrome 
in that FAS is, in a way, the result of a behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This behaviour can be avoided.  It can be avoided if we put 
everything into play socially so there is maximum 
information available to those who are primarily responsible, 
since they give life, carry the children and, of course, are 
women.  I am not saying they have sole responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to join with the member for Winnipeg Centre North.  I 
think our ridings are quite similar.  My riding is in the centre 
of Montreal, in the eastern central part, to be more precise.  I 
too in my riding have a high number of underprivileged people. 
It is an industrial neighbourhood which underwent a major 
process of de-industrialization in the early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if people recall, but there was a big crisis in 
the shipbuilding industry in the early 1980s. 
There was a big crisis in the traditional industries linked to 
textiles and metallurgy, known as the soft sector, and there was 
a major crisis in the shoe industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three sectors were central to the economic life of the 
riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  It is a riding with a high 
number of underprivileged people.  It is clear that fetal 
alcohol syndrome is to be found in communities with high levels 
of poverty.  In this regard, we can ask ourselves as 
parliamentarians why there is more poverty in certain 
communities than in others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course personal variables.  There are variables 
relating to the manufacturing profile and to the economic 
profile of our ridings.  But in the life of an individual, 
sometimes things go badly.  We lose confidence in the system.  I 
would say there are unwanted pregnancies sometimes. 
There are people who plan pregnancies, who want to have a child 
and for whom doing so gives meaning to life.  I think this is 
true for most people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are probably circumstances in life where if a pregnancy is 
imposed, unwanted, accidental, a woman might be tempted to turn 
to alcohol. When things are not going well, when we are 
depressed, when we lose confidence, when we are in an 
environment where we feel useless, alcohol may unfortunately 
become a form of escape. This is why the proposal of the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre makes such sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speeches I always like to give examples. No member of 
parliament could present a bill to force someone to make a 
success of his or her life. 
From a legislative point of view, we cannot force people to do 
so. What we can do as parliamentarians is provide them with 
tools and training so they are equipped as best as they 
possibly can be to go through life, and particularly rough 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre is asking us to rely 
on information. Sometimes, pregnant women may not be adequately 
informed. If they see this warning on alcoholic beverages—wine, 
beer and other spirits—we can assume that it will deter them from 
drinking excessively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the parliamentary secretary and member for 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies told us that this motion must be part of 
a set of means. 
I am pleased to learn that in May an information campaign will 
be launched with the release of a brochure and a poster. I 
believe that all these tools can help us beat fetal alcohol 
syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that I only have three minutes left. I promised to take 
only eight minutes because I know that there are discussions 
between the parties to leave more time for the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I will conclude by congratulating the hon. member and asking 
for a unanimous vote on her motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
too, will be brief. The quality of the speeches made by the 
previous speakers was such that I could even refrain from taking 
part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think the member for Winnipeg North Centre and the 
member for Mississauga South deserve to be congratulated for the 
interest they have been showing in this issue for several years. 
Some nine or ten years ago, a committee presented a report on 
fetal alcohol syndrome. Recommendation no. 5 dealt with 
labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures were also recommended at that time. Some were 
implemented only a few months ago or a few years ago. We know 
the government is slow and this is why opposition parties have 
to push a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank God something else was done. 
The government helped to some extent, but it must be noted that 
the industry, as a result of that report or other reports, 
realized the importance of awareness and education campaigns and 
started to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw brewers and winemakers, state monopolies such as the SAQ 
in Quebec, take a portion of their revenues, a small one of 
course, to educate people on the effects of alcohol. An effort 
to increase awareness has been made over the last few years by 
the provincial governments, which control their liquor boards, 
by the federal government and by the industry. However, there 
remains an issue that is pretty important: labelling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we should not get into a labelling frenzy and get to 
the point where a bottle of beer or a bottle of wine carries 
several warnings. Too many warnings kill the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is nothing better than to start at the beginning. 
If someone is aware of fetal alcohol syndrome, that person might 
also be aware of the global impacts of alcohol for the rest of 
his or her life. If a woman is not too familiar with the 
consequences that alcohol can have on her unborn child, with a 
good education program and adequate warning labels, other people 
will let her know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when we see a label we do not pay too much attention 
to it, but when we see a pregnant woman close to us we tend to 
say “Be careful”. I have the chance to have a little boy, my 
angel. I never even thought of offering a glass of wine to my 
wife when she was pregnant. If she had taken one glass of wine, 
the baby would not have suffered from the syndrome. That is not 
the point, but at least there is an awareness. If everybody was 
more aware of all this, we would hear less comments like “Come 
on, just one little glass will do no harm”. But sometimes we do 
not know the effects that alcohol can have on a person. There 
again, we should not panic. The baby will not develop the 
syndrome with just one glass. All this is a matter of awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are wondering what consequences the labelling 
done in the United States will have, as we said earlier. Of 
course the industry is worried. This is normal. 
When we see other legislative follies, I think the industry is 
right to be alarmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the industry's current labelling practices for 
exports might well apply domestically as well.  What finer 
message to send to the public than to tell them that 
parliamentarians, in a motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, are going to force the government, in a 
manner of speaking, to take them into consideration.  We will 
have to cross our fingers and hope that the motion will acquire 
a “C” instead of its present “M” and that it will lead to a real 
bill the House will be able to consider very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here.  I thank my hon. colleague from the NDP for 
her initiative. 
Speaking of the New Democratic Party, I often treat the 
opposition parties well, but the NDP has been—and we see this 
evening once again—a sort of social conscience for the country. 
We are very glad of its existence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre listed those who have 
devoted themselves to building awareness of the importance of 
drinking responsibly.  To be fair, one group the hon. member 
forgot to mention is the Brewers Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Warning labels on alcohol beverage containers on their own will 
not put an end to the most serious problem of fetal alcohol 
syndrome.  In fact research has shown that 98% of women of 
childbearing age already know about the link between alcohol 
misuse and fetal alcohol syndrome.  They are already aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a brewery in my riding.  There are many members of 
parliament with breweries in their ridings.  I believe the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, the member 
for Etobicoke North, has two breweries in his riding.  We will 
not apologize for the fact that we have breweries in our ridings, 
because since 1987 the Brewers Association of Canada and its 
member brewers have devoted well in excess of $100 million to 
communicating messages about the importance of drinking 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to high profile advertising campaigns, brewers 
provide significant funding and other resources to a range of 
partner organizations involved in alcohol research, counselling, 
and the direct delivery of educational and awareness programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting a label on a bottle on its own will not do the job.  It 
is all the other work that is being done currently by those who 
are responsible, by those organizations like the Brewers 
Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is the Motherisk program of the Hospital for 
Sick Children.  Canada's brewers sponsor Motherisk's national 
toll free alcohol and substance use help line, 1-877-FAS-INFO, 
which provides callers with fact based information on how alcohol 
and substances can affect a developing fetus.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse.  Funding is 
provided to the Fetal Alcohol Resource Centre of the Canadian 
Centre on Substance Abuse, which acts as a clearing house for 
information on FAS-FAE for medical professionals, parents and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BAC, the Brewers Association of Canada, provided funding to 
the College of Family Physicians of Canada to design a program 
for family physicians called the alcohol risk assessment and 
intervention, ARAI, program.  The ARAI method gives family 
doctors the tools needed to identify patients most at risk, which 
helps them identify and help patients with problems related to 
harmful alcohol consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brewers sponsored the caring together program of the Native 
Physicians Association, which produced an FAS information poster 
series, video and guide, as well as an interactive board game 
aimed at native youth, which uses traditional symbols and 
teachings to address native lifestyle and health concerns.  This 
is not just a label on a bottle but actual traditional symbols 
used by our native communities so they better understand the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Brewers Association of Canada together with Young Drivers of 
Canada developed a video message that tells new drivers not to 
drink and drive.  We have all seen it.  This message, delivered 
by professional race car drivers, is seen by more than 40,000 new 
Canadian drivers each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Brewers Association of Canada initiated a partnership with 
L'Université de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick to 
develop Internet based activities for use in schools to educate 
young teens about alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BAC is a partner in a computer based training software 
focused on the safe operation of personal water craft.  BAC 
messaging encourages responsible behaviour and urges people not 
to drink and drive on the road or on the water. Other program 
partners include Bombardier and Shell Canada. This is a team 
effort.  It is a delivery of a message by all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1982, Canadian brewers and their U.S. counterparts have 
funded the Alcohol Beverage Medical Research Foundation. 
Associated with Johns Hopkins University, it provides research 
grants to study the medical, social and behavioural impacts of 
alcohol consumption.  The foundation has provided more than $30 
million in funding to 480 research projects here in Canada and in 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about Speak Up, Speak Out, Be Heard?  This is a multimillion 
dollar public service alcohol information campaign targeted 
specifically at young people using concepts and messages 
developed by young Canadians to be relevant to people their own 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to leave time at the end of the debate to ensure that 
we have an opportunity to have a vote on this particular issue, I 
will conclude with the following words.  The president and CEO of 
the Brewers Association of Canada, Sandy Morrison, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We work with a lot of people who are dedicated to bringing 
important information about responsible behaviour to those who 
need it.  At a very human and personal level, these people are 
making a difference.

<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
as a result of an exchange I had with the minister responsible 
for human resources back on March 23, during which I indicated 
concern about the system on CPP disability payments that was 
stacked against Canadians to the point where advocates were 
increasingly coming in to the system to give a hand on a very 
uneven playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had indicated to the minister that some of the advocates had 
been harassed in the past and, in her response, she kindly said 
that I should provide information on the allegations I had made. 
This turned out not to be necessary because the office of the 
commissioner of review tribunals wrote a letter almost 
immediately saying that in his two and a half years in that job, 
there had never been an advocate excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he went on to say that one witness was excluded last 
fall in a situation in Alberta where a person who had multiple 
sclerosis and serious cognitive disabilities repeatedly asked for 
her representative.  There was some confusion that the 
representative was actually an advocate.  It took six months. 
There has been no response yet from the office of the 
commissioner to that individual.  Obviously the case needs to be 
reheard immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes that I have I want to talk about the bigger 
picture of CPP disability benefits and why there are advocates 
entering the system.  My contention is that it is because the 
system is clearly working against ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two hundred thousand Canadians have been rejected over the last 
five years because either their forms were incomplete, their 
medical evidence was lacking or there was a misunderstanding of 
the basic criteria of a very complex form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines were changed as well in 1995.  They were made 
much more restrictive.  I will give one example.  It was assumed 
that people over age 55 prior to 1995 who were found to be 
disabled to do their own jobs were also disabled to do any other 
job.  That has now been rescinded and that opportunity no longer 
exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who may have contributed to CPP for their entire working 
life may all of a sudden need it but when they do it is not 
available.  The rationale is that this saves money.  It is 
estimated that there will be a $1 billion savings in this account 
alone by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a contest between the bottom line versus compassion and 
social justice for Canadians, the bottom line wins every time. 
This is a national concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Older Canadians are often very proud.  They are very reluctant 
to talk about infirmities they may have acquired.  We have poorly 
versed medical professionals who simply do not understand all the 
facts.  We lack finances for the professional testing that would 
help to sort this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no government provisions for appeals, forms or kits. 
Most people who are denied can rarely speak with an adjudicator 
as there is no money available for them.  The CPP disability plan 
is a bewildering, non-transparent maze.  I am sure every member 
of parliament has problems with this in their constituencies.  It 
is a totally unacceptable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caucus I represent will fight for progressive changes to 
this.  We will win, not on behalf of ourselves but on behalf of 
disabled Canadians from coast to coast to coast.

the hon. member for Palliser for the question he asked the 
Minister of Human Resources Development a few days ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer the member by saying that the office of the 
commissioner of review tribunals is a quasi-judicial body that 
operates independently from Human Resources Development Canada. 
In other words, it is completely at arm's length.  It oversees 
the work of review tribunals which hear appeals from CPP or OAS 
clients whose applications for benefits have been denied.  These 
are the clients I think the hon. member has been speaking 
about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada works within the requirements of the 
CPP legislation in determining who is eligible for disability 
benefits.  This definition has not changed since 1996.  It is no 
more and no less stringent since then.  In fact, the legislation 
states that a person's disability must be severe and prolonged in 
order to prevent him or her from doing any work on a regular 
basis.  This is what the law requires.

Madam Speaker, my question is in further pursuit of an answer to 
a question I had asked in February with regard to the home

people who should have received the rebate did not and those who

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to you to express the outrage I feel about the 
natural gas rebate to some of the citizens of Canada.  To hear 
that rebate cheques have been issued to children, prisoners and 
to people that do not even use natural gas makes me angry.  When 
issuing the rebates the government should only have issued them 
to those that have actually paid for natural gas.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of planning and thought that went into this program is

that we elect to wisely spend our hard earned monies.  I am 
writing this e-mail to you in the hope that you will be able to

need to know that ordinary working Canadian is really fed up with 
this type of nonsense and waste!  Some common sense should

</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm sick and tired of hearing that this, that and the other 
thing has gone up in price every time I turn around.  I haven't 
had a decent increase in wages for years.  I'm trying to support 
myself and have never relied on the government for help in any 
way—never applied for welfare or Unemployment Insurance 
benefits.  I have been a monetary supporter of the system since 
my teens and I am now 52.  I am an honest, hard working 
person—period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I don't think the way eligibility for the rebate was 
decided upon was fair—but who am I—just one small person in a 
country of many.

terribly upset at the recklessness of the Canadian Government at 
sending out the heating rebates to only a certain class of 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am outraged at the way the Liberal government spent millions of 
dollars, supposedly to help people offset the high cost of 
heating their homes with natural gas.  Issuing these cheques to 
GST recipients who are incarcerated, children, people who heat 
their homes with alternative fuels and don't use natural gas at 
all is stupidity at its worst.  Because my net income is (around 
32,000) I'm not entitled to a GST rebate but I have to heat my 
home the same as everyone else.  I have stopped using my natural 
gas fireplace and keep the thermostat set at 15 degrees and wear 
lots of clothes because I can't afford the high cost of heating 
my house.  It just infuriates me to think that not only am I 
paying to keep violent offenders in jail but that you gave them 
more spending money while I sit here in the cold struggling to 
make ends meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many more letters from constituents commenting on this 
rebate and wanting to know how the program was administered.  It 
may have started as a good idea but it was administered in such a 
way that caused great concern to many people in my riding and 
across the country.  We would like to have an answer from the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, if the member will recall, 
last fall the government indicated that it would provide some 
relief to Canadians for energy costs that were anticipated to 
rise quite significantly during the winter, which of course they 
did, and especially natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was then faced with the situation of getting 
relief out to Canadians, not next winter but this past winter 
because it was this past winter when we felt that natural gas 
prices in particular would be severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the instrument we used to get that relief to 
Canadians, the government was left with basically one instrument 
and that was to get the rebate out through the GST rebate. Those 
who were eligible for the GST rebate in 1999 received $125 per 
individual and $250 per household.  Eleven million Canadians 
benefited from this program at a one time cost of $1.3 billion. I 
am sure the member did not read all the letters from those who 
received the cheques, but 11 million of them did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that was presented to the government was that 
looking at different alternatives involved a huge bureaucracy. 
Forms would have to be checked. People could say that they paid 
for their heat but then we would have to actually check it out. 
We would have had a huge bureaucracy.  Of the $1.3 billion that 
was available, perhaps $700 million would actually go to the 
program needs and meeting the objectives for which we were 
striving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did know that the method it used was not perfect. 
It had some risks.  However, we are quite confident that it 
reached the vast majority of Canadians who were in need. Those 
who argue that they do not pay for their heat will eventually be 
charged for it by their landlords.  I think we used the best 
instrument available to us to make sure Canadians got relief this 
past winter, not next winter.
