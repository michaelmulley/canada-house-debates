this past July it was my pleasure to host a one day forum on the 
homeless in London, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour, as part of her special assignment on 
homelessness, spent a very informative day with us in our city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wide cross-section of agencies which deal with the homeless 
described the nature of the problem in London and district. 
Several homeless people also had an opportunity to speak directly 
to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank and congratulate my colleague, the Minister of 
Labour, for her tremendous dedication and hard work in preparing 
for the government a plan of action to deal with the problem of 
homelessness.  Of course, to effect such a plan significant 
additional funding will be required in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that our current Minister of Finance will make 
this serious problem a priority for more funding so that we can 
eradicate homelessness and provide for every Canadian a proper 
home in which to live.

Speaker, this week representatives of 135 sovereign nations are 
gathered in Seattle to launch the next set of global trade 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, which exports more than 40% of its gross domestic 
product, has a vital interest in these talks, especially with 
regard to unfair subsidization of European and American 
agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitual Canadian and American protesters, most of them warmly 
dressed, well fed, middle class and comfortable, have adopted 
opposition to global commerce as their cause of the week and they 
are trying to shut down the talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how many of those sanctimonious obstructionists in 
cutesy costumes have ever shown the courage of their conviction 
by refusing to buy products from countries where labour is 
routinely exploited.  Do they buy $50 North American shirts, or 
do they go for the made in China product at $12?

</I></B></P><P <b>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is World AIDS Day, a day to pause and reflect upon 
this devastating disease and renew our resolve to overcome it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme for this year's public awareness campaign is “Listen, 
Learn, Live!”, which aims to raise awareness about the need to 
strengthen AIDS programs for children and young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the 1999 UN AIDS update, an estimated 570,000 
children aged 14 or younger became infected with HIV/AIDS 
worldwide.  Over 90% were babies born to HIV positive women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are too many children being affected by HIV/AIDS.  We must 
redouble our efforts to eradicate AIDS and to educate our young 
people about this deadly disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of the “Listen, Learn, Live!” campaign the 
Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and 
Development, in collaboration with the Canadian Public Health 
Association and the Canadian Society of International Health, 
provide parliamentarians with information on HIV/AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to visit the information

disabled, with newcomers, with the disadvantaged and the poor, 
and with people in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada has therefore 
called upon the Government of Canada to offer concrete 
encouragement to volunteer action.  This concern confirms the 
great importance we attach to the two fundamental values 
underlying the Liberal program: equity and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the communities of my riding, and Cowansville in 
particular, represented here today by its mayor, for their

this evening at which the paintings of Lise de Maisonneuve will 
be offered for sale, with part of the proceeds going to these

loved ones, will now have two resources available to them in 
Laval.

AIDS, including 54,000 Canadians, and another 6 million join 
their ranks every year, among them over 4,000 Canadians.  There 
are already close to 120 known cases in Laval.

Laval and Maison Dominique make it possible for victims to lead 
more normal lives and for them and their loved ones to better 
cope with what is happening to them.

democratic meeting on the Nisga'a agreement in Vancouver 
sponsored by the official opposition.

condemning the government's mishandling of employment insurance, 
particularly the payroll taxes that support it.  He says “parliament 
and the public are left to speculate about the factors driving 
decisions concerning one of the government's largest and most 
visible programs”.  They are left to speculate because the 
government is imposing payroll taxes far higher than those 
required to support the program.

almost $100 more than the gasoline, and the government says it is

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
speak to Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian Tourism 
Commission, and I want to do so because, unfortunately, we are 
once again looking at a bill that is a shocking example of 
duplication. 
The purpose of the bill is to enhance federal visibility in a 
sector that clearly falls within Quebec's jurisdiction.  It is a 
sector of Quebec that is extremely well organized and that is 
working well, because the stakeholders work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill accomplish? It establishes a Canadian Tourism 
Commission.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill clearly states, this Canadian Tourism Commission is 
a corporation.  And what is it being established to do? What are 
its objects?  The bill states, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) sustain a vibrant and profitable Canadian tourism industry; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that this initial objective is a complete 
mystery to me. 
Since when is it the business of a crown corporation to “sustain 
a vibrant and profitable” industry?  Enough has been said in 
this House and elsewhere that it should be clear that private 
businesses, whatever their size, will, through their own 
efforts, find a way to become vibrant and profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's role is to support them through measures that 
are not specific to any one industry, but that apply generally 
to all industries, as does the Small Business Loans Act, or 
Technology Partnerships Canada, in the case of federal measures. 
There are many other measures that are available in the 
provinces and in Quebec to support investment and help identify 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why our colleagues on this side, to the right, that is 
the members of the Reform Party, are not surprised that the 
first object of the commission, as a crown corporation, is to 
sustain “a vibrant and profitable Canadian tourism industry”. 
Except for that first one, all the other objects, and I will 
read them, are already covered by Quebec law. And if there are 
similar laws in the other provinces, these objects must also be 
included in them. What are the other objects? They read, and I 
quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) market Canada as a desirable tourist destination; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the Quebec law says “market Quebec 
as a desirable tourist destination”. Quebec is indeed a 
desirable tourist destination. What is the next object? It 
reads, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) support a cooperative relationship between the private 
sector and the governments of Canada, the provinces and the 
territories with respect to Canadian tourism; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To co-operate is also an important object of Tourisme Québec, 
which is in a position to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the last object reads, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) provide information about Canadian tourism— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, it is information about Quebec tourism.

provinces and the territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading this, we must ask ourselves the question: What is the 
mandate of Tourisme Québec? Its mandate is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to guide and co-ordinate public and private initiatives 
regarding tourism; to develop a knowledge of tourism products 
and of tourists; to support the improvement and development of 
Quebec's tourist supply; to organize and support the promotion 
of Quebec and of its tourism products on the various markets; to 
inform clients on tourism products in Quebec; to build and 
operate public facilities for tourism. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, Tourisme Québec has a broader mandate, but it 
includes all the mandates given to that corporation, which would 
be known as the Canadian Tourism Commission. Frankly, why is the 
government getting involved in this area?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the government is saying that there was already a 
commission, but it did not have the same status.  It is not for 
nothing that the government is suddenly transforming it into a 
crown corporation, with its own legislation, that will report to 
the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at this bill, I have to wonder: Why is the 
government again bringing us such duplication?  How will it 
co-ordinate on a Canada-wide basis what is already extremely well 
co-ordinated within Quebec?  Why is it bent on having a Canadian 
Tourism Commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the preamble and I think I have it figured out. 
This will come as a surprise.  This is the Canadian Tourism 
Commission we are talking about.   The preamble starts out as 
follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identity and integrity of Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I nearly fell off my chair.  I will read it again “the 
Canadian tourism industry is vital to the [—] identity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be identity problems if the government pushes ahead 
with its plans for a Canadian Tourism Commission.  It does not 
trust Quebec, Alberta or British Columbia to look after their 
own tourist industry. 
Programs need to be co-ordinated in order to make the most of the 
funds available.  That is fine.  We know, however, that there 
are tourism targets for each of the provinces.  Each has its 
interests and its own attractions.  But now we hear that “the 
Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and cultural 
identity and integrity of Canada”.  Frankly, it take's one's 
breath away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is beginning to make less and less sense.  I have read 
several reports of a task force set up by the former Clerk of 
the Privy Council to prepare Canada for 2005, and several 
references are made to Canadians' serious identity problem.  I 
saw it mentioned more than once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebecers, it was both disturbing and surprising to read, 
page after page, how much the Canadian identity would be 
threatened by the fact that our economic links would be more on 
a north-south axis, by the fact that a vast majority of Canadians 
would watch American television programs, and so on and so 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think it is going much too far to perceive the problem as 
so serious that the Canadian tourist industry should be 
considered an essential component of that identity. This kind of 
exaggeration baffles the mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning this first part of the preamble, it is easy to 
understand that Tourisme Québec does not want to give rise to 
identity squabbles, but simply sell a distinctive tourist 
destination. Tourisme Québec is banking on Quebec's difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of Quebec City, which was founded in 1608 by 
Champlain and is the national capital of Quebecers. We are proud 
of our past. And we encourage tourists to come and visit us in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that, from now on, Quebec's invitation to 
tourists should be sent via Ottawa, and that we should invite 
them to come and visit “la belle province”? Is that the basic 
tenet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be, because Canada does not have the means to stop 
Quebec from selling its own tourist attractions. But one thing 
is for sure: this will create a great deal of confusion. 
Instead of ensuring better co-ordination, the bill will be 
confusing for many businesses that work perfectly well with 
Tourisme Québec. They will not know who to turn to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from improving the opportunities for Quebec's tourist 
industry, which is a very major one, the bill could prevent this 
from happening and could even be harmful to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot leave the first paragraph of the preamble without 
adding, at the very least, that it is extremely irritating and 
annoying to see how on the merest details—not to mention basic 
rights—concerning tourism, we must once again wage a battle to 
make the government understand that we can take care of this on 
our own in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we can discuss with the other provinces, but this is 
not the issue here. When a national commission, a big crown 
corporation, with a budget we do not even talk about, is given the 
same powers as Tourisme Québec, this can only be called 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states also that the Canadian tourism industry makes an 
essential contribution to the economic well-being of Canadians; 
this is also true for Quebec. And we believe that the better we 
are organized in Quebec, the better Tourisme Québec can fulfil 
its mandate, and that the more the federal government gives to 
the provinces in terms of adequate transfers, the more we will 
be able to develop our tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the federal government would use its large 
surpluses to give to the Canadian tourism commission funds that 
would otherwise not go to the provinces, to Quebec? If that is 
the case, this is utterly shameful. The federal government is 
misusing its spending power, and this means that all the 
structures we set up, which are begining to work well, all the 
preparation, all the consensus building could be bypassed or, as 
I have already said, duplicated by the Canadian tourism 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that there are regional tourist associations 
and that each one must produce a plan. This system works. There 
are discussions in each region. Not everybody agrees on 
priorities, but that is to be expected, because that is what 
consensus building is all about. People make concessions to 
reach a consensus. It is a remarkable effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last part of the preamble states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas it is desirable to strengthen Canada's commitment to 
Canadian tourism by establishing a Tourism Commission that would 
work with the governments of the provinces and the territories—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois strongly opposes the bill because it will 
create duplication and is useless. It even borders on the 
counterproductive, because duplication is counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always better to have clear priorities. It is always 
better to have one strategy than two. This is true for economic 
development. Not a single company could survive with two 
strategies. An industry, tourism in particular, must have one 
strategy and only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are morally tired—I think that is the most accurate way I 
can put it this afternoon—of the constant desire of the 
government to encroach, to centralize, to bandy “Canada, Canada, 
Canada, Canada, Canada” about everywhere, and of reading that 
Canada's tourism industry is essential to Canada's identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tired, as a Quebecer and at the age I have reached, of 
hearing, day in and day out in the House, especially on days 
like this one, that this country clearly has no time for the 
people of Quebec, who are proud to be a people and who want to 
get themselves organized.  There is no room for them either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the throes of a full constitutional debate revived by 
the Prime Minister. He says he wants to get on with other 
things, but he has revived the constitutional debate. The truth 
is we think they want to stick us in a corner and stamp the word 
Canada on us.  They would tolerate La Belle Province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, a people is in the process of being forged, 
forged in adversity. It is an independent, a distinct and proud 
people increasingly capable of achievement and increasingly 
aware that Canada is a yoke they want to put on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, not everyone speaks of this all the time in the buses 
and the metro, but one cannot stretch the elastic too for before 
it flies back into the face of the person holding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude.  I think I have said the main things I wanted 
to say.  This bill is an example of what must not be done.  If 
the government really wants to have it for the other nine 
provinces, let it include the right to opt out.  If there is 
money, it should be left to Quebec.  But the government must 
stop trying to force us into a model we do not want, when we 
have one that works.

creating something.  This was already there.  We are simply fine 
tuning it to crown corporation status, which is basically what 
all the stakeholders asked, including Quebec, which is granted a

collectively we can market not only the beautiful province of

knows full well that I know there is a commission.  I mentioned 
it in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am emphasizing is that there is a good reason for making 
changes to it.  All the mandates given to the commission—and he 
should be sensitive to this—apart from the first, which is 
unacceptable for a crown agency, are mandates already being 
carried out by Tourisme Québec.

vibrant and profitable Canadian tourism industry.  Come on. 
Support the industry, yes, do as Quebec has and do blanket

profitable.  That has never been the mandate of any crown 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other mandates, they are the jurisdiction of Tourisme

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mercier talked about duplication of effort and 
abuse of federal spending power.  I would like her to elaborate 
on how this is an abuse of federal spending power.  I am sure she 
has a couple of examples to elucidate that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said is that, if the 
government makes use of this commission to invest money that 
would not be used elsewhere, everything they want to do with 
this commission, everything in its mandate, is already being 
done in Quebec, where tourism is organized around a 
collaborative effort.  What is lacking, as it is in the fields 
of education and health, is money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a commission is established and money is put into it, this is 
going to derail the process.  That is what I have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is abusive, because this is an area that 
must prosper.  The economy is involved, deeply involved. 
Tourism is a $5.4 billion industry in Quebec, far from 
negligible.  It ranks sixth in terms of exports, and is 
therefore an important industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought 
you were boycotting me. I was getting scared; I was surprised 
because this is not a habit of yours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a two tiered question for my hon. colleague, our critic 
for foreign affairs, something it is important to remind the 
House of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she does some excellent work and has to represent Quebec 
and the sovereignist movement all over the world. She has had 
the opportunity on several occasions to visit embassies abroad, 
where there are often offices of the Canadian tourism 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to tell us a little about how she sees things. 
When she visited these offices, what was the image of Quebec 
shown abroad? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago, I was the critic for international trade, I 
also had the privilege to visit these offices. Canada is a big 
country and when one tries to promote tourism for almost all the 
provinces, some of them are left aside, and it happened quite 
often that I saw little or no information about Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make another comment. By trying to 
repatriate everything to the federal level—I have seen this in 
different English provinces—does the federal government not 
give quite clearly the impression that provincial jurisdictions 
are second class jurisdictions, that it is the one who has to do 
the real work and leave minor details and trivia to local 
authorities, which are expected to carry out the orders taken by 
the superior minds, as they see it, in the central government?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the government's bills smack of its smug attitude toward all 
institutions. As the hon. member for Mercier said quite clearly, 
in Quebec, there is another example of a principle that works. 
Tourisme Québec has been around for a very long time. It has 
developed through regional divisions, and this is working. I 
would like to hear the hon. member on these two issues. 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer 
the second question first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member and this will not come as a surprise to 
him.  The impression we glean from what was said over and over 
again in this place is that the federal government always does 
everything better.  It is said to be the government of all the 
provinces for some reason or other; perhaps because it is 
bigger.  This would apparently make it the real government. 
That is contrary to a federal system that is truly based on the 
participation of all of its components, which are each the best 
at what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a federation starts thinking that the central government is 
the only one able to do everything, it is on the verge of 
shifting from being a federation to having a central government 
with the others becoming regional governments. 
This reflects more closely what I am seeing take shape in 
Canada: a large central government with regions.  We can even 
think that this might be the fate of the Canadian federation if 
Quebec were to become an associated partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the first question is concerned, my colleague has been 
involved in international trade issues longer than I have.  I 
only visited very briefly a few embassies, but each time, I make 
sure to monitor closely how products from Quebec are faring.

</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the bill we are debating concerns the Canadian Tourism 
Commission.  It will change the legal status of the Canadian 
Tourism Commission from that of a special operating agency to 
that of a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words “crown corporation” raise the anxiety level in the 
House when heard by some, because from time to time we have taken 
a close look at some crown corporations.  We have put them under 
close scrutiny because of their lack of management skills. 
Canada Post comes to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some argue that if we are ever to get Canada Post moving into 
the 21st century we will have to make it a private entity which 
will no longer operate under legislation concerning crown 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the member was here during the Air Canada debate when 
it was changed from a crown agency, put on the market and bought 
by shareholders.  As well, Petro-Canada was a crown agency which 
was privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information we have received from our researchers tells us that 
in 1997-98 the Canadian Tourism Commission spent $146 million. 
Of that, $63 million came from the federal government and $83 
million from private sector partners.  Most of the budget was 
spent on marketing, with smaller amounts being spent on 
administration, research and product development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is arguing, not the commission, that the 
commission does not have enough autonomy.  When we are talking 
about autonomy, we are actually talking about the decision to 
chart its own destiny or set its own course.  However, there is 
nothing in the bill that would lead me to believe that there will 
be more autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission will be structured like a crown corporation and 
will be at arm's length from the government.  However, knowing the 
government, we will probably be standing in this place in the 
near future talking about the privatization of this very agency 
once the private sector gets to examine this so-called autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission will be set up in such a way that the chairperson 
will be appointed by who?  Will it be by private sector 
interests?  No.  The governor in council, meaning the Prime 
Minister of Canada, will pick the chairperson of the commission. 
What does that tell us about autonomy?  He or she will be under 
the callous hands of the Prime Minister within six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of this new organization, believe it or not, will 
be appointed by, who else?  The Prime Minister of Canada, the 
governor in council.  There is not much distance between the new 
president, the new chairperson and the Prime Minister and the 
cabinet.  It goes back to my opening comments in terms of 
autonomy.  I cannot see much autonomy there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us further read the bill.  The question I would ask is 
whether anyone in the House has read the bill.  I  mention that 
because today during petitions at least two NDP members, God 
bless their souls, presented petitions with regard to the Senate. 
I do not agree entirely with their position on the Senate but 
they are talking about an organization that is appointed by the 
Prime Minister of Canada.  Talk about accountability.  I know 
what the Bloc members are saying about the bill, but I think the 
bill requires close scrutiny.  I hope the NDP members take a look 
at clause 9 on page 3 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone from the chairperson to the president.  What else 
happens in any kind of a commission?  The next logical jump would 
be to the directors, would it not?   Where would the directors 
come from?  I know we do not dare to say it out loud, but they 
are appointed by the minister with the approval of the Prime 
Minister.  Talk about autonomy.  Does anyone see any autonomy in 
the bill, any distance from the Prime Minister's office?  For the 
love of me, I cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument is that one of the reasons the government wants to 
move it out of the department is because the department comes 
under the purview of the Public Service Administration Act.  In 
other words, we have civil servants who are not quite as easy to 
push around as appointed folks.  When push comes to shove, who 
will the commission be listening to or taking directions from?  I 
suggest it will be the Prime Minister of Canada and his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first bill to come to the House in the last 
couple of weeks, which leads me to believe that we are heading 
for an election probably sooner than later.  The other bill that 
is before us is the Canadian institutes of health research. 
It is the same situation from the president on down.  All the 
members of the advisory board are appointed by, who else?  The 
old Prime Minister of Canada himself.  Sir John A. Macdonald 
would roll over in his grave if he knew that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we not moved somewhere beyond the point where every member 
of a commission or a board is appointed by one man and by one man 
only?  That is the argument the NDP uses with regard to the 
senate.  It is somewhat the same argument that the Reformers use 
with regard to the Senate.  We are not all fundamentally opposed 
to the Senate.  Most of us would like to reform the Senate, but 
the Canadian people should have a choice.  However, surely there 
has to be a better way of doing it than this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ain't all, as they would say back home.  These appointments 
are all by pleasure.  Mr. Speaker, do you know what pleasure 
means?  It means that when the Prime Minister wakes up in the 
morning and decides he still likes you, then you are still there. 
If he gets out on the wrong side of the bed, then you are gone. 
You are history.  There is no autonomy in that.  There is no 
arm's length from government in that type of institution.  We see 
it over there on the back benches of the Liberal party. The Prime 
Minister says “jump” and the members say “how high”, or the 
Prime Minister says “don't come down until I tell you to”. That 
is exactly what will happen with this board, and I do not like 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at their remuneration.  We always start at 
the top with the president and then work down through.  The 
president will be paid the remuneration that the governor in 
council may fix.  The Prime Minister of Canada will determine 
what this person makes.  Not only that, he will determine how 
long he or she will collect his or her paycheque. The chairperson 
and the private sector directors, other than the president, shall 
be paid the fees that the governor in council may fix.  It is the 
same thing.  Governor in council is a fancy word for the Prime 
Minister of Canada.  It is basically the Prime Minister and 
cabinet making a decision, but it is one man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the debate that is raging now in the House between the 
Prime Minister and the premier of Quebec on the 50 plus one and 
his stance in regard to any constitutional initiative on Quebec 
and the referendum.  That is a one man decision.  It is a one man 
band leading the way down through the town with not too many 
followers even from his own cabinet, which is sort of a suicidal 
march. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am getting off the topic, but there has to be a better 
way to do this.  We are moving into the new millennium.  We are 
moving into the 21st century and we are still using the outdated 
institutions of the past to proceed into a new century.  If we 
are talking about reform in the House, it could start right here 
when we are debating bills like this.

invented, and I brought this out yesterday in committee, is the 
structure. 
In the United States, the public and members of the legislative 
bodies, senators and members of the House of Representatives, 
have some input into who goes on those boards or institutes. In 
Canada, the Minister of Health introduced a bill a week ago 
today, Bill C-13, structured in the same fashion as the bill we 
are talking about today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody argues that we have to pay attention to tourism in the 
country.  It is a big generator of jobs.  What scares many of us 
in the House is that the government is going to politicize the 
very commission that is asking for more autonomy, if we can 
believe what the government is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there will be any autonomy or any arm's length 
relationship from government.  I think we will have the strong 
hand of the Government of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, 
over this commission.  This bill has serious flaws that have to 
be addressed either in the House or in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to run in the face of motherhood.  This is sort of 
like a motherhood bill.  This is what the government is talking 
about.  It is all good in the eyes of the government.  There is 
nothing negative here.  This is a good news bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go through some of the points that we might argue are 
good news.  The commission may establish a head office anywhere 
in Canada.  That is fine, but what about Chicoutimi as a head 
office?  What would be the chances of Chicoutimi being the head 
office of this new commission?  I am just thinking out loud, but 
being in the Prime Minister's hometown I think it would have a 
pretty good kick at the can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission may not finance, acquire or construct facilities 
related to tourism.  That is a good point.  In other words, it 
will not be able to turn the Prime Minister's summer home into a 
hotel.  That is good news, unless the Minister for Human 
Resources Development Canada gets her hands on the application. 
Maybe then it can do that.  Anything is possible in the Prime 
Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission may enter into agreements with other governments. 
That is fine.  It may create new corporations as a result of 
these agreements.  So it does not end here.  There must be a 
hidden clause in there that even I might have missed under close 
scrutiny.  It may create new corporations as a result of those 
agreements as long as they are consistent with its mandate and do 
not involve financing or construction of tourism facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's annual corporate plan will be approved by the 
ministers of industry and the treasury board.  That is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there is a mechanism in here, which I did not see in the 
bill, where the commission has to actually come before the House 
and the auditor general for scrutiny.  I hope there is a 
provision in the bill where it does have to table a report 
annually on the floor of the House of Commons.  I do not see it 
in there, but I will ask my colleagues in the NDP, the Bloc, the 
Reform and the Conservative Parties to search through the bill 
while I am on my feet.  I did not see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors will continue to have up to 26 
representatives.  Goodness gracious, that is almost a quarter of 
the appointments that the Prime Minister gets to make in the 
Senate. Imagine, 26 new appointments.  On the eve of an election, 
it sounds good does it not, Mr. Speaker?  I would not be 
surprised if you were appointed to that board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we have the chairperson and the president 
and up to 16 private sector directors in six regions.  I did go 
through how that is going to be apportioned, and I think some 
members have a problem with that, as I guess they should.  These 
will be appointed, as I mentioned before, by the minister on the 
advice of the board or the committee.  There will be one director 
representing the provincial governments in each of the six 
regions.  The president, the chair and the directors will all 
serve at pleasure. 
That means as long as the Prime Minister of Canada is happy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have witnessed what has happened in some government 
departments and agencies when the Prime Minister and a particular 
minister are not happy with them.  I am not talking about not 
doing their jobs or not showing up for the job.  I am talking 
about civil servants, some of them senior civil servants, who 
just happen to disagree with the government.  The Prime Minister 
has taken the baseball bat to their kneecaps on occasion simply 
to get rid of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not exaggerating.  I have mentioned names in the House of 
individuals who have had longstanding, long ongoing battles with 
the government.  In fact, some of them have taken it to the Human 
Rights Commission and won their cases.  These are people who are 
protected by the Civil Service Act.  This new commission, no 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this new commission is ripe for political manipulation. 
I think the House deserves closer scrutiny and more debate on the 
bill.  I do not think it is a bill that can simply be rammed 
through the House.  I call on every member in the House to read 
this bill clause by clause and stand up on their hind legs and 
argue for a new and better way of doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the bill deserves more scrutiny than what it is getting. 
I do not think we can simply give the government a blank cheque 
based on its performance with commissions and boards like this in 
the past.  Let us intelligently debate this in committee, bring 
forth some amendments which the government might consider and 
improve this bill before we get to third and final reading.

commend my hon. colleague for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about tourism, there is one very important thing 
that we have to keep in mind, which is the fact that there are 
several different regions in this vast country of Canada as well 
as in Quebec, and there is a competitive element involved. A 
number of regions are increasingly trying to attract more 
tourists. These regions are not all the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the federal government wants to gain control of 
tourism, it could very easily end up discriminating in favour of 
some regions and against others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what my hon. colleague thinks about the 
possibility that the federal government might do what it did in 
terms of regional development and discriminate in favour of one 
region and against another, as has too often been the case in 
Quebec. What does the hon. member think about a government, 
which has often chosen to promote some regions and ignore 
others, getting involved in tourism? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that just shows that 
great minds think alike.  I think the hon. member's point is 
worth noting.  That is in fact what can happen because they can 
politicize this commission.  We must think about that, 103 
members of parliament in Ontario alone.  One has to win the 
province of Ontario to form the government in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be stretching it, but can we not envision the Prime 
Minister looking at political opportunity and using this 
commission to his best advantage in terms of where to put the 
advertising dollars and what portions of the country to promote. 
Obviously, there is not support in every province. 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. George Proud:</B>  I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Good point.  Nova Scotia, which is the

directly in tourism in Canada.  What is the multiplier?  It would 
be at least a multiplier of four or five, a big engine of 
economic growth in Atlantic Canada and other parts of Canada as 
well. The member's point is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very clear risk when we have the directors and the 
president of the commission appointed by the Prime Minister of 
Canada. That is a very strong possibility.  That is a point well 
taken.  That has to be considered when we are looking at 
amendments to this bill.  There must be a better way to set up 
this organization rather than having one man dictate who the 
members will be.  That individual would be the Prime Minister of 
Canada and he would be dictating who would be on the commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-5, an 
act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what the member had to say. He touched a 
bit on the constitutional issue, as he was supposed to do, 
openly criticizing, as his party did, the Prime Minister's 
attitude with regard to referendum rules, and I congratulate him 
for that. 
Saying that the rules should be different from those applied in 
past referendums on the political future of Quebec and Canada is 
a serious attack on democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of tourism, I would also like to know if the member 
thinks that the federal government is once again trying to 
interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction, not only in 
Quebec but in other provinces as well, and that, by doing so, it 
is breaking another one of its commitments, namely the 
commitment to withdraw from the tourism sector. We were told on 
several occasions that tourism was a provincial jurisdiction.

tourism should be exclusively under provincial jurisdiction.

role for the federal government in tourism.  I do not question 
the need for that role as custodians for the entire country.  I 
am not arguing that point.

are debating here today.  I do not believe that that will lead to 
good management practices.  I think it can lead to political 
manipulation, if you wish, in every province including the 
province of Quebec.  On that basis, I do not support the 
construction as laid out in this design paper we have before us 
entitled Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it could be taken back to the drawing board, keeping in 
mind that there is a significant role in tourism for the federal

an act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by taking this opportunity to acknowledge 
the great growth of the Canadian tourism market over the past 
number of years.  In many parts of the country, tourism accounts 
for perhaps fourth or third, sometimes even second or first, 
among the industries that produce dollars.  From the 
unique locations that have a story to tell, the many historical 
points across this land of ours, to the remote locations of 
ecotourism, Canada has a lot to offer the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All across the country there are tourism boards which are mainly 
made up of volunteers looking to promote their own local 
highlights.  From small town Saskatchewan to urban Montreal and 
all the points east, west, north and south the country has much 
to offer.  We ought to be exploiting the scenic beauty and the 
many historical sites around the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take some time to read into the record this afternoon a 
bit about the community in which I live.  The story of Chemainus, 
British Columbia, is one of the success of tourism in the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who do not know where Chemainus is located ought to know. 
It is located about one hour north of Victoria, British Columbia, 
on beautiful Vancouver Island.  Many people are looking forward 
to making that part of the country their final destination.  It 
is a great place to live and I suspect, although I do not know 
yet, that it is probably a good place to die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local tourism information centre describes the history of 
Chemainus as a small town having relied for over 100 years on the 
lumber industry for its existence.  In 1980 concern about 
MacMillan Bloedel's inevitable downsizing prompted the community 
to begin discussions on revitalizing the downtown core, with the 
hope of developing some form of tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking advantage of a provincial downtown revitalization 
program, the town fathers developed a business improvement plan 
now known as the mural project.  They recommended painting large, 
high quality murals depicting the logging and lumber history of 
Chemainus on the exterior walls of various buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first mural was painted in 1982 by Vancouver Island artist 
Frank Lewis.  These amazing professionally painted murals, all 
painted from authentic historical photos of the settlers, vividly 
depict the history of the Chemainus valley including the forest 
industry and first nations chiefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the magnificent murals Chemainus now boasts a new 
270 seat family dinner theatre, many fascinating shops, and is 
home to many talented artisans.  By the third year it was 
estimated that the murals were attracting somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of 15,000 tourists.  Today over 400,000 people 
visit Chemainus annually to see the 33 world famous murals.  A 
sign on the edge of town reads “Welcome to the community that is 
known as the little town that did”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chemainus is a success story of determination, courage and 
vision.  For over 100 years the town had solely depended on the 
forest industry for its existence.  Confronted with the 
downsizing of the forest industry in the early 1980s, the 
community began embarking on the transition to diversify its 
economy.  Along with the city fathers there was one man who was 
the driving force behind the original Chemainus mural project, 
Karl Shultz.  Many people could learn a lot from Karl.  His credo 
is never let those who say it cannot be done stand in the way of 
those who are doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people looked at Chemainus in those days and declared that 
turning the town into an outdoor art gallery simply could not and 
should not be done.  Fortunately the people who were busy trying 
to do it were too busy to get discouraged.  That is why Chemainus 
is known today as the little town that did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During this transition Chemainus went from a 120 year old sawmill 
town with no tourists in 1981 to a thriving tourist destination 
with over 450,000 tourists by the year 1988, and from 40 local 
businesses to over 300 today.  Chemainus has gone from being left 
off the maps of the world to becoming internationally famous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine that municipal revenues have more than 
tripled what they were a little over a decade ago.  From the work 
of one man to a dedicated group of community minded volunteers 
Chemainus is indeed the little town that did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chemainus received the prestigious British Airways Tourism for 
Tomorrow Award for the Americas in London, England.  It was 
featured on radio with 1.5 million listeners hearing the story on 
the British travel TV show <I>Wish You Were Here</I>.  They were 
viewed by 15 million people and appeared in the London 
<I>Times</I> with a readership of 3.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Japan the popular quiz show <I>Naruhodo the World</I>, with 10 
million viewers, featured the Chemainus Art Gallery.  As well 
there was an eight page article in the May 1994 issue of the 
<I>Smithsonian Magazine</i>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one small town with one story to tell in the 
tourist industry across Canada.  It is what the dream and 
determination of dedicated people coming together in a common 
cause can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chemainus is a prime example of the success of entrepreneurial 
spirit that captures the heart and soul of many Canadians across 
the country today.  In fact, many Canadians have come to the 
conclusion that if we do not do it, it will not get done.  That 
is simply the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the midst of speaking about the bill I ask why there is the 
need to have one more crown corporation to do the work being done 
so well by groups of people like the citizens of Chemainus.  I 
have no doubt that the Canadian Tourism Commission plays an 
important role at the international level, but I really wonder 
whether it is the government's business to be involved in such 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I concerned?  Simply put, it comes down to who can 
perform the task best and at what financial cost.  If we go over 
the history of Canada, the involvement of the Canadian government 
in the economic life of the country and the stories that are told 
about government crown corporations, surely we will learn some 
lessons from the past.  Whether crown corporations are federal or 
provincial, over a period of years their budgets and 
bureaucracies are virtually out of control.  It is certainly out 
of the control of the ordinary Canadian taxpayer who ends up 
funding these projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors is now largely made up of private 
industry members.  It is in their best interest to continue to 
promote Canada as a tourist destination.  Why not simply let them 
continue doing the job without the apron strings of government? 
Let them do what they can do best.  We have the obvious example 
of the Chemainus success story.  Surely it can be repeated over 
and over and over again across the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my colleagues and I in the official opposition firmly 
support the creation of efficiency in government and the delivery 
of government programs, I cannot support the move to establish 
the Canadian Tourist Commission as a crown corporation.

accountability of its tax dollars at work, we should not be 
allowing the creation of another crown corporation which does not 
have the need to come before parliament to account for how it 
spends its money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues in the House have already pointed out the 
problem of too much political influence by the government in 
crown corporations.  That political influence starts right at the 
Prime Minister's Office.  It goes down through the various 
departments and their ministers to the grassroots.  Before we 
know it power is vested in a small group of people taking control 
of all crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have a situation where the Prime Minister's Office 
has far too much power.  Are Canadian taxpayers aware that the 
Prime Minister's Office has the power to make over 5,000 
appointments from supreme court justices to senators in the other 
house and down through parliamentary secretaries to members of 
committees?  It goes on and on.  We have vested far too much 
power in the hands of a few.  Crown corporations are just another 
way of keeping a tight rein on that power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have shown with my hometown of Chemainus, local businesses 
and municipal leaders have been able to take what was a desperate 
situation in the early 1980s and turn the community into an 
international success story.  I invite members to join me next 
summer in Chemainus to see what the private sector can do and see 
what real success and community pride are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission could learn a lot from 
Chemainus.  The government could learn a lot from the little town 
that did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the story of Chemainus.  It sounds like a 
wonderful place.  I would be happy to visit it some day.  We have 
these points of light across the country.  It is a great country 
to visit.  Yet, when I travel abroad we are seen as a country 
that plays at tourism.  We do not treat it with all the respect 
that it perhaps needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission and its predecessor are all relatively new.  I 
remember when the commission first started a number of years ago. 
The Canadian government as a federal jurisdiction basically 
withdrew from these areas and Canadian tourism shrunk 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Realistically the hon. member knows that people will not simply 
come from Europe to visit Chemainus.  They will visit many other 
tourist areas in the country.  If there is one thing the 
government can do effectively, it can co-ordinate tourist areas 
to find destinations to which people want to travel and designate 
marketing areas, for instance the European Union, southeast Asia 
and so forth, in which to tell our story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in one problem we have with the European Union 
because I am interested in the area of trade.  The European Union 
still thinks that in Canada we mine and cut down trees.  It is 
very important, not only for tourism but for trade, that we 
change that image or vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the member.  He seems to feel that if we 
privatize everything industry will know best. 
I can tell the member that if industry knew best it would have 
done this years ago, but it did not.  It has failed to coalesce 
those areas in our country and market them as a country, rather 
than just Chemainus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>His party is fixated on the idea of privatizing everything, that 
somehow if we give it over to private industry it will know best, 
and maybe it will in some ways.  However, what we will find is 
that the big players will benefit, the airlines and the 
international hotels, and not the Chemainuses of this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not see the importance of having a national 
tourism authority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about accountability.  I am very sensitive to that as 
well.  However, the commission will come under the Financial 
Administration Act.  The auditor general will audit the books of 
the crown corporation, and there are ways to make crown 
corporations efficient and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think there is a good use for this and that 
Chemainus will be better off if we have a crown corporation set 
up for tourism? 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Reed Elley:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his questions.  I am sure he will not be offended if I correct 
his pronunciation of my hometown.  It is Chemainus.  Seamus is 
that Irish character from a different land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between my hon. colleague and myself there is obviously a 
fundamental difference in philosophy and approach.  We in this 
party believe very strongly in free enterprise, that people who 
are motivated by low tax regimes and opportunities for business 
create a good business climate.  They make the best decisions and 
do the right things in terms of driving the economy of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government does not drive the economy of the country.  Big 
business does not really drive the economy.  What drives the 
economy are thousands of small businessmen across the nation, 
entrepreneurial in nature and outlook, who take hold of an idea 
and run with it.  They are the ones who are closest to the ground 
and to the delivery of services.  They are the ones who know best 
how to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my colleague that in the little town of 
Chemainus, of the 450,000 visitors who come each year, the 
highest number come from Japan and the second highest number come 
from Germany, an Asian nation and a European nation.  Obviously 
the people of Chemainus and their little tourism group have done 
their work.  They have been overseas to visit these markets. 
They have done their work and they have attracted people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why that experience cannot be duplicated right 
across the country.  My contention still remains that if we get 
government involved in things like crown corporations, sooner or 
later they rob people of initiative at the grassroots level by 
trying to do the job in a huge way that can be best done locally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and I have a fundamental difference, and I guess we 
will both have to live with it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague for his most passionate 
speech about his hometown of Chemainus.  I can tell by the 
twinkle in your eye, Mr. Speaker, that you will be booking your 
next vacation to Chemainus.  I know that warms the heart of my 
hon. colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague spoke quite eloquently about his hometown and all 
the hard work that has been done to create this thriving tourism 
hot spot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to my hon. colleague yesterday who made a similar 
speech on this topic, when it comes to the level of jurisdiction, 
I believe there is a role for all three levels of government, the 
municipal, provincial and federal government, in promoting 
tourism.  Obviously tourism falls into provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague think we could respect a balance between 
the provinces and the federal government in the role of promoting 
tourism in light of these changes? 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Reed Elley:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
and the good wishes of my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very big issue across Canada.  We have spoken about 
provincial jurisdiction, referenda and possible threats of 
breaking up the country in the House every day this week and last 
week.  This is a very important issue in terms of the kind of 
roles the provinces and the federal government play in areas like 
tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have a fundamental difference with our Liberal 
colleagues on this issue.  Reformers do not want to play the role 
of big brother from a federal perspective.  We want to play the 
role of brothers and sisters equally across the country. The 
provincial prerogative to deliver services should be left to the 
provinces because those services can better be delivered at the 
local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Reform Party in the last year or so has put 
forth the one Canada proposal.  We call it “La Troisième Voie”. 
It is a third way of looking at this.  There should be equality 
among provinces.  Perhaps we could return to some of the original 
concepts that this great nation was built on, such as allowing 
the provinces to do those things which were guaranteed.  Over the 
years the federal government, playing big brother, has taken them 
away.  Health care is one of them, and now look at the state we 
are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to return to the fundamental reasons for which this 
country was built and create again a sense of equality so that we 
can walk side by side with our heads held high and keep this 
country together, united in the areas that make us great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is basically a provincial responsibility and the federal 
government should stay out of it as much as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</b> Mr. Speaker, I think we are debating an 
extremely important matter.  I call for a quorum count.

</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-5, an act to 
establish the Canadian Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several of my colleagues have already explained the Bloc 
Quebecois' view of the bill.  The bill can be summed up as 
follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It creates a sort of crown corporation, to be known as the 
Canadian Tourism Commission.  If we look at the summary which 
appears at the beginning of the bill, and again in clause 5, we 
read that the commission's objects are to: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(</I>a<I>) sustain a vibrant and profitable Canadian tourism industry; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(</I>b<I>) market Canada as a desirable tourist destination; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(</I>c<I>) support a cooperative relationship between the private 
sector and the governments of Canada, the provinces and the 
territories with respect to Canadian tourism; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(</I>d<I>) provide information about Canadian tourism to the private 
sector and to the governments of Canada, the provinces and the 
territories. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 Canada has had a tourism commission, although it was 
not formally instituted like the one proposed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission will have the same mandate it always did, which 
is to develop, direct, administer and implement programs to 
increase and promote tourism at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the present government, any and all means are acceptable 
when it comes to fighting Quebec sovereignty. Or, to put it 
another way, anything goes.  The end justifies the means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before, as far as we can remember, has Canada worked 
so hard at gaining visibility, at selling itself, as it has 
since the Bloc Quebecois arrived in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not much of a stretch to then conclude that one of the 
unavowed objectives of this bill is to encourage and enhance the 
visibility of the Government of Canada, and to bolster the 
spirit of national unity it holds so dear.  There may be some 
laudable intentions behind this bill, and these are expressed in 
the preamble to the bill proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Government of Canada announces 
its intention to “work with the governments of the provinces and 
the territories and the Canadian tourism industry to promote the 
interests of that industry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the majority of the “whereases” set out in the preamble 
are of such a nature as to give me pause as far as the real 
intentions of the Government of Canada are concerned.  Every 
time it gets a chance it repeats over and over again that it 
wishes to respect provincial jurisdiction, but here we have in 
writing: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identity and integrity of Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry makes an essential 
contribution...to the economic objectives of the Government of 
Canada 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such “whereases”, what about Quebec's cultural identity? What 
might happen if the economic goals of Canada and Quebec differ? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why such a bill, when the provinces, especially Quebec, already 
have their own infrastructure, their own well developed tourism 
network, and their own strategy, which is better suited to the 
needs and characteristics of their respective territories? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the needs of each province be better served by a 
Canadian tourism commission that will be expected to promote 
several competing products? How will the commission allot its 
promotion budget among various tourism products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a closer look at the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, clauses 7 to 14 provide for the organization of the board 
of directors, which will consists of not more than 26 directors. 
The Deputy Minister of Industry is, ex officio, a director of 
the commission. The chairperson, who will hold office on a part 
time basis, and the president, who will hold office on a full 
time basis, will both be appointed by the governor in council 
for a term of not more than five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the approval of the governor in council and on the advice 
of a committee established by the board of directors, the 
Minister of Industry will appoint 16 private sector directors 
for a term of not more than three years. 
Nine will be private sector representatives and seven will be 
tourism operators and represent the various regions. The 
appointment of the latter will be done in the manner prescribed 
in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is stipulated that there will be two from the 
maritimes, one from Quebec, one from Ontario, one from British 
Columbia and the Yukon, one from the provinces of Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba, and one from Alberta, the Northwest Territories 
and Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same process will be used to select private sector 
representatives who, before being appointed by the Minister of 
Industry, will first be designated by the provincial or 
territorial ministers responsible for tourism. 
These directors will either be deputy ministers or the 
equivalent or heads of provincial or territorial agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is surprising in this part of the bill is clause 11(5), which 
gives three definitions. It is obvious that the bill was drafted 
in a hurry. I would like somebody to shed some light on this for 
me some day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to look at the three definitions in clause 
11(5): private sector director, tourism operator and private 
sector representative. These three expressions are defined and 
clause 11(5) specifies that “The definitions in this subsection 
apply in this section”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read these three definitions over and over again but I 
could not make anything out of them. I do not possess the 
necessary philological knowledge to make an expert comment on 
this text, nor the expertise to compare the French and English 
definitions. Perhaps members can follow me as I go through these 
extraordinary definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private sector director is a tourism operator. A tourism 
operator is an owner or a manager of a private sector tourism 
business. The private sector director is a private sector 
representative. Why use two terms that mean the same thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really surprised. La Palisse himself could not have done 
better, and he was the expert on truisms. A private sector 
director is a private sector representative. Is this not 
obvious? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the owner or manager of a business if not a private 
sector director? Again, I do not have the answer, because this 
is the definition given. The bill says that the director is an 
operator and that the operator is an owner or a manager of a 
private sector tourism business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third definition is that of the private sector 
representative. This is quite the find: the private sector 
representative is a tourism operator. Can anyone tell me the 
difference between a private sector director who is a tourism 
operator and a private sector representative who is a tourism 
operator? How will we distinguish between the two on the board? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new element that will open the door to arbitrary 
decisions and political patronage. I must say that the English 
version of that definition sheds a different light, since it 
specifies that the person to be appointed will have to have the 
expertise required to satisfy the board's needs. This means that 
the person appointed may be someone who is really needed and not 
a person who is being rewarded for political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to conduct a clause by clause review of the 
bill and to propose amendments, it would be appropriate for the 
government to take a serious look at clause 11(5) and to make 
the necessary changes so that the definitions are, as the Prime 
Minister likes to say, very clear, very precise and mutually 
exclusive. Dictionaries exist to provide definitions which are 
usually mutually exclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a dictionary of synonyms. It is a series of 
definitions to define which people will sit on the commission's 
board and what their duties will be. Perhaps the legislator 
intends to have vague, imprecise, obscure and mutually inclusive 
definitions to be in a position to appoint friends of the 
government, regardless of their qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has its work cut out for it, because it has a bad 
habit of refusing any suggestions for amendments, however 
brilliant, from the opposition parties.  It will therefore have 
to go back to the drawing board if we are to know exactly whom 
it has in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 15 to 28 cover the other features of the bill, such as 
the duties of the chairperson and the chief executive officer, 
head office and meetings, remuneration and fees, and 
compensation.  Clause 26 specifies that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>26.(1) The Commission may enter into an agreement with the 
government of any province or territory to carry out its 
objects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, beginning with clause 29, the bill launches into a series 
of transitional provisions for transferring the activities of 
the former commission to the new one.  The last four clauses 
contain the consequential amendments to the Access to 
Information Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, 
the Financial Administration Act and, finally, the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I drew the House's attention to the fact that one act has again 
been omitted; every time a commission or agency is established, 
we want to see a specific reference to the Official Languages 
Act.  Once again, the government has left out this piece of 
legislation. 
We might once again see that translated into facts, when the 
advertizing fails to point out that tourism in Canada can be 
done in French or in English, depending on where the tourist 
registers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will claim that mentioning that act in this bill is not 
necessary since Canada is officially a bilingual country, but I 
really wish that an amendment along those lines be seriously 
considered at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have a fairly good idea of the bill's contents, let 
us see what kind of a political impact it could have. With the 
establishment of this commission, the government provides itself 
with a parallel organization that will allow it to escape 
accountability. Of course, the commission will report to 
Parliament like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
National Film Board and Telefilm Canada do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having an organization reporting to Parliament is very useful: 
all the scandals occurring are overlooked. A report is produced 
and someone opposite rises in the House and says “I have the 
honour to table, in both official languages, this report”. But 
accountability is really avoided. Parliament will be informed 
through the commission's board of directors. But the minister 
will always find a way to walk away from ministerial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are witnessing the implementation of a new way of managing 
public assets and funds. This time, a commission is created; 
last year, it was agencies: the Revenue Agency, the Canadian 
Parks Agency and the Agri-Food Agency.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What distinction does the government make between a commission 
and an agency? I did not find the answer. It is as if the 
country were asking a third party to monitor all the actions of 
its politicians. A commission or an agency is almost the 
equivalent of a contracting out system. Who will account for the 
actions of the commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that, within the limits of the Financial 
Administration Act, the commission will be given greater leeway 
to purchase the goods and services necessary for the programs 
established by the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system will make it easier to contract out consulting 
and advertising services. One can readily see that it will be 
easier for the commission to act from outside a department 
rather than from inside. Easier to operate also means easier to 
elude the control of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the Bloc's opposition to this bill, one must 
realize that, for us, Tourism Canada is a duplication of 
Tourisme Québec, which is already in place and functions very 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In several speeches made by its members and in the throne 
speech, the Liberal government promised to withdraw from 
provincial jurisdictions. This bill shows today that visibility 
comes first, regardless of the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the vision of the federal government in terms of tourism 
development really compete with the diversified and positive 
vision of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the goals of the commission and the actions it will take 
support the strategy put forward by Tourism Quebec? Can we trust 
that this commission will work at consolidating the tourism 
centres of Montreal and Quebec City when we know an agreement 
could not even be achieved on the expansion of the Palais des 
Congrès in Montreal? Yet it is the driving force of the tourism 
strategy in the greater Montreal area. How can we rely on this 
new commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater Montreal area and Quebec City play a strategic role 
in the Quebec tourism industry. They are showcasing the province 
of Quebec for the benefit of foreign markets. Montreal's 
international reputation is based on its economic and cultural 
strength. Tourism has greatly sustained and promoted this 
strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's distinctive culture has been the focus of our tourism 
strategy for many years now. Quebec has been able to 
successfully feature its cultural uniqueness through many of its 
attractions and events. Will the commission continue on that 
track? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is known for its distinct culture in North America. 
Quebec's tourism policy is based on this characteristic. Tourism 
Quebec is one of Quebec's main engines in promoting its 
distinctiveness on the world markets. Will the new commission be 
able to do the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of pushing for the federal government to get involved, 
would it not be better to financially support the provinces 
that, especially where Quebec is concerned, have proven quite 
successful in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc will vote against this bill mainly because it 
duplicates what is already being done, and quite successfully, 
in the provinces and because, on the face of it, this bill looks 
like a new propaganda tool for the Liberal government to gain 
more visibility.

</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member's intervention and speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to touch on the issue of 
accountability because that has come up a number of times in 
debate.  This comes under the Financial Administration Act. By 
doing that, it will come under the ambit of the audit of the 
auditor general.  I wonder why the member dismisses that.  The 
auditor general is fairly well respected by parliament.  In fact, 
he just gave a report the other day, accounting a number of 
areas, some of them not all that complimentary to the government 
but at the same time giving us, as parliamentarians, the ability 
to look into these organizations and recommend changes that would 
improve their efficiency and effectiveness and basically be of 
value to the taxpayers of Canada.

Québec is a very effective organization in bringing tourists to 
Quebec. Surely the member would respect the concept that when 
people travel to other countries, they often want to experience a 
multiplicity, a multifaceted experience when they visit those 
areas.  While we are a huge geographical country, it seems to me 
that if people come to Ontario, they would also like to go to 
Quebec.  The same thing when we go to the maritime provinces, we 
would like to experience Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travel to Europe, I do not just go to France 
while I am there.  Since I expended such a great amount of money 
to get there, I like to also go to other European countries.  I 
have done the same thing in Africa and India.  I would assume 
that tourists coming to Canada would like to experience the same 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the member not see tourism, a crown corporation, 
being a major benefit?  It is not a duplication in the sense that 
all those people that would have come via Tourisme Québec would 
also come from Tourism Canada.  They are identical people.  In 
fact, Quebec will benefit by the fact that there is another 
marketing tool out there, whether it is in Europe, Asia or 
the United States.  It can only be a positive thing for Quebec 
and for the rest of Canada that we complement each other in our 
tourist ventures and that we try to increase our economic 
well-being, whether it is in Quebec or Ontario, or anywhere else in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the member has such blinders on and sees this as a 
fence around Quebec and that only Quebec could possibly enjoy the 
tourist trade of people coming to Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P <b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</b> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his comment and his questions. But I would like to come back to 
certain aspects based not on theory but on experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, when we ask questions of the government, it tells us it 
cannot answer a particular question because it is a matter for 
the board of directors, whether we are talking of Telefilm 
Canada, the CBC, or another corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those crown corporations, agencies or commissions that have 
boards of directors, this is the board's primary responsibility. 
There are crown corporations like Telefilm Canada, for example, 
that escape the scrutiny of the auditor general, unlike the CBC, 
where the auditor general has the legislative mandate to conduct 
an audit every five years. This is not the case for Telefilm 
Canada or for the National Film Board, and they somehow escape 
the scrutiny of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to say that, where public finances are 
concerned, reference is made to very specific legislation. We 
must go beyond that. If we want to make absolutely sure that the 
auditor general will be able to take a close look at the 
commission's finances, it must be spelled out in the bill. 
Otherwise, he could very well not be able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it seems extremely important to me to consider all these 
questions and to find the necessary answers that will guarantee 
the kind of transparency we want, so that the commission can 
have all the credit it will certainly deserve if it helps 
Montreal get a bigger convention centre. 
</I></B></P><P <b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b> I must inform the House

</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, there are 
bills that are introduced in the House the purpose and even the 
necessity of which is easy for all to see. With other bills, we 
have reservations on a few points or even fundamental 
differences, but at least we can understand their purpose and 
significance. In this case it is exactly the opposite. Let me 
explain. It is easy to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is based on the first four paragraphs of the preamble. 
I will go through them, and members will see that, as a matter 
of fact, it is based on next to nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain. Here is the first paragraph in French: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—que l'industrie touristique canadienne est essentielle à 
l'identité et à l'intégrité sociale et culturelle du Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did members get that? The tourism industry is vital to the Canadian 
identity. What happens if the tourist industry disappears? Will 
the Canadian identity disappear too? Should we infer that it 
could not survive? This is not a mistranslation. I checked the English 
version, because I suspected a mistranslation. I could 
not believe anybody could write that the tourism industry was 
vital to Canadian unity, so I checked the English version. Here 
it is: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identity and integrity of Canada 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the tourism industry, will the social and cultural identity 
and the integrity of Canada disappear? Come on. This does not 
seem very serious. I cannot believe that it is so fragile and so 
dependent on foreign visitors. In other words, if foreigners do 
not come to see us, Canada no longer has a cultural identity and 
social integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will admit that whoever wrote this probably had a 
bad night and was somewhat out of his or her mind. It is 
unthinkable to find a whereas as hare-brained as this one, if I 
can put it that way, at the beginning of the bill. Let us get 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the second whereas, absolutely convinced that I 
would now find something substantial. 
This is what it is said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry makes an essential 
contribution to the economic well-being of Canadians and to the 
economic objectives of the Government of Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true, but not only of the tourism industry. Does this 
mean that we have to create a Canadian commission for every 
industry that makes a major contribution to the economic 
well-being of Canadians and to the economic objectives of the 
Government of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the whereas is all about. It is one of the reasons 
this bill is before us. 
If this is so important for the tourist industry, would it not 
be equally important for any other?  I have to say that I do not 
believe we could name a single industry that did not make a 
vital contribution to the economic well-being of the people who 
derive their livelihood from it, the people of Canada or of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let hon. members name one industry that we could do without 
because it has no importance.  I agree the importance of some 
may be relative, but the importance of tourism is certainly 
considerable.  Yet how many more are also of great importance to 
the economic well-being of ordinary people?  Are we to have a 
commission for each? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the second whereas in the preamble, and hon. members 
will agree with me that it is pretty weak.  It could apply to 
anything at all, not just the tourist industry in particular. 
Who in heaven's name wrote this?  Who is the one that had this 
brilliant idea?  It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the third whereas will offer us some clarification and 
will show us that this bill is really a serious one, that there 
are really pressing reasons for it to be passed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry consists of mainly small 
and medium-sized businesses that are essential to Canada's goals 
for entrepreneurial development and job creation; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most jobs in Canada and in Quebec are in small and medium sized 
business, not just those in tourism.  For instance, 
neighbourhood convenience stores are important. Are they going 
to create a Canadian convenience store commission?  How about 
getting serious here. 
This third pillar is being presented as a fundamental argument 
in support of the bill.  This pillar is just as far off as the 
first two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one pillar is left, now—the fourth one.  Let us examine it. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas it is desirable to strengthen Canada's commitment to 
Canadian tourism [—] 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas it is desirable to strengthen Canada's commitment?  Is 
it really desirable to do so?  This is an unwarranted 
affirmation; or I am missing something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked. 
Perhaps it was explained on the preceding page why it was 
desirable; perhaps. But there is no explanation to be found in 
the recommendation or in the summary.  Who said it was desirable 
to strengthen Canada's commitment to Canadian tourism?  Who made 
this statement?  Where does it come from?  Can anyone explain 
why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want anyone to get me wrong.  I think tourism is an 
important industry in the economic fabric of Canada and Quebec, 
and in my own riding I am an ardent proponent of tourism.  As a 
matter of fact, money spent promoting tourism produces the 
biggest, and the fastest, bang for the buck.  And, in my riding, 
investments in this sector have paid off handsomely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But does it necessarily follow that it is desirable to 
strengthen Canada's commitment?  If Canada wants to use my tax 
dollars and those of the average Canadian to help the tourism 
industry, it does not need to establish a commission.  It seems 
to me this is only common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill rests on four pillars; four extremely fragile 
pillars that make no sense.  I do not know who wrote these four 
“whereases”.  Obviously, the person did not examine the matter 
seriously.  It does not come across as serious; neither I nor 
anyone else is convinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is one thing in the bill that struck me—the fact that 
there will be a board of directors.  And that, to all intents 
and purposes, the directors will be appointed by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I began to see the light. 
The four pillars just mentioned, the four “whereases”, are not the 
important thing here. The important thing is those 16 persons 
who will be appointed to the board of directors.  That is the 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get serious. The tourist industry has been developing 
quite well for a long time now both in Quebec and in Canada. 
Quebec has created institutions, developed tools. 
Municipalities, urban communities and agencies have all worked 
hard to promote the tourist industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government, with our tax money, wants to support 
the tourist industry, I am all for it.  But if the federal 
government wants to do some window dressing just to reward its 
friends, then I have to be against it.  Tourism is much more 
than that; it is more important, much more important than 
this useless creature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill insults our intelligence; it is an insult to taxpayers 
and to all Canadians and Quebecers.  This bill should never have 
been introduced. It should never have been drafted. It should be 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will of course vote against it; I know all my colleagues from 
the Bloc Quebecois will do the same and I encourage all members 
in this House to vote against it. I see my time is up.  I thank 
all members for their attention and I hope they will agree with 
what I said.

an act to provide for the participation of the House of Commons 
when treaties are concluded, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce Bill C-214 
providing for the participation of the House of Commons when 
treaties are concluded. I would like to ask all members of the 
House of Commons to support this bill so that it can one day 
become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vote for this bill would give a new voice to all members, 
would confer increased legitimacy on treaties and finally would 
democratize the process by which the state assumes international 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak, the 135 member states of the World Trade 
Organization are gathered in Seattle to launch the millennium 
round of negotiations and start international trade negotiations 
that will end in the signing of many treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties will create international obligations for the 
states that are parties to them, and will have to be implemented 
through legislation the House of Commons will have to consider, 
the same way it had to pass implementing legislation for the 
agreements reached during the Uruguay round, which preceded the 
current millennium round of negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other negotiations are in fact going on, whether on bilateral 
treaties on social security or investment protection, or on 
multilateral treaties on disarmament, human rights or trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations will also lead to international treaties that 
will have a significant impact on people's lives, on businesses 
and also on government institutions. The number of such treaties 
is constantly increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a study that I conducted in 1992 for the Commission des 
questions afférentes à l'accession du Québec à la souveraineté, 
I found 1,388 treaties that were in effect in Canada on April 
30, 1991. From 1992 to 1998, at least 644 other treaties came 
into effect, and we must now add the 84 treaties for which 
measures were taken in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While globalization has something to do with the increase in the 
number of international legal treaties, it should not diminish 
the legislative sovereignty of the House of Commons and deprive 
it of its authority to look at the content of these numerous 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a power is necessary for important treaties, those which 
are likely to have a significant and lasting impact on our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why clause 7 of Bill C-214 provides that no treaty shall 
be ratified by Canada unless the House of Commons has first 
approved the treaty by resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such approval would be necessary for important treaties, as 
defined in clause 2 of the bill that I am tabling in the House. 
An important treaty includes any treaty whose implementation 
requires the enactment of an act of parliament, treaties 
creating international institutions, treaties on international 
trade and many other treaties listed in the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As set out in clause 7(2) of this bill, approval by the House of 
Commons would not include the power to amend the text of a 
treaty, because the approval would be on the text of a treaty 
already signed.  This would preserve the government's margin of 
manoeuvrability in negotiations and would allow it to sign 
treaties without fear that the House of Commons would 
subsequently reject terms that had already been validated by 
signing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of such a clause is, moreover, to restore—and I 
stress this, to restore—a parliamentary practice whereby major 
treaties were approved by resolution of this House, a practice 
first implemented in 1923 at the instigation of Prime Minister 
William Lyon Mackenzie King, and confirmed for treaties in 
general, and treaties relating to military and economic 
sanctions in particular, in 1926. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Mackenzie King stated, moreover, that the 
practice meant that “with the exception of treaties of lesser 
importance or in cases of extreme urgency, the Senate and the 
House of Commons are invited to approve treaties, conventions 
and formal agreements before ratification by or on behalf of 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last instance of a treaty deemed important was back in 1966, 
when the House of Commons and the Senate approved the Auto Pact, 
on January 16, 1966 and January 30, 1966 respectively.  Since 
that time, the Government of Canada has not submitted any treaty 
to this House for approval, although it has implied in certain 
documents, certain memoranda from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs, that such a practice is still in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite their importance, neither the Free Trade Agreement 
between the U.S. and Canada, nor NAFTA, nor the recent treaties 
on landmines and disarmament, were approved by this House before 
the government expressed its consent to be bound by them. 
Thirty-three years have elapsed since parliament really had a say 
in the process leading to the signing of treaties and when it 
could make a detailed examination of the treaties subject to its 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 also provides, in clause 8, that the tabling of 
treaties be based on legal requirement instead of being left at 
the discretion of the government of the day. Inspired by the 
British Ponsonby rule, but based on no particular legislative or 
constitutional rule, the tabling of treaties in the Parliament 
of Canada was done sporadically and interrupted without 
explanation in 1990. Even extradition treaties, which had to be 
tabled pursuant to section 7 of the Extradition Act, were not 
tabled. In this case, the government clearly violated a 
legislative obligation to table extradition treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following my remarks on this subject after my election on June 
2, 1997, the practice of tabling has resumed: the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs forwarded to the Clerk of the House of Commons, 
on January 8, 1999, seven extradition treaties, accompanied by a 
list of these treaties and a letter indicating that they were 
being tabled pursuant to Standing Order 32(1).

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add, however, that section 7 of the Extradition Act has 
been abrogated. The obligation to table treaties was abrogated 
by Bill C-40, in spite of my strong opposition and my attempt to 
amend section 8 of the bill during its examination on November 
23, 1998 by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, 
by replacing its wording with the wording of section 7 of the old 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs tabled, on April 13, 1999, the treaties 
concluded by Canada in 1995-96, accompanied by a list of these 
treaties. 
Only a few days ago—and I guess they did it in anticipation of 
today's debate—on November 26 and 29, treaties signed in 1991 
and 1992 and in 1989 and 1990 were tabled by the parliamentary 
secretary. We are still waiting for the treaties signed in 1993 
and 1994 and in 1997 and 1998, not to mention the 84 treaties on 
which measures were taken this year, none of which has yet been 
tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian parliamentarians should not be subject to the 
arbitrariness of the government in this regard and should be 
informed of all international treaties signed by Canada, through 
their being tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make these treaties easier to understand, they should include 
as an attachment explanatory memorandum containing, as provided 
under clause 8(3) of Bill C-214, a statement of Canada's 
obligations under the treaty, a summary of any legislation that 
must be enacted by parliament in order to implement the treaty 
and other relevant information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adopting this provision, the House of Commons would not be 
innovating, since three other Commonwealth parliaments, namely 
those of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the 
mother of all the Commonwealth parliaments, adopted similar 
rules and explanatory memoranda were sent to all 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 also includes provisions requiring the government to 
publish treaties rapidly and to post them as quickly as possible 
on a government website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of clauses 11 and 14 is to ensure that treaties are 
published within certain time limits, that is, in the </I>Canada 
Gazette <I>not later than 21 days after being ratified, in 
the </I>Canada Treaties Series<I> not later than three months after 
being ratified and in an electronic version even more rapidly, 
as would be necessary, that is, not later than seven days after 
being ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current publication practices are so inadequate and there is 
so little transparency that no treaty is reproduced in the 
</I>Canada Gazette<I> except for extradition treaties and that only 32 of 
the 34 treaties on which measures were taken in 1999 were 
published in the </I>Canada Treaties Series<I>. I checked this a few 
hours ago with the Library of Parliament, 
and none of these treaties are on the website of the Department 
of Foreign Affairs, with the exception—and I also checked this 
as of today—of the North American free trade agreement, which 
is mentioned under the heading “Regional and Bilateral 
Agreements”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would correct an obvious deficiency, allowing ordinary 
citizens as well as parliamentarians to have access to 
international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 also contains four clauses on the negotiation and the 
conclusion of treaties that I would like to bring to the 
attention of this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While recognizing the respective jurisdictions of the federal 
and provincial governments regarding the conclusion of treaties 
in areas under the exclusive authority of either level of 
government—I must mention at this point that we consider the 
Gérin-Lajoie doctrine in this respect to be in accordance with 
the Canadian Constitution—clauses 5 and 6 of the bill are aimed 
at fostering co-operation between the federal government and the 
provinces when the treaties being negotiated are joint treaties 
in an area under the authority of both the federal and 
provincial levels of government. Treaties of this kind are 
numerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, clause 5 of the bill provides that the federal 
government will have to enter into an agreement with each 
provincial government on the manner in which it will consult the 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the premiers asked for this kind of agreement during 
their annual conference that was held in August. Clause 5 
reflects the desire of 10 provinces which want to see an end to 
improvisation in this respect, and the federal government 
commit, in a formal and permanent manner, through an agreement 
among governments, to involve the provinces in the negotiating 
process and the conclusion of international treaties that have a 
significant impact on provincial governments and legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude with the presentation of Bill C-214, I want to 
thank my parliamentary intern, Mr. Gibran van Ert, who helped me 
to draft this bill last spring and got so interested in this 
field that he has decided to address this issue in the master 
thesis he will be working on this year at the University of 
Toronto, highlighting some of the work of two renown 
internationalists, Mr. Alan Gotlieb and Mrs. Anne-Marie 
Jacomy-Millette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my parliamentary assistant, Éric 
Normandeau, for all the preparatory work he did on this bill 
every step of the way and for his continued support and loyalty. 
Lastly, I would like to thank legislative counsel Louis-Philippe 
Côté who put Bill C-214 in perfect legal form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I advocate changes to the treaty process and I 
want to convince the federal government and the 
parliamentarians, even those in opposition, that the time has 
come to reform the obsolete process being used by the 
government. The process has been changed elsewhere in the 
Commonwealth, but not here, in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, we have to change the process in 
order to give our fellow citizens the opportunity to express 
their views on international treaties. In the short term, we 
need to change the process used in the House of Commons and I 
intend to advocate changes to the role the House of Commons 
plays in negotiating and implementing international treaties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill.  I encourage everyone in the House of 
Commons to support it.  There is a real lack of consultation and 
approval in the treaty making process.  I wonder if people 
watching and listening to the debate today realize how much the 
House of Commons is cut out of the action when it comes to 
international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get a chance to vote on an odd treaty which comes before the 
House, maybe a free trade agreement, but between 1994 and 1999 
during the life of the government it has signed 470 international 
treaties and has ratified 295 treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members of the House of Commons have never seen them and 
know almost nothing about them because the government handles 
them behind closed doors.  The negotiations take place behind 
closed doors.  The signing takes place behind closed doors.  I do 
not even know who signs them.  We do not even know who negotiates 
on our behalf.  The government takes a group of NGOs, a big group 
of bureaucrats and a whole bunch of other people, and they all 
head over on a big bus to sign the deal.  Then we do not learn 
about it until we read about it in the papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the bill is meant to address.  It is a perfect 
redress to this lack of democracy.  What is happening right now 
has happened for too long in the House of Commons.  Too much 
power has been vested in the Prime Minister and in his cabinet 
and not enough power is spread around to other members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill properly addresses the requirement of the government to 
be part of international agreements and negotiations but to come 
back to the House for consultation and approval.  This is a good 
balance for the government and the House of Commons when 
assembled together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that Canadians have a right to be 
consulted about international treaties.  We believe it should 
happen through their duly elected representatives in parliament. 
We also believe that public debate, public discussion and public 
input are ways to improve treaties and to improve public 
participation in our democratic process.  This is not something 
to be feared or something to be hidden or something to run from. 
The bill adequately addresses those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect the House of Commons to advance solutions.  Not 
just the bureaucrats, not just the government, but the entire 
House of Commons should put our minds and our best ideas together 
on all issues, certainly on international treaties which affect 
all of us in our day to day lives.  Presently that expectation is 
not being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 sets out to change the problematic process of hidden 
negotiations.  There was the problem which the government faced 
last year concerning all the rumours surrounding the MAI. 
Concerns were expressed about what the government was negotiating 
and proposing.  What was our position in the negotiations?  When 
it comes back, will we have a chance to ratify it before we are 
signed on to an agreement that will affect everyone in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ensure that it comes back to the House to be 
debated and talked about.  We will approve it as an entire House. 
The government may decide to push it through with its vote, but 
at least we would have a debate and at least we would have a 
vote.  Then Canadians would have a full hearing and a full airing 
of these important discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that all important international treaties must 
be tabled in the House of Commons for approval by resolution.  No 
treaty may be ratified unless approved.  This is a good balance 
between the necessity for the government to negotiate, to do fine 
work on behalf of all Canadians and through their representatives 
in the House of Commons to put a final stamp on it showing that 
we think it is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that every international treaty shall be 
tabled for 21 sitting days prior to ratification.  In other 
words, we will all have a chance to look at it.  We will all have 
a chance to go through it with a fine tooth comb if that is our 
wish.  Very importantly, an explanatory memorandum accompanies 
the bill, something which explains why it is in the best interest 
of Canada, whether there are tax implications, how it will affect 
Canadians, whether there are estimated expenditures to which the 
government might be obligating Canada, and all such things that 
Canadians expect us to keep an eye on. 
Under the current system they do not get the opportunity.  This 
bill does not stop the government from doing its job; it just 
entitles all Canadians and all of us who are duly elected 
representatives to scrutinize these 400 or 500 international 
treaties that Canada has signed on to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes that the government not be permitted to 
ratify or modify a treaty without House of Commons approval, 
after the treaty has been tabled for 21 days.  That would provide 
a good opportunity to go through the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform agrees with the provisions of the bill, but we would like 
the legislation to go even further.  Before I explain that I 
would like to state our policy on treaty negotiations.  Our 
policy book states that parliament should be asked to approve all 
agreements or declarations before they are ratified as Canadian 
positions.  We think it is a good idea to include 
parliamentarians early on in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote a dissenting opinion following the foreign policy review 
in 1994.  I wrote 40 or 50 pages which I am sure the Speaker has 
in his library.  I wrote about the dismay that many of us felt 
when the government continued to sign agreements.  In one case, 
the hon. André Ouellet announced Canada's support for a United 
Nations standing army, even while the standing committee was 
reviewing Canada's foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister made a major policy address on the need for 
UN reform two weeks before the committee reported its findings to 
parliament.  That undermines and undercuts the role of 
parliamentarians and places all the power and influence in the 
Prime Minister's hands.  In this bill the Prime Minister would 
have a role, the cabinet would have a role, but the House of 
Commons would also have a role in the making of international 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at what happened in Seattle these last 
couple of days to see how important people feel international 
agreements have become.  They are in many ways more important 
than the day to day business we do in the House because the 
hundreds of treaties that are signed by the government on our 
behalf make commitments on behalf of all Canadians on issues like 
trade, human rights, women's issues, family issues and the 
environment.  They commit the House and Canada to billions and 
billions of dollars and legislative responses on any number of 
issues and Canadians do not have a chance to see them first. 
They should have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our recently released foreign policy review, which was 
released by our foreign affairs critic a week or so ago, there is 
a four point proposal.  The review goes into some detail, but I 
will quickly say that parliamentary ratification would be needed 
for all treaties.  We would require an impact statement similar 
to the one outlined in this bill.  We also ask that these 
international agreements work to strengthen co-operative 
federalism.  If an agreement affects provincial jurisdiction, the 
provinces should be brought in early to make sure they understand 
the impact it will have on the provinces.  That is one way to 
improve federalism.  Perhaps it is a solution the Prime Minister 
should be thinking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these discussions and debates would help to better inform 
the public of what it is that Canada is doing on the 
international stage.  Canada does a lot of good work.  Most of 
these treaties would be routinely endorsed, but Canadians need to 
know about them.  The best way to let them know is to have 
debates in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill, and happily so, but I urge that we consider 
in the days to come even more ways of increasing the 
accountability of international treaties.  We would like to see a 
national interest impact analysis, very similar to the one 
proposed in this bill's explanatory memorandum, but we would also 
like to see a family impact statement.  How would this affect the 
family?  Would it have tax implications?  How would it affect 
children?  Those things should be discussed and debated.  The 
government should table them in the House when it tables the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our foreign affairs minister said earlier this year in New York, 
when he was talking about the security council, that we want to 
make the council more transparent, more democratic and more open. 
The trends have been going the other way.  Our job is 
to express our concerns and introduce alternate options.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part 
in this debate at second reading stage of Bill C-214, sponsored 
by the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with the Canadian practice with regard to the 
conclusion of treaties, an important element of the Government 
of Canada's prerogative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I must tell the House that the government does not 
intend to support Bill C-214 for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seriously affects the division of powers in Canada and 
questions certain priority aspects of Canada's foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the international context has a direct impact on the 
daily lives of Canadians. They are increasingly mobile and 
travel around the world to work and do business. Since an 
increasing number of problems go beyond traditional boundaries, 
countries adopt more and more a concerted approach to solve 
these problems, whether they relate to the fight against crime, 
the promotion of peace, disarmament, environmental protection, 
sustainable development or international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concerted approach leads to an ongoing international 
dialogue and to an increasing number of international 
agreements, as evidenced by the fact that Canada signs about 100 
treaties each year. 
At this moment, Canada is party—and our colleague mentioned 
some figures a few moments ago—to nearly 3,000 bilateral and 
multilateral instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To inform Parliament of the obligations stemming from these 
treaties, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade already tables in the House—and I did so myself in the 
last few days—as well as in the Senate the text of all treaties 
that have been implemented and do not require special 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, all these treaties are also provided in electronic 
format to both Houses and to the Library of Parliament for 
consultation by all MPs and senators. Not only do 
parliamentarians receive all this information, but they play an 
active role in the implementation of treaties that Canada wishes 
to ratify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian constitutional law clearly establishes that the 
negotiation and the signature of a treaty, that is the act by 
which Canada wishes to be bound by a treaty, is strictly the 
purview of the federal executive branch. However, the 
legislative branch is still responsible for implementing the 
ensuing obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a treaty results in changes to current laws or in the 
enactment of new ones, the lawmaker alone can take such action. 
Depending on the jurisdiction, implementing legislation must be 
passed by parliament or provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This role is essential because, in the absence of any 
participation from the legislative branch, the international 
commitments made by Canada would never be followed up on for 
lack of internal enactments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this implementation power, parliament is regularly 
required to study and discuss treaties. We need only think of 
the bill to implement the land mines convention, which banned 
land mines and provided for their destruction, the bill to 
implement the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which I 
will deal with later, or the Corruption Of Foreign Public 
Officials Act that gives effect to the OECD convention on 
combating bribery of foreign public officials in international 
business transactions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to highlight the fact that while we believe 
that legislative changes are not necessary, in practice the role 
of parliament in treaty making continues to evolve.  The hon. 
member is aware that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade and its subcommittee examined and made 
recommendations to the government on the multilateral agreement 
on investment, on the WTO and the FTAA negotiations.  They make 
recommendations prior to the conclusion of any agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example would be that parliament last spring debated 
Bill S-22, implementing legislation of an agreement with the 
Americans, prior to the conclusion of the agreement, in order to 
give parliament greater latitude in determining what powers 
Canada would provide American customs officers in Canadian 
airports. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, parliament does play a role, not in every case, but 
in many important cases prior to the conclusion of an agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to treaties dealing with areas under provincial 
jurisdiction, constitutional law already requires that the 
Government of Canada secure the support of provinces before 
ratifying an international treaty requiring implementation 
through provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal government consults provincial 
governments in relation to Hague conventions dealing with 
private international law and in relation to the development of 
the Canadian negotiating position on environmental protection 
conventions. 
Provincial representatives are sometimes part of Canadian 
delegations, when treaties concerning the provinces are 
negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 creates nothing new in that area, but it imposes a 
tight framework on the Government of Canada for consulting its 
provincial partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, Bill C-214 refers to the royal prerogative of Her Majesty 
in right of a province with respect to the negotiation and 
signing of treaties. It is clearly established in Canada that no 
such provincial prerogative exists and that the prerogative with 
respect to the negotiation and signing of any international 
treaty lies exclusively with the Canadian federal executive 
branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Bill C-214 adversely affects Canadian foreign policy. 
Crises throughout the world must not be used for partisan 
purposes on the national political scene. The Government of 
Canada, which is accountable to parliament, is responsible for 
the country's foreign affairs. In order to be heard and to be 
perceived as a leader, it must have a single voice on the 
international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the partisan decision of the U.S. Senate, with its 
Republican majority, not to sign the comprehensive nuclear test 
ban treaty stunned Canada and the whole international community, 
dimmed the hopes for peace and international stability generated 
by the treaty, and dealt a serious blow to the United States' 
reputation, even though President Clinton himself openly 
supported ratification of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This show of disunity by our American neighbours is a clear 
illustration of what happens when sterile party politics find 
their way into the conduct of a country's foreign affairs. 
Canada does not wish to undergo such a drastic change in the 
conduct of its foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-214 would slow down the treaty ratification 
process and prevent Canada from being a leader in the 
development of international conventions. Here is an example of 
obstacles that Bill C-214 could create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land mines convention, which was signed right here in 
Ottawa, is an international priority for Canada. We were the 
first country to sign that treaty, in December 1997. However, if 
Bill C-214 had been in effect at the time, that would not have 
been possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must have a treaty ratification process that allows it to 
achieve its foreign policy objectives and to deal quickly and 
effectively with changing and urgent situations. The current 
process meets these imperatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an example of the flexibility provided by 
the current Canadian system that serves the interests of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To promote business in the air transport industry, for instance, 
the government regularly signs air transport agreements with 
other countries. Under these agreements, commercial carriers 
from one signatory state can use the airspace of another 
signatory state, which increases the number of destination 
points the carriers of both countries can offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often, these agreements are implemented even before the 
countries can have them officially ratified, so that the 
carriers of both countries can benefit from the terms of the 
agreements as soon as possible. 
If we were to abide by the process and the restricting delays 
stipulated by the hon. member in his bill, we would not be able 
to implement the agreements on a temporary basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think Bill C-214 provides for an overly complex 
and inefficient procedure to replace a treaty negotiation 
process that, so far, has well served Canadians, 
parliamentarians, and Canada throughout the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</b> Mr. Speaker, first, 
I wish to congratulate the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry for 
the good job he has done on this issue.  It is one the Bloc 
Quebecois, particularly the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, has 
been addressing for years.  Why?  Because it has to do with the 
whole issue of respect for federal and provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should bear in mind that what goes around, comes around.  We 
have had an opportunity to be at the helm a few times and we 
will no doubt have an opportunity, as a political party, to be 
at the helm in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry pointed out that the two 
parties that have formed the successive governments since 
Confederation have basically taken the same approach to 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I think there is a need to evolve. In the 
case of very specific treaties with a major impact on the life 
of Canadians, elected representatives should have a much greater 
say not during the negotiation phase, but before they are 
ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the millennium round at Seattle was mentioned. 
Considering today's technology, it is preferable to let people 
know before they decide to go and get the information 
themselves. I think it is necessary to do so for the sake of 
public peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am not a procedural expert, what I can say about this 
bill is that we should bear in mind two things when we talk 
about it being divided into two bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, about the role of Parliament.  From the outset, 
parliamentarians must be involved.  The parliamentary secretary 
gave the example of ratification after 21 days in the case of 
the airline industry.  But these treaties are not part of the 
description or the philosophy of an important treaty. 
It is a cinch; international trade agreements are not listed as 
important treaties, by tradition. The examples given by the 
parliamentary secretary were not good ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with Bill C-214, the parliamentary secretary said 
“But the provinces were consulted on the implementation 
measures”.  I hope that they were because it is their 
responsibility.  But that is not being taken away by Bill C-214. 
The whole matter of implementation of treaties is still there. 
What is being called for is for parliamentarians to be consulted 
before ratification of a treaty, so that they can give it some 
examination.  There would then be no surprises, because they 
would be familiar with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am to believe the hon. parliamentary secretary, the 
government is so good that the members of parliament will just 
look at the treaty—without being able to change its wording—and 
will surely support it, because generally treaties signed by the 
government are perfect. Afterward, we will go to our ridings to 
be like ambassadors testifying to the good job this government 
is doing internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could serve the cause of the party in power by approving 
every international treaty.  The parliamentary secretary could 
make use of the opposition. It might be a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, in connection with parliament, Bill C-214 is 
incomplete, and I do not mean that as a criticism.  It is highly 
complicated, nevertheless.  As for all the consultation, all the 
negotiation between provinces and the implementation, the 
decision has to be made on how this will be handled. 
Will it be limited to the standing foreign affairs committee or 
will a new committee be established? Will it be a Senate 
committee? What will the role of the Senate be in all this? 
Nevertheless, the aim of Bill C-214 is to say: “With everything 
that is going on, could we not see to it that parliamentarians 
are involved?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary system we are living under—and I want to get 
back to the example given by the parliamentary secretary with 
respect to what happened in the United States—is quite different 
from the United States' political system. As we saw today, more 
often than not the parliamentary system allows the government to 
create an alliance on a particular issue and get a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, there is a republican, bicameral system 
where the houses are renewed one third at a time over the years, 
which can lead to some imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all its flaws, our parliamentary system has one 
quality: it provides political stability to the party in power. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the government should not be afraid. Historically, 
and the same goes for provincial legislatures, more often than 
not, the government in power is a majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to make the government fall over an international 
treaty; rather, we want to be informed. We cannot change them, 
but we can understand them. And this should be done quickly. 
Transparency and involvement at the international level, this is 
what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry is not asking to negotiate 
for the government. This is not what we are asking for. We say: 
“when the negotiations are over.” 
This was a very short time, because 21 days is not long.  The 
land mines treaty, for instance, could have been signed faster. 
The signing was to take place in Ottawa.  It had to suit the 
ministers' schedules.  The weather had to be nice, not too cool 
and not too hot. The signing was held up so all the guests could 
be present.  If the government is capable of being polite 
and open to guests, could it be open a little to 
parliamentarians, the representatives of the people?  That is 
how it works when treaties are being signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask the directors of ceremonies in the various departments. 
They wait.  They can put off a signing for several months 
because the minister is not there. 
It would be possible to have 21 days or a few months or just 
a few weeks to look at them together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-214, this is self evident.  The government has picked 
up bad habits.  The two parties that have taken turns in power 
certainly have.  That does not mean they cannot be fixed so that 
we can go in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me most is that portion of the bill that deals 
with the provinces.  I understand and I do not understand.  The 
member for Beauharnois—Salaberry is much more knowledgeable and 
experienced than I am in this field.  However, I hesitate a bit 
on this issue, because we know that increasingly, with changes 
in society, the issue of jurisdiction is becoming increasingly 
grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, we are seeing that globalization has an impact on 
trial court and even supreme court rulings. Increasingly, 
opinion is divided and things are not clear.  Let us take the 
example of the environment.  Recently, a Bloc Quebecois member 
spoke about matters relating to the fishery.  He said:  “If the 
fish washes ashore, whose is it?  If it is floating on the 
surface, whose is it?  If it is on the bottom and only just got 
there, whose is it?”  This is an excellent example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a jurisdictional level, there is still the problem of knowing 
whose fish it is. 
We do not need a constitutional conference to sort this out but, 
increasingly, in the case of an environmental treaty, there is 
no doubt that provincial jurisdictions are just as affected as 
federal ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall an attempt by the Bloc Quebecois.  There was a 
memorable speech by the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who 
said that Quebec could and should have a say in negotiations. 
We were discussing asbestos at the WTO, and Quebec wanted a 
place at the negotiating table.  However, as I see it, there are 
two ways to interpret clauses 4 and 5.  The bill says that 
Canada shall not—and here I am referring to clause 5, which 
provides for an agreement on the manner of consultation with the 
provinces—negotiate or conclude a treaty unless there is a 
consultation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry admits 
that the federal government has the prerogative of the 
international negotiations and it is quite well. But in the 
consultation scheme, would the provinces be given the right to 
negotiate or to sit at the table for all important treaties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions should be asked, and they are quite interesting. 
It goes to prove that we are open to the possibility of sharing 
the knowledge we have on the international treaties being 
negotiated by the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize my time is up. We are going to support Bill C-214 even 
if there are still grey areas. But the most important point here 
is that, in this Parliament, we see to it that members are 
respected, after all the recommendations by committees to the 
effect that people should be given information. We should start 
in this House, and at the international level.

</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
exceedingly brief this afternoon.  On behalf of the New 
Democratic Party caucus I wanted to be on the record on this 
subject.  I think I should tell the House that we had another 
speaker lined up who has been detained at a meeting and is unable 
to be with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very intently to the debate so far.  I want to begin 
by congratulating the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry for 
putting forward this important private member's bill and for the 
cogent arguments and research that accompanied it.  I think it is 
an extremely important private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree as well with the comments that have been made by the 
Reform Party and the spokesperson for the Conservative Party and 
therefore am disappointed in the remarks from the government 
members opposite as to why they cannot bring themselves to 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point for me is that the enactment of such a bill 
would provide that Canada may not ratify an important treaty 
unless the House of Commons has first approved the treaty by 
resolution, pursuant to the rules of procedure of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that in this country or in the world there are few 
governments that have more power within the executive branch than 
in this House of Commons.  Because of our system of appointing 
senators and other problems that we have had vis-a-vis the 
constitution, we effectively have very little checks and balances 
with which to restrain or detain the government in important 
issues.  This would be one way in which parliamentarians could 
and should have a say in doing those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to get on the record and say that the New Democratic 
Party caucus supports this private member's bill.  We 
congratulate the member from the Bloc for bringing it forward. We 
are very disappointed with the reaction from the government 
members opposite.

</I></B></P><P <b>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have some problems with this resolution and I will treat them 
very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a failure to study empirically Canadian practice and to 
recognize the distinction between self-executing and 
non-self-executing treaties.  About 99% of the treaties made by 
Canada since the war are non-self-executing.  That is to say, to 
be implemented in Canadian law they require laws passed by 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed to hear the official opposition say they do not know 
anything about it.  Have they been asleep?  They have had a 
foreign affairs committee.  It is competent to hear these 
matters.  Its members are competent to raise the matters when the 
laws come before the House.  Somebody has been playing Rip Van 
Winkle and it does not reflect very credibly on the opposition 
people to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have in a certain sense fused what used to be the 
highly formal act of ratification with the legislative 
implementation.  I confirm this with the land mines treaty when 
there was an issue we wanted to be the first to ratify because we 
sponsored that treaty.  However, it had to wait on our 
legislation by parliament and we ended up, I think, number three. 
But, there is the fact.  Every treaty made in effect comes before 
parliament and before the foreign affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point which I will make is I am amazed again by this 
study of comparative law.  It is the first lesson.  I am reminded 
of what Sir Austen Chamberlain said “Comparative law is a trap 
for the unwary and a signpost for the guilty”.  He was saying it 
to something else, but there it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can you compare positive law snatched from one society to 
another society unless they are congruent in terms of their legal 
systems?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian system and the German system are totally different 
from the British, Australian and anything else.  The member who 
introduced this bill would be horrified if he had the American, 
Australian or other systems in force here.  Those systems 
establish the supremacy of federal law implementing a treaty.  By 
the very fact of making a treaty, one gets the power to 
legislate.  The Canadian is in the inverse and in 1957 the German 
court studying our experience said it would follow the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So every treaty for implementation requires federal legislation 
and, if it touches provincial powers, provincial legislation. 
When one gets to issues like fisheries, it will take several 
years of patient negotiation, frustrating negotiation sometimes, 
with the provinces.  Let me simply make that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third position I would make is simply this.  It is not a 
good plan to seek to do by indirection what can be done by the 
front door.  I read this very carefully and I find that article 6 
of the bill on treaties either is uttered per incuriam with a 
lack of knowledge of Canadian constitutional law, which I do not 
believe, or it is an exercise in espièglerie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face the facts.  There is no such thing as a treaty made 
by a province under Canadian law.  It just does not exist. 
Therefore, in the interstices of a clause buried in the middle of 
a projected law, how can one purport to make a constitutional 
amendment?  It just cannot be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much of this is an act of supererogation, of stating what 
parliament already does.  I look at those several hundreds hours 
in the foreign affairs committees on the MAI.  Backward and 
forward, it was exhaustively discussed.  There was the landmines 
treaty with input from the official opposition and others, which 
the minister acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have said that apart from clause 6, this is an example 
of what Quintus Horatius Flacuus said, “Parturient montes, 
nascetur ridiculus mus”.  Briefly translated, as Shakespeare did 
somewhat freely, it means “Sound and fury signifying nothing 
new”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also tempted by the suggestion that it was perhaps an 
interesting exercise in doing by the back door what should have 
been done by the front door.  It is an interesting exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would advise the hon. member, whom I respect for his qualities 
and his sense of humour, to come back again with a better draft. 
I would also suggest putting students to exercises more fully 
rooted in sociological jurisprudence.  That is to say, he should 
make sure the societies they study are cognate before taking away 
their positive law.  Comparative law is not an exercise in 
butterfly collections as one has here, with one monster butterfly 
from one society and one from another.  There has to be a certain 
relevance. 
</I></B></P><P <b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  Is there unanimous consent to call it 
6.30 p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P <b>Some hon. members:</b>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P <b>The Deputy Speaker:</b> The time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired, and the order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.29 p.m.)
