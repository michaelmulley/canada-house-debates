<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in Canada probably do not know that one of the interesting results is it created the potential for 16 different governments in the Yukon at the federal, territorial and first nations level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge was when it came to development assessment on a project,   a first nations business, or a corporation, or a mining company that had interests across several boundaries of these many orders of government may  have had to go through many different assessment processes, laws and regimes. There needed to be a one window process put in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I debated the bill I spoke about how the law was created over a number of years, about how it would accomplish a one window approach and how some of the issues that came up during those many years of debate were dealt with in the proposal.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these orders of government managing  various lands and resources, the Yukon could have found itself with 16 or more different ways for assessing projects throughout the territory. However, Bill C-2 will establish a single uniform process for assessing land projects in the Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, potential proponents will have to follow only one set of regulations for assessing the environmental and socio-economic effects of their projects in the Yukon.  In order to promote responsible development activities, the assessment process must be uniform and predictable. The bill includes both these characteristics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If responsible development in the Yukon is to include proper protection of the environment, certainty and timeliness are equally essential to the assessment process and are reflected in Bill C-2.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I committed at this stage to  outline some of the ideas, concerns and suggestions that arose during the debate and the committee process on Bill C-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yukon organizations,   Klondike Placer Miners' Association and the Chamber of Mines,  have a number of suggestions. They want to ensure there is procedural fairness regarding a proponent's ability to respond and to appeal. They want to ensure that the proponent receives all the information pertaining to the application and is able to respond during the assessment phase prior to a recommendation being made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to ensure that there is public input on the development of regulations and on the development of the Yukon environmental and socio-economic assessment   board rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this  legislation there are very many important things, some of which were fought for by these groups. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations  define what a project would be, for instance. There are some other coordination issues in the regulations. This is a very significant factor in how this  is going to work and  what is defined as a project. It is very important that the public have input in this area. It is  the same with the rules. Rules that will be developed by the board have some very instrumental elements  that some of the Yukon groups  asked for, for instance, time lines. It is very important that there be good public input into these major aspects of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mining industry wants the bill  to establish  methods whereby the public will be consulted. Any legislation benefits from public input. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessments must  have clear time lines in order to ensure a healthy economy. These processes should occur within the time lines. It provides certainty to those doing the development. For placer miners, even more so these days, well defined limits that are followed at every stage are a must for the stability of the industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of these points are suggestions from the mining association. They  also reflect what the chambers of commerce are interested in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would like to appeal to an elected official if there is a dispute with the board. They also suggested a scheduled review of the act because it is so important to ongoing protection of the environment and development in the Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the act is in place, they do not want existing projects to be reviewed unless the proponent requests a review. To ensure certainty, many of the miners told the committee that projects must only be reviewed if a proponent is requesting a change to that project. The ability to arbitrarily trigger a review is part of the legislation which  has raised concerns in part of the mining community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessments must also consider benefits to society. The purpose of the act should ensure that development as a  public good is considered during socio-economic assessment. The economic factor is where there needs to be recognition of the good and the prosperity that the development brings so that Yukon families can support themselves and, through their taxes, fund the things that are important to governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to ensure that rules pertaining to designated offices will be reviewed. Designated offices should not be allowed to make their own rules to ensure  that  the rules   are not different in different districts and  a proponent  is   not treated differently in different districts. There are going to be six offices throughout the Yukon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some suggestion that the scope of the act was so limited it could not catch some major projects that might have a negative socio-economic impact on communities and first nations such as the designation of parks or protected areas.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the assessment of cumulative impacts, they want to make sure that the board is empowered not only to consider the adverse impacts but the positive impacts of those developments. They also are wary of the possibility that certain mineral development could be imperiled where there are conflicts with the land use plans and  this regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yukon Chamber of Commerce  had  similar concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the intervenors were quite positive toward a five year review of the act and  input into the regulations and the rules, all of which are so instrumental.  In a pioneering piece of legislation that  will  have so much impact  on the community and on the territory, it is important to incorporate these items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three first nations  provided input,  the Kwanlin Dun First Nation, the   Kaska First Nation and the White River First Nation. They want to ensure that there is  a five year review in place. They also want to ensure that  the first nations are involved in the development of the regulations, which is a view consistent with that of other intervenors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservation Society also provided input throughout the process over the years and also represented the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.  One of the major points, over and above the ones that I  mentioned  was that there should be enforcement legislation so that the results of this legislation would not be just recommendations, as they are now, but decisions. This  would be regulatory legislation as opposed to advisory legislation.  The five year review and involvement in the regulations were also mentioned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is complex because there is another land claim in the northern part of the Yukon which  involves the Yukon North Slope.  The Wildlife Management Advisory Council of  the Inuvialuit expressed an interest that there    not be duplication of the screening that comes under its processes related to its screening committee under that land claim, which would then overlap the assessment process in the Yukon system. There could possibly be  two different results from the different assessment processes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Yukon Communities was also an intervenor.  It   represents 100% of the municipalities in the Yukon and over 80% of the people in the Yukon.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  noted in  its submission that  it  had been   involved with the public consultation process from the beginning, since 1996.   It met regularly and had input with groups, including   the  Council  of Yukon First Nations, Yukon Chamber of Mines, the Klondike Placer Miners' Association, the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, the Yukon Conservation Society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipalities were concerned that because they were not recognized as an order of government in the bill,   they may not have a right to appeal on  every issue that occurred within municipal boundaries. They also suggested that it  be mandatory on panels occurring within the municipal boundaries to have representation on the panel recommended by the municipalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their reading,  they thought it was unclear where CEAA and YESAA would cover a project and that there might be a dual assessment. The bill   basically removes CEAA from the Yukon. Yukon  will be one of only three parts of Canada that have their own assessment process. It will be designed by the local governments and  people in the Yukon, for the Yukon.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is exciting when people can work with the federal, first nations and territorial governments.  It is a process that is unique to the country and to Yukon. They then do not have to follow the national legislation that may not be as sensitive to local concerns. The municipalities also thought that as other orders of government or decision bodies were in line within their jurisdiction, they should have the same provision in certain instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were some of the ideas and suggestions that were raised during the debate.  We have been processing this proposition created by three governments in Yukon for Yukoners. Whatever emerges from this Parliament will be unique to Yukon and to Canada.  Perhaps it will contain elements of a model for the country for refinement and emulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerge it must.  Our economy is at a low ebb and we need a regime to protect the environment while providing the certainty to entrepreneurs, corporations, first nations business persons and businesses so that we can all get on with building an economy so that Yukon families can survive and prosper in the beautiful country that has been given to us.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450273"></A><a HREF="#Int-450285"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450263"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central to participate in the debate on Bill C-2, an act to establish a process for assessing the environmental and socio-economic effects of certain activities in Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the hon. member for Yukon and  I do appreciate his concern for the environment and the socio-economic development of Yukon.  All members in this Chamber are concerned.  However, I wish that the hon. member had some influence on his government and the minister to address the issues which I will be addressing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider some important elements about rural Canada.  Canada is the second largest country in the world with a huge wealth of natural resources.  Though we are sparsely populated in Canada, more than 60% of our population lives in 10 or so of our southern most cities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade of the Liberal government's rule, rural Canada has more or less been ignored by the government. Rural Canada suffers because of poor roads, poor rail links, and a lack of infrastructure development.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of Canada depends on resource based industry, which is not supported by government programs, and is suffering badly from the plight of the Liberal government.  The reasons are political more than anything else.  It likes to focus on the voter rich areas, but it  forgets about the concerns of rural Canadians.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mismanagement of our natural resources by the Liberals is quite evident. Softwood lumber, mining, oil and gas and the fisheries are some of the examples of  Liberal government mismanagement.  If the weak Liberal government had a vision Canada would have been exporting more value added products rather than the natural resources like raw materials that we export.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to go to the port in Vancouver we would see big heaps of sulfur or lumber.  Why can we not add value to the products?  It  would not only create jobs but it would contribute to the economy. That is the unfortunate plight. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural Canada is suffering because of  Liberal government mismanagement.  The government's approach to dealing with the environment, Kyoto, endangered species and wildlife, or even the gun registry has not been fair to the rural communities in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-2 should have been in the House at least six years ago. Despite the lengthy development process the bill is significantly flawed.  The Canadian Alliance is opposing the legislation, not because legislation in this area is not needed, but because this particular piece of legislation is not what is needed.  Our main concern with the bill is that it does not do the very thing the minister says it does.  The minister and his department claim that the bill would hand over to Yukoners the task of assessing development projects that have been proposed on federal, territorial and first nations lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government  says the bill is about devolution, about putting into local hands responsibility for making these assessments, but the truth is that the minister would retain for himself the power to control the process and to control who sits on the board that would be set up.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the federal government cannot keep its hands off areas that should be under provincial and territorial jurisdiction. When it says that it is handing over powers to another level of government, it is doing nothing of the sort. There is no true handing over of power to Yukoners. The minister would retain the powers  that he claims would be given to Yukoners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on other concerns that we have with the bill.  The minister would have too much authority over project assessment in Yukon. The bill was supposed to be about devolving to the people of Yukon authority for project assessments. The public relations material from the minister's department and the spokesman of the committee have sold this bill as a devolution of power, but the opposite is true. The minister would hold all the strings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that in a number of places in the bill, the most important of which is the composition of the assessment board, which would be the main body established by the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me mention some of the amendments the Canadian Alliance moved in committee. These amendments would have curbed the minister's power over the assessment process, but each amendment was voted down by the Liberals in committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the minister currently has the power under the bill to make an unlimited number of patronage appointments to the assessment board. Two different amendments were proposed that would have restricted the size of the board. We made those amendments on the recommendations of an MLA from Yukon. This would have limited the federal minister's ability to make patronage appointments to the board, but the amendment was not passed because the Liberal members voted against it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, another amendment would have forced the minister to establish minimum qualifications and other criteria for the selection of board members. The bill in its current form makes no such requirements and therefore patronage appointments are easier to make. Our amendment would have made patronage appointments more difficult for the government and the minister. Again, the Liberals on the committee voted down this amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we also proposed amendments designed to strengthen the role of the Yukon government at the expense of the federal minister's role. The bill is supposed to hand to Yukoners control of the project assessment process, so one would have expected these amendments to pass because they are very natural amendments, but again the Liberals voted them down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such amendment would have strengthened the role of the territorial minister by enabling him to nominate one of the three executive committee members of the board; just one of the three. At present the minister must merely consult the territorial minister on one of those three appointments. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment would have strengthened the role of the territorial minister at the expense of the federal minister by enabling him to nominate two rather than only one of the four non-executive board members. Again, the Liberals voted this down, choosing instead to keep all of the strings in the federal minister's hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment would have limited the size of the board to a maximum of 13 members, but the Liberals on the committee voted against this. So now, the federal minister can make as many patronage appointments as he or she wants, up to 13 at least.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment would have changed the process of how the additional board members are chosen. Currently half of these members are nominated by the Council of Yukon First Nations.  Under another amendment, the other half would be nominated by the territorial minister.  That is fair enough.  Half would be nominated by the minister and half by  Yukon first nations through the council.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handing of power from the federal minister to the territorial minister would make sense if, as the minister says, the bill is  about handing to the people of Yukon powers that have until now been with the federal government.   However again the minister is holding all of the power rather than giving it to the people of Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 would give the federal minister authority to select  the communities in which six assessment officers would  be located, because the bill would establish six offices in various communities in  Yukon.  This would create the potential of political influence in the selection of the communities. We have moved an amendment that the authority be transferred from the minister to the board so that a board could  make those decisions but again the Liberals on the committee rejected that amendment too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second major concern  with the bill is that it is silent on the subject of timelines for the completion of assessments by the board.  This is unacceptable given the problems that have existed in  Yukon in this regard.  Project assessments have taken far too long.  Given this major problem, the bill should have addressed the matter of timelines right away.   The bill has failed the people of Yukon on that issue again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me describe the problem that has existed in Yukon, with project assessments dragging on for so long.  Development  and  the economy of Yukon are hurting and the people of Yukon are suffering for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, environmental and socio-economic assessments of proposed projects in  Yukon are assessed under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.    It is administered by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  The department has failed to conduct a timely, efficient and cost effective assessments of the projects in Yukon under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These projects should be assessed in a timely, efficient and cost effective manner but the department has failed the people of  Yukon.  It is widely recognized.  For example, in the mining industry, the recent annual survey of mining companies rated Yukon as having the second worst mining regulatory system in Canada.  A survey was done by the Fraser Institute and it rated Yukon to be the second worst mining regulatory system in Canada.  By the way, the first one was British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for hard data over the past 10 years, the length of time between the submission of an application and the delivery of a permit for a mining project has far exceeded what any reasonable person would consider acceptable.  I did some research and have some examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Copper Holdings Ltd. made a submission in 1994  for an assessment.  It  is still not complete after 97 months.  Imagine a business company applying for a licence and waiting for 97 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Millennium Mining Corp. made a submission in 1996 for assessment.  It is still not complete after 79 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an opportunity to visit the Cominco mine.  Cominco Ltd. made a project assessment submission in 1996 and the permit was delivered in 2000, after 47 months, almost four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minto Explorations Ltd. made a submission for assessment in 1994 and the permit was delivered in 1997 after 35 months, almost three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viceroy Resources Ltd. made a submission in 1994 and the permit was delivered in 1996, after 23 months.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most jurisdictions in Canada, at least for small mines, take six months to one year. Can members see the comparison? In the rest of Canada it takes just six months to one year. In Yukon it takes from 97 months. That is not acceptable. Globally it takes two years or less and that is the norm. The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, has not come close to these Canadian norms of two years or less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to conduct timely, efficient and cost effective assessments of projects in Yukon has contributed to the economic slowdown in Yukon and destroyed Yukon's reputation as a sound and stable jurisdiction in which to develop new mines. How can Yukon  attract foreign investments or investors in the mining industry when the government's standard is letting those miners down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the shutdown of the mine at Faro in 1998, I am sure the member for Yukon knows, had disastrous economic consequences in the region. This could have been mitigated by timely approvals of other projects prior to the Faro shutdown. However those timely assessment projects by the government were not there. One company had to shut down. The other projects for the assessment were not completed for so long and the economy suffered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has not been equal to the task. As a result, Yukon's economy is largely dependent on the net federal transfer payments to fuel economic activity,   whereas Yukon could be self-sufficient. Development should have been taking place if the government's approach was right.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the failure of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to conduct timely, efficient and cost effective assessments of projects in Yukon, we would expect the bill to correct these deficiencies so that worthwhile projects could proceed in a timely manner. However the bill does not do this nor even attempts to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead the bill focuses on identifying and mitigating negative impacts of development. The bill shows little concern for development as something positive and desirable for the people of Yukon. It focuses on the negative impacts of development, including damage to lifestyles, heritage sites, the environment and community social systems. Therefore the bill is missing a needed balance between development and sustainability. It does not consider development as a public good which benefits communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment board is therefore incapable of weighing costs and benefits in a balanced fashion since its only mandate is to safeguard against damage. Under the bill the board's preference when making assessments must always be to prohibit or limit development, even in cases when the benefits of a project would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only timeline that would come into play has yet to be determined, since it will be a part of regulations. That timeline does not relate to the assessment process. It relates to something that will follow the assessment process. Let me explain this, because it demonstrates just how much the bill fails to do what is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a project has been assessed, the board, or one of the six offices in the communities that have conducted the assessment, will recommend to the responsible federal, territorial or first nations decision bodies whether the project should be allowed to proceed. These decision bodies, not the board or its six offices which are supposed to be listening to the people, have the final say. The board can only recommend. These decision bodies can accept, reject or vary the recommendation contained in the assessment.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incredible thing about the bill is that timelines will be created under regulations for the decision bodies to issue their decisions. The bill specifies no timelines for the assessment board and its offices to deliver assessments to these decision bodies.  That means the board can make its own decisions as to how long it wants to take to complete an assessment. People who do the labour of assessment get to decide how long they will take to finish their work, the while development will be held up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that the regulations will decide about the timelines and the fact that the regulations are not submitted along with the bill.  Normally, the government submits the regulations after the bill is debated in the House.  All members in the House passionately debate bills and passionately vote on bills, but without knowing the contents of a bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is in the habit of submitting the intent of the bill without any substance or subject matter.   The subject matter and the substance comes through the back door by way of regulations. Why does the government not submit all  regulations with the legislation when the legislation is tabled in the House so we can debate them and vote on them?   We could then understand what the bill means. The government is not governing; it is ruling through the back door.  Eighty per cent of the substance that we see in the law in Canada comes through the back door by way of regulations not debated in the House.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, which is supposed to scrutinize those regulations, has very limited powers.  The committee cannot even scrutinize regulations made by the delegation of authority to various agencies and boards.  The disallowance procedure is not on statutory footing, but I will talk about that another day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a non-partisan issue. The House needs to have a disallowance procedure for those regulations which are submitted through the back door to be scrutinized properly.  If committee members decide that those regulations are not fair enough, or they are not legal or they are not valid, then they should be disallowed. That procedure should be on statutory footing, but it is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen years ago a committee set up a temporary experimental procedure to see if the procedure would work.  For 16 years we have been following that temporary procedure rather than putting the statutory disallowance procedure on statutory footing.  However that is for another day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has a history of  foot dragging in completing assessments, and we have seen this in relation to the mining industry. Timelines should have been imposed on the board by the legislation itself, not by the regulations. The bill fails the people of Yukon in this important respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the bill fails to provide the people of Yukon with a true devolution of power as the minister has been touting.  It also fails to provide a timely way to assess and approve projects so that they can get off the ground and development can begin in Yukon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is particularly shameful is the way in which the Liberals have concealed their failure to the people of Yukon by telling them the opposite of what the bill will do.  The first thing mentioned in a Liberal press release was that the bill would hand over power to the people of Yukon.   Once again we see the Liberals playing their power games with other levels of government.  We are seeing again  that confrontation between the provincial and territorial governments.   The Liberals are hoping their public relations material will be slick enough that the public will not catch on.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Canadian Alliance are opposed to the passage of this bill and will vote against it in the true interests of the people of Yukon.  I am sure people of Yukon will understand. I wish the hon. member representing Yukon had some influence on the government in addressing these issues.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450285"></A><a HREF="#Int-450293"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450273"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and indicate on behalf of the New Democratic Party of Canada that we will be supporting Bill C-2. We are pleased at the progress this demonstrates in terms of transferring authority and control to the first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not see the bill, assuming it will pass into law and eventually be the law, as a panacea for all of the problems that will be confronted by the Yukon government and the first nations in Yukon with regard to environmental assessments. There are problems with the bill.  However, because we have waited so long, we are at that stage where the party feels we must move ahead.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that over the next number of years some of the problems that have been identified and that I will make reference to today will come to the fore.  They will require either amendments to the legislation or some very generous interpretations to broaden the scope of the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns we have with the legislation is that it will supersede the Canadian environmental assessment legislation. As the party representative on the environment committee, I have just gone through the review of that legislation.  That legislation and the amendments to it will be coming before the House sometime between now and the spring. I am concerned because some of the amendments we made to it are not necessarily reflected in this legislation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, going back to our support of the legislation, we see this as an initial stage.  I will not say that it is an experiment, as we are beyond that, but it is the initial stage of having the first nations of this country take greater control of the environmental assessment process.  For that reason alone, in spite of our concern about potential conflicts between the Canadian environmental assessment legislation and this bill, the Yukon environmental and socio-economic assessment act, we believe that it should go ahead, and we should develop experience from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other concerns we have is that the legislation is not clear enough, we believe, as to how assessments will be dealt with when they cross boundaries, whether it is dealing with Alaska or with other parts of Canada, with the territories or British Columbia.  It is quite possible, and I think of the pipeline in particular with the potential for pipelines coming out of the north, that it will require a number of jurisdictions to have environmental assessments.  How that will be resolved, how the assessment process will take place when we have multi-jurisdictions, is not at all resolved in the legislation. That is a problem that will have to be dealt with at some time in the future and potentially in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I will digress for a moment, if I may.  Anyone who has looked at the territories and the north generally recognizes  that they are under tremendous pressure and will be even more so in the next number of years from major endeavours to develop, whether it be in the mining sector, and the diamond mines are probably the best example, or in oil and gas. There is going to be tremendous pressure put on the governments, both in the north and in the provinces immediately adjacent to the north, to deal with how or whether those projects should go ahead. I would suggest that this legislation is going to be tested very early on and probably repeatedly.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has some very good points in it. I think the major one is that it is not strictly the traditional environmental assessment approach.  It does take into account and in fact give priority to socio-economic issues. It does not ignore, as we have on a number of occasions with the existing environmental assessment legislation, historical and cultural issues and topics. In fact, it makes it mandatory that they be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations who were consulted extensively in this process insisted on that being in the legislation, and rightfully so. I believe it is going to give us an opportunity, perhaps for the first time on the globe, for those issues to be taken into account significantly.  We can point to other examples around the globe where assessment legislation will sometimes look at those issues almost as the periphery of the environmental assessment hearings that go on, but in Yukon they will be front and centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that  we will see situations, and I am going to use an example, where perhaps a significant mining development wanting to proceed, that being the proposal that is before the hearing, will be confronted with the reality that there is a regional fishery that is very fundamental to that community, that forms the basis of that community. The importance of that historical fishery will be given prominence and may in fact override the need to have that mine developed. Given the fragility that we find in our northern territories, it is important and crucial that in fact those considerations be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations have argued strenuously in a number of areas, and we were confronted with this in the species at risk legislation, that traditional knowledge be given equal weight with what I will call European science. It was accepted in that particular piece of legislation and it is incorporated into this one also. It recognizes that the scientific technology and techniques that we have developed are not perfect.  They are at times certainly not the best method to assess the significance of developments on the natural  environment. In fact, the traditional knowledge that comes out of the first nations will be at times, in some cases many times, a better technique to be used. Again, as I said, that traditional knowledge, that concept, that principle, is incorporated into this legislation.  It is an important step forward to be doing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the board and the executive committee I believe calls for commentary as well, because it reflects the importance of the first nations and local communities being involved in the process.  The board will be composed of members of the first nations.  Also, they will  have not a majority but a significant representation at the executive committee, which is a three member committee.  It will have one member from the first nations and one appointed by the government and then those two people will choose the third person. The larger board is roughly equally balanced between the local communities and first nations and the appointments from the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the needs, the desires and the decision making will be flowing from the local community, not from the south.  These will be people who know their communities, know their regions and know their territory. They will know what is best for it, where they want it to go and where they want to take it, what they want to save and what they want to develop. This is built into the legislation and I believe it is one of the strong points of the legislation.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some debate and some criticism of the legislation over what will be considered.  There is what is being touted in the legislation,  the project list regulator, which will be the body that will determine which activities are subject to assessment and which are not. The goal of that body is to catch those projects that pose a potential risk to the environment and/or that have socio-economic impacts.  It will also take into account and ensure that activities which do not pose any risk, either to the natural environment or with socio-economic impacts, will be cleared quickly and will not be assessed because they do not need to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make, which is both a strength and I think also a weakness in that it does not go far enough, is that of the cumulative impact. This has been a real weakness in the Canadian environmental assessment legislation to this point. We have attempted to deal with it in amendments that will be coming before the House shortly.  I do not think we did so successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally so, I do not think that this legislation is broad enough.  It is one of the areas where some very generous interpretation is going to have to occur in order to take into account fully the cumulative impact of a series of developments and those developments impacting on the natural environment. One small mine may not be a problem, but if it is the first of a chain of mines in that particular region it may in fact be a major problem.  More of that work and the questioning of cumulative impact has to be taken into account at earlier stages than what we have traditionally done under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>

Every day pharmacists make a significant difference in the lives of Canadians by providing expert information and advice on health and medication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most accessible health care provider, pharmacists are always available to answer questions, give professional advice and ensure better health outcomes for all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore no surprise that pharmacists were recently chosen as the most trusted professional by the public at large. As we undergo health care reform, Canadians will see the role of the pharmacist continue to expand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future we will see greater participation by pharmacists in medication management programs, patient safety initiatives and full involvement in new primary health care teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all Canadians to join us in celebrating and thanking Canadian pharmacists for a job well done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This private member's bill would amend the Criminal Code by providing for the imposition of a minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of two years upon a second or subsequent conviction for the offence of breaking and entering where the offence was committed in relation to a dwelling house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A break and enter offence is much more than a property offence. It is a crime against the person. It is a crime that violates a person's home, often the only refuge of private ownership and privacy left for Canadians to enjoy. It also has the potential to be a violent crime because every break and enter is potentially a home invasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have been making this bill non-votable despite Canada-wide support from police organizations. For a change, can the Liberals listen to Canadians and do something about the break and enter problem? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous is run entirely by volunteers  and supported by corporate and government sponsors. It takes a lot of hard work and an unbelievable amount of energy to make this annual event such a success.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday a Sea King crashed on the deck of the HMCS <i>Iroquois</i> on the way to the war front, not because of the enemy but because the government treats the military like some kind of useless appendage to a state that prefers to distribute wealth rather than creating wealth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalization affects women particularly, through their working conditions, increasing poverty, health and education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are to preserve their gains, women have to be alert to the negative effects of globalization and ensure that their voices are heard in the debate on this phenomenon.</p>

It is a time for all Canadians to experience a part of their history and explore role models that they might not have recognized before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly Killingbeck is an athlete, a coach, a leader and just one of many shining examples of female black Canadian role models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killingbeck began her love of sports at a young age with her love of running.  Through dedication and hard work, she trained to become one of Canada's top female athletes in track and field.  Her love of sport propelled her to many heights, from coaching the gold medal winning men's relay team in 1996 to her current position as an athlete services manager with the National Sport Centre of Ontario. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following her experiences, she was inspired to campaign for a tighter anti-drug program.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dedication and a healthy dose of fun keep Killingbeck strongly connected to the world of sport. As a coach, Killingbeck works to instill qualities in athletes that they can use on and off the track.  For her, it is important to see all athletes as people first before viewing them as performers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members to please join me in saluting Molly Killingbeck and all black Canadians who are role models for Canadian youth. </p>

There is a better idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals should start giving provinces their fair share of gas tax revenue.  Thirty eight per cent of what we are paying at the pumps goes into government coffers.  The government rakes in nearly $5 billion in gas taxes annually, but it spends merely $113 million on roadway development, just two and a quarter per cent. As gasoline prices soar, so do government revenues as the Liberals continue to charge taxes on taxes.  The Ottawa gas tax rip-off is highway robbery.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation is critical to B.C.'s economy and public safety.  Money is needed for repairs to the Sea to Sky Highway and public transit, but instead the government has one boondoggle after another.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should dedicate more of the gasoline taxes to highway spending, eliminate the one and a half cent per litre deficit-financing gasoline tax and stop charging GST on gasoline taxes.</p>

David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, we have been consistent in dealing with this matter in the last few days.  The fact is that the present code of conduct did emanate from certain deliberations made by the former government and following Justice Parker's report, and we have followed those procedures. In the case of the former minister of finance, he followed all the rules and that has been confirmed by the ethics counsellor.</p><A NAME="Int-450359"></A><a HREF="#Int-450362"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450357"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance): </b>Maybe he followed all the rules, but the rules should be changed, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former finance minister is not covered by a blind trust but by a one of a kind supervisory agreement, whatever that is. That allows him to have direct input into his company. He now says that as Prime Minister he would change that and make an even better deal for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethics should apply to all cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister.  Why should the government ethics package allow a special deal for this Prime Minister wannabe?</p><A NAME="Int-450362"></A><a HREF="#Int-450365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450359"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former finance minister's proposal for avoiding conflicts of interest, though, is to simply excuse himself from cabinet. When his businesses and personal holdings are directly affected by almost every government department, he will certainly be spending a lot of time in the hallways. Will the government commit to ethics guidelines that prohibit the Prime Minister from having personal control over his holdings?  Yes or no.</p><A NAME="Int-450368"></A><a HREF="#Int-450370"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

The former finance minister had a special supervisory deal and has now asked for yet another tailor-made arrangement.  Entrepreneurs in cabinet have only two options: to divest themselves of their assets or to put those assets into a true, and I emphasize true, blind trust. Will the government now admit that the only way to remove the perception of a conflict of interest is to have ministers divest themselves of private holdings as they do in the United States?</p><A NAME="Int-450374"></A><a HREF="#Int-450377"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450370"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, to repeat, the former minister of finance followed all the rules.  He conducted himself in an exemplary fashion while he was in cabinet. The issue of the meetings and what was discussed at the meetings has been reported on by the ethics commissioner, who said that there was no cause for concern in any of the meetings which he attended.</p><A NAME="Int-450377"></A><a HREF="#Int-450380"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450374"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, the only reason the former finance minister was able to follow all the rules is that they were so loose he could drive one of his ships right through them. The former finance minister received numerous private briefings from the Liberals' very own ethics counsellor. How many and on what issues, both of them refuse to say. Why is it  the job of the ethics counsellor to protect the wannabe Prime Minister from public relations embarrassment? </p><A NAME="Int-450380"></A><a HREF="#Int-450382"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450377"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

I hope that the hon. member would reflect upon the kinds of accusations he has made against Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that for any discussions that have gone on, and these meetings are for Mr. Wilson or the former minister of finance to talk about publicly, we are assured that all of the rules were followed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to recognize that there are parties other than the German government involved. There are also the Americans, the British and others who are threatening to go to war without the Security Council.

For example, comments made in the B.C. legislature last week made it clear that the minister had no credibility with the B.C. Liberal government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of saying no to the development. It is saying that if we wish to have development, we have to analyze what the benefits and costs from an environmental point of view might be. That is all I have asked for, that we have a proper assessment of the potential impact of this industry on the environment of the west coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  a five point program to  do a study to make sure that we understand fully whether the sea lice problem is increased by aquaculture in those areas and to make sure that we minimize the risk. It is our belief that we can have both an aquaculture industry and at the same time protect the wild salmon resource. It is very important that our first priority be  the wild salmon resource.</p>

Don Boudria (Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, this is in fact not a new question of privilege. It refers to something that was raised in the House yesterday. I committed yesterday to return to the House on the question of privilege at the earliest opportunity, which of course is today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the hon. member for St. Albert asked  about details on the firearms funding in the supplementary estimates by way of a question of privilege.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $77.5 million was requested for Justice in the supplementary estimates.  Of this amount, $59.4 million was requested in support of the Canadian firearms program, of which $50.5 million is in  Justice vote 1, operating,  and $8.8 is in vote 5, contributions. The remaining $18 million is to cover four additional items, namely: incremental funding--which has an asterisk beside  it and I will get back to that in a moment--to address core operational requirements, $16.4 million; public security and anti-terrorism initiatives, $.4 million; additional operating costs, $1 million; and partnering with the voluntary sector, $.2 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of Treasury Board vote 5 for Justice, as it was alleged yesterday, in the 2002-03 supplementary estimates part B, the member for St. Albert also asked whether  Treasury Board vote 5 was used for firearms funding.  As I answered yesterday, and I am willing to provide more detail now, the answer is no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated yesterday, $14 million was provided from Treasury Board vote 5 specifically for prosecution and legal costs associated with an increased workload in drug prosecution.  When the minister appears before committee he can give details of that. That is the custom. The remainder is for aboriginal litigation cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The asterisk in the supplementary estimates denotes the fact that the request was made by the Minister of Justice for access to vote 5 for this specific item only. The department will use this temporary allocation only for this purpose.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that all departmental expenditures in either the main or supplementary estimates are approved by Parliament and reported in the public accounts, which of course ultimately is the verification method.  They are subsequently reviewed, as we know, and verified by the Office of the Auditor General.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House on this.  I hope it will assist the Chair in making its decision as to whether or not the privileges have been breached, which of course we maintain they have not.</p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450597"></A><a HREF="#Int-450598"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450594"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I think the government House leader is just trying to deflect the whole issue. </p>

It proposes to change the Income Tax Act to require the government to have a doctor overrule a doctor's report.  Currently a disabled person applying for a disability tax credit is required to have a doctor's report.  Revenue Canada should be held to the same standard.  Only a doctor should ever be able to overrule another doctor's report.  That is not the case now.</p><A NAME="PT-3"></A><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)</font>

<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>
<center><b>Question No. 45--</b></center><b>Mr. John Cummins</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Mefloquine adverse event monitoring
					 report received on August 26, 2002 by Health Canada indicating a murder and an
					 attempted suicide: (<i>a</i>) what investigation has been carried out by Health
					 Canada and other government agencies; and (<i>b</i>) what was the result of
					 these investigations? </p><b>Mr. Geoff Regan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</b>:
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am informed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Adverse Drug Reporting Monitoring Program,
					 CADRMP, in Health Canada is responsible for the collection and assessment of
					 adverse reactions that have been submitted by health professionals or
					 consumers, either directly or through manufacturers. Information on all
					 reported adverse reactions is maintained in a computerized database and is used
					 as part of the continuing assessment of marketed health products. It is
					 important to remember that reports to the CADRMP represent the suspicion,
					 opinion or observation of the individual reporter. Cause and effect
					 relationships have not been established. Adverse reaction information is used
					 to help ensure the benefits of a marketed health product continue to outweigh
					 the risks, to continuously update the labelling and product information for a
					 marketed health product and to inform health care professionals and consumers
					 about adverse reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since mefloquine was marketed in Canada, 1993 to
					 October 8, 2002, the Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program, CADRMP, has
					 received a total of 65 reports in which mefloquine was listed as suspected or
					 interacting drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada analyzes adverse reaction reports to
					 discover potential health product safety signals. A signal is considered to be
					 the preliminary indication of a product related issue, for example a report of
					 an unusual or unexpected adverse event, or an increase in the number of reports
					 of a particular adverse event. The identification of a signal is not by itself
					 the proof of the association of an adverse reaction to a health product but it
					 triggers the need to further investigate a potential association. Health
					 Canada’s regulatory actions are based on a scientific analysis of cases and are
					 taken according to the regulatory framework in place. This includes updating
					 the product monograph. Since Lariam, mefloquine, was approved in 1993, the
					 Product Monograph has been revised seven times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada continues to monitor the adverse reaction
					 profile of mefloquine. The Marketed Health Products and Therapeutic Products
					 Directorates are working in collaboration to ensure that measures are taken to
					 address safety issues and make sure that the information in the Canadian
					 Product Monograph is accurate, current and reflective of the Canadian
					 experience. With regard to Lariam, mefloquine, there was a communique in the
					 Canadian Adverse Reactions Newsletter, Volume 8, No 1, January 1998, on the
					 neuropsychiatric reactions with the prophylactic use of this antimalarial drug.
					 The Canadian Product Monograph of Lariam, mefloquine, contains all information
					 on very rare neuropsychiatric reactions reported in some patients as well as
					 cautions to be considered by physicians when prescribing this drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because information that could identify the patient or
					 the reporter in an adverse reaction report is confidential as per section 19(1)
					 of the Access to Information Act, Health Canada cannot comment on
					 investigations of any case by Health Canada or other government
					 agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Defence:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The Department of National Defence reviewed the
					 report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Given that the report deals with incidents that the
					 Department examined in the past, no further investigation is deemed
					 warranted.</p>
<center><b>Question No. 105--</b></center><b>Mr. Jim Pankiw</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to cancer and cancer research in Canada
					 for each of the previously recorded nine fiscal years, what has Health Canada
					 determined to be: (<i>a</i>) the incidence and fatality rates for breast cancer
					 within the female population expressed as a percentage of all Canadian women;
					 (<i>b</i>) the incidence and fatality rates for prostate cancer within the male
					 population expressed as a percentage of all Canadian men; (<i>c</i>) the total
					 amount of federal tax dollars put towards breast cancer research; (<i>d</i>)
					 the total amount of federal tax dollars put towards prostate cancer research;
					 (<i>e</i>) the provinces and territories in which mammograms are paid for by
					 publicly-funded health care insurance when used as a tool in the early
					 detection of breast cancer; and (<i>f</i>) the provinces and territories in
					 which prostate specific antigen tests are paid for by publicly-funded health
					 care insurance when used as a tool in the early detection of prostate
					 cancer?</p><b>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Health, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  Breast cancer continues to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer for women.  One in nine women are expected to develop breast cancer and one in twenty-seven are expected to die of the disease.  Following small but steady annual increases over three decades, breast cancer incidence among women levelled off in 1993.  Mortality rates for breast cancer have declined steadily since 1986.  This pattern of divergent trends is consistent with the benefits being achieved through screening programs and improved treatments.</p>The table below indicates the incidence and mortality* rates for breast cancer, female only, in Canada for the years 1990 to 1999.  <table summary="The table below indicates the incidence and mortality* rates for breast cancer, female only, in Canada for the years 1990 to 1999.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Prostate cancer will continue to be the most frequently occurring cancer for Canadian men.  One in eight men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime, mostly after age 70 and one in twenty-eight will die of the disease.  Beginning in 1994, incidence rates* for prostate cancer began to decline after having increased rapidly for several years.  Mortality rates for prostate cancer peaked between 1991 and 1995 and have fallen since.  Increases in prostate cancer incidence in the early 1990's were likely due to the rapid increase in the use of early detection techniques.</p>The table below indicates the incidence and mortality* rates for prostate cancer in Canadian men for the years 1990 to 1999.  <table summary="The table below indicates the incidence and mortality* rates for prostate cancer in Canadian men for the years 1990 to 1999.

The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an act to establish a process for assessing the environmental and socio-economic effects of certain activities in Yukon, be read the third time and passed.
</p><A NAME="Int-450643"></A><a HREF="#Int-450648"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450675"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker,  I can assure my Progressive Conservative Party friend from Manitoba, my friends from the opposite side of the House,  and you, Madam Speaker, that I do not intend to use all of the 27 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did wish to raise one additional point. There is another concern that I believe the Yukon Territory is going to have to confront, assuming this legislation does proceed. That is the conflict in the territories with regard to outstanding land claims. The land claim issue of course is a problem across the country. Yukon is no exception to that, but there is a particular concern in Yukon because of the pressure that is being exerted on that territory in terms of the demands that we have for fossil fuel and the building of a pipeline that would cross the Yukon Territory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, there were various proposals outstanding for different pipelines, but one proposal would have fuel flow out of Alaska through the southern part of Yukon down through British Columbia and Alberta. The land that is in the area in the southern part of the Yukon Territory is subject to a land claim that, like so many others, has been outstanding for quite some time. This legislation, if it is applied to the proposal for the pipeline to run through that area, is also going to be confronted with how we deal with that proposal when we have an outstanding land claim. What role does that first nation play? It is not the only area in the territory where this is a potential problem. It obviously behooves this government to move as quickly as possible to resolve those land claims. On behalf of the NDP, I highlight this as a concern as to how this legislation is going to be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of summary, let me say that the NDP is in support of this legislation. We believe it has some innovative features which make it mandatory that it be supported. I have expressed today, as has the member for Winnipeg Centre in the past, certain concerns about the legislation, but it does enhance significantly the role that the first nations will play in the environmental assessment process. It introduces to a much more significant degree socio-economic issues, particularly cultural and heritage matters. It brings into play the cumulative impact principle. Finally, this legislation has had a significant amount of consultation with the first nations, with the government of the Yukon Territory and with local communities in Yukon. On that basis we will be supporting the legislation.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450648"></A><a HREF="#Int-450653"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450643"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, I am speaking to  legislation that  was taken through committee by my colleague from Dauphin--Swan River who, unfortunately, cannot be here today. He has been absent from the House and committee in the past while, although  I know members of the committee miss his important influence and input into the committee work.  I know they miss him because he does have a  good grasp on what is happening with regard to first nations issues.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stood in the House and spoken in favour of Bill C-2 previously on behalf of my colleague from Dauphin--Swan River, and I  will again   reiterate the support of the Progressive Conservative Party for Bill C-2.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Tuesday  a vote was held in the House on an amendment to Bill C-2.  The original amendment was proposed by the member for Dauphin--Swan River and passed at the   committee. It said that any future changes to regulations were to be brought before the standing committee  before being published in the <i>Canada Gazette</i> or before coming  into force.  Effectively the committee agreed with  this as being  a good amendment, that before any of the regulation changes were to go forward and be  gazetted  they would come  back to the parliamentary committee.  What an innovative way of doing business in the House that in fact parliamentarians and the committee, which  knows how   the regulations would affect this   legislation, would be able to deal with it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even though the committee accepted and approved the amendment, it came back to the House and the minister felt that it was a little beneath him to take an amendment from an opposition member of the committee so he  decided last Tuesday to do away with it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat disappointed with the member for Yukon.  I respect him and his ability to bring this legislation to the House.  I respect the passion by which he has dealt with this legislation.  However I have to admit that I am disappointed that the member for Yukon did not stand up and support what the committee had done to bring  this legislation forward and support  the amendment.  This would be a  small chastisement of the member for Yukon, an individual who has put his heart and soul into this legislation, and who, as I said earlier,  I respect for what he has done in the past but perhaps cannot respect him quite that much for not supporting this amendment coming forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we do support  it.   We believe it is a good step forward.  We believe   the process was a good process, right up until the committee amendment was defeated in the House,   but it  brought together basically three levels of government, and I say that with some trepidation,  but it was the federal government, the territorial government and the Council of Yukon Indians  which represented the majority of the aboriginal governments within Yukon.  I believe 11 of the 14   were represented at the table.  That is good, co-operative federalism at work.  I wish other departments and other ministers would consider that co-operative federalism when dealing with their own portfolios. They could probably learn a lesson from the minister in this particular case when they did go out and did use  the consultative process  and used it well, I might add,  in order to bring all  those parties to the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it also does is it  creates the process whereby environmental and socio-economic effects of a wide range of development activities are carefully assessed and considered before a project is approved.  That is also very positive. This puts a process in place that will allow developments to go forward without having all parties throwing unnecessary barriers or roadblocks in the way.  The ultimate result will be increased opportunity for economic development within the Yukon territory.  That in itself is extremely positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also establish  a development assessment process which would  oversee development proposals within a province, which is, as I just said, a  proposal that obviously would assist the process as opposed to having roadblocks thrown in its way.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some concerns, as was mentioned earlier by my colleague from Windsor and by  other sitting members. The fact   is that the benefits of the bill certainly outweigh all   the negatives. As I say, it   speaks to the insensitivity of not only the minister  but certainly of the member who brought it forward, in not allowing what we consider to be a very important amendment that was  brought forward and accepted by the committee but which was then taken out of the system in a back door fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want it on record that the Progressive Conservative Party will support Bill C-2 in its final reading. I appreciate the fact that the first nations in   Yukon   have the ability to more forward as well as they should.</p><A NAME="Int-450653"></A><a HREF="#Int-450654"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450648"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed from February 25 consideration of the motion that Bill C-6, an act to establish the Canadian Centre for the Independent Resolution of First Nations Specific Claims to provide for the filing, negotiation and resolution of specific claims and to make related amendments to other Acts, be read the third time and passed.
</p><A NAME="Int-450660"></A><a HREF="#Int-450671"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, there is no party in the House that wants to speed up the resolution of land claims more than the Canadian Alliance.  We have seen and experienced firsthand the awful economic impact Liberal dawdling has had on the economies of our constituencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no party in the House that wants a fair and just land claims settlement program more than the Alliance Party.  We have seen and experienced firsthand the grievous financial injury done to individuals who were sideswiped by land claims and lost their grazing leases or even their private property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party wants an independent land claims body more than the Alliance because we know what political meddling and influence peddling can do to thwart just settlements and fair and just treatment of all concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation, an act to establish the Canadian centre for the independent resolution of first nations specific claims, will not speed up the resolution of claims, particularly larger, more costly claims such as in British Columbia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All one has to do is consider the proposed process for settlement.  A first nation submits a claim to the proposed commission, at which time research funding is allocated by the commission to the first nation.  All interested parties are notified and preparatory meetings are facilitated. How long that first step will take is anyone's guess, but we know how slowly the wheels of commissions can turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the first step, the Crown must decide whether  to accept the claim.  One would think that before allocating research money to the first nation making the claim that some decision on the validity of the claim would be made before throwing money out the window.  That is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step two has not finished.  If the Crown refuses the claim after having handed over the research money, the first nation can ask for dispute resolution led by the commission.  Keep an eye on that wheel to see if there is any movement.  If the request for dispute resolution or dispute resolution fails, the first nation can ask the commission to refer the matter to a tribunal to ponder the validity of the claim. I should note here that we are still in what the government calls step two of this process and only just completing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step three is if the claim is accepted as valid by the Crown or the tribunal, then the matter reverts back to the commission which will lead the negotiations with the first nation on the amount and the amount will never be allowed to exceed $7 million. I state again, that leaves British Columbia out of the process. However, if those commission led negotiations fail,  the first nation can demand that the matter be referred back to the tribunal for a binding decision on the amount of compensation to a maximum of $7 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those three steps alone could take years.  Whatever happened to the speedy settlement of land claims, particularly those that are worth $7 million or less?  It is not speeding anything up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its wording, the government uses the term “independent”.  We must take issue with that.  The Prime Minister will appoint the chief, the  vice-chief commissioners and the other five commissioners.  The Prime Minister will also appoint the chief and the vice-chief adjudicators and the other five adjudicators.  He will determine what they will be paid and what their travel and living allowances will be. How independent are those 14 individuals going to be if the Prime Minister appoints them?  Will they be as independent as the ethics counsellor?  There will be suspicions and allegations from the outset of  patronage and partiality. Those accusations and suspicions will tarnish the legitimacy and the credibility of the centre before it even gets off the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also disturbing to read that the Canadian centre for the independent resolution of first nations specific claims will determine its own staffing requirements. We have seen enough over the years to know that when a so-called independent body is left to determine its own staffing needs, there is an out of control bureaucracy in the making. I could cite several examples.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to ask this.  Who will represent the vast majority of Canadians in this new process, the other stakeholders?  By vast majority I mean all the people who pay taxes.  Who will stand up for the taxpayer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  system like this that avoids accountability for government stonewalling and discourages alternative dispute mechanisms over costly court cases is a potentially huge waste of scarce and hard earned tax dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find fault in the clause that says that the centre will submit quarterly reports on the values of all settlements to the minister.  It does not say that the minister will immediately turn those quarterly reports over to the House for parliamentary scrutiny. We have seen what happened to the firearms registry and how true costs were hidden by the justice department.  We have seen billion dollar HRDC disasters that the department tried to hide from Parliament.  We know that Canada Customs and Revenue is desperately trying to hide the true losses taxpayers are suffering from the GST fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the House feel assured that the minister will pass on the true costs of all these $7 million maximum settlements?  By true costs, I mean the settlements plus the bureaucratic costs.  The question remains, where is there anything in the legislation that suggests the taxpayers have somebody standing up for them in this process?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a lot from the Liberal side of the House about transparency in government.   Liberals seem to have a bit of difficulty determining what transparency and what translucency is.  When we say transparency, we mean see through.  They have a different version of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reading this over it appears that lip service is being paid to transparency in government but nothing is being done about it.  There is no transparency in the legislation. Government members on the Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development  and Natural Resources voted against all the amendments that would have required the government to declare openly its reasons for deciding against a claim or for holding up the claim process.  Where is the transparency in that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for speeding up the process, why is there no mandated timeline in the process?  Why are there plenty of loopholes in here so as to permit the government to delay and stonewall.  Every amendment put forward in committee to discourage stonewalling and delay was defeated by the Liberal members of the committee on orders handed down by the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have, for over 100 years, treated our aboriginal people with indifference and even contempt.  These half measures to make amends will be seen through by the first nation people.  Maybe that is where they are talking about transparency because it is the only thing transparent in the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that the proposed legislation will not bring speedy resolution to their claims.  They have seen the wheels of government turn and they know how long it takes to even get the wheels moving.  They know how agonizingly long it will take for a full revolution of those wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will rightly feel betrayed by the Prime Minister and the author of the 1993 Liberal red book who happens to be the former finance minister.  He wrote the Liberal promise that an independent claims commission would be jointly appointed by first nations and the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation breaks the promise of the Liberals and the former finance minister because it concentrates the power in the hands of the Prime Minister by making him the only person who can appoint the members of the centre for independent resolution of first nation specific claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If first nations people feel betrayed, it is no surprise.  It is just one more broken Liberal promise in 150 years worth of broken Liberal promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is not worthy of support.  That is why on this side of the House the official opposition will oppose it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-6, an act to establish the Canadian Centre for the Independent Resolution of First Nations Specific Claims to provide for the filing, negotiation and resolution of specific claims and to make related amendments to other Acts, be read the third time and passed.
</p><A NAME="Int-450673"></A><a HREF="#Int-450683"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450671"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand today and speak to the third reading of the Bill C-6, the first nations specific resolutions claims act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill aims to modify the current specific claims process by creating a new administrative body which will include a commission to facilitate claims, negotiations and dispute resolutions, as well as a tribunal to make binding decisions on the validity of claims and compensation awards to a prescribed maximum per claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should try to locate the bill in the context of other bills involving aboriginal people. This is part of a series of new legislations that make up the most comprehensive review of the Indian Act in modern history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Specific Claims Commission, the ICC, was established in 1992 by order in council as a temporary independent advisory body to review specific claims that have been rejected by government and to issue non-binding decisions. This limited mandate has frustrated commission members and aboriginal claimants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ICC has called for a permanent independent specific claims commission. This has been on the Liberal agenda since the 1993 pre-election agenda. As it stands now, claims are presented to the Canadian government for review and acceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 a Joint First Nations-Canada task force began considering the structure and the authority of this commission and submitted a report containing a model bill for a new specific claims body. Although the new legislation in question makes massive changes to the JTF report, the proposed Bill C-6 will replace the ICC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with interest to the comments of the member before me who expressed a great deal of disappointment with the bill and a sense of betrayal for native people. New Democrats feel the same. We have a lot of difficulties with the bill and  I would like to go through some of our concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the other bills included within the ministry's suite of first nations legislation, such as Bill  C-7, the governance act, and Bill C-19, the fiscal institutions act, this bill would further damage the relationship between the government and the first nations as it would arbitrarily impose legislation upon the first nations people regardless of their input and their massive objection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treaties are nation to nation agreements that date back over 300 years and are central building blocks to the creation of Canada. They are legally protected under section 35 of the Constitution of Canada. Bill C-6 does not respect the spirit of those treaties, and as such it is unconstitutional. The government is in conflict of interest in this instance. It is both the defence and the adjudicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill, the government has not created the independent and impartial committee for which was asked. Instead the minister has the last say about everything in the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 dismisses the role of the Assembly of First Nations when it comes to their inherent right to self-government. Not only does the bill dismiss the government-AFN joint task force report model bill, but nowhere does the legislation even mention the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to dismissing the joint task force report, the consultation process regarding Bill C-6 has been a joke. The committee set aside only three weeks for Bill C-6 and this included everything from introduction to all witnesses, to clause to clause revisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the joint task force report, there is no provision in Bill C-6 for appointments, renewals and approvals to require the consent of the AFN as well as the federal government. All appointments, such as the chief executive officer, commissioners and the tribunal will be made on the recommendation of the minister alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with this picture? It has to be fairly obvious. Faced with constantly being dependent upon the federal government for reappointment, members will feel the pressure of wanting to be favourably regarded by the government. Thus the members will not be seen to be free to make a decision against the very government that would be responsible for their reappointment.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other flaws in this legislation.  With Bill C-6, the minister also has control over the so-called independent bodies through its ability to add more members whenever he or she pleases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Bill C-6 ignores the JTF report and dramatically and arbitrarily narrows the definition of specific claim in the following way.  It excludes obligations arising under treaties and agreements that do not deal with lands or assets. Second, it excludes unilateral federal undertakings to provide lands or assets. Third, it excludes claims based on laws of Canada that were United Kingdom statutes or royal proclamations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also severely limits access to the tribunal by denying all claims that are over the cap of $7 million.  That amount can be unilaterally defined by the federal cabinet.  It can be lowered as well as raised.  The majority of claims, whose content deal with land, damages or loss issues, will be seeking compensation that is above that cap.  The Indian claims commission reports that out of 120 claims they have dealt with, only three were worth less than $7 million.  It is not meeting the needs of claimants in this regard whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay is a major problem in the current system as well.  It explains much of the current backlog estimated to be over 550 claims.  Bill C-6 does not create any independent or impartial body designed to clear up that huge claim backlog.  Instead, it is an instrument that enables the federal government to closely control the pace of settlements and decisions by granting the minister the power to consider a claim indefinitely at an early stage in the process. There are no time limits for compliance that must be observed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 authorizes the federal government to delay the claims resolution process.  It does so in the following ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No claim can proceed to alternate dispute resolution administered by the commission or the tribunal without the consideration and the approval of the minister. Bill C-6 says that no delay in responding can ever constitute constructive denial. A first nation cannot take a claim to the tribunal unless all alternative dispute resolution is exhausted and it must wait for the minister to deem that process exhausted. The government can request additional preparatory meetings even if the first nation does not think that it is necessary. If a first nation ever amends a claim during commission proceedings, the claim cannot proceed to the commission until the minister has considered the amendment. Finally, the government can delay by unilaterally lowering the cap on the overall amount of potential awards that a tribunal can issue in a given year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that Bill C-6 favours the government by requiring the first nation to disclose all the facts and laws it is relying on before it reaches the tribunal.  It does not require the same transparency from the government. The government sets the rules and controls the system by which it governs itself.  This proposed process is not an independent or impartial process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely insulting to the Assembly of First Nations and to native people across the country that the government asked the AFN to take part in the joint task force in 1998 responsible for making recommendations in this regard and then it completely ignored the model bill which it proposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations leadership wants changes to the Indian Act and they welcome change.  Yet Bill C-6 has generated an unprecedented degree of animosity and disgust.  Partly because of the content, but more important because of the process that animosity has occurred. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will finish by saying that the NDP will not be supporting Bill C-6.  It is not a constructive bill at this point in time and it is causing damage to relationships with native people.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450683"></A><a HREF="#Int-450687"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450673"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, I find it rather ironic that I rose to speak in support of Bill C-2 just prior to Bill C-6.  All of the accolades that I gave to Bill C-2 with respect to the consultative process, to all parties not only being involved in the process but being supportive of the process are absolutely and totally changed when we come to Bill C-6.  In fact, it is the same minister and  department, but it is like night and day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 has not had a consultative process.  It has not listened to the joint task force of 1998.  It has not brought all of the stakeholders together in a consultative process.  It is frankly one of the worst piece of legislation that the ministry could bring forward. Here we have two examples, one a good example and one a deplorable example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I rise on behalf of my colleague, the member for Dauphin--Swan River, who has been instrumental in speaking in opposition to the bill.  I would  like to reiterate the position of the Progressive Conservative Party that we cannot support  Bill C-6 at third reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said by the member from the NDP, there are a number of shortcomings in the bill, not the least of which is the limit of the commission of  $7 million for the tribunal.  We recognize when we are dealing with land claims, when we are having to make necessary commitments to those land claims, that the majority of them are well over the limit of $7 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it is simply a matter of  the government putting in place another roadblock where it does not have to deal with the real issue of settling these land claims, and simply delays and delays. As usual the government feels it can stick its head in the sand often enough and long enough with whatever the issue. Whether it be EH-101 helicopters,  health care, taxation, gas prices or land claims, it sticks its head in the sand and eventually it thinks that people will either forget or the issue will go away. It will not and it cannot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in this particular case what the government would like to do with its proposals in Bill C-6 is take about 100 years to clear up the backlog of the outstanding land claims.  The government may think it has 100 years, but I know the average age of the government members and I can assure the House they do not have that long to sit in the House to be able to settle those land claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned with the makeup of the tribunal. We have examples now of other organizations that have government appointed members.  One that comes to mind is the Canadian Wheat Board where the government has its own appointees.  What they simply do is take the agenda of the government to the table and nothing changes.  This is the same factor in Bill C-6 where the members  of the tribunal  would be appointed by the same person, the minister who is trying to reach an agreement on land claims which is a total conflict of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the government is not too concerned with conflict of interest as we have seen with other issues that are now going on in the House.  It is not only  not a concern for the government but it seems to be part of the norm. It seems like the government members  like to put into place legislation that would perpetuate more conflicts because that is the way in their minds business is meant to be done.  It seems they have done a very good job of putting in place another conflict with the land claims system which is something they probably did on purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue relates to animosity.   There is not a stakeholder who supports the bill with the exception of the minister.  The minister feels that it is the best piece of legislation contrary to whatever anybody else believes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, there was no consultation and no process.  Any of the people that it is trying to achieve a settlement with do not buy into the process and do not buy into the legislation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Conservative Party will vote against Bill C-6 at third reading.  We believe strongly that  bringing forward Bill C-6 would just perpetuate the problem.  We believe that there must be closure.  We believe that there is a need for an honest resolution to the land claims issues within the country.  There is not only a need but a constitutional right to be able to settle those land claims.  Unfortunately, the bill would perpetuate the problem, it would not fix it.  It is more part of the problem than part of the solution.  Therefore we will be voting against the bill.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450687"></A><a HREF="#Int-450700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450683"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-6, an act related to the Canadian centre for the independent resolution of first nations specific claims. It is my understanding that the purpose of the bill is to create an independent institution to provide for the filing, negotiation, and resolution of specific claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try as he might to say otherwise, the Prime Minister will have an everlasting legacy over his treatment of the aboriginal people of Canada.  I do believe that in his heart he has tried to get it right. It is just unfortunate that aboriginal Canadians continue to pay the price for him getting it wrong.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On almost all fronts, aboriginal Canadians are the poorest, most undereducated group of people in all of Canada.  Their on-reserve unemployment rates rank as high as 80% to 90%.  The drug and alcohol abuse is heart breaking, and the imprisonment and reoffending rate is higher than any other group in Canada.  Yes, there is a legacy here.  Unfortunately, to Canadians and in particular aboriginal Canadians, it is an infamous one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first make clear what the Alliance policy is with regard to settling of aboriginal claims.  Our position in land claims negotiations would be to ensure respect for existing private property rights, affordable and conclusive settlements of all claims, and an open and transparent process involving all stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal Canadians will not be able to move forward as individuals or as an autonomous group until the outstanding claims are settled conclusively and with finality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development are living in a world that has passed them by.  They refuse to acknowledge that their past attempts to resolve the many outstanding issues have all failed and yet they continue to repeat the same mistake over and over again.  Fresh approaches and renewed attitudes are needed in order to see substantial change for the betterment  of aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would expedite only claims for cash involving less than $7 million and not any larger claims or claims for land. In addition, the commissioner and adjudicators would not be representative of all stakeholders, as they would be appointed by the Prime Minister.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the process involved under the bill, the centre would consist of a commission and a tribunal.  In turn the claims process would proceed through three stages.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the  input and preparatory stage where the first nations would submit their claim to the commission, arrange research funding and notify interested parties of the claim.  Second, the validity stage where the Crown would decide whether or not to accept the claim.  If the Crown refuses the claim, the first nation can ask for dispute resolution led by the commission.  If that fails, the first nation can ask the commission to refer the claim to the tribunal to decide on its validity.  Third, is the negotiation stage.  When the claim is accepted by the Crown, or deemed valid by the tribunal, it would enter a commission led negotiation.  If negotiation fails, the first nation could ask the commission to refer the claim to the tribunal for a binding decision on cash compensation to a maximum of $7 million.  Obviously, this limits the ability of many first nations, and the federal and provincial governments where involved, to resolve claims because most claims are much larger than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several concerns regarding the bill.  Although the centre is slated to be in Ottawa, there appears to have been no consideration for where the most cost effective location for the centre would be.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the Auditor General of Canada would audit the financial accounts of the centre annually and the report of the audit would be made to the centre and the minister.  Although there is a time lag for the reporting mechanism of the centre to the minister and a further time lag of the minister tabling the relevant documents in the House, there is the appearance of some transparency.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  concerns me is that the minister would not be presenting the quarterly reports from the centre to Parliament.  This is wrong and they should be tabled, thus keeping parliamentarians fully apprised of the centre's financial well-being.  Let us not have another gun registry on our hands as  Canadians cannot afford that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of my concerns relates to the efficiency of the process.  The government needs to re-examine its approach to defining access to the proposed claims centre.  If it were to be more efficient, the minister would need to determine how to allow more access for legitimate claims.  The government must ensure that transparency exists throughout the entire process.  It is not reasonable to give government the right to hold up the process  as it decides whether or not to hear a claim because it provides no timelines or final deadlines for government to provide an answer. Furthermore, it would provide no mechanism for the commission or the claimant to move the process forward in the event of extended delay by the government.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government appears determined to continue to hold on to all of its dictatorial power, all the while paying lip service to aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 would allow the government to require the claimant to meet an excessive threshold of proof of having used all available mediation mechanisms before allowing the first nation to request a move to the tribunal in the case of an unresolved claim. This appears to be nothing less than another stalling mechanism for the government.  Of special note is that this clause would also  impose a cap on the validity stage of the process.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the arbitrary $7 million cap for compensation approval by the centre.  I understand there were other proposals, as high as $25 million, however the amendment was defeated.  Furthermore, the process used to determine the actual compensation is difficult, if not impossible, to determine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my greatest concerns surrounds clause 77.  This clause reads:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Governor in Council may make regulations </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>(a) adding to Part 2 of the schedule the name of any agreement related to aboriginal self-government; and </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>(b) prescribing anything that may, under this Act, be prescribed.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again this appears to be a loophole that would allow the government to fill in the blanks after the bill has passed under the watchful eye of Parliament. Although the Prime Minister talks the talk about parliamentary democracy, he is unable to walk the walk.  Legislation should not be something that can be added to arbitrarily after the fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me confirm that the Canadian Alliance supports the fair and expeditious resolution of claims in a manner that benefits relations between aboriginal Canadians and the federal government, and in fact all Canadians.  The bill would not achieve that goal.  The federal government has it all wrong with timing.  Under this draft of the bill, first nations could not file claims based on events that occurred within the 15 years immediately preceding the filing of a claim.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would raise false hopes and open the floodgates for more claims that first nations have held back. The centre risks being overwhelmed by cases, just like the Liberal gun registry, resulting in an even larger backlog and ultimately higher costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three decades the government has settled only 230 claims.  Some 500 claims are still waiting to be heard.  First nations representatives tell us they expect up to 1,000 more claims to be filed.  At the current rate it would take 200 years to deal with all of these claims.  That is totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993 the Liberal red book promised an independent claims commission jointly appointed by first nations and the Government of Canada.  The bill breaks that promise by concentrating the power to make appointments in the PMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-6 requires change and amendments before being ratified.  I would ask all members of the House to support the current amendment that would send the bill back to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources. This legislation is flawed and requires serious change before becoming law.</p><A NAME="Int-450700"></A><a HREF="#Int-450720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450687"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, it will probably surprise you  that my speech will be a little longer than those  of the other members. I could actually speak from now till 5:30 p.m. I will not bother asking for unanimous consent for that because I rather suspect there would be at least one member here who would decline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much to be said on this topic. It is one of those issues where again, we ought to be paying a great deal more attention to the facts of the matter than we actually are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by laying some groundwork. I have had some experience, but not a great amount, in working with native people. When I was in the math department at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, one of the very good projects in which I was involved was setting up a program for students who had dropped out of high school so that we could get them back into the educational route and hopefully retrieve their lost years.  We would  get them into a program and give them training so that they could obtain employment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institute had  a program called pretechnology  where we taught the basics  of mathematics, the English language and science. There was a course in chemistry and a course in physics for them. On those subjects we actually went back all the way  to the very basics. We started probably at  the grade 2 or 3 level in math. We did not spend a great deal of time at that level because they were adult students, but we laid the foundation and we built on that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of one year we had taken those students right through to having completed high school equivalency. They did not get a high school diploma from us but  we gave them enough education in those basic areas so that the following year they could  enter a post-secondary program, just as those who had gone through grade 12 in high school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the students in that program  for one reason or another had dropped out of school any time after grade 9 or 10. They had forgotten everything  they may have known, so it was a major task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indicating that today  because when I was working in that program, I was also one of the instructors. Even though I was the head of the mathematics department in those years, I also chose to work as an instructor in that program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that program we had a small number of native students. I always felt that somehow these students were not anywhere near  the potential that was contained in them. For the most part that was true. When I would talk to them individually about this, I would find out that most of them had had very poor opportunities and very poor discipline and learning in the schools that they had  attended. There was a big attendance problem. The students were never really properly motivated, whether or not it was because their parents did not support their going to school adequately. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them were involved in  cultural things. In the fall they would go hunting. I always  felt that if that is what they wanted to do, that was fine, but surely we could devise an education program that worked around that. Their vacation time could be during  hunting season if need be. These young people could go out with their dads and learn how to hunt and do all of those things. That would be great, but let us not stop their education.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result these students came to NAIT very often with a very poor elementary and lower high school background. They were wonderful people to work with. I say that unequivocally. I found them to be very gentle, if I can make a generalization, and very eager to please. </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually met one of the students on the airplane not very long ago. He had been in my class.   Amazingly I remembered him but he did not remember me, which was quite a curiosity.  Usually students remember me because I was the guy up front and they would recall that I had been their instructor. He also was one of my students and we did a little reminiscing about that experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say by preamble is that I have a real soft spot in my heart for the natives of Canada because of the situation that they have been in for many decades. I believe primarily it is because of the fact that governments have really done wrong by them, they really have, and it is time to correct it. It is time to put that behind us and start moving forward in huge leaps and bounds in order to allow native Canadians to realize their full potential. That is a goal  I think we really need to seek out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House may or may not know, for a time I was also involved in a small business. I remember that one of the young men who was hired to work for us was a first nations person. He was a fine young man.  He worked diligently and people could count on him.  If he said he was going to be there, he would be there.  Unfortunately I have to say that was not true of all of the employees, but for him it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember  as well one occasion, and this is a dead giveaway, when I stopped at one of the Kentucky Fried Chicken places in Edmonton.  I was hungry for Kentucky Fried Chicken.  This is a free ad for it and everyone can see it had a good, long term effect on me.  I was eating my meal in the car.  I used to pick up my food, sit in the car at noon time and listen to the radio before I would head back to work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was doing that when a young native came to the door of my car and asked for money.  Instead of giving him money, I asked him what he needed it for. When I found out that he needed bus money in order to get home, I told him to get in and that I would drive him home. I had an opportunity to talk to him. I found out about what a sad plight he was in.  Here he was in the big city and he did not have a job or any means of support. He really was very desperate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable that for years and years these people have been undertrained, undereducated and underemployed. We need to correct that.  One of the ways of correcting it  is to treat them with the dignity with which they should be treated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we come to the topic of Bill C-6, I think this is an area where the federal Liberal government, which loves to crow about its compassionate attitude, has so totally blown it.  It has blown it over decades.  The Prime Minister likes to brag about the fact that he held all sorts of portfolios, that way back he was the minister of Indian and northern affairs. In all areas where those people have been trying to work with our first nations people they have utterly and totally failed. Now they have deluded themselves into thinking that if they  keep on doing the same thing a little more often, they  are going to get different results. I do not think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the many provisions in Bill C-6.  I am rather appalled by the mediocrity of the bill, by the fact that the Minister of Finance under the direction of the Prime Minister and all of the people in that department could not come up with something better than Bill C-6 with all of its flaws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that really annoys me is that in the next election campaign, and I can already see it, there is going to be an election platform where the Liberals are going  to say,  “Do not vote for the Canadian Alliance.  It voted against the natives”.  That is how they will message it.  That is very annoying. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that we in the Alliance are against this bill  is it is so totally inadequate.  The Liberals  will twist it.  Instead of saying that we are against this bill in order to improve it for the natives, they will twist it so that Canadian people will be led to believe that we are against the natives. It is exactly the opposite. </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Liberals who are against them because of the inadequacy of legislation such as this bill.  A careful reading  of the bill would prove that what I am saying is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the previous speakers have already drawn attention to the fact that if the goal is to provide for speedy resolutions of claims, the bill  would be one of the major hindrances to achieving that goal.  How ironic to state that is the goal of the bill and then to design the bill so that it does exactly the opposite.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, it is as if we were in a race. In order to help you,   I as the young engineer,  want to get your car going really fast and I say    that we should   tie a bunch of rocks on the back of the car and then  drag them along.  You would say, “Okay, you are the engineer, go ahead and do it”.  But it would not help.  I could say this   would   help you    to go faster, but just because I say it would help does  not make it so.  In fact it  would be just  the opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same   is true with the bill.  When the Liberals  say the purpose is to provide for speedy resolution of claims, it is just the opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk a little about some of the specifics of the bill.  One that comes to mind is the promise of independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons the natives of our country feel so downtrodden is that  they have had governments lord it  over them for too long.  Here we have  a process in place which again uses a label which is totally opposite to the result. They   are talking about having an independent commission, an independent tribunal.  Maybe the Liberals should get out the good old dictionary.  They should have a look at what it means to be independent.  They have missed the boat entirely on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have used this example before in some speeches but it bears repeating here.  It is the same as   someone who gets into  the  ring   to have a boxing match and  the opponent also happens  to be the referee.  I wish  that person  luck in winning the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives  are looking for an independent and   fair resolution mechanism and what do they get?  They get more of the same from the past,  the Liberal government lording it over them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals do not know the meaning of the word “independent”.  If they do, they sure do not give any demonstration of understanding the meaning by the legislation  they have here, in terms of appointments to the commission and to the tribunal.  It is absolutely incredible that independence is a  word only to them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we know that they do not understand it.  Way back in 1993 we were promised an independent ethics counsellor.  We have seen in the last nine and half to ten years how independent an ethics counsellor is,  who is appointed by the Prime Minister, whose salary is determined by the Prime Minister, who answers to the Prime Minister, who reports to the Prime Minister and who, in effect, has been drawn into becoming part of the Prime Minister's damage control team every time anything goes wrong.  We do not get independence by having a close tie like that to the government, to the Prime Minister and to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a shame that they could not arrange for, as our amendment stated in committee,   true independence,  people on the board who would be agreed to by both the government and the first nations people.  Why could that not be done?  Surely they could agree.    There must be about 15 million or 20 million adults in Canada.  Among those, surely we could find 14 people who would be mutually agreeable.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would take a little bit of work, perhaps.  But the government simply says that   it  will appoint, and that is what this legislation does, but  the actual wording is something like order in council.  We in Parliament of course understand that is by order of the governor in  council of  the executive branch of our government, which means the Prime Minister and the minister and they will appoint whomever they will.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is so offensive in that regard. They will be appointed by the Prime Minister.   Their  salaries will be determined by the Prime Minister or by a minister of the department; their working conditions; any bonuses; and the extent to which expenses are paid. Where do the first nations people come into this? Nowhere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will  have a person or a group of people who will  be adjudicating and  determining the basis on which these claims are processed and the whole process will be done by people who are beholden to the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the probability of   commissioners making a fair judgment, which might go against the government, if they know  their appointment is   to serve during pleasure, which means the Prime Minister and the minister are pleased with their work? How can they ever come up with something that  displeases the government? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can the  Liberals not simply build into that appointment process,  that  hiring process and  that  benefit process a way of having an independent appointment process, just simply, as I said, to make sure those   individuals who are appointed are mutually agreeable? That should not be difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before,   and this is  a very small sample, but in my   dealings with native Canadians I have found them so co-operative. They seem to be a group of people who   have a gentle spirit. I find it unfathomable that in this country we would be taking more and more of them away from their  natural ways  and training them to become almost militant and to have to stand up so strongly for their rights because they have been put down so long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the appointment of the chief executive officer.  The bill states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Chief Executive Officer may be appointed to hold office for a term of not more than five years and may be removed for cause by the Governor in Council. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  right in  the bill. What is ironic is that the appointment is for a term not exceeding five years, but the very next paragraph states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Chief Executive Officer is eligible for re-appointment on the expiration of any term of office. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flaw in that.   I realize members  are all paying very close attention to what I am saying, all 170 of them out there.  I want to point out the flaw in the fact that the individual would be  subject to re-appointment. That puts in  another reason   that a commissioner would have to  make sure  he or she did  not offend the sensibilities of the Prime Minister or the minister of the department in order to keep the job. And it is a fine paying job. It is ranked at the level of deputy minister and the salary is  higher  than members of Parliament, if I am not mistaken. There is a very fine pension plan and all that stuff. Of course those commissioners  would want to keep their job. They will not   rule against the government. Where do the natives stand in this? They come out on the short end of it once again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subclause 8(3) states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Chief Executive Officer shall be paid the remuneration that is fixed by the Governor in Council. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything would be done by  governor  in council, no mutual agreement at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To skip a few points, it is interesting that under subclause 8(6) it states: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Chief Executive Officer shall not accept or hold any office or employment or carry on any activity inconsistent with the duties and functions of that  office--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, in a most bizarre continuation of the sentence, it states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--but, for greater certainty, the Chief Executive Officer may also hold the office of Chief Commissioner.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, I assure you that I have made many pronunciation mistakes of the same sort, but the people of Falun Gong are very tolerant of those of us who are not perfect in our Chinese pronunciation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion that was just read was unanimously passed, with a slight change in wording,  by the House on October 24.  The motion that we are debating today is identical in all practical purposes to that motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very unusual, to say the least, to debate a motion in the House of Commons that has been adopted, for all intents and purposes, four months after the fact of its adoption.  This provides us  with the unique opportunity to review the unanimous action of the House on October 24, and to see what results it has borne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, as the wording of the motion indicates, the Prime Minister was departing for Mexico to meet with leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference, including the president of China. I drafted and introduced this motion in the belief that any clear signal from the Prime Minister to the president of China, whether delivered in public or in private conversation, as the motion anticipates, would result in an improvement in the treatment of the 13 prisoners of conscience who are named in the motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I imagined it then, the process would have worked something like this: the Prime Minister would spend a moment during his private time with President Jiang Zemin, drawing the attention of the president toward the unanimous will of the House of Commons.  The president would probably regard this as an annoyance, but probably he would nevertheless, following this conversation, pass on this information to some underling with the instruction to make this minor irritation go away, so that China's relations with its valued Canadian trading partners might not be impeded by the peculiarly Canadian habit of obsessing over the individual human rights of particular individuals. And in the bowels of the vast Chinese bureaucracy, through a sort of trickle down effect, the appropriate administrators would probably in turn, so I imagined, be advised at the least to improve the conditions and the treatment of the prisoners of conscience and perhaps even to cause the release of some of the individuals named in this motion, simply in order to make this irritation go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other hon. members seem to have agreed with the logic of the scenario that I had imagined and so the motion was passed without the opposition of a single member of Parliament.  This kind of unanimous consent is a very rare occurrence in the House.  I must say that it makes me proud of all my 300 colleagues and proud to be a member of the same institution as all  my 300 colleagues in the House of all parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that the unanimous adoption of the motion seems to have resulted in at least the partial achievement of its intended goal.  Of the 13 prisoners of conscience named in the motion, 5 have been freed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo Qiu, a 27 year old photographer whose mother lives in Canada, has been released from the Liuchangshan labour camp.  Yueli Yang, a 62 year old aerospace engineer and the mother of Zhendong Yang of Toronto, is now out of prison.   Tianxiong Peng, whose twin sister lives right here in Ontario, was freed and on Christmas eve was reunited with her two year old daughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote, if I may, from her twin sister, Helen Peng, who lives in Canada and who writes as follows:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

I hope each government will help the Falun Gong practitioners persecuted in China and help end this persecution which should never have occurred.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more encouraging in the three names that I have mentioned is the news about Changzheng Sun and Guangshou Huang, both of whom have been freed, and allowed to leave the country.  I am happy to report that both Mrs. Sun and Mr. Huang have been reunited with their families here in Canada.</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports from China indicate that the treatment of some of the other prisoners mentioned in the motion appear to have improved since October, and the evidence suggests that this is the direct result of the fact that the motion was passed in the House on October 24.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at a distance of four months, it seems to me pretty clear that from a technical or mechanical point of view what actually transpired to cause these positive developments, after the motion was passed in the House of Commons, was something very different from what I had imagined would take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on reports that I have received from contacts here in Canada, who are themselves in contact with friends and family in China and who have been monitoring the situation of loved ones within the Chinese penal system, it seems that the most important factor was not so much the internal pressure trickling down from on high, but rather the external pressure that the Canadian embassy in Beijing was able to bring to bear with regard to these 13 specific cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian embassy officials, acting with impressive energy and efficiency, made it clear to the relevant Chinese authorities, that is to say the governors of the prisons and the administrators of the labour camps in which the 13 practitioners have been imprisoned, that Canada's Parliament and Canada's diplomatic corps was watching.  In one particularly colourful and effective gesture, the embassy mailed Chinese New Year cards last month to each of the prisoners of conscience which made a dramatic impression, as members can imagine, upon the administrators who intercepted this mail.  It made the point that they were not forgotten, that people were watching and that people in positions of authority cared very much about what happened to them. In the words of one Chinese Canadian with whom I recently talked, “It was as if the people at the Canadian embassy had been given a green light to do all the things they needed to do”.  It is that which has been the most effective in getting the results that we see today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point, I would like to read from a letter that I recently received from a Canadian living in Toronto whose 63 year old mother was freed from prison three weeks ago, probably as a result of this motion.  He writes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one other remarkable action taken as a result of alert Canadian diplomatic officials in the wake of the October 24 resolution, which we are discussing here today.  This involved Ms. Yuzmi Wang, who today resides safely in Toronto following a remarkable rescue.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As seems so often to be the case with Falun Gong practitioners, Mrs. Wang had led a quiet and productive life prior to her arrest. She owned a small computer store in Harbin, the capital of  Manchuria. When she was arrested and imprisoned several years ago, Mrs. Wang was tortured and force fed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came to Ottawa following her release, I had the opportunity to talk with Mrs. Wang and she described a bit of what was involved in some of the torture that she experienced.  Force feeding is really a way of imposing a form of torture on someone. Whether they are on a starvation diet, it is done to torture them without officially being engaged in torture.  Their mouths are forced open, a rubber hose is forced down their throat and cold water mixed with wheat flour is poured down their throat.  This results in gagging, retching, severe cramps and in some cases vomiting and nausea.  Its actual benefits in terms of delivering nutrition to the person in question is highly questionable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mrs. Wang was imprisoned and tortured.  She was released from her first sentence in prison when her death as a result of her treatment seemed inevitable.  To avoid taking responsibility for her death, the Chinese authorities shipped Mrs. Wang to the United Arab Emirates where she had family members who nursed her back to health.   A new warrant for her arrest was issued after Mrs. Wang was sighted at the United Arab Emirates airport by Chinese authorities and it became clear that her health had recovered and that she would  not  remain meek and quiet about the conditions that she had suffered while in prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local authorities in the United Arab Emirates were contacted by Chinese authorities and were preparing to deport Mrs. Wang back to China on the basis of this warrant for her arrest.   Members of the Falun Gong Association of Canada rallied to support her and compiled the relevant documentation to present to the authorities in the United Arab Emirates to save her from deportation and from certain imprisonment, which Mrs. Wang does not believe she would have survived.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included among the documents that were presented, both to United Arab Emirates authorities and also to Canadian consular authorities in the UAE, was a copy of the motion that had been adopted in the House on October 24.  The package of materials seems to have been decisive in causing Canadian consular officials to  arrange a ministerial permit for Mrs. Wang to come safely to this country where she now resides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell for a moment on the question of ministerial permits and the good that they could do in the case of individuals named in this motion who remain in China, whether still in prison or in that curious state of quasi freedom that exists for someone who, like Mrs. Wang following her release, is in perpetual danger of renewed incarceration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of getting these people out of China whenever possible and to the safety of Canada where they all have family members, husbands, wives, sons or daughters, parents in some cases, waiting to greet them, cannot be overemphasized.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote again from Helen Peng, whose twin sister is in China, out of prison but under close observation.  She says, “I am sad for the tribulations my sister has endured and I hope she can come soon to the safe environment in Canada”.  I hope she can too.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450773"></A><a HREF="#Int-450738"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450728"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>The only way to ensure that the treatment of these individuals and other individuals in similar circumstances, including others not mentioned in the motion who also have close family ties to Canada, and  to ensure that their rights are respected is to continue to have vigilance, to continue to draw attention to them and to be prepared to issue ministerial permits to allow them to come to this country where they can become productive citizens, as have many other individuals who have been persecuted in China for their spiritual beliefs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude with one individual whose story came to my attention after the motion had already been placed before the House and whose story is particularly sad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yunhe Zhang, whose sister lives in Vancouver, is currently in prison.  She has a three year old child who never got to see her father.  Her father was also in prison and died there a couple of years ago. Yunhe Zhang remains in prison, separated from her child who is being raised by relatives.  Her mother-in-law died, a death that members of their family believe was premature, due to the conditions that her son and her daughter-in-law were suffering in prison in China and the stress that was involved in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This individual has done no harm to anybody.  She believes, as do all members of the Falun Gong movement, in the values that are central to the Chinese culture and to all civilized society.  The principles of Falun Gong, an apolitical movement, are a belief in tolerance, compassion and truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals have always been productive members of  the Chinese society.  I am confident that those who would be allowed to come here to Canada on ministerial permits would also be productive members of our society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this moment to thank all members of the House who voted in favour of the motion when it was before the House on October 24, 2002  and made it possible for several of these individuals to find their freedom again.</p><A NAME="Int-450738"></A><a HREF="#Int-450751"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, we continue to raise human rights concerns and to urge Chinese leaders to respect internationally agreed upon human rights standards during meetings with Chinese ministers and officials.  We will continue to register Canadian concerns about human rights abuses both in general terms and with respect to specific cases where appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also continues to make reference to China in annual country situation public statements at the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee, the latest occurrence which took place in November 2002, and also at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and equally to support multilateral initiatives which promote our human rights objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that engagement, rather than isolation, will effect a sustained improvement in the human rights situation in China.  The Canada-China human rights dialogue is an example of how engagement has allowed Canada access to Chinese agencies whose co-operation is essential if human rights practices are to improve in China.  Canada plans to continue to express its concern on a range of issues which include freedom of religion, expression, association, women's rights, children's rights, good governance and minority rights among others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major components of Canada's human rights dialogue include the Joint Committee on Human Rights, JCHR, and the Plurilateral Human Rights Symposium co-hosted by Canada, Norway and China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's JCHR took place in Beijing and Xinjiang, China from November 4 to 8.  The topics on the agenda included: recent progress in promotion and protection of human rights in China and Canada; conditions of detention, special concern for female prisoners and detainees; police training and international co-operation in human rights in the multilateral context.  A frank and open discussion allowed for the free exchange of ideas and issues of concerns to both countries.   In addition both China and Canada expressed belief in the value of the JCHR and its continuation to permit the ongoing exchange of issues and points of  view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's Canada-China-Norway Plurilateral Symposium on Human Rights took place in Jakarta from March 11 to 12.  The meeting brought delegations from the three co-sponsoring governments together with delegations from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Korea, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan and others.  The meeting succeeded in achieving its immediate objectives which were a discussion of mutual human rights concerns, an exchange of strategies and policies  to address them and confidence building among the participants so as to facilitate possible joint activities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, the meeting again proved its value as a non-confrontational venue to discuss sensitive human rights issues in great depth than is possible  in larger human rights fora.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also tries to improve the human rights situation in China through CIDA programming. Some of CIDA's projects include training of senior Chinese judges; a women's law program to assist in understanding and exercising legal rights; the development of a national legal aid system; an international human rights implementation project to assist China's efforts in implementing international conventions; a civil society program to strengthen the functioning of autonomous people based voluntary community organizations; co-operation between the Canadian Bar Association and the All China Lawyers Association to promote the rule of law and links between the two legal professions; and a criminal law and criminal justice co-operation program to assist in the development of the rule of law in criminal procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the points that I have raised on human rights I draw the attention of my colleague and the House to Canada's trade relationship with China.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broad sense our continuing goal is to see an evolution toward a more transparent economic and political system in China.  To use the oft-quoted phrase, we seek to “engage China”.  Canada's policy of engaging China is reflected in the numerous ongoing dialogues between state and non-state actors.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to underline our view that trade and human rights are not mutually exclusive.  Our trade interests are not pursued at the expense of voicing our concerns about human rights or vice versa. In fact, regular high level exchanges, including the team Canada missions to China, allow Canada to reinforce our concerns on issues such as human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe that improving our trade ties with other countries in a rules based system can reduce isolationism and open channels that will promote social progress and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-450751"></A><a HREF="#Int-450758"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450738"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, I too am  pleased to speak in the debate on the motion by the hon. member for Lanark—Carleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank and congratulate our hon. colleague from Lanark—Carleton for again drawing the House's attention to the very disturbing situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Based on our long discussions, especially on the expulsion of the Acadians, I know that the hon. member for Lanark—Carleton is deeply concerned with justice and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I had the pleasure of speaking in the House on a bill regarding China's accession to the World Trade Organization. I was very happy to speak in that debate to amend our legislation so that the People's Republic of China could join the WTO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that I mentioned at that time that there are a number of human rights issues in China that are currently great cause for concern. The fate of Falun Gong or Falun Dafa practitioners is one of our concerns, particularly in the context of  China's accession to the WTO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, I went over the evolution of Canadian policy from the days of the Progressive Conservative government. This debate is almost like talking about the chicken or the egg. The Progressive Conservatives had decided to make respect of human rights one of the pillars of Canadian foreign policy. When the Liberals came to power in 1993, they quickly changed direction, making trade one of the new pillars of our foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to the chicken or the egg. The Progressive Conservative government claimed that the approach to take with foreign policy was to oblige States to respect a minimally acceptable human rights policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall the very courageous policy put forward by the Progressive Conservative government, particularly within the Commonwealth, regarding the contentious issue of apartheid in South Africa. We had decided, on the one hand, to sever diplomatic relations and on the other to boycott South African products, to introduce an embargo, to force change in South Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals came into power, they said to themselves “This may not be the way to do things.    Perhaps the best approach might be to encourage trade so as to facilitate exchanges, contacts and dialogue.   Through these, we could have some impact on the development of societies, serving as an example so as to be able to transmit to them our democratic values, our respect for human rights”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the intrinsic value of such a policy.   Because the government has adopted it as policy, we need to work to improve the human rights situation in certain countries as much as possible  by encouraging exchanges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my previous speech, I applauded the admission of China to the World Trade Organization for a number of quite obvious reasons, including the size of the market, since we cannot exclude over one billion people from the developing world market.   I think therefore that it was highly appropriate for the People's Republic of China to be able to join the WTO.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it is also a fact that the People's Republic of China did indeed gain membership in the WTO in December 2001, and has also complied with a number of treaties relating to human rights.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Republic of China cannot, therefore, be surprised if the international community, and Canada in particular, is concerned about the human rights situation in that country, given its commitments within the international community in this area.  The international community is therefore responsible for ensuring that the signatories of the treaties in question meet their commitments.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore say that the motion again presented by the hon. member for Lanark—Carleton has already had some positive impact, as he has mentioned.  This motion, which was already unanimously adopted in this House in October 2002, appears to have brought about, or at least contributed to bringing about, the release of at least three of the Falun Gong practitioners listed in the resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore seems likely that focussing attention on the situation of our fellow citizens of Quebec or Canada, or of the Chinese relatives of those fellow citizens,  can have a positive impact on what happens to them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think, and I am sure the member for Lanark—Carleton will agree with me, that through these specific cases we have decided to highlight here today, as we did in October, we really want to focus on the predicament of all Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents, whose human rights are being violated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falun Gong, as our colleague mentioned, is a peaceful and  apolitical organization that promotes a spiritual approach based on three broad principles: truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. Falun Gong tries to bring human beings closer to the fundamental nature of the universe to achieve harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Falun Gong practitioners, the group is neither a sect nor a religious movement. The zealousness of authorities in the People's Republic of China when it comes to persecuting Falun Dafa practitioners needs to be examined. Possibly the reason for their intolerance of the group  is because Chinese authorities identify it as a religious movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we know the old saying that applies in communist regimes, which states that “religion is the opium of the masses”. We know that all religious movements have been persecuted by various communist countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  also cause to wonder about what is really motivating authorities, beyond this simplistic take on the situation. They say the group wants to topple the communist regime and the powers in place. Of course, Falun Dafa followers strongly and vigorously deny this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we need to consider,  and this is the fundamental issue, is that human rights and democracy go hand in hand. In a democracy, it is unacceptable that human beings be treated this way, when we know that according to figures provided by Human Rights Watch, more than 37,000 members of Falun Gong have been imprisoned since September 1999.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, these thirteen people are currently in prison solely because of their beliefs.  It is no secret that China has an appalling human rights record and routinely tortures and imprisons people for their beliefs and for taking peaceful action such as publishing an article critical of government policy or assembling in Tiananmen Square to protest the lack of democracy in China.  There are hundreds of stories of the Chinese government violating the human rights of the Falun Gong. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the member for Burnaby--Douglas for providing me with the information that I am using today.  For example, on March 14, 2002, four Swiss and twelve Hong King citizens were forcefully arrested while staging a peaceful appeal outside the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong to raise awareness of China's escalating persecution of Falun Gong. As the number of demonstrators was less than fifty, no permit was necessary for this gathering.  As video evidence clearly attests, the demonstration was small, unobtrusive and completely non-violent, yet the police used violence in disrupting the event and taking away the participants.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, just last week there were four deaths reported.  One was that of a 37 year old woman who was arrested for distributing New Year's greeting cards with the words truth, compassion and tolerance written on them.  Her husband was only informed of her death 10 days later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report that many thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been tortured, murdered, subjected to sexual violence, including rape and forced abortions, and arbitrarily imprisoned in psychiatric facilities, labour camps and penitentiaries.  As well, the government of the People's Republic of China has embarked upon a massive public campaign to breed hatred and discrimination against Falun Gong practitioners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot think of any reason that any human being should be subjected to the kind of abuse that the Chinese government has put upon the Falun Gong. The persecution of the Falun Gong violates China's own constitution as well as the international covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights.  China is a signatory to both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally it is the practice of sovereign countries not to interfere in the internal affairs of another sovereign country, yet through globalization our world is coming closer together and the artificial boundaries of nation states are fast crumbling. The Chinese efforts to persecute the Falun Gong go beyond the Chinese borders.  In Canada, adherents have been victims of death threats, vandalism, harassment, cyber-attacks and other forms of intimidation and discrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in this case Canada has a responsibility to encourage the Chinese government to stop these attacks and respect international law. What is the point of having international agreements if countries can sign on and then turn around and not respect them, without any repercussions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2002 the  U.S. Congress passed a resolution that urged the U.S. government to condemn the efforts of the People's Republic of China to persecute the Falun Gong practitioners domestically and internationally and to strive to ensure that China released all imprisoned adherents of the faith in accordance with international human rights laws. Canadian protests also do make a difference, as Canadian Lin Shengli was recently rescued. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support this motion and urge the Prime Minister to discuss the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners with the President of China as a matter of human rights. No one should have to suffer what these people have been through. Canada has a responsibility to help put an end to this.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450765"></A><a HREF="#Int-450782"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-450758"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support the motion of the member for Lanark--Carleton and the individual cases and underlying cause that inspire it: the ongoing prosecution and persecution of the Falun Gong in China, in a word, the criminalization of innocence that finds expression in the intimidation, harassment, arrest, detention, coercive interrogation, torture, beatings and imprisonment of people for doing nothing other than espousing ancient Chinese values, which are also universal values, of truth, compassion and tolerance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is instructive and encouraging to note that since the member for Lanark--Carleton spoke to a similar motion on October 24, 2002, regarding the plight of thirteen Falun Gong practitioners with close family ties in Canada, which received unanimous support at the time and for which initiative he is to be singularly congratulated, five have been released, while a sixth, Yanying Wu, has been released but remains under house arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, the news of their release is encouraging, and the improved treatment of other of these prisoners still in detention is also encouraging, and the whole is testimony to the role that the House has played and the role of our Canadian embassy and diplomats in that regard. As the member for Lanark--Carleton put it, we made it clear that we are going to be watching, that we are going to maintain a watching brief, that the prisoners are not alone in this regard and that we stand in solidarity with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while this news is encouraging, as I have just described, and as the member for Lanark--Carleton went into the individual cases and humanized the appreciation and understanding of the cases and cause, the important point that must also be appreciated today and which is the import of my remarks is that while we are pleased and indeed encouraged at the release of people who are effectively prisoners of conscience, and we extend our appreciation to all involved in this effort, we have to realize that those released should never have been arrested to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to realize the following: that they should never have been imprisoned, held incommunicado and subjected to coercive interrogation and beatings while in detention; that they should never have been deprived of the companionship and shared life with their loved ones; that there remain eight Falun Gong practitioners with a Canadian connection still in detention, seven of them and one under house arrest, as I mentioned; that those who have been released should also not mask the fact that thousands upon thousands of Falun Gong practitioners, as has been mentioned in the House,  have been detained and imprisoned for nothing other than espousing these values of truth, compassion and tolerance. We have to realize that in addition to their false imprisonment, their fundamental values of conscience and religion, of assembly and association and of expression and information, have been systematically violated, and that, indeed, over 100,000 people have been sent to labour camps without any legal process while over 1,000 Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in psychiatric institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese authorities recently have passed new rules allowing courts to try followers for subversion, separatism and leaking state secrets if they spread any information about the Falun Gong, thereby further enlarging the dragnet of the criminalization of innocence. We are witnessing in effect a systematic and sustained assault on freedom of religion in general and the rights of Christians, Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims in particular. For example,  this has even included, by the Chinese authorities' own acknowledgement, the confiscation and destruction of houses of worship and religious books and material. This also has a Falun Gong connection, for the anti-cult legislation, developed to criminalize and eliminate the Falun Gong, has been used against 16 other religious organizations that refuse to tailor their beliefs and practices to the demands of Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, we would be remiss if we did not make mention of all this and sound the alarm about the dramatic increase in the persecution of the Falun Gong, including the increase in the rate of arrest and detention, the increase in deaths of Falun Gong in detention, the increase in the beatings and torture, according to eyewitness testimony and documentary evidence of Falun Gong detainees, the increase in the numbers sent to psychiatric institutions, and the use of atrocity propaganda to demonize them in the eyes of their fellow citizens.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I call upon the Chinese authorities:  to release the seven Falun Gong practitioners with a Canadian and family connection from their imprisonment, and permit them to be reunited with their loved ones here in Canada; to repeal the illegal ban on the Falun Gong; to rescind any laws or regulations specifically criminalizing the Falun Gong as an “illegal association” and prohibiting thereby the exercise of the fundamental freedoms of their members as guaranteed under Chinese law; to cease and desist from any policy or practice of torture or other degrading punishment or treatment of prisoners in detention, something that Chinese authorities undertook as well with the ratification of the international covenant on civil and political rights,  with respect to which we have made representations; and to release all Falun Gong members now detained in prison, forced labour camps or psychiatric detention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I want to express my appreciation to the parliamentary secretary for her comprehensive statement.  I want to join in the support of the initiatives she described on behalf of the government respecting the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law in China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of trade relations with China, again I want to join in the  words of the parliamentary secretary and call upon the Canadian government to reaffirm certain basic principles for the Canadian relationship with China in the matter of trade and human rights, including: first, to reaffirm that human rights is an organizing principle of Canadian foreign policy and human security as the core of our Canadian foreign policy, such that it must find expression not only as a statement of principle, but as an expression of policy in our relations with China; second, that trade and human rights are not contradictory but complementary, as the parliamentary secretary mentioned in her statement, and that indeed trade can be used as an instrument for constructive engagement in matters of human rights, just as the protection for human rights protects the integrity of trade relations; and, third, trade missions should therefore be seen as trade and human rights missions, as trade cannot be a matter of “business as usual”.  Human rights must be a priority on the agenda of our trade relations with China and, indeed, of the totality of our bilateral relationship with China.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-450782"></A><a HREF="#Int-450765"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>The time provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired.
