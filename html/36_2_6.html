introduce Bill C-250, an act to amend the Criminal Code (bail in 
cases of assault with weapon or a criminal harassment). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill is an act to 
amend the Criminal Code to prevent a person accused of sexual 
assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, sexual assault or 
criminal harassment who has been identified by the victim or by a 
witness to the offence from being released until the charge is 
withdrawn or the accused is acquitted at a trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 522, which currently allows a judge of a court of a 
superior or criminal jurisdiction the discretion to allow bail in 
these very serious offences, would be repealed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to introduce this 
private member's bill.  The concept for it began when Craig 
Powell, Amber Keuben, Brandy Keuben and Stephanie Smith were all 
instantly killed by a drunk driver on June 23, 1996, near Morley, 
Alberta, as they returned from a camping trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drunk driver in this case was Christopher Goodstoney and he 
was charged with four counts of criminal negligence causing death 
and one count of criminal negligence causing injury.  At his 
sentencing hearing last April the judge referred to section 
718.2(2) of the Criminal Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is permitted to give 
a succinct explanation of the purpose of the bill and we have not 
heard anything yet about the bill.  I know he has interesting 
facts, but I think he should save those for the debate at second 
reading and perhaps give the House the pith and substance of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really sorry.  I 
hate to offend my little friend across the way.  I will see if I 
can do a better job.

the race of a criminal when he is convicted of a crime.

These undersigned citizens of Canada draw the attention of the 
House to the following, that the laws of our country have always 
been based on Judeo-Christian morals and values which have been 
passed down through the centuries via western civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned about the preamble to the charter of rights

weapons on the earth and that the continuing existence of nuclear 
weapons poses a threat to the health and survival of human 
civilization and the global environment.  It also notes the 
concerns of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on this 
subject.

subject of the abolition of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners from my constituency of Burnaby—Douglas and 
elsewhere note that the Senate of Canada is an undemocratic 
institution composed of unelected members who are unaccountable 
to the people, that it costs taxpayers some $50 million per year, 
that its role is redundant given the roles played by the supreme 
court and the provinces, that it undermines the role of MPs in 
the House of Commons, and that there is a need to modernize our 
parliamentary institutions.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, today I have the honour to introduce to 
the House the new Canada Elections Act.  The Canada Elections 
Act constitutes the operational basis of our democratic 
electoral system.  Our elections act is based on three essential 
principles: equity, transparency and accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For close to 30 years now, the Canada Elections Act has been the 
focal point of an electoral system that has been an inspiration 
to democracies the world over.  Our Elections Act is based on 
solid principles and orientations. 
Nevertheless, administrative inconsistencies have developed over 
those 30 years, and we need to eliminate them and to amend 
sections of the Act the courts have chosen to strike down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the members of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for preparing the 
excellent report on which this legislation is based, 
particularly the hon. member for Peterborough who chaired its 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we propose today are based on the committee's 
findings and recommendations.  The bill also reflects the 
recommendations contained in the 1991 report of the Royal 
Commission on Electoral Reform, the Lortie Commission, the 
proposals submitted in 1993 by the special House committee, and 
the Chief Electoral Officer's reports to parliament in 1996 and 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the bill reflects discussions between myself and my 
counterparts in the United Kingdom, as well as the ideas, 
concerns and initiatives shared with us by large numbers of MPs, 
senators, members of all political parties, academics, interest 
groups and ordinary citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is determined to see this bill passed and to 
implement amendments which reflect the wisdom and collective 
vision of the hon. members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference to a committee before second reading will permit 
broader amendments, provided of course that these amendments 
amend the same statute as is the subject of the bill. Allow me to 
take some time to describe some of the administrative changes 
proposed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed that the chief electoral officer be empowered 
to adjust voting hours for areas that do not switch to daylight 
saving time.  This will address the problem Saskatchewan voters 
experienced in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also offsetting the impact of inflation since the act was 
introduced in 1974, increasing the threshold for the disclosure 
of the names and addresses of campaign contributors for donations 
and the threshold for receiving the 75% political tax credit from 
$100 to $200. The voucher expense limit would be increased from 
$25 to $50.  The audit fee expense limit, because it is getting 
very difficult to hire auditors for $750, would be increased to 
$1,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed extending voting rights to all returning 
officers in Canada.  We have included amendments to ensure the 
right to campaign canvassing and the posting of signs in 
apartment buildings.  We have proposed that the enforcement 
capabilities of the commissioner of Canada elections be 
strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, court decisions have called on the Government 
of Canada to take a second look at some sections of the Canada 
Elections Act.  We believe that amendments in this legislation 
are consistent with both the spirit and the letter of those 
decisions.  Our amendments regarding third party spending are a 
perfect case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked closely at the 1996 decision of the Alberta Court of 
Appeal which threw out the previous spending limits, but we also 
examined the 1997 Libman decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
which said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect...we cannot accept the Alberta Court of Appeal's 
point of view because we disagree with its conclusion regarding 
the legitimacy of the objective of the provisions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court further stated: “While we recognize their 
right”—third parties—“to participate in the electoral 
process, independent individuals and groups cannot be subject to 
the same financial rules as candidates or political parties and 
be allowed the same spending limits.  Although what they have to 
say is important, it is the candidates and political parties that 
are running for election.  Limits on independent spending must 
therefore be lower than those imposed on candidates or political 
parties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also placed fairness at the heart of the proposed 
changes to the rules governing blackouts.  Recently the Supreme 
Court of Canada struck down the 72 hour election blackout on 
election polls.  However, the court did not close the door on 
giving voters the means and the time to assess polls. Consistent 
with the guidance of the court, we have required publication of 
polling methodologies and we have shortened the blackout period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also addressed the issue of blackouts on political 
advertising.  As a result of the decision of the Alberta courts, 
political parties now remain subject to blackouts on advertising 
while at the same time there is no such blackout on candidates 
and third parties.  Obviously it is wrong and the same rule 
should apply to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed a new 48 hour blackout period prior to election 
day on political ads; no ads on election day and the day before 
for anybody.  We want to make sure that the only group to get the 
last word in a campaign is Canadian voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently the Figueroa decision of the Ontario court struck 
down another provision in the elections act under which a 
political party that loses its status as a registered party must 
deregister and liquidate all its assets and turn them over to the 
receiver general. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took note of that decision and we responded by allowing third 
parties that fail to field the required number of candidates 
during an election to retain their assets subject to certain 
conditions.  The government is however, and most members will 
know this, appealing that part of the court order holding that a 
party need only nominate two candidates to become a registered 
party. The government believes strongly that the existing 
requirements should be defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single one of the amendments proposed in the bill, the 
ones that we have put forward, have put the values and principles 
of the elections act and Canadians first.  In every single case 
we have asked the questions that are the foundations of the 
Canada Elections Act. Is it fair?  Does it promote accessibility? 
Does it keep our electoral system open and transparent?  I 
believe that in every case the answer is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this is going to be a non-partisan effort.  I look 
forward to sending the bill to committee and listening to the 
constructive suggestions of all members of parliament that would 
permit us to improve the bill, providing that the amendments 
amend the same acts as those referred to in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to join in support of the bill 
and to send it to committee.  I believe that together we will 
make it such to maintain one of Canada's most important pieces of 
legislation as our country and our democracy moves into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank hon. members for all the work they have done thus far on 
improving the Canada Elections Act.  I look forward to appearing 
before the committee, answering all questions from hon. members 
and working together with them to make this bill better for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the spirit that has been shown by the government House leader, 
I wonder if the House would give unanimous consent to question 
the minister for five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not object to that, 
but we are only limited to three hours and I would be taking away 
other members' time.  I am appearing before the committee in a 
few days.  I can do it either way, it is the same for me.  I just 
do not want to take up other members' time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps we can clarify it.  Is there 
unanimous consent to proceed with questions to the minister at 
this time for five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I did not hear any nos.  Is someone 
saying no to the proposal?  No one is saying no. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore have a five minute question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the concerns of 
my hon. colleague, the government House leader, and I must say 
that, up to a certain point, I share them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If question and comment period is limited to only five minutes, 
it is obvious that all political parties will lose out.  If we 
were to agree on, say, five minutes for each party, then I could 
agree but otherwise not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Five minutes each. Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a shame that we would not get the chance right at the beginning 
of this debate to ask the minister a few questions.  It would 
help clarify the issues.  Even if we all had to give up a half 
minute of our time, it would have helped to focus the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of referring bills to committee prior to second 
reading frankly is nothing more than a way for the government to 
fast track legislation that it really does not want the public 
and the media to get a good handle on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I am not allowed to use props, but we are looking at 
a bill that is 253 pages thick.  This bill was introduced last 
Thursday in the House by the minister and just a few days later 
he wants to ram it into committee behind closed doors where the 
public and the media cannot see it. It is so full of 
objectionable stuff that he does not want anyone in the real 
world to catch on to what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is denying the public and the media 
the opportunity to hear a meaningful debate of the extensive 
provisions in the bill before it goes to committee. 
How are the public and interested parties going to get enough 
information about this bill to come to committee and make 
meaningful comments, answer questions and suggest amendments when 
they are not going to know the bill is here?

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of the situation is that when this bill disappears 
later today after the vote into committee, nobody except a few 
special interest groups—and if they can get a few talk show 
hosts or media commentators to talk about it—will know it even 
exists.  That is an absolutely appalling situation for such a 
comprehensive piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the six years I have been in the House I have seen very few 
pieces of legislation that have been this thick. One of them 
would be the gun control bill, Bill C-68, some years ago.  Look 
how long that bill took to move through the House.  Here we have 
something that is going through in a flash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had had the opportunity a few minutes ago, I would have 
asked the minister a couple of questions in connection with the 
Communist Party of Canada challenge to the elections act and the 
number of members that constitute a party. Why is it that the 
government House leader is so concerned that the Communist Party 
of Canada or the Green Party of Canada might actually have its 
party name on the ballot?  What is the minister so afraid of that 
he wants to reinstate a rule that requires 50 candidates for a 
group to be labelled as a party?  Why on earth is there anything 
wrong with two, three or 10 people getting together and saying 
they would like to be the such and such party and have their name 
printed on the ballot?  Is the House leader so afraid of 
competition that he cannot stand the thought that some other 
credible group might actually be on the ballot? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at Germany or New Zealand, both of which have mixed 
member proportional systems in their elections, or any other 
country that has a proportional element in its electoral system, 
there are up to 35 parties on the ballot.  Yet the voters in 
those countries seem perfectly capable of making sensible 
decisions about which parties to elect and which to reject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government House leader believe that Canadian 
voters are too stupid to make those same decisions?  Surely when 
he stood there and argued that the final decision should be that 
of the Canadian voter, why does he not let them make that 
decision? Put anybody's name on the ballot, anybody who wants to 
apply under the rules and pay the candidate deposit.  Let them 
put whatever name they want on the ballot and let the voters 
decide.  I certainly believe that voters are sensible and smart 
enough to make that decision themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I would have asked the minister is in 
connection with patronage which riddles like a web the field 
operations of Elections Canada.  Elections Canada has begged the 
government for years to remove the patronage provisions from the 
elections act.  When Elections Canada advises third world 
governments and emerging democracies how to set up their 
electoral systems, it never recommends the system that is used 
here in Canada of political patronage in all of the field 
positions of Elections Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registered parties get to appoint returning officers, deputy 
returning officers and polling clerks.  A whole host of people 
get paid positions as rewards for supporting the government or 
other parties. Elections Canada has begged for the right to hire 
and fire on merit.  The government will not give it the right 
because it suits the government to reward political supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader mentioned that he is going to give 
ROs the right to vote.  We all know right now because of the 
patronage appointments that the ROs are all Liberals.  I guess 
they must be afraid they do not have enough votes already so they 
have to claw in every single vote they can get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of third party spending, I heard the government House 
leader quote extensively from a decision of the court in Quebec 
because he really did not want to take any notice of the 
decisions in Alberta.  It amuses and puzzles me that the 
government is prepared to ignore court decisions in B.C. that 
allow child pornography to run rampant. 
The government is quite prepared to ignore court decisions that 
endorse race based fisheries, but it rushes quickly to block any 
tiny little court decision that might diminish its advantage in 
elections, such as the 50 candidate rule and the third party 
expenses.  It wants to retain the patronage.  It pays lip service 
to democracy but its actions speak a lot louder than its words.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the size of the bill.  We have already started to 
contact a few parties, groups and individuals who have shown 
interest in the bill.  We have not even been able to send them 
copies of the bill until yesterday by courier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister wants to appear before committee as early as this 
Thursday.  How can we expect it to be reasonable for interested 
people in the country, who may or may not have legal training, to 
go through 253 pages of a complicated bill, work out the 
implications for their group or part of society, prepare 
submissions, apply to come to Ottawa and transport themselves 
here by Thursday or maybe next week? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee begins discussions on the timetable for the 
bill, I hope it will show some reasonable consideration for those 
outside this place who are interested and who would like to come 
here as witnesses and talk about the provisions in the bill.  I 
hope the committee will have a realistic timetable that will 
perhaps extend into the spring of next year. I do not see why we 
should rush through on something as complicated as this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Maybe there is a snap election coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  One of my colleagues on this side says 
that there may be is a snap election election coming.  It is 
interesting that he says that because I notice Bill C-2, which is 
pretty much a replacement for Bill C-83, which was introduced 
just before we broke for the summer and ended the first session, 
contains an extra couple of clauses that were not in Bill C-83. 
Those clauses deal with the registration of and reporting of 
parties prior to June 2000 if the bill is passed before then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read those clauses, I just wondered if some sort of quick 
election was being planned and the government wants to make sure 
that certain things are in place by June of next year.  It is 
interesting that my colleague mentioned that.  I am not sure if 
he read those clauses but that was certainly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the debate we are having this morning is an affront to 
democracy.  The House leader stood and talked about the 
democratic process and how he supports it.  However the debate we 
are having now is an affront to democracy.  We do not get to ask 
any questions of any speaker on the government side.  We get the 
opportunity to put up four people, 10 minutes each, no questions 
and comments, have a vote that the government side will win and 
it is rammed into committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all been here long enough to know exactly what will 
happen behind closed doors.  We are all adults.  The bill will be 
rammed through clause by clause with no meaningful input.  It 
will be back here in the House again in its final form.  That is 
just not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the minister, if he truly believes in what he said 
this morning, to permit the bill to have a thorough investigation 
in committee and to permit meaningful amendments.  The one which 
I will propose will surely not be too controversial.  It is 
simply to build in the opportunity for the chief electoral 
officer to investigate and experiment with electronic voting. 
Since that has been in the Elections Act in Ontario for three 
years there is no reason it should not be in the federal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to being in committee.  I also look forward to a 
meaningful debate once the bill is back in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I rise today to take part in the 
preliminary debate on Bill C-2, an act respecting the election of 
members to the House of Commons, repealing other acts relating 
to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that, in preparation for this bill, no 
fewer than 14 sittings of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs were spent considering the present Canada 
Elections Act during this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given our detailed and careful study, we were entitled to expect 
that the government would pay particular attention to the 
various recommendations formulated by the standing committee, 
but this did not seem to be entirely the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain unanimous recommendations of the committee are nowhere 
to be found in the bill.  I will come back to this a little 
later in my speech.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, when we considered the Canada Elections Act, I 
was struck by two things in particular: funding of political 
parties, and the corollary issue of trust funds established to 
support candidates.  No less important, I would say that the 
partisan process for appointing electoral officers also leaves 
me confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Elections Act, small and large corporations 
have always been able to contribute to the funding of federal 
political parties.  This practice allows the various parties to 
amass huge sums, while making it less necessary to approach 
individual voters for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they do not have to keep to a contribution limit, corporations 
may contribute huge sums to the federal political parties of 
their choice, and, need I point out, these contributions 
certainly do not go to political parties for purely 
philanthropic purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding of political parties, as practised federally, 
necessarily implies preferential treatment for the most 
generous, and God knows just how generous they can be under the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to say that, with a simple contribution of a few 
dollars, the ordinary voter runs the risk of not having the ear 
of his political representatives to the same extent as a bank, 
which, for example, may make substantial contributions of up to 
several tens of thousands of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation creates different categories of contributors, and, 
unfortunately, different levels of attention to the many 
requests and expectations political leaders must address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are considering a bill, which, according to the 
government, aims at, and I quote: “equity, transparency and 
accessibility”.  I might question that.  How can the government 
claim that this process is equitable, when the provisions of the 
bill do not establish any sort of limit for contributions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could claim, without raising an eyebrow, that this system is 
truly equitable, transparent and accessible, a system that 
allows corporations, which do not have the right to vote, to 
meddle in the electoral process by making contributions far 
beyond the capability of the ordinary voter, and thus unduly 
influencing the political policy of the parties and the 
candidates seeking votes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill runs counter to a narrow concept of the rules of 
democracy that should govern our society, since it still gives 
its wealthier members a more attentive ear and a greater voice 
with those representing the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in the introduction, having a trust fund to 
support candidates seems to be nebulous at the very 
least. 
Another financial matter, you will say.  This point was 
unanimously recommended by the members of the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs when the federal electoral 
legislation was studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the committee wanted the government to clarify 
the rules governing this practice, which may make it possible to 
circumvent the already lax provisions of the election act on 
funding of political parties.  Well, not a word; nothing we 
recommended on the subject appears in the bill we are now 
considering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what is the point of in depth examination in preparation for 
bills such as this one, if the government merely nods and takes 
from our deliberations only those elements that suit it and 
which it had already in all likelihood decided to legislate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the work and recommendations of the 
committees are only recognized and implemented when they meet 
cabinet's expectations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large amounts of money may be deposited through trust funds in 
the election fund of a candidate, with no one being able to 
identify the source of that money. This directly contravenes the 
spirit and even the letter of the Canada Elections Act. 
Monitoring, through a legislative framework, the source of a 
candidate's trust funds would definitely have added greater 
transparency to the electoral system, to use a term so dear to 
this government. But the Liberals decided not to endorse that 
recommendation and one wonders why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the appointment process of electoral 
officers, which is another example of transparency that is 
opaque, to say the least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government claim to have a transparent electoral 
process when returning officers are all appointed by the 
governor in council, that is by the party in office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois can only deplore the partisan nature of these 
appointments, something which is unacceptable in a process as 
democratic as an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government preferred to keep this eminently partisan 
instrument, which it can use to its advantage, instead of 
leaving the electoral process in the hands of qualified, 
non-partisan and objective people. Can one truly believe that a 
returning officer appointed by the party in office will be 
unbiased? I have doubts about that in many cases. 
And what about the provisions dealing with third party 
interventions, which set a spending limit only for costs related 
to advertising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it considered issues such as the ones I mentioned earlier, 
my party came to the conclusion that the expressions “reform” 
and “in-depth review of the elections act” were somewhat 
exaggerated. It has been over 30 years since the Canada 
Elections Act last underwent any serious overhaul. The 
government claims to have put forth the so-called principles of 
equity, transparency and accessibility, when in fact it did 
nothing more than indulge in a primarily self-serving exercise at 
the expense of the voters that it should be serving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members missed a good opportunity to demonstrate that 
they really had democratization of the electoral process at 
heart.  It seemed to those of us in the Bloc Quebecois that, 
after thirty years of elections under this legislation, a 
serious reform could, and should, be undertaken.  Having 
experienced, in this last year of the millennium, the Liberal 
regime and its twenty-five gags imposed in the first session of 
the 36th Parliament alone, it would be daydreaming o believe 
that the government truly intended to carry out any real 
modernization of the electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to express the wish that, despite 
the somewhat singular character of the legislative process in 
which we are currently engaged in order to pass bill C-2, the 
government will truly pay attention to the concerns expressed by 
the witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, that it will be open to proposed 
amendments it might receive from the various parties in this 
House, and that it will be prepared to truly make this process, 
this operation to revise the federal election legislation, a 
process devoted to truly democratizing the electoral system in 
Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-2 which is the first 
major overhaul of the Canada Elections Act since 1970.  MPs are 
very interested in the minute details of the bill because it is 
one of the key rule books for the sport of politics and the 
business of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the bill's importance into some kind of context.  The 
biggest single difference between Canadian rules in elections and 
U.S. rules in elections is the fact that we have reasonable 
campaign spending limits in Canada.  In the U.S. spending limits 
are stratospheric.  One does not have to be a billionaire like 
Donald Trump, Ross Perot, Steven Forbes or Oprah Winfrey to run 
an election campaign in Canada as one would have to be in the 
U.S. We do not have to spend most of our time as elected members 
of parliament sucking up to the political action committees of 
various lobby groups that have the power to raise money for our 
campaigns or to spend millions of dollars to defeat us over some 
narrow issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we are seeing a few Americanisms entering our 
process on a small scale.  If the National Citizens' Coalition 
and the Reform Party had their way we would have even more.  They 
want American style health care and American style politics to 
help them get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be proud of the following point.  It cost Barbara Boxer 
$22 million U.S. to win her senate seat in California. That 
amount and more will be spent by both Hillary Clinton and Rudy 
Giuliani as they run for the vacant New York senate seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comparison, I just received a letter from the Chief Electoral 
Officer of Canada saying that the spending limit in my riding for 
the next election will be around $61,000.   With a few more golf 
tournaments and potluck suppers by the hundreds of supporters we 
have in my district we can raise that money easily over a four 
year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have these spending limits in part because David Lewis and 
the NDP were foresighted enough make them part of their price for 
supporting the minority Liberal government in 1974.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. style campaign financing makes running for office an 
impossibility for ordinary citizens like most of us in the House. 
It turns election volunteers into full time, paid professionals, 
running round-the-clock, round-the-calendar election campaigns. 
It reduces interest groups and social movements to buying and 
selling votes instead of trying to influence public policy with 
the strength of their research and the moral weight of their 
arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One benchmark to assess change in the elections act should be 
whether a certain provision helps more ordinary citizens get 
involved in the electoral system.  Then it is worthy of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benchmark is if the provision encourages us to 
concentrate in the public interest and the public good, rather 
than endless fundraising from special interests.  Then it is 
worthy of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many changes in the act that the NDP supports.  We 
support the national riding limits on third party advertising and 
the requirement to identify their sponsors.  We believe 
uncontrolled advertising would distort elections in favour of 
those groups which can afford million dollar ad campaigns at the 
expense of democracy.  Without this clause we would have the U.S. 
style financing to which I referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support polling blackouts during the last 48 hours of 
the campaign.  Poll results are capable of being manipulated and 
the parties involved need to be given sufficient time to respond 
to published findings so the public can get the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support changing the voting hours in Saskatchewan.  I guess 
folks in central Canada who never heard of my province do not 
know that we observe only central standard time throughout the 
year, but at least now we will not be voting later than B.C. as 
we did in the last federal election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the changes which do not automatically deregister 
parties and thereby force the sale of assets if that political 
party for one election could not muster a slate of at least 50 
candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly support the increases in the federal political 
contribution tax credit limits for individuals.  This is an 
inclusionary policy.  It involves more people and is the first 
change since the NDP obtained these credits as part of a package 
to democratize election financing in Canada back in 1974, fully 
25 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another positive change is the fact that all candidates are now 
eligible for the return of the $1,000 nomination deposit once the 
appropriate election expense returns are filed with Elections 
Canada.  Previously candidates needed to get 15% of the vote or 
they would lose their deposit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Official agents can be fired and replaced if necessary during a 
campaign and nomination papers can now be filed electronically or 
by fax.  My colleagues from Yukon, Churchill River, Saskatchewan 
and Churchill, Manitoba will certainly appreciate this change as 
their ridings are bigger than most European countries.  Of course 
they do not have the roads to match, at least not until we have a 
national highway program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our urban friends, the right of access for candidates and 
their volunteers to campaign in condos and apartments is 
strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the changes which make it administratively 
easier for political parties to merge.  Unfortunately, for the 
Leader of the Opposition, it cannot be made politically any 
easier for him, at least not in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are two changes which we oppose, and there are 
some glaring omissions.  We cannot support the elimination of 
so-called “rural vouching”.  People who live in the city often 
do not know their neighbours.  We know that.  However, folks who 
live in the country all know one another.  They grew up together, 
went to school together, farm together, do business together and 
are usually related to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Georgina says that Kaye got left off the list because she 
does not live on the farm any more, then everyone will take her 
word for it because that is the way things are.  Some people can 
tell a lie to a stranger, some people cannot, but it is just 
about impossible to get away with telling a fib to a DRO, a poll 
clerk and three or four party scrutineers from your home town; 
any or all of whom could easily catch you out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario election used the federal permanent voters list 
instead of their own enumeration and advertised for revisions. 
Almost every voter in certain polls in Toronto had moved during 
the intervening two year period.  I know we will find the same 
thing next time in places like downtown Vancouver and, in 
particular, Vancouver East.  If we do not reintroduce some 
mandatory enumeration of polls with a high proportion of renters 
or tenants we may wind up with the American situation where only 
rich people and homeowners get around to registering and voting. 
That would be a shame, unfair and undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other provision I cannot support and my party cannot support 
relates to returning officers.  They are now able to vote, which 
is okay, but they are still appointed by the government.  This is 
significant because they hold the job until they die or the 
riding boundaries change.  These positions should be awarded 
after a competition on the basis of merit.  A whole new merit 
system would be quite a refreshing change in the House of 
Commons.  It is the only way to maintain the appearance of 
neutrality, as well as the practice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing?  There were several issues omitted from this 
review of the elections act, a number of which are very important 
to the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At our recent policy convention we adopted a paper on democratic 
reform which made a number of recommendations, including 
promoting a form of proportional representation as appropriate 
for our country.  A system of proportional representation would 
contribute to the Canadian sense that the House of Commons 
belonged to them and would reduce regional frictions, resulting 
in a more dynamic and equitable democracy in Canada, which is 
another refreshing suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs decided not to examine proportional representation, or PR 
as we call it, in spite of a very thorough presentation by my 
colleague, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, and a lot of 
interest around the table.  Given the level of cynicism about 
politics these days it is a pretty grave omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People feel their vote does not count when the allocation of 
seats in parliament does not fairly reflect the distribution of 
the popular vote.  A modified system of PR, where most of the 
seats in the commons were still constituency based but a portion 
were allocated under a regional or percentage basis under a PR 
system, could go some way toward relieving this imbalance.  PR 
would overcome some of the arguments about regional or provincial 
representation made by some defenders of the unelected, 
undemocratic Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the idea of fixed election dates reviewed 
as well.  Our convention and our party supports this.  This would 
remove one of the advantages that an incumbent political party 
has over every other political party in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the voting age has not been lowered in this version of 
the act.  The Liberals have been trumpeting their so-called 
children's agenda.  In my view, let the young people vote on the 
children's agenda.  In fact, it would be interesting to see how 
often all party leaders volunteered to campaign in high schools 
if these students could actually vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are thought responsible enough to drive at age 16. 
They can be held responsible for committing violent criminal acts 
in adult court.  More than that, they will have to live with the 
long term implications of decisions taken by the parliament of 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, they are taken seriously enough by other parties 
in the House, some of which have been known to offer kids a free 
bus trip, pizza and a bit of booze to skip school and wave the 
flag.  I believe that young people will live up to the 
expectations we have of them and will not disappoint us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many support lowering the voting age to 16, including my 
colleague, the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys, as well as the New Democratic Youth of Canada, the Nova 
Scotia NDP and many other organizations around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, one thing we would like to see addressed, which was 
raised by my colleague from Palliser, is the use of a private 
person's likeness without permission in an advertisement during a 
campaign.  This should not be allowed.  We will work to see that 
this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear the government House leader say that he is 
prepared to co-operate on these issues.  This week we are 
celebrating co-operatives week and I am pleased to see that the 
government House leader will co-operate with all parties to make 
some changes to this very important act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to follow my hon. colleague.  He 
has hit a very important tone; that is, on an issue such as this 
there should certainly be an element of co-operation 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly to Bill C-2, 
formerly Bill C-83, an act to replace the Canada Elections Act. 
As has been pointed out by previous speakers, this is the first 
attempt in over 30 years to address this problem.  The way in 
which this country elects its representatives is the cornerstone 
of democracy.  It is important to examine closely all of the ways 
in which those changes would impact on our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat what has been said earlier, this attempt, although 
perhaps the bill itself may appear at first blush as being rather 
cumbersome and lengthy, is a very important exercise as we engage 
in looking at some of these changes.  Such legislation is 
required to update the language, add new provisions and recognize 
the content to reflect changes in the political landscape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roger Gibbons, a noted and highly respected political scientist 
and author, said that in most instances there is very little 
incentive to change a system that is on the government's side, a 
system that was responsible for electing it.  I give the 
government some credit for having taken this bold initiative. 
Time will tell as to whether some of these suggested changes 
toward making the process more democratic will actually come to 
fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's electoral laws in their current form, while still very 
effective, do require updating.  All Canadians, not just 
politicians, are affected very directly by our electoral laws, as 
voters, political party volunteers, as well as those who work as 
election officials on voting days have a very unique stake in 
what this legislation entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that just 38% of the Canada population elected the 
current government, which resulted in this very precarious 
majority government system that we now have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take the time of the House to review the bill in 
great depth that we are sending off to committee because it is at 
committee where this study will really get down to the nuts and 
bolts.  However, I will point out a number of the positive 
elements as well as some of the areas of the bill that the 
Progressive Conservative Party takes issue with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are pleased to see that third party spending limits 
have been reintroduced to the $150,000 maximum, with no more than 
$3,000 against the individual candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party is also pleased to see that measures have been 
taken to control Internet advertising.  There is no ignoring the 
advances that are being made technologically in the country and 
while the Internet is a remarkable tool of communication for 
millions of Canadians we are still fine tuning its appropriate 
use.  One needs only to mention the issue of child pornography 
and other particular broadcasts that are taking place on the 
Internet to highlight the fact that this is an area that has to 
be examined very carefully.  The potential for abuse is very 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 would eliminate the possibility of adding or deleting 
content from political parties' election websites after a 
blackout period, which is 72 to 48 hours.  This is a positive 
step.  Given the fact that someone could elevate confusion just 
prior to an election, this is something we have to take very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as with the Internet, the emergence of polls as an 
important communication tool is another element that cannot be 
ignored.  The release of polls in relation to the proximity of 
election day has been an ongoing source of concern and 
frustration both for the elector and the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased therefore to see that the provisions in the 
bill would require an individual or polling company who releases 
a poll during a writ period to provide an in-depth analysis of the 
poll itself, speaking to the voracity, I suggest, and the 
importance of the accuracy of the information being relayed.  One 
can only hope that this measure would dramatically reduce the 
number of polls that are perhaps based on inaccurate or 
inadequate data.  I also believe that it is important that the 
media take greater responsibility in clearly outlining the poll's 
methodology and how the findings were reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very positive change that has been alluded to is the 
changing of the voting hours, particularly in the province of 
Saskatchewan, but I suggest it is as important in Chicoutimi as 
it is in Antigonish or anywhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting addition to the legislation that is not contained 
in Bill C-2 would be to require the chief electoral officer to 
notify the leader of a political party of any outstanding filings 
from candidates.  This, I believe, would be consistent with the 
efforts to be more transparent and open as to how all financial 
matters are being conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports the initiative of the chief 
electoral officer to provide candidates with an estimation of the 
spending limits in their respective ridings.  Greater clarity and 
understanding of the rules of engagement are extremely important 
to running efficient, effective and honest elections.  This is 
certainly a tool that would assist candidates as they undertake 
their election preparedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the finances that takes place in Bill C-2 is 
an extremely important part of the legislation.  Increased 
accountability, increased accessibility, transparency and all of 
those fine watch words that we hear have to be more than just 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the previous speaker, there is a high degree of 
cynicism that exists about the process that of course flows into 
a degree of cynicism about politics in general.  If we can 
address this at the outset, early in the process, the process 
that is responsible for each and every member of the House 
arriving here in Ottawa as a representative, it will perhaps help 
to stem, to a degree, the cynicism that does exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being able to identify how much money is given to parties will 
allow for scrutiny.  There is some concern as to how this might 
act as a disincentive to some, but it is certainly an important 
area to look at and it is one of the specific areas that we in 
the Conservative Party very much look forward to examining in 
greater detail at the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perhaps important as well to look at the raising of the 
thresholds for 75% of political tax credits from $100 to $200. We 
have some concerns with respect to the publishing of 
contributor's names and specific information about where they are 
doing business, their location and the ways in which they may be 
contacted.  This may be a disincentive for some and if we want to 
encourage people to participate on a financial level in the 
process I think there has to be some respect for confidentiality. 
However, this will be dealt with in greater detail at the 
committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The return of the $1,000 candidate's deposit also encourages 
people to participate in the actual process because this is the 
basic threshold that a person has to cross to enter into the 
fray.  The return of the $1,000 deposit is an important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation simply requires that a name be provided 
when a donation is made.  Bill C-2, just to hearken back to my 
earlier point, now requires that an individual must provide 
addresses for publication.  This may raise real concerns for 
individuals who do not wish to have this information made public. 
The committee will be delving into that in greater detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concern that the Conservative Party has, and it 
is a rather vague concept, deals with the issue of party mergers. 
I will not get into this particular debate today.  There has been 
a lot of debate outside of the House in a different context, and 
it is not something that the Conservative Party has pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initial interpretation of the section in Bill C-2 dealing 
with mergers requires simply that two political parties wishing 
to merge obtain a signature of two leaders in respective parties. 
I can think of a personal example where that will not happen.  A 
30-day waiting period is then imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is some concern that when an election is called, 
that the merger itself would be nullified.  So there is some 
nebulous content in the bill respecting mergers.  I believe we 
may be heading down a slippery slope if we were to accept carte 
blanche what is currently in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other concern I would just like to put on the 
record.  Our party has some difficulty with the role of the 
registered district agents or auditors.  While the principle 
behind this is sound, it is imperative that the mandate and the 
position of this particular person be clarified in the 
legislation.  The role of the registered district agent or 
auditor has far-reaching powers and it is something that must be 
clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also aware of the seriousness of electoral fraud.  We 
know it can be a problem.  We must therefore empower those 
auditors and individuals entrusted with the role of overseeing 
elections with the ability to act and act with clarity and force. 
However, those powers must be carefully examined before they are 
laid down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there was mention of the difference between rural and 
the vouching for individuals.  We recognize that there is in some 
instances in rural communities the ability of a neighbour to come 
and vouch for a person but there should be some clarity and 
perhaps a method for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged that the government has recognized this as an 
area for change to produce a more democratic, better functioning 
electoral system.  I look forward to taking part in the debate at 
the committee and look forward to waiting to see how the 
government will react to the input that it will receive no doubt 
from all members of the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased to be able to speak in the debate on the new 
Canada elections bill. I was the chair of procedure and House 
affairs last year when we dealt with this matter on a preliminary 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been mentioned by some members of the opposition 
that this is a large bill.  The fact of the matter is that this 
is one of the underpinnings of our democracy.  Our legislation 
and Elections Canada are a model to the world.  People come to 
Ottawa regularly from other countries to examine how we do 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been 30 years since there was a comprehensive review of 
this important piece of legislation. Over those years, of course, 
given the changes in technology and in communications across the 
country, all sorts of smaller changes have been made to it, 
trying to keep it up to date and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased at this time that the government has 
seen fit not just to fix parts of it but to take this very basic 
piece of legislation and develop what is essentially a new act. 
The time is right for that given the changes of the last three 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process on how this was done has been mentioned.  It was 
unusual, and I realize that it may be difficult for some 
opposition members to understand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which is 
the committee responsible in the House for the Canada Elections 
Act, conducted an elaborate review of this last year.  I 
recommend the report that resulted from that review to all 
members of the House and to anybody watching this on television. 
I recommend it not because it provides all the answers or that it 
provides a sort of complete blueprint from which this new 
legislation was taken, but because it presents all the views of 
registered parties, members of parliament, members of the House 
and others who appeared before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report does not say one way or the other how it should be 
done.  It says what particular issue is at stake, what the views 
are that were presented to us and whether or not the committee 
had a consensus view.  The report, which involved very wide 
consultation in the House and beyond, provided the basis for the 
drafters of the legislation, which was very useful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee's consultations, we did not start with a 
blank space.  We had before us the work of our predecessors over 
the last 30 years in the House of Commons, for example the Lortie 
commission which the minister mentioned.  We considered the 
recommendations of the Lortie commission, many of which have not 
been acted upon, with great care and included them in the 
committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also considered the recommendations of the special committee 
of the House which dealt with electoral matters only a few years 
ago.  We considered those and they are also referenced in the 
report.  The drafters had the Lortie commission, the 
recommendations of the special committee of the House and the 
general framework laid out based on the consultations of last 
year's Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, continuing the process, the minister wants the bill to go 
directly to committee for further consultation not only with 
members of the House but, as usual, by holding public hearings 
with people across the country.  There will be further input.  I 
commend the minister for that.  It is very courageous and 
appropriate to get the bill into committee now so it can be 
debated by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now heard from the minister and a number of members of 
the opposition parties.  There was criticism of course from the 
opposition parties but it was constructive criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is a very thick document, I would like to point out 
the sorts of things the bill is trying to deal with.  In doing 
that I underestimate the bill in some ways.  It is not a bill 
that simply fixes bits and pieces of the legislation.  It is a 
bill that rewrites the legislation to fit with the modern era. 
Nevertheless, I will mention some of the specific points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples of the way people as voters will 
benefit from the legislation.  Canadian voters temporarily abroad 
will be able to submit their ballots at embassies and consulates. 
The legislation has not been revised for 30 years. Thirty years 
ago it would have been very difficult to administer a system like 
this.  One can well imagine people in remote embassies trying to 
get a valid vote back into Canada.  It could have been quite 
difficult and could have delayed the process. We now need 
something easier so that is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made the point about signs in multiple dwelling 
units.  We know we can canvass in buildings which are like small 
communities in some of our cities.  People live in those 
communities.  They walk the corridors, ride the elevators and so 
on.  The legislation, with respect to signage from political 
parties, has been different inside these dwellings than it was 
outside.  The modern reality is that many of us live in multiple 
dwellings.  It is very appropriate that those of us who do live 
in those dwellings have the same chance to advertise and show our 
political affiliation as the people who live in single or small 
units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members think about the changes over the last 30 years, they 
think about the role of polls. 
Polls are now part of modern life like so many other things. 
Maybe in the backs of our minds we would like to turn the clock 
back to when polls did not exist but they do exist. It is now 
possible to sample thousands of people in a very short time and 
very quickly put the results of that sampling in front of people 
as they are watching TV at night.  This is now recognized in the 
legislation today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not ban polls or anything of that sort. 
Among other things, it states that during an election campaign 
when a poll first appears, the first time it is mentioned in the 
campaign, the methodology, that is the exact way in which the 
poll was conducted, will have to be given to the public.  We will 
know if is a straw poll and it is somebody selling hamburgers and 
counting the hamburgers that are red or blue or whatever the 
methodology may be, or if it truly is a statistically based 
sampling of people in all regions, people of all ages, people of 
different income groups and those types of thing.  I think it is 
very appropriate nowadays because the general public is well 
informed about such things.  Now, when a poll first appears in an 
election, the methodology will be described and it will allow us 
all to judge the reliability of the results of that polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have so much information and it is so easy to get 
information out, it is very appropriate that the legislation 
provide us with more complete information on the registered 
parties, what they stand for and what their organizational basis 
is, more information on the candidates who run, whether they run 
for main line parties or some local issue of that sort, and more 
information on what we in the House now know as third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third parties are groups that are not registered and have no 
running candidates in an election, but want to be able to 
advertise on a particular issue in a certain constituency. Again, 
it is very appropriate when that occurs. If it is a legitimate 
activity, we need to know who those people are, where they are 
coming from and, in this legislation, that there be information 
about them and spending limits—in this case $3,000 per 
constituency—on them in the same way as all candidates and all 
parties have spending limits and have to provide information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental piece of legislation.  The process so far 
has been very positive and open.  It is my sense that when this 
gets to committee it will create great interest and input from 
all members.  I look forward to the discussions. I urge all 
members to move forward so that at the end of this process we 
will have a new, even stronger Canada Elections Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have to admit that this is one of those days when I am actually 
sick to my stomach to be a member of parliament.  It is obscene 
and unconscionable that the government brings through, to serve 
its own ends, some of the restrictions on the freedom of speech 
that it is doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that a ruling party seeks to restrict the ability of 
any other person or group to counter government propaganda during 
an election is frankly evil.  The government currently uses its 
advertising to an unfair advantage.  It uses unbridled partisan 
activities.  I could come up with numerous examples but I do not 
think I need to.  The population of the country knows them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why a government is allowed to use taxpayer 
funding to get themselves re-elected.  I think that is wrong. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens should be able to enforce provisions by filing 
complaints with Elections Canada to prevent governments from 
doing those types of things with taxpayer funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect I would like to touch on is the whole idea of 
patronage.  Elections Canada as an instrument of democracy is 
rife with people who are chosen by the government to do its 
bidding during elections.  I cannot think of a better example in 
government of a totally patronage ridden system. Other countries 
would be wise never to copy such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to spending limits, two separate court decisions in 
Alberta have struck down spending limits as unconstitutional.  It 
is not the place of the government to limit the right of an 
individual Canadian or a group of Canadians to spend their own 
money in support of an idea.  There is a saying that nothing is 
so important as an idea whose time has come, but you can bet that 
this government will toss as many roadblocks and obstacles at the 
success of an idea as it possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite just one example among many, the Charlottetown accord. 
Those people who call others enemies of Canada outspent the other 
side by a ratio of 13:1, yet the people's voice still came 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending limits only really serve the interests of the governing 
party.  I will elaborate on that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding registered party status, in March an Ontario court 
struck down requirements that would force a party to run 50 
candidates in order to have its candidates listed with party 
affiliation on the ballot. By what rationale are two candidates 
or more not sufficient to be recognized as a political party? 
This is why.  It is because the governing party likes big 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals like the idea that you cannot start up small and 
expand and it does not like competition.  That is the reason 
these rules have been put in.  It goes so far as to require the 
liquidation of a party's assets and to send the money to the 
receiver general for failure to run 50 candidates in an election. 
How dare they.  Why not let the voters rather than the 
government decide who they want to represent them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing but a clear attempt to stifle the formation and 
growth of new parties and to limit competition on the ballot.  In 
other countries that have proportionate representation they make 
selections between 35 parties or more on a given ballot, yet the 
Liberals, the ruling party across the way, tell Canadians by this 
legislation that they are too stupid to make the same types of 
distinctions on ballots.  That is exactly what the Liberals are 
saying by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small issue which one of the other members touched on is the 
idea of party mergers.  This legislation will disallow local 
decisions for parties to run a single candidate between them. 
Instead it centralizes power and requires the signature of party 
leaders in order to perform some sort of local merger.  It 
disallows the idea of local decisions and local 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the idea of voter identification, currently an electoral 
official may ask for proof of identification but a voter can take 
an oath instead.  Imagine the strange and bizarre scenario where 
a homeless friend of the prime minister could arrive at a voting 
station and say “I do not have any proof of my eligibility to 
vote or proof of residence”.  “What is your name, sir?” “John 
Crouton”.  “Where do you live, sir?”  “24 Sucks Us Drive, 
Ottawa, Ontario”.  And that person may be eligible to vote. That 
is a travesty in our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of abuse could go on at our polling stations. 
Identification should be shown to prove eligibility and 
residence.  That is only fair.  It substantiates our right to 
vote and gives it some validity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about taxpayer subsidies.  We should oppose any 
assistance to political parties and political lobbies from public 
funds.  Taxpayers should not be expected to fund activities 
designed to persuade them how to vote.  There should be no 
reimbursement for those types of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of byelections, the legislation reads now that 
byelections must be called within six months but not held within 
six months.  The distinction is it allows the ruling party to 
time byelections according to its own circumstances which it does 
all too well.  With new computerized voters lists there is no 
problem with holding elections within six months and indeed that 
has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a few different sources which I think eloquently 
back up some of the things I have been talking about today, some 
of the travesties which I think are being done to our elections 
act and to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dave Rutherford writes a column in the province of Alberta and 
also runs a local talk radio show.  He pointed out that one of 
our former prime ministers actually once said during an election 
campaign that it was not the time nor the place to discuss 
complex issues.  A person who says that kind of thing is probably 
the type of person who wants to bring forward legislation that 
would restrict freedom of speech and restrict competition on the 
ballot.  I do not doubt that for a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people want to control the election agenda.  They want to 
ensure that political parties themselves, particularly the 
government party, can establish the agenda of an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I note that I only have one minute left in my 
time. I would like to quickly read into the record the type of 
subsidies that go on and who they benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upshot of this is that the Liberals had a spending limit of 
over $30 million in 1997 but surprise, $22 million of that was in 
direct and indirect subsidies from the Canadian taxpayer in terms 
of spending rebates and political tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is wrong.  People should do what they can to fight 
this legislation.  I urge those who challenge it in the courts to 
please do so.  I hope that even though legislation like this was 
brought forward by Trudeau in 1983, again by the Conservative 
government when it was in office and by the NDP in British 
Columbia, that it once again will be thrown out as 
unconstitutional by the courts of this land.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is always a privilege to take part in a debate as important as 
the one we are conducting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of the measures in the bill are as a result of 
a long broad based, painstaking consultation process. Today we 
are referring this bill, the new Canada Elections Act, to 
committee before second reading. The results of the consultation 
were subjected to careful analysis by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.  The proposed amendments to the 
current Canada Elections Act stem directly from that analysis 
which was performed by members of all parties represented in this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first responsibility as parliamentarians is therefore to 
pass those improvements into law and give Canada an elections act 
which is suited to the society of today and more important still, 
to the society of tomorrow. We should bear in mind that the new 
elections act we pass will govern the election of the first 
government of the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second responsibility and no less important, far from it, is 
to uphold Canada's role in the eyes of the whole world as a 
leader in democracy.  The virtues of our democratic system are 
known and recognized the world over.  In this area as others, 
Canada has served as a model, one which is acclaimed at home and 
indeed abroad.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have a firmly established reputation for democracy, 
we must always work continually to maintain it. Our whole 
democratic system in its fullest and most noble expression rests 
first and foremost on our electoral process, the very process 
which is our task to perfect here today. We must work to perfect 
it.  We must ever strive for perfection knowing however we will 
never fully achieve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how strong our collective commitment as members of 
parliament to the shared cause of serving Canadians may be, there 
will always be new circumstances, special situations, unforeseen 
snags and impediments along the way.  Simply the process of 
social change, the pace of which has increased exponentially as a 
right of technological explosion, makes a periodic review 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments before us today are in keeping with the existing 
act's three hallmarks: fairness, transparency and accessibility. 
They relate chiefly to the three distinctive areas of 
administrative adjustments, publication bans and spending by 
third parties during election campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last point, the courts have found some aspects of the act 
to be too restrictive and incompatible with the charter of rights 
and freedoms.  However while that decision settled one problem, 
it has created another.  The result is while the official parties 
and candidates must abide by stringent spending rules, the third 
parties remain exempt.  We believe this is fundamentally unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the broad public support in the regulation of 
election expenses, especially as we look to our neighbours to the 
south and see that it seems that now only the rich may run, there 
has been demonstrated public support for extending this rule to 
third parties.  To make these rules fair for everyone, Bill C-2 
will raise the spending limit for third parties to $150,000 
nationally and $3,000 per riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second main issue of the bill deals with the matter of 
publication bans which have also been contested in the courts. 
The regulations concerning partisan advertising and the 
publication of public opinion polls have been the subject of 
various court challenges.  On this point too the new measures are 
based on the principles of fairness but also accessibility.  They 
would limit publication bans to the 48 hours before the vote and 
require that the methodology used in opinion polls be released at 
the same time as the poll results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, the first major component of the bill 
relates to various changes of a basically administrative nature. 
Here more than anywhere else the three great principles of 
fairness, transparency and accessibility apply and are in 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had previously settled the problems relating to the release 
of election results and closing of polling stations given the 
existence of different time zones in Canada.  However, we had not 
dealt with the special case of Saskatchewan which, unlike the 
other western provinces, does not move its clocks forward in 
summer. The bill provides for this adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another inequity had cropped up under the current act which was 
with returning officers not having the right to vote except in 
the event of a tie.  This did not appear consistent with the 
provisions of the charter of rights and freedoms. This bill will 
give the returning officers the right to vote like all Canadians. 
If there is a tie, there will simply be another vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point relates to urban concentration. Multi-unit 
buildings, condominiums and homes for the aged are proliferating 
in some towns and are home to a growing number of voters.  We are 
proposing in Bill C-2 to let candidates campaign in dwellings of 
that type and to let tenants or owners, as the case may be, put 
up posters and signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my experience that certain boards of condominiums 
have instituted private bylaws prohibiting canvassing which then 
is enforced by security guards.  I was involved in one situation 
where the security guard was fired for having let canvassers into 
the building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our existing Canada Elections Act is an exceptional, remarkably 
effective document which has served Canadians well for many 
years.  Many other countries in the world would like to be able 
to say the same.  It remains however, like many other laws, that 
it needs to be updated periodically.  Some of its provisions are 
30 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have pointed out, the changes before us are based on a 
thorough analysis of the situation performed by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, an analysis which I 
think we can all agree is untainted by partisanship.  That 
analysis yielded a number of suggestions and in some cases, 
conclusions which were included in the committee's nearly 
unanimous report.  Based on that report the government framed the 
new measures that are being proposed to improve the Canada 
Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I believe these new measure will achieve their 
purpose.  I am convinced that in the medium term and the long 
term the new provisions will raise the quality of our democratic 
system to a still higher level.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of a new elections act is to build democratic 
respect for the rights and freedoms of a country's citizens and 
let all citizens freely choose the people who will represent 
them, defend their rights and ultimately ensure their quality of 
life.  I wholeheartedly recommend passage of the bill in its 
entirety. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
after the Constitution Act, the Canada Elections Act is, without 
a doubt, the cornerstone of our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act, which encompasses the entire electoral 
process, is to ensure that the rules of democracy are respected 
so that the House of Commons reflects, as faithfully as 
possible, the wishes expressed by voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act has not been overhauled in over 30 years. 
It was time, and we might have expected Bill C-2 to opt clearly 
for transparency.  On reading it, however, we are forced to 
admit that, for this government, there is many a slip twixt the 
cup and the lip.  The transparency is still veiled; I would even 
go so far as to say that the veils number at least seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 577 clauses in the present bill.  For the initial 
consideration of some 250 pages of text, before Bill C-2 is 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, 301 parliamentarians will have a total of 180 minutes: 
three hours of debate.  This will allow a mere 6% of elected 
members to speak.  Given that nine of 18 opportunities to speak 
go to the government party, that leaves nine for the four 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, the decision to go with this entirely parliamentary 
rule might suggest that the government is not too inclined to 
hear what the opposition might have to say on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the few minutes allotted to me, I would like to draw 
particular attention to two points that we feel are fundamental 
but which are striking by their very absence: democratic funding 
of political parties, and the method of appointing returning 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 20 years, Quebec has been able to take just pride in 
having had the courage to clean up party funding by allowing 
only individual voters to contribute to party coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution limit is set at $3,000 per voter. 
The Quebec legislation, which has been in effect for over 20 
years, has been proven effective and we are sorry that Bill C-2 
shows not even the hint of a desire to take a similar approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, not a month goes by that events do not make us think 
that perhaps the influence of contributors to the government's 
electoral fund is directly proportional to the size of their 
cheque.  Is it simply by chance that the Minister of Transport 
is on good terms with the president of Onex? The question is 
put; it is up to you to come up with hypotheses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the bill before us today will not increase the public's 
confidence in the political parties.  The old adage “Them that 
has gets” has not lost its meaning entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as corporations, both large and small, can contribute to 
the electoral coffers as they like, with no restriction, 
democracy will be at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a country that wants to be the best and prides itself on 
being so, the federal approach to funding in this bill is an 
obvious blight on democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 75 days or so, we will be in the next millennium.  How can we 
not regret the fact that this government prefers the status quo 
to clearly opting for transparency?  Not only is the ordinary 
individual's perception of elected officials not improved, but, 
more importantly, democracy would come out ahead with 
legislation that recognized the vital need to give back to 
voters and to them alone the responsibility for the vitality of 
the political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second matter I would like to draw your attention to is that 
of the selection of returning officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to cast any doubt whatsoever on the ability of 
the governor in council to make valid recommendations in this 
connection. Moreover, making the number of appointments of all 
kinds that fall under its jurisdiction must be a full time job. 
Yet the fact that appointments of returning officers are 
perceived as political appointments in itself casts some doubt 
on the impartiality of these appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of returning officer is key to the entire electoral 
process.  He is responsible for applying the legislation and for 
settling any conflicts.  As everyone is aware, a decision can 
satisfy some and stir up controversy with others.  Just how wise 
is it to maintain a controversial system of appointment rather 
than assigning this responsibility to a committee which would 
examine applications for the position submitted in a 
competition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could a candidate defeated in a previous federal election be 
appointed returning officer?  There have already been 
appointments as surprising as this within the present selection 
process.  It is not unreasonable to believe that a committee 
would select from among the candidates the person best fitting 
the requirements of ability plus impartiality.  And if, by 
chance, a former Bloc Quebecois candidate were to become a 
returning officer, there is a good chance that he or she would 
make an excellent one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, the government had a choice of transparency, but 
once again it has chosen the status quo.  That is a choice that 
we regret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the 18th century, Montesquieu wrote “The love of democracy is 
a love of equality”.  Canada is a democratic country, but 
democracy is as fragile as fine china, and the lawmakers have a 
duty to protect it. 
Not only to protect it, but to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By maintaining the present rules for political party funding and 
the appointment of returning officers, Bill C-2 confirms our 
suspicions that the democratic discourse adopted by the 
government does not necessarily have as its corollary any love 
for equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We greatly regret this, and in the words of Châteaubriand, a 
parliamentarian himself, we are forced to acknowledge that this 
bill does not meet our legitimate expectations and that, 
“despite the efforts of democracy to raise its standards with 
its grand goals, its standards are lowered by its actions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a pity that the democratic habits of the Liberal Party 
will, instead of raising the standards of Canadian democracy, 
remorselessly lower those standards.

to speak today to Bill C-2 to amend the elections act. 
My presentation will be somewhat different from some of the 
others we have heard so far, which I must say have all been quite 
interesting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be very specific in my comments.  I want to make clear 
that I am not necessarily speaking in terms of advancing New 
Democratic Party policy.  It is a policy in a number of our 
sections.  I know it is a policy also in a number of other party 
sections, particularly the youth sections.  I am referring in 
particular to section 3 of the elections act which states that 
every person who is a Canadian citizen and is 18 years of age or 
older on polling day is qualified as an elector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we begin the 21st century, we hear more and more from all 
political parties about the concern of young people.  The way 
society and the economy are going there will be a future for 
them.  The younger generation will be taking on major leadership 
roles very quickly and at very young ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should listen to the words of the government House leader 
today when he said that we should work to make the act better for 
all Canadians.  This is the first time we have had a chance for 
some major overhaul for the past almost 30 years and we should 
consider lowering the voting age from age 18 as it currently is 
to age 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably most MPs like myself spend a lot of time in high 
schools talking to young people.  If there is one point that 
stands out clearly it is that young people today are very 
informed, very serious, and very hard working.  We do not often 
hear about them.  We often hear about the ones that are the small 
minority, but overwhelmingly young people today are incredibly 
bright, hard working and dedicated to their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes very clear that they are very well informed about 
political, economic and societal issues.  When it comes to 
elections in some cases I am prepared to say that many of 
Canada's young people aged 16 or 17 are probably more informed 
than their parents on some issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it is not time for us now to be as bold in our 
thinking as members of parliament as others in the past were bold 
and said against incredible opposition that it was time for women 
to have the vote.  To think anything other than that now is 
absolute folly.  Also it was suggested a few years ago that first 
nations people should have a chance to vote.  To think back that 
we as a country only allowed first nations people to vote in the 
1960 general elections is almost incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am suggesting that young people aged 16 and 17 should be 
given the opportunity to participate in Canada's electoral 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 215 of the criminal code says that everyone is under a 
legal duty as a parent, foster parent, guardian, or head of a 
family to provide the necessities of life for a child under the 
age of 16 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At age 16 a whole number of things change for young people.  At 
age 16, for example, they can drive any kind of vehicle on our 
highways.  They can join and serve in the armed forces of Canada. 
They are eligible for adult court consideration in our justice 
system.  They can use a firearm and go hunting.  They can leave 
school if that is their wish.  They are no longer under their 
parents' legal obligation to care for children.  They have the 
legal right to get married and to raise children.  They can be 
eligible to receive social assistance but they cannot participate 
in Canada's electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not permitted to vote.  They can go hunting, drive 
cars, get married and join the armed forces, but we do not permit 
young people who wish to vote the opportunity to cast their 
ballots in terms of the party of their choice and of the policies 
of their choice.  After all, people who are aged 16 and 17 
probably have the most to lose or gain by policies that parties 
and governments put forward compared to others in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happens in other jurisdictions that have 
given the vote to young people aged 16 and 17.  There are 
countries which for a number of years have said that they want 
our young people to participate in the electoral process, to get 
involved.  We do it for a particular set.  Young people of 16 and 
17 years of age are welcome to join a political party and choose 
the leader of that party.  They are welcome to participate in 
enumeration during election time. They are welcome to participate 
and develop party policy for the New Democrats, the Reform Party, 
the Conservatives or the Liberals. 
They can choose leaders, develop policy and participate in the 
electoral process, but they cannot vote.  There seems to be some 
inconsistency here, some slight hypocrisy in our positioning when 
we say we want to involve young people in their country's 
electoral process, we want them to participate but we will not 
let them vote on voting day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a window of opportunity which we have not had for a 
long time as members of parliament.  We can say to young people 
that not only do we want them to participate in the electoral 
process to determine the future of their country but we certainly 
want them to be able to cast a vote on election day by lowering 
the voting age from 18 to 16. It would potentially add almost 
700,000 young people to the voters list. They would not all want 
to vote, just as their parents do not all want to vote.  A lot of 
adults do not vote today but the majority do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are jurisdictions that have permitted young people to 
vote. A number of years ago Brazil said it wanted 16 and 17 year 
olds to participate in the electoral process.  There were a lot 
of naysayers who said that they do not care about politics and 
they will not participate, blah, blah, blah, but the reality is 
quite the contrary. The participation rate of 16 and 17 year old 
voters in Brazil is higher than the average.  In other words, 
given the opportunity to involve themselves in a meaningful way 
in their country's future, these young people rallied to the 
cause, as do young people in Nicaragua.  They also have the 
opportunity to participate and vote at ages 16 and 17.  They are 
participating and showing interest in numbers beyond those of 
their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the young people I know and I suspect it is the same for 
my colleagues in the House of Commons, when we go to high schools 
and technical schools and we talk to these young people about the 
future, they have ideas.  They know the situation.  They have 
concerns.  They would love to participate in the electoral 
process if we gave them that opportunity.  From the limited 
information we have of those countries that permit this, not only 
do young people participate but they participate 
enthusiastically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the youth wings of all the political 
parties in the House have endorsed this concept, at least in 
principle or in detail.  Many of the provincial sections of our 
parties have adopted the idea of considering lowering the voting 
age from 18 to 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look through the various clauses of the elections act 
before us, clause 3 says a person has to be 18. Let us go back 
30, 40 or 50 years, or to where we changed the age from 21 to 18. 
It was stated at that time that 18 year olds were much more 
informed than they were previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about the technological revolution that has taken 
place in the last few years.  Now young people are plugged into 
the electronic world probably a whole lot more than we are.  They 
understand the issues.  They know how to get the information. 
Those who wish to be are tuned in to the web pages of political 
parties.  They are on the Internet. As a matter of fact some of 
them spend half their life on the Internet becoming informed 
about all kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those young men and women who are 16 and 17 years old, let 
us be bold as members of parliament as we approach the 21st 
century and extend to them a welcoming hand. Let us say we want 
them to participate in their country's electoral process.  For 
goodness sake let us give those who wish to vote the opportunity 
to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me first say that I find it 
particularly satisfying and exciting to begin the new session of 
parliament with the prime objective of improving our nation's 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2, the purpose of which is to replace the current Canada 
Elections Act, was born of a great consensus here in parliament. 
The measures that are being proposed are in fact the outcome of a 
long and comprehensive consultation exercise, a process in which 
all parties represented in the House took part through the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
That consultation, conducted with the highest regard for the 
principles of parliamentary democracy, generated many suggestions 
and even allowed us to draw certain conclusions. The bill we are 
examining today is therefore not exclusively the creation of the 
government; rather it reflects to a considerable extent the 
opinions of all parties present in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our electoral system has certainly made its mark throughout the 
world.  New democracies are taking inspiration from it and using 
it as a model.  True, this electoral system has evolved over the 
years and up to now has generally served the Canadian people 
well.  But like anything else in the real world, an electoral 
system is never perfect. Because the society it serves is 
constantly changing, our electoral system must not only keep pace 
with this evolution, but it should anticipate it to the greatest 
extent possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to think of it, an electoral system is never 
intended to respond to the limited needs of the day.  On the 
contrary, an electoral system must anticipate tomorrow's 
democratic society and prepare for it.  To achieve this 
objective, Canada has spared no effort.  Over the past few years 
there have been countless studies and reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lortie commission on electoral reform, to name one, made 
numerous recommendations.  Those recommendations brought about 
the striking of a special House committee which in turn produced 
five separate reports to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, Canada's chief electoral officer, Jean Pierre 
Kingsley, submitted his own report following the 1997 election. 
This towering mass of work bears witness to the interest 
parliamentarians take in electoral reform.  This new bill marks 
its culmination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, our task is basically to improve a system that has made 
our democracy a source of pride and international recognition. We 
must correct a few imperfections, fill some gaps, update some 
components of the existing act to better reflect today's reality, 
but perhaps most important, adapt each measure to the 
requirements of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This latter aspect relates to some of the financial measures 
more specifically, the participation of third parties in election 
campaigns, for example.  To what extent should we accept this 
participation and what restrictions are to be imposed on 
spending?  Those issues have already raised much controversy, 
including legal action. In this regard, the new bill provides for 
higher limits to allowable spending, $150,000 nationally and 
$3,000 per riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of administration, Bill C-2 includes a series of new 
measures intended to facilitate many matters and here again to 
better respect Canadians' rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other measures, Bill C-2 provides that returning officers 
will have the right to vote, which has not been the case in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third important aspect of the bill concerns publication bans 
on both advertising and polls.  This is another aspect of the act 
that has been contested before the courts.  The elections act of 
1974 banned all electoral advertising at the beginning of the 
campaign and before voting day.  This was the situation until 
1996 when the Alberta Court of Appeal rejected this principle in 
the Somerville case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as publicizing the result of polls is concerned, the ban 
applied for 72 hours before polling.  Last year however, the 
supreme court handed down a decision in the Thomson case 
declaring this to be inconsistent with the exercise of rights and 
freedoms.  That decision of the supreme court also added an 
important proviso in that it stipulated voters should be given 
the opportunity to make up their own minds as to the credibility 
of polls by analysing the methodology.  Thus the court was saying 
that parliament's restrictions might be more acceptable if they 
included a requirement to make the polling methodology public 
along with the results of each poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the government has opted for the best possible 
compromise in the new measures being put forward. First, all bans 
at the beginning of the electoral campaign are lifted. 
Second, the bans before voting day are shortened from 72 hours to 
48 hours. Third, the bill requires that the publication of all 
public opinion polls during an election period include in the 
first 24 hours of publication, full details of the polling method 
applied. This decision first and foremost was intended to ensure 
fairness toward all voters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously some will cry censorship.  They will argue that 
Canadian voters are perfectly capable of separating the wheat 
from the chaff and selecting the information that is meaningful 
to them.  That may very well be. However the 48 hour period is a 
means of giving the voters a bit of a respite before they go to 
the polls, allowing time for personal and individual reflection 
without outside influence.  I should note here that the supreme 
court in the Thomson decision did not take this reflection period 
into consideration. I believe this is a serious argument that 
brings the new measures entirely within the intent of the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to polling methodology, its publication will enable people to 
get a better idea of whether the results are based on 
professional polling or amateur surveys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, this electoral reform is yet another means of 
preserving what is most precious to all the people of Canada, our 
democracy.  As we go about our day to day business we do not 
often have to think of it and when we do, we often see our 
democratic freedoms as an acquired right, perhaps even as our 
due.  Yet it takes only passing attention to international events 
of late unfortunately to remind us of the richness of our 
democracy.  It is this richness that Bill C-2 seeks to preserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Canada being a world leader in this area, there is no 
standard to follow. We must learn as we go. We must learn from 
our mistakes, our imperfections and our evolution. This is 
exactly what electoral reform is aimed at, improving the 
elections act equitably and transparently.  Surely it is possible 
in order to safeguard what we as Canadians most cherish, our 
democratic freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, modernizing the 
Canada Elections Act is of the utmost importance to update a 
tool that is indispensable to the framing of our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is not going too far to say that, after 30 years, we 
must carefully look at every detail of this issue. It is a 
start. Members of the House of Commons have done some 
preliminary work that is very important. But this bill is far 
from being perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this exercise, it is essential to keep in mind that the work 
that has started and will continue over the next few weeks and 
the next few months will serve Canadian democracy and also each 
Canadian who must assume his or her responsibility to vote at 
specific intervals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to consider certain elements which, to us, seem 
indispensable. This is a very laborious exercise. We are 
addressing issues on which it may be difficult to reach a 
consensus. The numerous clauses and hundreds of pages setting 
out the proposals to be submitted to the House at a later time 
force us to recognize that it is almost a monk's job that will 
be asked of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be hard to agree on everything. Regarding the financing 
of political parties, for example, policy issues will arise that 
will need to be discussed. And these will be difficult issues. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, for example, the issue of popular financing, which was 
introduced in Quebec. In spite of the fact that the act marked a 
huge improvement in the exercise of democratic rights, it is not 
perfect either. Under the provincial act, a business or its 
members may still contribute to the financing of political 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in a law firm, only personal contributions are 
allowed. However, the firm itself could very well ask its 
members to contribute to a political party with the promise of 
being reimburse by the firm. A direct link between financing and 
democracy is not as easy as it may seem to make. 
These are nuances that will be important to address in debate or 
in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selection of returning officers is also an issue that will 
have to be addressed. We need to put in place a system where 
returning officers at least appear to be beyond too direct 
political influence. In debate, it will be very interesting to 
hear suggestions from all political parties and all Canadians on 
how to improve this procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also be important to consider issues such as the voting 
age. It is becoming almost unavoidable to change the legal 
voting age given that, as one of my colleagues noted, young 
people are increasingly well-informed, and from an earlier age, 
about the problems and challenges they will have to face during 
their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be important to consider changes in that respect. 
Letting younger people take part in a democratic process, in an 
election, would probably force the vast majority of Canadians to 
be more attuned to the priorities that are of particular concern 
to young people. Some of our debates, which have been going on 
for over 15, 25 or 30 years, will have to be set aside, so that 
we can deal with issues that concern young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, we have to be open to the idea of lowering the 
voting age. To allow young people to vote at age sixteen might 
be appropriate. At that age, and even before, young people are 
increasingly aware of the issues confronting them. Such a change 
might bring some fresh air to the Canadian democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that these amendments to the Canada Elections 
Act concern all Canadian voters. 
That is why we may have to try to go as far as we can in seeking 
a consensus, so as to achieve near-unanimity in the House of 
Commons regarding this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will obviously be policy issues involved. Each party has 
been adhering to certain principles for many years, even 
decades. In undertaking a review of such an important act, we 
should perhaps set aside the principles that have guided our 
actions in the past and be more forward-looking instead. This is 
important in order to give all Canadians an act that will 
reflect a great deal of openness regarding several issues, 
including financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financing has always been a very divisive issue in Canada, where 
we have the strict public financing process as we know it in 
Quebec and the traditional financing system used elsewhere in 
the country. 
I think it is possible to reconcile the two and come to agree on 
financing methods that are acceptable to all Canadians, without 
contravening the principles of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised the issues of polls, electronic information, Internet, 
etc., and we will raise them again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to limit such action rationally, because it is 
possible—democracy is important, we must protect it—to put it 
to demagogic use even.  Therefore, activity involving election 
polls and electronic information that will be distributed 
increasingly, both publicly and within our families, must be 
given a framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the fact of having to publish the full 
rationality behind polls conducted will prevent, obviously, in 
the context of a regular election campaign, the publication of 
certain polls intended strictly to serve partisan purposes and 
to manipulate the very democratic action people are called on to 
take from time to time, namely vote in all good conscience. 
This is an important point that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the number of hours in which the publication of 
polls both rational and less rational will be controlled is 
surely good news and will enable all Canadians to cast their 
vote in an objective and rational way that will benefit the 
country as a whole.  I believe that our role as politicians is 
to do everything necessary to promote transparent democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the various parties, everything must be done, in the 
context of the revision of election legislation, so that the 
periodic act of voting by the public may be governed by 
objective and non partisan rules.  I am sure that all the time 
spent revising the Canadian election legislation will be 
beneficial for decades to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for having given me a few minutes to express 
my thoughts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to begin by expressing my support for the bill introduced by the 
government leader and reminding members that the new measures in 
this bill are the result of consultation by various parties over 
a period of several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to the time difference dilemma, we realized 
that the situation of Saskatchewan called for special attention. 
The minister has already covered this this morning.  A special 
amendment in the bill also applies to the various aspects of 
publication during an electoral campaign.  The problem of 
blackouts arises, not just with respect to advertising per se, 
but also with respect to the publication of opinion polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has set out the government's reasoning very 
clearly: in any democratic election, the electorate must have 
the final word, without any interference or influence.  Under 
the 1974 legislation, third parties claiming to have no 
political affiliation could intervene financially and however 
they wished in an election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, partisan independence was quickly challenged and, in 
1993, new legislation had to be introduced to limit their 
spending to $1,000.  And this was where the domino effect of the 
Charter came into play, because the courts ruled that such a 
limit was contrary to the exercise of rights and freedoms.  The 
solution thus led to a new problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is public pressure on the government to do something 
about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls have shown that eight out of ten Canadians approve the 
imposition of third party spending limits.  What is more, 79% of 
those polled think that these third parties should not be 
allowed to spend more than the candidates, as is now the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new bill, the government is therefore proposing that 
third party spending be capped at $150,000 nationally, and 
$3,000 per riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still on the topic of funding, another factor called for 
immediate attention and that was inflation.  By keeping its 
fiscal house in order, the present government has undoubtedly 
managed to minimize inflation's impact in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, since the 1974 legislation, the need for 
improvements at the electoral level has made itself felt.  And 
this is another of the provisions in Bill C-2. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, the bill is a good step in the right direction. 
I am certain there will be other desirable measures in the not 
too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on record a suggestion that was made by a 
group of constituents in Davenport who some months ago suggested 
the establishment of a declined vote ballot paper.  In other 
words, the option ought to be given to the elector to indicate 
that he or she declines to vote as a form of rejection, 
disapproval or malcontent with the candidates who are indicated 
on the ballot paper, none of whom meet the expectations of the 
elector.  It is a novel idea.  It is the subject of a private 
member's bill which I put forth.  I look forward to the 
opportunity of explaining it in more detail at the appropriate 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding I will comment on the financing of election 
campaigns.  Election campaigns need not be as expensive as they 
are now.  They can be run on much smaller budgets, with much less 
publicity at the national and local levels, with perhaps more 
debate and with particular discussions at the community level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt we have a good system in place.  It is the 
envy of many other electoral jurisdictions, but we have to make 
progress on the question of maintaining the electoral process as 
independent as possible from sectoral interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect I urge the government to give serious 
consideration to the elimination of contributions by sectoral 
interests such as the corporate sector and organized labour and 
trade unions and to increase the incentives for individual 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that kind of system which exists in some jurisdictions the 
head of a corporation or union would make a personal 
contribution.  In other words, the contribution would be on a 
personal basis rather than on the basis of a company or a union. 
The person would make that contribution out of the funds 
available to him or her as a private citizen and not as a 
contribution in the name of a corporation that may pursue 
specific interests in the legislation in the following parliament 
with a specific bill under certain conditions, or may use the 
threat of the withdrawal of contributions in future elections as 
a means of obtaining the attention and bending, so to say, the 
will of the government of the day.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ideal goal that we ought to be aiming for would be a system 
in which individual contributions would become more and more in 
number, thus enhancing the democratic quality of our system 
because it would involve more people recognizing their civic duty 
and their civic right to make contributions to the party of their 
choice, but on a private, personal and individual basis.  At the 
same time this would be coupled with the goal of eliminating 
corporate sector and organized labour contributions and any 
contribution by a specific narrow interest in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to recognize that this is one of the issues that the 
government has already tackled in Bill C-2, by way of its 
amendments, which will deal with sectoral interests and specific 
interests with respect to publicity and intervention during an 
election period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the right path.  We are moving in the right direction. 
We now need to build on this measure contained in Bill C-2 and 
move toward a system that will allow for the flourishing of 
individual contributions and a gradual, if not determined, 
elimination of contributions from the corporate and organized 
labour sectors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak in 
opposition to the government's scheme to torpedo Bill C-2 through 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes changes to the Canada Elections Act.  It is a 
very important bill for our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues, the hon. members for North Vancouver and 
Calgary West, have already pointed out, this bill was examined in 
committee during the first session of this parliament.  Yet, the 
contents of the bill being introduced today prove that the 
Liberals have ignored the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee.  It is as if there had been no committee hearings at 
all with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally bills before the House are sent to committee for study 
after the debate at second reading has taken place.  Because the 
government could not get this bill passed in the first session, 
is it reintroducing it and sending it to the committee 
immediately, where it can secretly amend it?  Or, is it to 
prevent the bill from being amended as a result of having no 
debate at second reading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of the 
Canada Elections Act, especially those that benefit the ruling 
party, in this case the Liberal Party.  Our elections should be 
democratic, free and fair, offering equal opportunity to all 
candidates and all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been asking for changes to the way we elect our 
federal government representatives.  With this bill we see 
clearly that the Liberals have once again failed to respond to 
the wishes of Canadians.  What a great way to start the second 
session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week the Liberal government that lacks vision is being 
particularly undemocratic with Bill C-2.  The government has 
wasted an opportunity to modernize and democratize the Canada 
Elections Act.  Specifically, it has failed to deliver changes to 
a number of things; for example, patronage appointments, party 
registration requirements, campaign financing, third party 
spending issues, the reimbursement of election expenses, voter ID 
and the timing of elections and byelections.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time I have to speak on this bill I will say a few 
words about some of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about patronage appointments.  Under the current 
elections act the system of patronage allows parties to appoint 
people to positions.  Returning officers are political 
appointees.  The returning officers appoint their own assistants, 
poll clerks and others.  This is a way of rewarding the party 
faithful, which has no place in our electoral system.  It is 
outrageous in what is supposed to be a non-partisan, impartial 
and neutral electoral organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada always recommends against a patronage ridden 
system when it helps developing nations set up their electoral 
system.  Yet, the Liberals are maintaining the system because it 
benefits them.  They go out to preach what they do not practise 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada has repeatedly asked the government to release 
it from the patronage system and allow it to hire its own staff 
for elections by advertising and interviewing based on ability, 
merit and experience.  Many Reform MPs have insisted in the past 
that these appointed positions be advertised in newspapers for 
staffing instead of filling these positions as patronage 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer's report on the 36th general 
election made the same recommendations as we have been proposing 
on this side of the House.  Opposition MPs on the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs supported this position, 
but the Liberals opposed it, proving that the government's 
position is politically motivated in what should be a 
non-partisan situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third party spending limit is proposed to be $150,000 during 
a federal general election, of which no more than $3,000 may be 
spent on any particular riding.  We believe that it is not the 
place of government to limit the rights of individual Canadians, 
or group of Canadians, to spend their money in support of a cause 
or a candidate in federal elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from levelling the playing field the Liberals are 
challenging the hallmarks of our democracy.  For example, the 
ruling Liberal party has free broadcasting time based on the 
number of members of parliament it has, far and beyond what any 
other party is allowed to have.  Have the Liberals changed that 
situation with this bill?  No, absolutely not.  This would give a 
huge advantage to the Liberals by restricting the ability of any 
other person or group to counter government propaganda during an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the requirements for registered party status. 
The elections act requires a political party to run 50 candidates 
in an election to remain a party on the ballot.  The courts in 
Ontario say that only two candidates are needed to form a party. 
It is the voters, not the government, who should decide whether a 
party or a candidate is worthy of their vote.  It is up to the 
voters, not the government.  This is an attempt by the government 
to hinder the formation and growth of new parties like the Reform 
Party.  The government is actually trying to limit competition on 
the ballot.  It is undemocratic.  It is anti-democratic.  The 
government should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding voter identification, currently, when there is doubt 
about a voter's identity or right to vote, that person may be 
asked for proof of identification, or the voter can be asked to 
swear an oath.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  If someone is 
evil enough to try to commit fraud in an election, surely we can 
assume that the same person would have no problem swearing an 
oath, lying to God or to himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding electronic voting, the Liberal government is ignoring 
the realities of the information age in denying us the use of 
electronic voting methods that are more efficient, less costly 
and more universally accessible voting systems.  In Ontario 
electronic council elections can be run for one-sixth of the 
normal cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the reimbursement of a party's election 
expenses.  The Liberals allow reimbursement of campaign expenses 
and then restrict eligibility for reimbursement to certain 
parties.  What is going on here? 
There should be no reimbursement at all to any candidate or any 
party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 retains the requirement for a candidate to deposit 
$1,000.  The candidate's deposit should be much lower, in the 
interest of encouraging Canadians to participate regardless of 
their financial position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are many other areas where the bill could 
be criticized as undemocratic, including the lack of fixed dates 
for federal elections, the timing of byelections, government 
advertising or propaganda before an election, and others, but 
time prevents me from commenting on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read an e-mail from one of my constituents. 
Bill Lawton states:  “All in all I feel this is just an affront 
to democracy.  This bill is really draconian and not relevant to 
the democratic citizenry”.  My constituents know all about the 
bill. It is manipulation by the power hungry government in power. 
It is nothing less than dictatorship, worse than even the 
military government in Pakistan.  Let alone scandals, it is 
enough to call this government corrupt.  It is a crime in broad 
daylight.  The government must amend Bill C-2 and restore 
democracy in Canada. If this bill goes through in its present 
form Canadian voters should refuse to vote Liberal in the next 
election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in 
support of the government's introduction of a new elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin my remarks today by congratulating Elections Canada 
for the work it has done in the past.  I know that under the new 
bill it will continue to do fine work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved directly in two elections.  I do not know 
if Elections Canada is monitoring this speech, but if it is I 
want to say how well I thought it did from my own personal 
experience.  Any Elections Canada official I had to deal with was 
extremely fair and I have had nothing but a good experience with 
the organization.  I know that with the new bill it will continue 
to operate in a fair-handed, even manner and we look forward to 
the continuation of a tradition which I think Canadians hold 
dear, democratic elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada really is like a referee.  We have the best 
election when we do not notice that it is there.  It is like a 
sports game where we do not notice the calls that are being made 
by the referee.  There is much work that Elections Canada does in 
getting ready for an election, such as voters lists and setting 
up the polls.  It is a tribute to the hard work that there are 
not more complaints, given the complexity of the task of having 
people vote in a country as large as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to some substantive issues which have been 
addressed by members opposite.  The opposition has raised the 
issue of the bill going to committee before second reading.  I 
want to point out to members in the Chamber and to Canadians 
generally that by having the bill go to committee before second 
reading gives committee members greater latitude for a fuller, 
broader debate and to make different amendments than they would 
otherwise be able to make if the bill went to them after second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic principles of parliamentary procedure are that once a 
bill goes through second reading it has been approved in 
principle.  Amendments that can be made are somewhat more 
narrowly defined than would be allowed under parliamentary law, 
or more narrowly defined in that they cannot go against the bill 
which has already been approved in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By going to committee before second reading committee members 
can have a broader debate.  They can look at numerous amendments 
in a broader context.  Being a member of that committee I look 
forward to having a very full and frank debate, which will impact 
on all of us elected to the House as well as Canadians 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of administrative changes that are being 
proposed in the bill and there are reasons we need to make those 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's electoral laws are based on principles we value as a 
democratic society:  fairness, transparency and accessibility. 
They provide the framework of our electoral system.  A House of 
Commons committee has concluded that Canada's electoral law 
remains strong, although a number of provisions came into effect 
nearly 30 years ago and should be updated.  The proposed 
administrative changes are based on the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first electoral administrative change I would like to talk 
about is the adjusting of voting hours.  We will allow for the 
adjustment of voting hours for areas that do not switch to 
daylight savings time when other clocks move ahead one hour. 
This will ensure that polls in Saskatchewan will close either 
before or at the same time as polls in Alberta and British 
Columbia.  This corrects the problem experienced in Saskatchewan 
in the last election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we all remember a time when it used to be a grievance 
of western Canadians that as they turned on their televisions on 
election night there was a sense that the election had already 
been determined even before they had cast their votes because of 
the time zone switch.  A government may have obtained a majority 
once the returns were made in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and 
Ontario.  By the time the returns got to either the prairie 
provinces or British Columbia, the majority had already been set 
and there was a sense that their vote did not matter as much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that.  The government was wise to try to correct it 
in the last parliament.  Now we are fine-tuning it a bit so that 
we will get the results at the same time.  In 1997 it made for an 
exciting return.  All Canadians have a sense that their votes 
count just as much when the returns come in at roughly the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will also provide for standardized hours of voting for a 
single byelection or more than one byelection in the same time 
zone, being from 8.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.  It will enable returning 
officers to vote.  At present they may vote only in the case of a 
tie.  It will authorize the electronic submission of nomination 
papers for all candidates to take account of the advent of new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will ensure the right of electors to post reasonable 
electoral signs and of candidates to canvas in multiple unit 
residential buildings, including condominiums, during campaigns. 
Having canvassed in apartment buildings, as have most of the 
members of the House. it is often a case of dispute between 
oneself and the caretaker of the premises.  It will be good to 
have it spelled out more clearly in the Canada Elections Act that 
candidates actually have a right to go into apartment buildings 
during reasonable hours to canvas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will abolish the process of vouching to reduce the risks 
of electoral fraud, a practice whereby rural voters could vouch 
for neighbours at the polling place so that they would be allowed 
to vote even when they had not been enumerated.  It will 
consolidate, clarify and modernize the language and organization 
of the act to make it easier to understand and apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to elections financing the bill makes a number of 
changes.  Some of them are minor and some of them are more 
substantive.  To offset the impact of inflation it will increase 
the threshold to $200 from the $100 level which was set in 1974, 
the 75% threshold for the political tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us as politicians who have to raise money understand what 
this means, but the general public may not.  Right now, if one 
makes a donation to a political party one gets a tax credit for 
75% of the first $100.  That was set in 1974 and obviously it 
needs to be updated in light of inflation so we are proposing 
that it be raised to $200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will increase the threshold for disclosure to $200 from the 
current $100 limit.  This provision ensures that all donors who 
contribute more than the threshold level to a registered party, 
candidate or third party are identified by name and address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of what level the threshold should be, whether $100 or 
$200, is somewhat academic.  The main point is that it is an 
example of something that makes our system fair.  If one wants to 
donate to a political party, whether one's name is Gerry Schwartz 
or some other name it becomes a matter of public record. This is 
one of the key elements of our electoral law that prevents 
corruption in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone may want to try to influence me by making a donation to 
my party or to my campaign.  However, if it has to be public 
there is a record.  The opposition can obtain that record and 
raise the issue in the House.  The local media can obtain it. 
This is one thing that limits the influence of big money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have a system of which we can be particularly 
proud, particularly in comparison with the system in the United 
States where the accusation is often made quite rightly that its 
politics are driven by big money.  The amount of money that a 
congressman or senator has to raise to run for re-election in its 
federal system is somewhat scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My next campaign will spend in the neighbourhood of roughly 
$50,000. 
My equivalent in the United States would probably spend in the 
neighbourhood of millions of dollars.  That is something of which 
all of us should be proud.  It is something we should applaud. It 
says something very worthwhile.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new act we will require a more detailed financial 
reporting by registered parties.  It is the same issue of making 
sure that parties conduct their business in a transparent way. If 
a party is receiving money from individuals, they are registered 
and become public.  It will also let us know what money is being 
spent on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a campaign there are limits on what someone can spend. It 
should be open and transparent reporting so that we can see 
whether someone is trying to sneak around the campaign limits by 
spending money ahead of the campaign.  Proper reporting is one of 
the cornerstones or the guardians of making sure that people do 
not overspend their limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act will also prohibit the transfer of surplus funds 
from a party or local association to a candidate after polling 
day.  All this does is prevent someone from trying to run to 
raise money for their own personal benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy the government is proceeding with the bill.  As a 
member of the committee I look forward to debating with the 
opposition the merits of the bill and any amendments that will 
come forward from all members of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to rise in this short debate today.  As you 
know, Mr. Speaker, but perhaps not everyone within hearing 
distance of the debate knows, we are indirectly talking about 
Bill C-2.  The motion before the House right now is whether or 
not we should send the bill to committee prior to second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some experience with this matter.  I will use the 
first couple of minutes of my time to address what we are really 
supposed to be addressing today, whether or not the bill should 
go to committee at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was first introduced I thought it was a very good 
idea.  We could get bills out to committee and let the members of 
the committee work through the bill in its initial stages so that 
before there is an entrenched position we could exercise the give 
and take of debate and give due consideration to various aspects 
of the bill.  Hopefully we would come forward with a bill with 
less controversial wording and less in need of amendment.  The 
whole idea sounded like a really good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do I put this gently and within the rules of parliamentary 
language?  I think committee work in this parliament is a sham. 
That is really a strong statement but it really is so, 
unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I wish members opposite would listen to what 
I am saying.  I know they have a duty to protect their political 
party and the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sham in this sense.  It is known that the Liberals as 
the governing party dominate every committee.  For the Liberals 
to have eight members and all of the opposition parties together 
to have seven is I suppose okay, but unfortunately government 
members lose their freedom in committee as they do the House. 
Just as we have had members of the Liberal Party stand with tears 
in their eyes to vote against something they were deeply in 
favour of, so we have those members in committees controlled by 
the leader of the government or the minister, as the case may be. 
I have firsthand experience in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for 
Elk Island has the floor.  With all the yelling that is going on 
it is very hard for the Chair to hear him.  I know members are 
enthusiastic in their support of what he has to say or against it 
as the case may be, but it is nice to be able to hear the words 
of wisdom of the hon. member for Elk Island.  I am sure all hon. 
members would like to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really wish they would give 
thoughtful attention to what I am trying to say.  As defenders of 
democracy, as they like to call themselves, they should also be 
speaking the same words I am now speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that when I was first elected in 1993 I came here and 
I was involved in a particular party.  I brought in an amendment 
to a bill at committee.  It was one of the first bills that went 
to committee before second reading.  I was involved in the 
debate.  I thought it would be great and I put forward an idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear majority of members, including those on the government 
side, were in favour of the amendment I proposed.  One Liberal 
member used my name and said that I had a good idea.  I cannot 
use my own name here.  It is a stifling of freedom of speech in 
the House of Commons.  I proceeded with the amendment to the 
wording of the bill and assumed that it would be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There came a day some time later when we voted on clause by 
clause in committee.  The chairman asked “Shall clause one pass, 
shall clause two pass, shall clause three pass”.  When it came I 
moved an amendment to the appropriate clause as required by 
procedure and the Liberal members all voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on I challenged them.  I said “I thought you guys were on 
my side.  I thought you agreed with the common sense of what I 
was trying to propose”.  I would never divulge the name.  Nor 
would I even identify the riding, which is within the rules here. 
The Liberal member to whom I spoke looked at me, shrugged his 
shoulders and said  “We really don't have a choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward that evidence to say that the whole process is a 
sham.  Even though the committee will do the work, and I have no 
doubt that it will try to do good work, the ultimate control will 
come from the government House leader in that committee.  He will 
basically dictate what the final results of the bill will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surely unfortunate that I do not have a couple of hours to 
debate everything.  I will have to hurry.  I will now talk a 
little about the bill.  My colleague has already mentioned the 
magnitude of Bill C-2.  It is a huge bill.  It has 250-some 
pages.  There is a lot of detail in terms of prescribing how we 
conduct our elections.  The index alone has xxii pages, and I 
will talk about two of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government House leader who made a speech this 
morning, one of the topics covered is improving the way our 
elections work and of improving democracy in Canada.  I want to 
talk about clause 39.  It is important to actually put on the 
record what it says.  I want to alert Canadians across the 
country from coast to coast who are sitting there glued to CPAC 
this morning to pay attention to what it says.  There are several 
different positions.  I cannot read them all but they all have 
this wording: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the returning officer shall solicit names of suitable persons 
from the candidates of the registered parties whose candidates 
finished first and second in the last election in the electoral 
district, to be submitted to the returning officer— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it says that the candidates shall be appointed as much as 
possible half from the candidate's party that finished first and 
half from the candidate's party that finished second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is not Elections Canada and the work of Elections Canada 
impartial?  Is that not what democracy is?  We have right in the 
elections act proposed by the government an entrenchment of a 
practice which has been in our procedures for far too long. There 
is a pay off if one votes correctly.  The Prime Minister will 
tell people in his riding to vote for him and he will be able to 
funnel millions of taxpayers dollars into the riding. That will 
be their prize for voting for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to give Canadians free choice to vote for the 
candidate and the party that are principled and that represent 
the true values of Canadians.  We should not cloud that decision 
by the immediate appeal of having money funnelled into the riding 
or getting some patronage appointments at the next election 
because all these positions are paid for by the Canadian taxpayer 
via Elections Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised when I was first elected to find out that this 
process existed.  In fact I was a brand new candidate back in 
1993.  I had never participated in elections before and one day I 
got a phone call telling me that the Reform Party came second in 
the 1988 election and that I now had the right to name all the 
deputy returning officers in the polls.  I said, “That cannot 
be, Elections Canada is surely impartial.  Just because we came 
second surely does not give me the right to now say that the 
people who voted for the Reform Party in the last election will 
now get a payoff, a government job”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was wrong and I recognized it right away even though I was 
inexperienced.  I declined.  I told the returning officer in Elk 
Island to choose the person who did it the last time if she or he 
did a good job.  I also said that I did not care what party the 
person was with, but that if there was somebody who worked last 
time and did not do a good job that I would give my permission to 
fire them.  I should have been out of the loop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principled Reform Party, not the one of political expedience 
doing anything that needs to be done to get elected but rather 
the one that is based on principle, says that the Reform Party 
supports giving Elections Canada the power to select and hire all 
of its own employees, including but not limited to returning 
officers, deputy returning officers and other field staff.  We 
believe that the decision should be made on merit and on ability 
to do the job and not based on a debt to be paid because of 
having shown favour to one political party or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had time I would also love to talk about many other issues 
in Bill C-2 but of course with this process we cannot.  I have 
only these few minutes and members cannot even ask me any 
questions. That is regrettable, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My colleague spoke so eloquently that I wonder if the House would 
agree to allow him another 10 minutes.  It was such a great 
speech, I would like to hear more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the hon. member for Elk Island's time by an additional 10 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to speak to Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly interested in the analysis and comments by 
the previous speaker with regard to the work of committees.  In 
the last two years I have served on the public accounts committee 
which is chaired by one of the Reform opposition members who, I 
would add, does a very good job, is very impartial and fair and 
really runs an excellent committee.  We have a process in place 
here where the official opposition automatically gets the 
opportunity, if it so chooses, to chair the public accounts 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also served on the citizenship and immigration committee and 
filled in on a number of different committees.  The committee 
system that is in place is not dysfunctional and is not what the 
member has said, a sham.  In fact, it is representative of the 
make-up of this place.  Why would that be?  Interestingly enough, 
the majority of Canadians voted for this government in two 
elections in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we abdicate our responsibility?  We have been told by the 
Canadian people that they want the Liberal Party and this Prime 
Minister to run the government.  We understand that the 
opposition is not happy with that.  I served in opposition myself 
to a labour party, to Bob Rae and—I will be nice—his group of 
colleagues.  It was somewhat frustrating, to say the least, to 
see a majority government of New Democrats in the great province 
of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it appears to me there 
are not very many members to hear the speech of the member 
opposite.  I ask that quorum be checked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum.  The hon. member for 
Mississauga West has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not my fault if the 
room empties when I stand up to speak.  I try to do my best.  I 
do appreciate the assistance to bring in some of my colleagues 
whom I know are working hard at their desks on behalf of the 
people of Canada and their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often wonder why the Chamber is so sparsely populated 
when members of parliament speak.  It is because we have so many 
things to do and committees are just one example.  Even though 
the official committees are not up and running yet, although I 
understand they will be in a day or two, we, in particular, have 
caucus committees.  We have interparliamentary committees of 
Canada and Europe that are meeting and, as we speak, the 
Canada-Taiwan interparliamentary committee is meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last evening I had the privilege of having dinner with the 
parliamentary group from Barbados who are here on official 
business and will be here for question period.  There is a lot of 
work to do. I recently attended a meeting of AECL where it gave 
us an update of its work around the world.  To denigrate the work 
of members really is not fair.  It is not something that I would 
do on that side of the House and would not expect it to be done 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the committee system is very clear in this 
government.  In this place, in Ottawa, there is a role for 
opposition members.  Sometimes I am quite surprised, actually. 
Were I in opposition, I think I would be substantially more 
aggressive in going after— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Or effective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I might be more effective, I do not 
know.  I will leave that for others to judge. I certainly would 
find more opportunities to raise issues.  I do not see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a proposal forward back in the Ontario legislature in 
1992.  In fact, I stood for the leadership of our party.  One of 
my proposals was that a bill should not be referred to committee; 
an idea or a problem should be referred to committee and that a 
committee should be convened in an attempt to write a bill and to 
put forward a solution that could go in the bill rather than 
having the bureaucrats draft something, put it on our desk and it 
appears too many times to be a fait accompli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about as close as I have seen any government get to that 
particular principle.  This is taking the bill reforming the 
Elections Act into committee before second reading.  If I were in 
opposition I would have my staff working overtime going through 
the bill.  I would see this as an open and accountable government 
giving opposition members the opportunity to make comments at 
committee, to repair anything they thought needed repairing, to 
change parts of the bill and to have input into the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get?  We get, I am afraid, the somewhat typical 
response, “If they are doing it, we must disagree with it”. 
That really is unfortunate.  It is somewhat myopic and 
narrow-minded. 
It does not do credit to the constituents who sent these people 
here, who expect them to roll up their sleeves and get into 
committee and work with government members and other members of 
the opposition to make this bill a better bill.  Why would anyone 
opposed it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>My next election will be my tenth at the municipal, provincial 
and federal levels.  I have had some experience.  In fact, my 
wife has had three elections.  She sits on the Mississauga 
council.  I guess one could say we are a bit of a political 
family.  We care about the process that is in place.  We care 
about the rules.  I, along with my family and the government, 
believe very much that the rules need to be fair for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I would go a little further with this reform.  If I 
have an opportunity at committee, I might even float an idea that 
members may accept or reject.  I believe there should be a 
penalty for someone who does not vote.  I know it is a very 
controversial idea, but there are places in the world where they 
actually do that.  The penalty in Australia is a fine.  It could 
show up on one's income tax reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it disgraceful that municipally we only get a 30% voter 
turnout.  It is the one level of government, in my view, that 
impacts more directly on people's lives than any other level of 
government and less than 30% of the people vote.  In fact, if 
there is not a high profile contest for mayor, quite often less 
than 20% of the people vote.  However, they are quick to pick up 
the phone to call their elected representative to solve a 
particular problem in the community, for example, if the garbage 
is not picked up or they have other difficulties.  They just do 
not accept the responsibility to cast a ballet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincially, that percentage goes up to between 50% and 60% 
depending on, I guess, the nature of the election.  In the 1995 
Ontario provincial election I think there was a higher voter 
turnout because the public generally wanted to dismiss the 
government of Mr. Rae that was in office.  However, we have now 
slipped back down again.  Federally, it again increases into the 
65% to 75% range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a country with democratic freedom and we see other 
places in the world experiencing difficulties, in particular, the 
problems we see in Pakistan today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of being part of a parliamentary group 
visiting Croatia during the first free election since the second 
world war.  I saw men and women lining up down the street, with 
tears in their eyes, having the first opportunity to actually 
cast a ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell members what that experience was like.  When I 
walked into the polling booth there were Yugoslav soldiers with 
rifles on their shoulders standing on either side of the ballot 
box. Behind the ballot box was a life-sized picture of General 
Tito. It was only just a little bit intimidating to those people 
casting their ballot.  I tried to lighten it up by pinning 
Canadian flags on the lapels of the soldiers but I do not think 
they were particularly amused by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one sees that kind of thing, when one sees people fighting 
and dying for freedom and democracy all around the world as we 
have seen in our generation, one realizes that a Canadian who 
does not cast a ballot unless there is a legitimate reason, 
although I cannot think of one other than being dead, is not 
living up to the responsibility that goes along with the freedom 
of living in such a great and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go even further, but the bill at least sets a level 
playing field, makes it fair for everybody involved and cleans up 
the election procedure in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
pleased to take the floor for the first time in this new 
session, and especially so because we are debating the Canada 
Elections Act, which is supposed to be completely amended by 
Bill C-2, an act respecting the election of members to the House 
of Commons, repealing other acts relating to elections and 
making consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to take part in this debate because I have been 
involved in the consultations undertaken by the chief electoral 
officer after the May 2, 1997 election. He was looking for ways 
to improve this legislation which is rather outdated. 
For well over 30 years, it has not been revised significantly, 
and the chief electoral officer was striving to have it amended 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After what I had gone through and what had been reported to me 
in my riding during the election, I got involved in this process 
with the help of an excellent lawyer and friend of mine, 
Jean-François Lacoursière. As a legal adviser to the Bloc and a 
good adviser on electoral law, an area in which his expert 
opinion has been frequently sought, he agreed to write a report 
which I have tabled in the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, a report we may come back to. It has hardly been 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, it is very hard to find one's way around in this 
bill. 
Mr. Lacoursière himself told me some time ago that the Canada 
Elections Act was very difficult to consult and to understand. 
This is not normal. The federal government is already being 
criticized for its lack of transparency. The elections act is an 
extremely important important tool in that it is the basis of 
the election process in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is important to call a spade a spade. It is 
important for the thousands of people who have to work with the 
Canada Elections Act at some point to be able to find whatever 
they are looking for quickly and efficiently instead of always 
feeling lost in the legalese used by government lawyers—we hope 
they themselves can find their way through it. It really is 
difficult to consult that document, which is at least one inch 
thick. 
Something is wrong here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems raised by Mr. Lacoursière dealt with issues that 
will undoubtedly be raised again, issues like voting by mail, a 
process that is riddled with flaws, and voting at mobile polling 
stations, a process that will certainly have to be refined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech, I will touch on three main elements of this bill 
on which we are criticizing the government. First, there is 
political party financing, which is not a new issue but which 
deserves to be raised again because of the scandalous way in 
which political parties are managed and because of the 
connections that exist between large corporations and the 
election funds of traditional political parties in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we want to address the designation of returning 
officers. Third, we want to talk about voter identification, 
something that leaves a lot to be desired and, here again, we 
can give some examples from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Party financing is really outdated. We have not made any 
progress in this area. We know full well that the legislation is 
full of holes that allow corporations as well as individuals to 
shamelessly contribute all they want to Canada's traditional 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues like the Onex proposal, which I feel, as a Quebecer, goes 
against the best interests of Quebec and maybe even of all of 
Canada and which, notwithstanding its basic flaws, demonstrates 
the more or less honourable relationship between the Liberal 
Party of Canada and the main promoter of the Onex deal, can only 
further undermine the proposal. 
We feel this entitles us to criticize this proposal all we want.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its credibility is open to question, given the known 
relationship between one of the major contributors to the 
Liberal Party, former Cabinet members and current party 
managers. The federal government blithely announced that there 
will be a moratorium, as if it were one of its own management 
decisions. Obviously, it is part of the Onex agenda to get the 
federal government involved at some point by taking such a 
measure to help the deal along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government obviously committed itself in favour of 
Onex, for reasons that may too shameful to mention because they 
are related to the financing of the party currently in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> It is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> This is shameful, because it is primitive. 
So-called civilized societies such as ours should ensure that 
rules are in place to protect government decision makers from 
undue influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what democratic financing is all about. This is what we 
realized in Quebec. We set a limit of $3,000 for contributions 
made to political parties, and such contributions can only be 
made by voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parti Quebecois government is depending on no one in 
particular, but on everyone, whereas this government depends on 
financial backers such as oil and pharmaceutical companies, 
banks and logging companies. All these businesses contribute 
tens of thousands of dollars and, in return, get privileged 
access to the ministers and the Prime Minister. This is 
unacceptable, it is a unending scandal, and it is easy to figure 
out why the government sometimes makes very dubious decisions. 
It is all a matter of cause and effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the financing process is flawed, it is not possible to look 
after the public's interest only. The government must take other 
things into account, because the telephone could ring at any 
time and someone might say “We will remember this the next time 
you come looking for work or money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, governing is complicated enough in itself. Therefore, 
it is a good thing that the Quebec government does not have to 
concern itself with private interests. This is the strength of 
the Quebec government, given the complexities involved. It is 
free to act. It only needs to do so intelligently, whereas the 
federal government must accommodate all kinds of phantoms who 
remain nameless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second major criticism has to do with the appointment process 
for returning officers. This is issue is not as well known. We 
are talking here about the qualifications of individuals who 
hold strategic positions in each of the ridings, during 
elections. These positions should be filled through a process 
that is above suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, what we have is basic and primitive; it does not 
provide any protection against abuse. 
All these people possess personal qualities that are beyond 
doubt, but there is one condition that must be met to be a 
returning officer for Elections Canada, or so it seems, although 
it is not written down anywhere: to be a member of the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  It is even better if one has been the 
president or vice-president of an association, and better yet a 
defeated candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable, and primitive.  It smacks of the way 
things are done in a banana republic.  Canada is one of the 
western democracies that go around preaching to the whole world 
on how things should be done.  We travel all over the planet to 
tell people how to govern themselves, and yet to this very day 
we still tolerate having as one of the main, yet hidden, 
criteria for appointment active membership in the Liberal Party 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all off, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada saw how 
incongruous and unacceptable the situation was, and has long 
been recommending that the Canadian government change the rules 
so that, like Quebec, there would be a competition to designate 
elections staff, as indeed there should be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally—and I shall close with this—the last weakness is that 
there is not a word about voters being required to identify 
themselves with a card or some other means.  Given the 
impersonal character of our society and our big cities, it is 
completely normal for citizens to be required to identify 
themselves to the person at the polling station, since we know 
all the funny business there can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in within the order of things for voters to be required to 
identify themselves to whoever is duly mandated to require it 
before giving them authorization to vote, a fundamental right in 
a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet again, this is a considerable weakness in the bill and one 
against which we must speak out. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to enter this debate today with respect to the 
Canada Elections Act. I find it of considerable interest.  I sat 
on the procedure and House affairs committee and this was 
certainly a part of the committee's work.  I thought we did it in 
a very non-partisan, effective way that ended up being very 
succinct and to the point in terms of the kind of meaningful 
changes Canadians expect in terms of their electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada have a model electoral system that is emulated 
around the world.  It is certainly considered to be one that is 
of great interest to nations wherever they are in the world. It 
underscores the great democracy that we in Canada have.  It is 
one which I think we should be very proud of in terms of its 
effectiveness and what it means for Canadians wherever they may 
live in this great land of ours. It also underscores the values, 
institutions and symbols that unite us as a people and present us 
as an effective nation not only to ourselves internally but to 
the wider world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised by the Reform Party, especially the 
member for Elk Island who tried to denigrate the things we are 
trying to do.  Instead he should be celebrating the fact that 
this bill is going to committee where they can be part of a 
system where there can be effective changes. Instead of trying to 
work with the government in this all important area, Reformers 
are content as usual to take extremist views to try to sabotage 
the system. That is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But then Reform is a party that is always intent on pitting 
region against region, people against people and group against 
group. It is most unfortunate that Reformers take that tact all 
the time. It underscores where that party is coming from.  I know 
Canadians want and will have no part of it. What Canadians will 
have a part of is the government's position on this all important 
legislation, understanding that this is the way we have to go. We 
need to ensure that we do the right thing for Canadians in this 
area because it underscores our democratic system as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues I could get involved with, election 
financing for example.  I know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry but it is my duty to 
interrupt the hon. member and the proceedings at this time and 
put forthwith the question on the motion now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  All those in favour of the motion

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yea.

nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In my opinion the yeas have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And more than five members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The chief government whip on a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Discussions have taken place between all the party whips. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 45 I believe you would find consent to 
defer the recorded division just requested on Bill C-2 until 
later this day at the end of the time provided for government 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there consent to defer the 
division to 6.30 p.m. as agreed to by all the whips? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will call it again if need be but I 
believe five members rose and I am prepared to defer it. 
Therefore the vote is deferred until 6.30 p.m.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should inform the House that after 
that 20 minute speech debates are limited to 10 minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the 
first group of amendments to Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54, an act 
to support electronic commerce and protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by saying that we have many problems with this bill 
for several reasons. This explains why we are proposing so many 
amendments asking for the withdrawal of the bill or, at the very 
least, the suspension of its implementation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deal with the second group of amendments, we will have 
an opportunity to discuss more specifically one particular 
amendment that would make this possible, should the government 
have the will to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is, in a rapidly evolving technological 
context, to foster the development of electronic commerce while 
respecting the confidentiality of the information we supply or 
agree to supply, or the use that could be made of personal 
information provided without knowing how it is going to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that, for the past five years already, Quebec 
has had a law protecting personal information. The introduction 
or implementation of a federal act will create administrative 
chaos, making life very difficult for businesses. One can 
understand the will displayed by the federal government in this 
respect. In the other nine provinces, there is no law protecting 
personal information. Therefore the federal government has 
decided to go ahead and legislate. 
Too bad for the other provinces if they do not want their own 
law and are willing to withdraw from a field of jurisdiction

to protect personal information. Moreover, the civil code contains 
provisions making specific reference to it. Quebec businesses 
have to abide by the civil code provisions as well as the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why many groups appeared before the Committee during the 
hearings and told the government “You are placing Quebec in a 
very bad position, when we already have a provincial act that 
protects both privacy and access to information. With this new 
act, businesses will not always know which act to enforce and 
which definition to use in specific cases. Some organizations 
will have to abide by the federal act, others by the provincial 
act and others yet by both or part of one and part of the 
other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the government will say “Listen, this will only take 
effect in three years because, in the first three years, the new 
act will not apply to all fields, data or businesses”. But, in 
three years, it will get much more extensive and will apply to 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cabinet could make an order to withhold a particular field 
of activities or ensure that some sectors get under another act. 
But this will have to be decided by the federal government after 
careful consideration of its objectives and criteria. Since we 
all know that the Civil Code and the common law do not always 
have the same approach on certain issues, there will undoubtedly 
be differences of opinions and policies as well as differences 
between mechanisms adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can quote a number of people who addressed this issue at the

I will start with the Conseil du patronat du Québec, which came

donor crisis in our country.  What an enormous disappointment it 
was.  With 150 Canadians dying every year waiting for a

developed world, it took the government four months to respond, 
during which time 66 Canadians died.

claim their place in the medical profession.  It offered them 
opportunities in teaching and in hospital practice, which were

Speaker, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool has a near monopoly on grain 
buying on the Altawan and Notukeu rail subdivisions in my riding.

to use its grain car entitlements elsewhere, the elevators on 
that line have been plugged for more than two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railway company will not deliver cars to the few competing 
elevators or to producers who wish to load their own grain 
because the competition alone cannot assemble a 50 car train. 
Farmers in the area are therefore forced to haul grain as much as 
80 kilometres over substandard roads while their local elevators 
are idle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the pool and the railway company 
collude, but they do share a common interest in limiting the 
amount of grain shipped off of that line.  As less grain is 
shipped, the line becomes less viable and line abandonment 
becomes more easy to justify.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, just hours ago Air Canada and its partners announced 
their proposal for reorganizing the airline industry.  Onex and 
Canadian Airlines announced their proposal a number of weeks ago. 
We now know where both the airlines stand but we still have not 
heard from the government.  The government did not even mention 
this subject in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that everyone else has abandoned the status quo, will the 
Prime Minister tell us what he envisions for the Canadian airline 
industry of the 21st century? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as was said, some offers were made today by Air Canada, 
as there was an offer made by Onex to the shareholders of the 
company.  Its shareholders will look at what is best for them and 
they will decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport enunciated very clearly the five 
conditions that the government is demanding under the 
circumstances, but we have to know the results of the bidding 
before we carry on with our policy of making sure that we have at 
least one national airline in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is standing still while everything else 
in the airline industry is moving.  Surely the government has an 
obligation to be more specific about a policy framework for the 
airline industry.  For example, both the Onex-Canadian proposal 
and the Air Canada-Lufthansa-United proposal envision a major 
role for foreign air carriers and investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the government stand on the current rules for foreign 
ownership and participation in the industry?  Does it endorse the 
current rules or does it have plans to revise them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have always said that the government would 
consider any regulatory or statutory change that would enhance 
the viability and competitiveness of the Canadian airline system, 
and we will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel very strongly that not only should the government 
outline the five principles as I did the other week, but that we 
should seek the input of parliamentarians on this very important 
matter.  That is why the committee is meeting.  We will be guided 
on all of these issues by members of the House and of the Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it will be a novel day when the government talks to us 
and consults the advice of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of thousands of air travellers want assurances that 
they will continue to have a quality service at the lowest 
possible cost.  We have tens of thousands of workers in this 
industry who want to be assured that there is a place for them in 
the future.  All regions of the country want to be assured that 
particular routes and services of importance to them will be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the government's policy framework to ensure that all of 
these interests will be properly addressed?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the Leader of the Opposition is 
adhering to the five principles that the government enunciated a 
few weeks ago.  That is the outline of our framework and over the 
next few weeks we will be putting more detail on the policy, but 
we will not do it unilaterally.  The Leader of the Opposition 
would be the first one to condemn us if we came in here with a 
policy, put it on the floor of the House of Commons and ignored 
the views of members of this House.

<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today the federal court ruled that the government is on the hook 
for $5 billion in its pay equity dispute.  We know there is a 
very good chance that the government is going to lose its appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance.  Does the government 
have a contingency fund large enough to cover this $5 billion, or 
does this mean the end of any meaningful tax relief for 
Canadians?

<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
read the decision this morning and we are in the process of 
analyzing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important decision for all federal employees.  We will 
take the time we need before reaching a decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to address this question again to the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has known for years that it was going to face 
this day of reckoning, but does it have a plan?  No.  Does it 
have a contingency fund?  Evidently not.  Does it mean that 
taxpayers are on the hook?  I suspect so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not just admit that the government has 
mishandled the file and it is the taxpayers who are going to have 
to pay for this fiasco? 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let us be clear.  We have just received the judgment.  We are 
looking at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big difference between the government's position and 
the position of the Reform Party.  The Reform Party does not 
believe in pay equity.  We believe in pay equity.

Telefilm, had been used by CINAR in order to illegally obtain 
federal funding for production assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  Since the 
name Érika Alexandre, a pseudonym made up of the first names of 
the children of CINAR president, Mrs. Charest, has already been 
identified as a possible link to the same type of fraud, has the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage asked her departmental staff to 
make the necessary checks in order to confirm or deny this?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

do so, and I shall put him directly in contact with the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada takes these allegations very seriously,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fight for 
pay equity has been going on for 15 years. The courts keep

equal pay for work of equal value.

employees? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

for women and men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling was issued today. It is only normal that we take a

<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
government supports the pay equity principle as long as it does 
not have to treat women as equals, as long as it does not have to 
pay any money.  However, when it is required to actually obey the 
law and pay, its principles go out the window.  Its words say 
yes, but its actions say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not treat women as equals?

this ruling is very important for all federal public service 
employees. Therefore, it only makes sense that, as a responsible 
government, we would take time to analyse it. I can assure you 
that we will then act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that affected employees are somewhat anxious 
about the government's eventual decision, but I would ask them 
to wait a few more days, to allow us to choose the appropriate

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport.  Air Canada today 
announced its proposal for a restructuring of the Canadian 
airline industry and in that proposal it requested a full merger 
review process by the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister require that all proposals, either present or 
future, go through the same process so that they are all treated 
the same? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, under section 47 the 
Competition Bureau is very much engaged.  In fact, I asked the 
bureau for its advice on the restructuring and that report should 
be coming to me in the next few days.  It will be made public and 
it will be the subject of discussions at the Standing Committee 
on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ensures the role of the bureau on issues dealing with 
competition, but the bureau does not have the statutory 
responsibility to deal with levels of service, the protection of 
employees, price gouging, or whether or not the airline is 
effectively Canadian controlled.  That is why we put section 47 
in place, so that the elected representatives of the people will 
determine the outcome of this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in fact the Competition Bureau is there to protect 
consumers.  The Competition Bureau is there to protect consumers 
for a good reason and it serves a good purpose for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  One proposal will accept a full review 
by the Competition Bureau.  Will the minister require all 
proposals to go through the same process, or is there favoured 
treatment?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry wants to promote them at all costs, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The science process is approved by the World Health 
Organization, by the FAO and by all international bodies.  It is 
peer tested science and we use it to judge the safety of any

Rogers Cable has announced an increase of $1.90 a month, well in

have a monopoly: consumers get hosed, consumers get gouged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister responsible for the CRTC, the

deemed they are not refugees and then released them.

concerned about the welfare of the people who are in the hands of 
those smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IRB is an independent quasi judicial process.  It has 
assured me that it will accelerate the determination procedure. 
The department is making arguments to detain those individuals on 
the grounds that there is fear of flight until we have their 
identity and know who they are, or if there are criminal 
proceedings.  That is the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government should be taking control of this issue.  Already one 
of the four bogus refugees has disappeared and the rest are sure 
to follow.  The minister thinks it is okay to detain claimants 
until they are deemed not to be refugees and then let them go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not make sense to me.  It does not make sense to most 
Canadians.  Can the minister explain how this makes sense to her? 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

is determined to enforce the charter of rights not just for some 
of the people some of the time, but for all of the people in 
Canada all of the time.  Part of that procedure is to allow the 
IRB to do its work and make its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department will continue to argue before an adjudicator to 
detain when we believe the detention is warranted.  However, it 
is a quasi judicial, independent body and we will not interfere

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to be sending out conflicting signals as to 
whether or not there will be any additional funding over and 
above the AIDA money for hard-pressed prairie farmers.  For 
example, last week following the meeting with the counterparts 
from Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the hon. minister hinted that the 
generous support payments in Europe and the United States could 
result in some new money for Canadian farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
issue is really of critical importance everywhere in rural and 
urban Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  It is sufficiently important 
that two agriculture ministers were here last week to meet with 
the minister.  It is important enough that the premiers of 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan are expected to be here next week to 
press the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue goes far beyond partisan politics and deserves a

no?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

listening.  I just said that we have been consulting with the two 
new recently appointed ministers and the other provincial 
ministers and with the safety net advisory committee.  We are

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK241">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-6, an act to support 
and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain 
circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to 
communicate or record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act 
and the Statute Revision Act, as reported (with amendment) from 
the standing committee; and of motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will now 
start where I left off earlier. I will remind members who 
are joining us just now that we are debating Bill C-6 promoting 
electronic commerce and the protection of personal information. 
I was explaining that Quebec already has legislation to protect 
that field of activity and that a new federal law will only make 
things more complicated for the organizations that will have to 
abide by it, in view of the double jurisdiction that will exist 
because the federal government did not recognize the precedence 
of the Quebec act in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in its March 1999 brief, the Conseil du Patronat 
stated “However, since subsection 92(13) of the 
British North America Act clearly gives the provinces 
jurisdiction in the area of protection of personal information 
and privacy and since Quebec has already enacted legislation 
within its jurisdiction and its borders, many jurisdictional 
disputes can be expected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when the Conseil made that statement, it expected the 
federal legislation as it stands today to be passed. 
The Conseil further stated “As for Quebec consumers, they would 
constantly be forced to try and determine which legislation 
applies and choose between two types of remedies, depending on 
whether their information is protected by one statute or the 
other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to really understand the situation because 
consumers will have some recourse if they feel their personal 
information has not been protected. However, they will have to 
know if it was the federal legislation or the Quebec legislation 
that was supposed to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Quebec Commission d'accès à l'information appeared 
before the committee to explain about all the problems the 
implementation of both these acts would cause in the field and 
to stress that, in the end, Quebecers have a lot to lose given 
the complexity of this legal issue and the fact that they are 
the most protected consumers in the country. 
If passed, this bill aimed at protecting consumers in the rest 
of Canada, in other words the nine provinces that do not have 
such legislation, will penalize Quebec consumers because the 
federal government has not recognized in its bill the existence 
of Quebec's act and the fact that the province has jurisdiction 
over this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other groups made their voices heard. I am thinking for instance 
of the Barreau du Québec, whose brief also stressed the 
complexity of such an act. It said “This means that from now on 
a huge number of Quebec based businesses will be subject to the 
federal act rather than Quebec's, which will not make it any 
easier for citizens trying to know what their rights are in this 
context of legislative changes. Moreover, businesses based in 
Quebec will have to master a new personal information protection 
system slightly different from Quebec's”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there are many differences since, as I explained 
earlier, Quebec is governed by civil law while the federal 
government follows a totally different approach, the common law. 
The Barreau further stated that it supports the recommendation 
made by the Access to Information Commission, which reads “In 
order to avoid any confusion and insure that Quebecers continue 
to enjoy the benefits of a full personal information protection 
system, we submit that Bill C-54 should be amended in order to 
provide that the act will not apply to businesses already 
subject to the Protection of Personal Information in the Private 
Sector Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, businesses would be subject to the existing act. 
The federal government could reach its goal of having an act in 
force across Canada, but which could be different in the case of 
Quebec. Businesses are already familiar with it and comply with 
it. 
The Barreau goes further still, saying “In our view, the bill 
should incorporate Quebec's act, even with respect to federal 
areas of jurisdiction, so as to avoid confusion, overlap and 
duplication of legislation in Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very interesting point of view.  Normally, the federal 
government's approach is always the opposite.  The federal 
government is the one interfering in provincial jurisdictions. 
The Barreau du Québec is saying that there is already an act so, 
to avoid any confusion, it should apply even where the federal 
act normally would. 
This is an interesting approach that was supported by various 
groups which appeared before the committee, but all of which met 
with the insensitivity of the federal government, the same 
government that, one week ago, brought us a lovely throne speech 
full of lofty goals on paper.  We can see that, when this 
government says, for instance, that it wants to work with the 
provinces to improve the quality of life of Canadians, in 
practice that is not what interests it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What interests it is to extend its authority, to acquire greater 
and greater control, to be the government that plans our 
economic and social development and controls the protection of 
personal information, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day, in one issue after another, this government 
bulldozes ahead, taking over one jurisdiction after another. 
And, if no amendments are made, this is what is going to happen 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at report stage. There is still time for the government 
to amend the bill.  It could include provisions acknowledging 
the existence of Quebec's act and providing the legal framework 
necessary for the development of e-commerce—we are not just 
talking about personal information in the electronic domain in 
this bill; its scope is much broader—as well as ensuring the 
protection of personal information under the legislation that 
already exists in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way, a reasonable balance and a workable solution could 
be found.  I hope that there are still some sensible people left 
across the way and that their beautiful speeches will translate 
into something concrete.  That is something we will see in the 
course of the debate and there will be an opportunity to hear 
what a number of my colleagues have to say about the bill this 
afternoon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased today to speak to the first group of amendments to 
Bill C-6 which was formally known as Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that there needs to be some certainty in the area of 
privacy.  We agree there needs to be some certainty in the rules 
surrounding the whole electronic commerce section of business, a 
fairly new area.  We are a little concerned that the government 
was probably a bit remiss in not trying to get a more 
co-operative approach from the provinces before embarking on its 
experiment in terms of privacy in the area of business, but we 
recognize that it is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that there is a three year timeframe for the 
provinces to introduce their own privacy legislation.  I think it 
is regrettable, though, that a consensus could not have been 
reached to allow for the provinces to be part of a program that 
would introduce legislation on their own.  The federal government 
has decided to go out on its own, and my hon. colleague reminds 
me that it is a three year phase-in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that the provinces will have three years to 
introduce legislation in this area of privacy.  However, if they 
are not able to do that or choose not to, the federal legislation 
will take precedent and become the legislation in the land in the 
areas of privacy in commerce and business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That still leaves the other amendments that we will be dealing 
with in section 2 to which I want to speak later on.  We agree 
that there needs to be rules and legislation surrounding the area 
of privacy.  Although we would have preferred to have a 
co-operative approach, most of the provinces will be introducing 
their own legislation to cover this area in the next three years. 
Therefore the federal legislation will probably not even come 
into effect.  The provinces may have better legislation in those 
areas of their own which they want to put in place, and I would 
encourage them to do that in this timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the part 1 amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot say how delighted I am to speak 
on Bill C-6 on personal information protection and the electronic 
documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am delighted is that today we were talking about 
perhaps the birth of a whole new economy for the country.  Others 
have described it in the last 24 hours as electronic commerce 
becoming the central nervous system of business, society and even 
of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We truly are into a form of commercial revolution, the 
consequences of which are almost unpredictable.  The fantastic 
growth in the use of the Internet in terms of business to 
business relationships as well as consumer to business 
relationships is nothing short of astonishing.  To illustrate 
this, Internet traffic doubles every 100 days and every second of 
the day seven new clients sign up on the Internet.  It truly is a 
revolution that is happening before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all revolutions we actually do not realize there is a 
revolution going if we are part of it.  One day we wake up and 
realize that the entire world has changed.  I suspect during the 
industrial revolution people were not standing around talking 
about the revolution that was going on, except when they looked 
back and realized the tremendous change that had occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as we have heard from the Minister of Industry, the 
Prime Minister and government spokespersons in a variety of 
capacities in the last number of weeks, that Canada is to become 
the most electronically connected country in the world by the 
year 2000.  There was the commitment the other day to set up 600 
Internet sites across the country and to mobilize 10,000 young 
people to serve those sites to ensure that every Canadian from 
coast to coast to coast, no matter where they live, no matter the 
size of their community, no matter the resources at their 
disposal will have access to the Internet of one kind or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a crucial issue that has to be dealt with and 
Bill C-6 attempts to do that.  I refer to what happened last 
month at Microsoft when hackers broke into the hot mail service, 
exposing 40 million accounts and the integrity of the e-mail 
system.  This kind of high profile breach of security obviously 
is something that consumers are concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I know that you are an e-commerce fan and I 
suspect that when you talk to your constituents about electronic 
commerce the kind of thing you hear is what the rest of us hear 
and that is that people are concerned about the security of the 
information they provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we send off our credit card number or when we carry out a 
business transaction, is it secure?  Do we have confidence that 
the person receiving that information is the person that we 
expect to be receiving that information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the electronic commerce section will grow from $1 
billion in 1997 to about $13 billion by 2002.  There is an 
incredible rate of economic change that is occurring before us. 
In 1998 there were 414,000 active commercial websites and by 2002 
it is predicted that number will jump to 1.6 million.  It is 
astonishing economic activity that is occurring before us.  Bill 
C-6 attempts to build in some security in terms of personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are dealing with the motions in Group No. 1.  I want to 
say on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party that we will be 
opposing the motions in Group No. 1 put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois.  The reason is obvious.  Bloc members believe, and 
they make a compelling argument, that we should have one system 
for the province of Quebec and one system for the rest of the 
country.  Obviously that is going to be a messy, patchwork system 
of protection.  We represent all Canadians in the House and we 
want to have a policy that will protect Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends in the Bloc Quebecois argue that there is already 
protective legislation in the province of Quebec.  They are right 
in that respect.  It is lacking in most other jurisdictions of 
the country.  However, to pass federal legislation that does not 
include all provinces and territories I think would be folly.  We 
do not want a patchwork of different standards across the 
country.  National standards are crucial.  For that reason we 
feel that we must oppose this group of amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not right or fair that some Canadians should be deprived 
of privacy protection because their provincial government has 
been slow to act.  The reality is that there are some provinces 
that are dragging their feet on this issue.  I suspect one of the 
reasons is that they really do not know what to do.  The 
provincial governments are looking to the federal government to 
say that rather than all of the provincial jurisdictions 
introducing their own protective legislation, why not have a 
decent standard from coast to coast to coast introduced by the 
federal government, which is what Bill C-6 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other policy areas where there is federal and provincial 
overlap both levels of government will be required to co-operate 
to ensure the strongest protection is given to Canadians and to 
reduce any confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the speech made by my hon. friend from 
the Bloc Quebecois, who argued that in his judgment the 
legislation presently in place in Quebec would be adequate.  Let 
us ensure that whatever is the best piece of legislation to 
protect the consumer will be the piece of legislation that will 
dominate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the federal government in its efforts 
to exercise its commerce power in respect to privacy protection. 
We support the intent of the legislation generally, and for that 
reason I am afraid we will have to oppose the motions in Group 
No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, before I commence speaking I 
would like to take this opportunity, as a newly appointed 
parliamentary secretary, to express my thanks to the Prime 
Minister for giving me the opportunity to engage in this level of 
our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side oppose the motions in Group No. 1. 
These motions, tabled by the Bloc, strike at the heart of Bill 
C-6 and indeed undermine the government's ability to introduce a 
national law that will protect the privacy rights of all 
Canadians, and I stress, all Canadians.  These motions attack the 
government's competence to deal with federal laws that impede 
electronic government and electronic services delivered to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our consultations at the industry committee, consumer groups 
and industry expressed the view that the government has achieved 
the right balance in Bill C-6 between the right of individuals to 
have some control over their personal information and to have 
access to avenues for effective redress, and the need of industry 
to collect and use personal information as a vital component of 
success in the information economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, consumer groups like the Public Interest 
Advocacy Centre, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association 
and the Consumers' Association of Canada, and industry groups 
like the Information Technology Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Marketing Association and the cable and telephone 
companies have all called for rapid passage of Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Swift passage of Bill C-6 will help build the consumer trust and 
market certainty needed to ensure that Canada is a world leader 
in electronic commerce and the global information economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions tabled by the Bloc are unacceptable and must be 
rejected.  With the passage of Bill C-6 Quebec citizens will 
benefit from the best data protection in the country.  Bill C-6 
will provide all Canadians, and I stress, all Canadians, 
including those in the province of Quebec, complete and 
comprehensive privacy coverage across our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I would have expected better of the Bloc than to 
table amendments which deprive all Canadians, who have no privacy 
protection in the private sector, of getting the benefits of this 
national law.

get a chance to clarify the situation once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is the resurrection of Bill C-54. The purpose of this 
bill is to implement legislation to protect personal information 
at the federal level, when similar legislation already exists in 
Quebec. This bill will enable the federal government to 
interfere in a provincial jurisdiction in spite of the fact that 
Quebec already has a legislation protecting all personal 
information. This seems to me to be a rather absurd situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a letter to industry minister John 
Manley and signed by Denis Marsolais, the president of the 
Chambre des notaires du Québec, copy of which was sent to us by 
this organization. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that overlapping systems will cause undue 
misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and 
organizations subjected to two sets of regulations dealing with 
a single matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a separatist speaking, but the president of the 
Chambre des notaires du Québec. 
I point this out to the previous speaker, who said that it is 
not surprising to see the Bloc Quebecois take this standpoint. 
The Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to take this standpoint; 
there is a consensus throughout Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Chambre des notaires also stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more disturbing is part 2 of the bill. Clause 38 recognizes 
the validity of electronic versions of notarial acts in Quebec 
which are referred to in a federal law, not only if they are 
recognized as such under the laws of the province of Quebec but 
also if they are listed in one of the schedules of the 
legislation. These schedules would be maintained by the 
minister, an agency or anyone given the authority to modify 
them. For all these reasons and many more— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This implies that not all the reasons were listed. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we believe— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the president of the Chambre des notaires du Québec 
speaking, not a separatist member of Parliament, as my colleague 
opposite would have you believed. The president of the Chambre 
des notaires du Québec represents all the notaries in Quebec. 
This point of view is shared by all Quebecers, all interested 
parties, not only the sovereignists, not only the separatists, 
but even the federalists in Quebec. Everyone in Quebec knows 
that, for five years now, we have had an act to protect personal 
information, not only in the government but also in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we have put forward only try to ensure that the 
federal government will respect the situation in Quebec. So, I 
was somewhat offended when I heard the previous speaker say “Of 
course, the Bloc members are always asking for something, 
because they do not want Canada to work”. 
This is utterly false. It is a matter of how things are supposed 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already legislation under Quebec's jurisdiction. Out of 
respect for Quebecers, the government should not have 
reintroduced this bill or should have amended it to ensure that 
Quebec's legislation would apply in that province while the 
federal legislation would apply elsewhere if this were what 
people wanted. But precedence should be given to Quebec's 
legislation so that our province can give personal information 
the protection it feels it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a distinct society. The House recognized it in a 
motion on distinct society that was moved by the government, but 
ever since the motion was agreed to, the government just paid 
lip service to it. 
It is not mentioned in any legislation and whenever Quebec's 
distinct character, society and people have to be recognized in 
a bill, there is no mention of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members say that this is the position promoted by the 
Bloc, by the separatists, but I invite all Canadians to assess 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the federal government wants to introduce a 
bill on electronic commerce that also covers the area of 
personal information, while, on the other hand, Quebec has 
already passed a groundbreaking bill whose value was recognized 
by people around the world. 
But the federal government is now stepping in, clumsily, several 
years after Quebec has passed and implemented its own 
legislation. All of a sudden, Quebec should step aside, because 
it is only a province. It would appear to be saying to Quebec 
“You people think in a different way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member used the term “national legislation”. It reminds 
me of all the fuss about the national capital. The federal 
government claims to be the national government. I am sorry but, 
under the constitution, it is merely the federal government and 
should act as such, respecting the jurisdictions of other 
governments. Quebec has jurisdiction over personal information, 
and it has exercised that jurisdiction quite well for 15 or 20 
years, because it has legislation in place and has enforced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we passed a first version of this legislation, and 
then a second one in which the protection of personal 
information was included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the whole situation, it must be understood that 
the position the Bloc Quebecois is fighting for is the result of 
a consensus in Quebec. It is supported by all kinds of 
organizations. For example, we have a letter from the Chambre 
des notaires to Mr. Manley, dated April 7, 1999, that reads— 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member knows very 
well that he cannot name a minister or a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> It is an unfortunate oversight on my part, and I 
apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry of Canada received that letter on April 
7, 1999. In his letter, the president of the Chambre des 
notaires—he is not a member of parliament so that I can name 
him—,Denis Marsolais, said “For all these reasons, among 
others, we believe that an amendment is necessary in order to 
exclude professionals, notaries as well as any other person or 
organization otherwise subject to Quebec's legislation from its 
application”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can it be any clearer? And it is the president of the Chambre 
des notaires who is speaking. He represents people who deal 
every day with this act. These people draft contracts; they are 
in regular contact with governments and private corporations 
when they sign contracts. They know Quebec's law also applies to 
the private sector, and the president of Quebec's Chambre des 
notaires says that this bill cannot be adopted without an 
amendment excluding Quebec from its application on its 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Liberal members present this bill in the House, I agree 
they can defend its validity. I have nothing against the fact 
that they are saying it could be good legislation. 
They have the right to say those things, but they do not have 
the right to say that we are against it just because we are 
always against everything the federal government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as reasonable and interesting measures are concerned, we 
have a support rate very similar to that of all other opposition 
parties. However, we withhold support when Quebec's interests 
are at stake and must be defended, when we must ensure that all 
Quebecers are covered by legislation. This also means that this 
coverage must not be too extensive, because we have seen many 
instances of both governments legislating in the same areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members need only think of the administrative nightmare and the 
extra operating costs incurred by an insurance company that has 
its headquarters in Quebec but does business in other provinces, 
when two acts based on different sets of basic principles apply. 
The costs could be prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also create problems for people affected by these two 
acts. All this because the federal government is determined to 
pass what it considers national legislation. It seems that the 
government cannot recognize that there can be solutions that are 
not all inclusive. It must always include all of Canada. For the 
government, all problems must be addressed the same way, be it 
in Vancouver, St. John's or Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that, however, is not the reality.  In Quebec we have a 
particular civil code.  The Liberal members should know that. 
Especially those from outside Quebec.  I hope that those from 
Quebec have known this for a very long time.  However, I do not 
see why they cannot be here in the House to say that it makes no 
sense to vote in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they not rise and say “As members for Quebec, we are 
federalists, but in this instance, Quebec legislation must be 
respected”.  I simply cannot understand why party discipline is 
involved in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on this point.  The federal government has been 
trying to have us swallow a bill on the protection of personal 
information for over a year.  We are defending here all the 
interests of Quebecers with respect to the matter of personal 
information. 
We will defend them to the end.  We will insist on our point 
until we get satisfaction from the government. Should the House 
pass this bill, it will be like all the other measures taken by 
the federal government that constitute the main reasons we want 
to leave this country, which does not understand us, and most 
importantly, which does not want to understand us, because of 
its invasive action.

excellent job of representing the Reform Party on industry 
issues.  I want to congratulate him on all the hard work he did 
in his prior post of international trade.  I look forward to 
working closely with him as we continue down the road of creating

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had many concerns, as does the Bloc, on this issue, especially 
on the issue of jurisdiction and how privacy specifically falls 
under the provincial jurisdiction of powers. Through my 
discussions in committee and with people in Alberta, I have come 
to realize that maybe there is not the conflict that the Bloc 
identifies on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak on the motions in Group No. 1, I want to clarify that 
we are opposed to the Bloc motions in this group. We do in fact 
support the direction of the government on this legislation.  My 
colleague from Peace River will reiterate that as we move to 
Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize specifically what this bill is trying to 
accomplish, Bill C-6 creates a legal and regulatory framework 
that will be applied to the commercial use of sensitive and 
private information in all areas of business.  Reform supports 
this initiative to protect privacy.  Reform supports limited 
government and free enterprise, but recognizes the important role 
of government in creating an economic climate in Canada with fair 
and transparent rules that protect both consumers and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also exactly where my second concern came up during the 
course of dealing with this legislation, especially in committee. 
Is the government in creating this legal framework and 
formulating this legislation going to be too heavy handed on the 
businesses that are engaging in electronic commerce and 
respecting privacy currently, thereby actually putting a 
disincentive on industry to continue with the work it has done to 
allow electronic commerce to flourish in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where we have to separate the two areas of privacy and 
electronic commerce.  Often that gets confusing because both are 
very important.  They have to be treated as equally important, 
but there are distinct differences between electronic commerce 
and privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of things brought to my attention while sitting on the 
committee was that if one looks at how electronic commerce has 
developed and begun to flourish, a lot of this has been done with 
relatively no government intervention until now.  Over $1 billion 
of trade is being done through electronic commerce, whether it is 
through the Internet or other forms of electronic commerce.  This 
consumer confidence in electronic commerce has begun with almost 
entirely no government intervention, which is quite phenomenal if 
one thinks about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons we have to be very concerned, as I 
mentioned, about being too heavy handed on industries as we 
develop legislation that tries to encourage electronic commerce 
to continue.  This was one of the points I tried to bring up in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, one of the things we cannot take lightly is the issue 
of privacy.  Some of the companies that have been doing business 
on the Internet have taken privacy very seriously. That is why 
customers, consumers who are currently engaging in trade on the 
Internet, feel confident enough to disclose information on the 
Internet and purchase services and goods.  That is a positive 
thing because obviously industry is doing its part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy extends far beyond the provincial jurisdiction, 
particularly when one starts to use mechanisms of trade that go 
beyond the national scope and into a global scope.  Therefore, 
there needs to be some sort of legal framework in place which 
shows that Canada has certain standards when it comes to privacy 
that the rest of the world has to take seriously. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I would like to share with my dear colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois my opinions and those of my party with respect 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial and federal governments should work together in 
this area and share responsibilities, because e-commerce is not 
limited to the provinces, it goes beyond provincial and national 
borders.  It is truly a global matter. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason I wanted to bring it up specifically in my 
meetings with the privacy commissioner in Alberta. The Bloc had 
concerns with how this federal legislation would combine its 
resources provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner in Alberta stated that this fall the 
government is going to be coming up with legislation that is 
going to deal specifically with strengthening privacy legislation 
in Alberta. It feels that in doing so it is going to be 
complementary with the scope of the federal government. The 
federal government has outlined that once this legislation 
passes, it will allow a window of three years for provinces that 
currently do not have privacy legislation to put privacy 
legislation in place and make it as strong as the provinces wish. 
The federal government will work with the provinces to respect 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if there is provincial legislation that is stronger in 
certain aspects of privacy than the federal legislation, it will 
take precedence over the federal legislation.  This is actually 
encouraged by the federal government which often does not respect 
much provincial jurisdiction, but in this case there is a bigger 
scope and I commend the minister on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we have to try to focus specifically on this 
issue.  I encourage my colleagues from the Bloc to look at this 
because if there are strong privacy laws, and I know Quebec is 
very proud of its current privacy legislation, it will be 
complementary to the federal legislation.  This is one of the big 
reasons that the Reform Party supports this. Even in Alberta we 
have the privacy commissioner and others involved with this 
particular legislation who say it is going in the right direction 
and we should support it in its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke about other groups that are looking at this 
legislation, whether it is industry groups or privacy groups, the 
general consensus is that there has been a balance reached so 
far, especially through our deliberations in committee and 
through the amendments that have been proposed in the House here 
today. There is balance so far in taking seriously privacy 
concerns and those of electronic commerce. The focus has to be 
not so heavy handed.  The Reform Party will support this 
legislation, until we see that the government is turning its tide 
and becoming too heavy handed in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak to the Group No. 2 motions yet but we hope at 
this report stage the government will consider some of the things 
the Reform Party has put forward when it comes to amending the 
privacy area especially in the areas of health services and 
health information.  I think most Canadians agree that is very 
important information and should be treated as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping the amendments I have put forward on behalf of the 
Reform caucus will be taken seriously.  Now that I will be 
working with my colleague from Peace River we hope we will be 
taken seriously because we would like to see that area of privacy 
strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 includes a two year phase-in timetable after which 
those provinces that do not have comparable legislation would 
fall under the federal legislation.  Currently only Quebec has 
this kind of comprehensive privacy protection.  Alberta will be 
coming on board this fall.  Other provinces have determined that 
they neither have the resources nor the inclination to create 
their own provincial privacy protection legislation and prefer 
that this be included under the broad federal legislation.  The 
Bloc would like total exemption for any province that has or 
creates privacy legislation.  Under this legislation that concern 
is taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with provincial privacy protection legislation is 
that for international and interprovincial trade purposes there 
should be a national standard for privacy protection.  Canadian 
businesses have asked for this in order to simplify trade rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the most important points to mention during this 
debate on the Group No. 1 motions.  We are not really opposed to 
the fact that there needs to be a balance. This legislation is 
achieving that.  But we need to keep our minds open to look at 
electronic commerce in a global perspective and see how 
legislation can be created that works positively with the 
provinces. This legislation does this and I would encourage my 
colleagues from the Bloc to consider that and look at ways to 
strengthen that relationship, especially when it comes to 
electronic commerce.

electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my comments I would like to thank the many 
witnesses who took time to make submissions either in person or 
in writing to the Standing Committee on Industry. 
Their representations were extremely helpful with respect to 
bringing new issues to light.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to all my colleagues who were on the industry 
committee and the new colleagues who are coming on board because 
this is definitely a very important area.  I compliment the 
government for bringing forth in committee an amendment to clause 
18 of the bill which was identical to the one I had sponsored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the PC Party believe in the need for personal privacy 
legislation, but we do not feel the government has adequately 
taken into account the views and concerns of the Ontario and 
Quebec governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not feel it has adequately considered the cost impact of 
the new regulatory regime in Bill C-6 on the private sector.  We 
do not see the need to pass a law to meet a European Union 
directive when our number one e-commerce and overall trading 
partner has adopted a diametrically different approach.  Ninety 
per cent of all the e-commerce traffic in this country is in 
trade with the U.S.  Therefore I cannot see the need to rush to 
beat the Americans in this regard because down the road they 
could adopt a different standard and we would have to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the specific amendments tabled in Group No. 1, 
all of which were sponsored by the member for Témiscamingue.  To 
be fair to the member I note for the record that the industry 
committee and a Bloc member at the time presented the following 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas witnesses were recently heard by the Standing Committee 
on Industry, on Bill C-54 concerning the major problems in 
implementing this legislation; and took into account the big 
application difficulties of this bill, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Quebec government has repeated its demand that Bill 
C-54 be withdrawn, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Committee suspend Clause by Clause consideration of 
Bill C-54 and ask the Industry Minister to undertake negotiations 
with all the provinces, to forestall any constitutional challenge 
that might impair the attainment of its objectives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was defeated by seven to four.  It was basically the 
Liberal majority that won the day and it was supported by all 
opposition members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard many concerns from witnesses the Liberals had the 
choice to take their time to consider meaningful changes to Bill 
C-6.  The Bloc, the Reform and the Conservatives were ready to 
work together to draft a better bill.  To their credit the 
Liberals allowed some minor tinkering to Bill C-54 which is now 
Bill C-6.  For example, they supported two of the sixteen 
amendments I brought forward, but on the major question of 
overall regulation in the form of excessive power granted to the 
privacy commissioner and provoking battles with the Ontario and 
Quebec governments, they refused to budge.  They refused to 
co-operate.  They refused to compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the PC Party I refuse to blindly support Bill C-6 
for the sake of getting a law, any law, on personal privacy and 
e-commerce.  One glaring example of the defects in the 
legislation is subclause 18(1) which would give the privacy 
commissioner the right to audit a company based on disputes 
regarding recommended business practices listed under schedule 1 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommended business practices are just that, recommendations. 
They are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such. 
The privacy commissioner should be allowed to conduct an audit 
only when there are reasonable grounds to believe the law has 
been violated.  Audits are intrusive and place a heavy 
administrative burden on the business operations of Canadian 
companies.  The audit power under Bill C-6 should only be used to 
cover alleged violations of mandatory obligations set out in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner should not be permitted to micromanage 
whether a company complies with recommended business practices 
such as what types of passwords or encryptions are being used by 
a company.  Therefore subclause 18(1) as presently drafted is not 
necessary since Bill C-6 already provides the privacy 
commissioner with the tools needed to ensure the compliance of 
schedule 1.  For example, section 11 allows an individual to file 
a complaint if he or she feels an organization is contravening 
the legislation or not following a recommended business practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, clause 12 gives the privacy commissioner the power to 
investigate all complaints including a complaint that an 
organization is not following a recommended business practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the longstanding objections of a variety of 
witnesses to the far-ranging powers granted to the privacy 
commissioner under clauses 12 and 18.  While I do not object to 
extending search and seizure power to the privacy commissioner 
under Bill C-6, it is in the best interest of all concerned that 
his office be required to obtain prior judicial authorization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of any obligation for the privacy commissioner to 
obtain the approval of our courts before exercising search and 
seizure power is deeply troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 18 and 12 of Bill C-6 create a fundamental conflict by 
allowing the privacy commissioner both to determine whether to 
exercise search and seizure powers and execute those same powers. 
The authorization should be granted by a neutral third party as 
in the case of criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 already provides the privacy commissioner with broad 
investigative and audit powers.  The commissioner may summon and 
enforce appearances of persons under oath, converse with any 
person, comply with the production of documents, and receive and 
accept any evidence in the same manner and to the same extent as 
the superior court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that additional safeguards are needed in 
Bill C-6 as it relates to the privacy commissioner or to his 
delegate actually entering the premises of a private organization 
and seizing records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just the concerns of allegedly self-interest 
companies.  Indeed, Blair Mackenzie from the Canadian Newspaper 
Association told the industry committee that the provisions 
within Bill C-6 are “frightening”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other witnesses have alluded to the provisions in the bill 
prompting challenges under the charter of rights and freedom if 
the privacy commissioner acted upon clause 12 or 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also troubled the government did not bring forward any 
study or reports on the cost impact of Bill C-6.  From a legal, 
constitutional and economic standpoint these unfettered audit 
powers constitute a tremendous defect in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the Liberal majority decided to ignore the fears of free 
speech advocates, to ignore the pleas of the private sector and 
to chose to defeat my amendments to oblige the privacy 
commissioner to obtain a court order before exercising search and 
seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any reluctance I have in supporting the Group No. 1 
amendments, it is due to Motions Nos. 56 and up which deal with 
parts 2 through 5.  Most of my objections pertain to part 1 of 
Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the familiar double dose of Liberal arrogance and 
heavy-handedness has left me with no choice but to support the 
Group No. 1 amendments on behalf of the Conservative caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had their chance to co-operate at committee to make 
a substantially better bill and they chose not to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in today's debate on Bill C-6, an act to 
support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain 
circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to 
communicate or record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act 
and the Statute Revision Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that we are debating today at report stage is the old 
Bill C-54 which, in spite of being the most significant step 
taken by the federal government since 1983 to protect personal 
information, does not fulfil its primary objective of protecting 
citizens. It falls short of our expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has failed to put forward a bill whose real 
objective would be to protect people's private lives in the 
private sector. In a technological world where this basic right 
is threatened, the Minister of Industry is proposing a fragile 
and confusing act whose core element is a schedule that repeats 
verbatim the principles set out in the code of the Canadian 
Standards Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's bill is one that gives huge discretionary powers 
to the governor in council, while not giving any authority to 
the privacy commissioner. This is a bill that puts the emphasis 
on electronic commerce at the expense of the basic concept of 
the right to privacy, that ignores Quebec's unique experience in 
the area of personal information protection in the private 
sector and which, ultimately, could create problems for Quebec's 
current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before dealing specifically with some of the major flaws of this 
bill before us, I want to say a few words about the concept of 
privacy, which is at the core of this bill, in the context of 
the Canadian and Quebec legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to privacy is a human right along with the right to 
equality and justice. The United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, which is celebrating this year its fiftieth 
anniversary and of which Canada is a member, clearly states that 
everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 
The declaration also states that “No one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or 
correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, this protection is provided under sections 7 and 8 of 
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Moreover, in 1983, the Canadian government passed legislation 
respecting the protection of personal information that applies 
to over one hundred government agencies under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the federal government has promised an umbrella act 
to force the private sector to protect personal information. 
Bill C-6 is the sad outcome of all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the 
Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and in the Quebec 
Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Quebec government is the only government in 
North America to have passed laws to govern the protection of 
privacy in the public sectors in 1982 and in the private sectors 
in 1994. Experts agree that Quebec's act governing the private 
sector is probably one of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is once again causing confusion, and this 
act will give a different meaning to the Privacy Act, just as 
Bill C-68 will with respect to the young offenders legislation. 
This is contrary to what Quebec has put in place. This bill has 
many flaws, it is a weak bill whose essence is in its schedule, 
a small one at that. Most of the provisions that will govern the 
protection of personal information are set out in the schedule 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this schedule is nothing more than the model code for 
the protection of personal information developed by the private 
sector and consumers as a framework to protect personal 
information on a voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not going beyond this text, the minister endorsed neither the 
consumers' recommendations nor those of the privacy 
commissioners, who recognized that the model code proposed by 
the Canadian Standard Association was a good basis for 
reflection, but that it should be reviewed and improved if it 
ever were to be incorporated in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows beyond any doubt that the minister gave precedence to 
economic values over social values, at a time when this 
fundamental right is so threatened by the expansion of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives huge discretion to the governor in council. 
Under paragraph 27(2)b), the federal government gives itself the 
right to amend the act through a simple order in council, 
without consulting parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Liberal government has mastered the art of not 
being accountable to parliament. 
Therefore, it will be possible to amend the act under the 
pressure of lobbying efforts on behalf of the large companies 
that fund traditional political parties in Canada. The Liberal 
Party knows what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives no power to the Privacy Commissioner. Although 
the other Canadian provinces followed Quebec's model, giving the 
commissioner the power to issue orders, the federal act does the 
exact opposite. Thus the commissioner will not be able to issue 
orders, which will make access to the act difficult for 
consumers and cause it to have no effect on business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill ignores Quebec's unique experience. It ignores its 
unique experience in the protection of personal information in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples: the objectives of the act are better 
defined in the Quebec legislation because the purpose is to 
protect privacy independently of any commercial consideration; 
the Quebec legislation clearly covers all undertakings, whether 
for-profit or not-for-profit, whereas the federal calls for the 
protection of personal information only for commercial 
transactions; Quebec's act allows a group of individuals to 
appoint a representative in a class action case.  There is no 
such provision in the federal bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore obvious that this is a bill with the potential 
to make life difficult in Quebec.  In addition to all the flaws 
that have been pointed out, there is one still greater area of 
concern.  The only guarantee Quebec has that it will be exempted 
from this legislation is a timid statement by the Minister of 
Industry.  Its mistrust is in large part motivated by Quebec's 
past experience with certain formal commitments made to it, 
about which the federal government has too often kept mum or 
which it has denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I will remind this government if I may of the 
present Prime Minister's promises made within days of the 1995 
referendum in the Verdun auditorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are clear, then. 
For the Minister of Industry, it is a question of ensuring that 
Canada participates fully in the rapidly expanding e-commerce 
without inordinate concern about peoples' worries about their 
privacy.  Nor does the Minister of Industry hesitate to adopt a 
centralizing position that runs counter in a number of respects 
to what should be done in the provinces of Canada, and could 
have served as a model to Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Deputy Premier of Quebec so aptly put it, “If Quebec were 
to participate fully in the concert of nations, its culture and 
the protection of its policy on the privacy of personal 
information, as concretized in its charter, its Civil Code and 
its two pieces of privacy legislation, would have been advanced 
by its government at the Ottawa OECD meeting in Ottawa”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-6, an act to support 
and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain 
circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to 
communicate or record information or transactions and by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today on Bill C-6, which affects a fundamental value 
in our society, privacy protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate goes beyond these walls. On November 2, 1998, 
parliamentarians, as well as Quebecers, had the opportunity to 
read in <I>Le Devoir</I> an article entitled “Pressure is mounting for 
consumers' privacy protection”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article talked about threats against our privacy and the 
need for citizens to be well informed of their rights. It also 
talked about the bill and some aspects of it that we are 
discussing today in the House. This article clearly specified 
that provinces that will not pass legislation in this area will 
have to comply with federal legislation within three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the need for legislation protecting personal information 
and privacy is not new. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most provinces already have such legislation. In this instance, 
the federal government has long been delaying taking its 
responsibilities by introducing a bill that would apply only to 
corporations under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we were expecting something from this government, that 
it take its cue from provincial laws already in place to 
introduce a consistent, efficient and clear bill, one that is in 
keeping with those provinces' jurisdictions. Unfortunately for 
all Quebecers and Canadians, this bill fails miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of protecting privacy, the bill limits itself to 
protecting the right of big business to make profits with as few 
restrictions as possible. This is totally unacceptable. The 
federal government must get the bill back to the drawing board 
as quickly as possible. It must introduce a bill really aimed at 
protecting privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is not yet convinced that it is urgent to act, 
that the situation is urgent, it should get in touch with the 
president of the Quebec access to information commission. The 
Minister of Industry would soon find that every month the Quebec 
government receives 2,000 calls from people concerned about the 
protection of their privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party fuels the public's cynical attitude toward 
politicians by using this empty and confused measure to try to 
convince our fellow citizens that it is concerned about the 
protection of privacy. 
The government does not say, however, that it has introduced a 
bill that only favours commerce, one that is predicated on 
voluntary compliance by businesses with its provisions to 
protect privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister responsible is not saying is that the bill is 
riddled with loopholes and leaves many sectors without any 
protection. Those sectors that are covered by this bill are 
conditionally covered. This means that businesses are told to 
take care, if possible, of their clients' privacy. This is 
totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want first to stress the fundamental nature of the right to 
privacy. It has been said before, but it is important to remind 
this House that the Liberal Party is putting the right to make 
profits before the right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts consider the right to privacy as a human right, the same 
as the right to equality and the right to justice. Thus, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights—as cited by several 
colleagues before me—which was adopted 50 years ago by the 
United Nations and which Canada adhered to, specifies that 
everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person 
and provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his 
privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his 
honour and reputation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the charter of rights and freedoms also protects 
privacy, although not in so many words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would mention that, in Quebec, as members 
are undoubtedly aware, this right to privacy is recognized 
explicitly in Quebec's 1975 charter of rights and freedoms. 
Article 5 is unambiguous where privacy is concerned: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person is entitled to privacy. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right is also recognized in chapter III of Quebec's Civil 
Code entitled “Respect of Reputation and Privacy”. I draw 
particular attention to article 35.  This is not just something 
the Bloc Quebecois is pushing.  I remind members that last 
April 7 the Chambre des notaires du Quebec wrote a letter to 
the minister responsible, mentioning this provision in Quebec's 
Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 35 is clear.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and 
privacy. No one may invade the privacy of a person without the 
consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems clear to me.  Respect of privacy is a fundamental 
right, which is recognized internationally, as well as in Canada 
and in Quebec.  It is ridiculous for the federal government to 
be introducing a bill that does not protect this fundamental 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned a <I>Devoir</I> article I tabled.  I see I have 
the House leader's attention.  That article clearly said that 
the Government of Quebec was the only government in North 
America to have passed legislation protecting personal 
information in the public and private sectors.  In addition, 
many experts say that Quebec's act regarding the private sector 
is one of the best in the world.  This is a far cry from the 
federal act, which covers only the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so surprising that the federal government did not draw 
upon the Quebec legislation. That would have been killing two 
birds with one stone. On the one hand, it would have ensured 
consumers of the exemplary protection of personal information, 
and, on the other hand, it would have avoided the loopholes and 
violations which are inescapable when enforcing federal and 
provincial laws which have not been harmonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to believe that the real object of this bill is 
not protection of privacy, but a pitiful public relations 
exercise. The government would like to use this legislation to 
show that it is finally taking heed of people's concerns. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill does not meet 
the expectations of those who wish for privacy. It simply serves 
the interests of big business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Canada's privacy commissioner observed that the discussion 
paper proposed by Industry Canada and the Department of Justice 
focuses mainly on commerce, not on privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we categorically oppose Bill C-6. The federal 
government refused to draw from Quebec's legislation, even if it 
is recognized as exemplary in this respect. This is not 
surprising, as the Quebec legislation focuses mainly on the 
protection of personal information, while the federal bill aims 
essentially at pleasing big business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government refuses to withdraw its bill, the 
Bloc Quebecois and its representative on this issue, the Member 
for Témiscamingue, are presenting today an amendment motion 
whose intent is to suppress clauses of the bill which would 
represent a setback in the field of personal information 
protection in Quebec. Let us not forget that the Minister of 
Industry tabled his bill on personal information without waiting 
for the results of a consultation that he had himself launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tabled his bill in October 1998 without waiting for 
the comments of his provincial counterparts to whom he had just 
sent a proposal of bill. 
However, at a meeting held in Fredericton in June of 1998, the 
ministers in charge of information highway agreed to consult 
each other on the opportunity to adopt a legislation concerning 
personal information protection in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government adopted a unilateral and 
paternalistic approach and imposed its point of view to the 
provinces. That is not very surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc asked that the bill be withdrawn for reasons of 
principles, including the fact that it had been introduced 
without consultations and that the bill is an encroachment on 
provincial jurisdiction over civil law. 
The Bloc also asks for the withdrawal of the bill because it 
would represent a major weakening of the legal provisions 
concerning personal information protection in Quebec. The bill 
contains many legal deficiencies and its implementation in 
Quebec would cause many duplications and a lot of confusion. 
This is not the first time the liberal government duplicates 
legislation since I have been elected in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's legislation is based on the charter of human rights 
where the protection of personal information is declared a basic 
right. As a matter of fact, section 5 of the Quebec Charter of 
Human Rights and Freedoms says that: “Every person has a right 
to respect for his private life.” 
This right is also defined and framed in the Quebec Civil Code, 
which states the basic principles governing the collection, 
retention and use of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal information of Quebecers is also very well 
protected under two laws. The first one, adopted in 1982, deals 
with the protection of privacy in the public sector, and the 
second one, adopted in 1994, extends that protection to the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the federal government cannot accept the fact that 
Quebec has the best system in Canada and is adamant about 
imposing its legislation even if it means reducing the 
protection now enjoyed by Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, we heard the federal Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs say in one of his speeches in May 1998 that we had to, 
and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—stop using the easy way out by claiming that a government 
initiative responds to too much of a pressing need to be stifled 
by jurisdictional issues—jurisdictional conflicts create 
confusion that diminishes the quality of public policies. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the minister does not do as he says or he does not 
talk often enough to his colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
who says it is urgent to legislate to protect the rights of 
Canadians and uses that as an excuse to interfere in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction and to impose a system that is 
criticized by Quebec's society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee held public hearings regarding this bill, 
every professional, business, labour and consumer organization 
in Quebec expressed its preference for the system already in 
place in that province. 
This is why these organizations unanimously requested that 
Quebec be excluded from the application of the bill we are 
debating today so that the federal government does not impose 
upon them, with regard to the protection of personal 
information, a system that is different from the one that has 
been in place in Quebec for five years.

civil rights—Generally, we believe that the federal access to

subjected to the Privacy Act.

represents over 3 000 legal professionals, wrote to the industry 
minister on April 7 to denounce the duplications that would 
result from this bill being imposed on Quebec, and ask that it 
be amended to avoid such a situation. I will quote from its 
letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the overlapping of systems will result in undue 
complications and misunderstandings both for consumers and

organization subject to the Quebec legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Conseil interprofessionnel du Québec, with 260,000

which deals with electronic documents, could deprive the 
provinces from their right to define concepts such as signature, 
contracts and other procedures that are now covered under civil 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the deficiencies in Bill C-6 and the threat it poses to 
the system now in place in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has 
proposed an amendment to limit damages that this bill, if 
passed, could cause by explicitly excluding from its scope 
provinces that already have legislation on the protection of 
personal information in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment is designed to maintain the privacy protection 
afforded to Quebecers by provincial legislation when dealing 
with federal companies doing business in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that, once again, the federal government is not 
listening to Quebec's will and putting it in a yoke. I condemn 
the domineering attitude of the federal government, which wants 
to dictate its will to all the provinces by imposing, from sea 
to sea, measures that are “made in Ottawa”, without any concern 
for effectiveness and without taking into consideration their 
negative impact on citizens' rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak to this bill. In light of the notice of 
motion for time allocation, I even consider it a privilege to be 
allowed to speak at the report stage of Bill C-6, also known as 
the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is identical to Bill C-54 brought forward in the last 
session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am adamantly opposed to this bill that the industry minister 
introduced without any consultation with the provinces and which 
constitutes an unacceptable intrusion in provincial areas of 
responsibility with respect to civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the provincial and territorial governments met on 
October 29 and 30 of last year and exposed the extraordinary 
intrusion in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions 
created by Bill C-54. The government is somehow attempting to 
recycle it as Bill C-6.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion in amendment before us today would delete a number of 
sections in this bill, which, if adopted, would mark a backward 
shift in the matter of protection of personal information in 
Quebec. This bill is very weak from a legal point of view and, 
without any harmonization with Quebec's legislation, its 
enforcement would cause confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, the bill much too flawed, from a 
constitutional, democratic and legal point of view. Far from 
improving the protection of personal information, it in fact 
threatens it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are asking, and have asked already numerous 
times, that the federal government withdraw its bill and resume 
consultation with the provinces in order to table a bill that 
respects provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take advantage of this debate to remind the Minister of 
Industry and the hon. members on the government side that my 
colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
had made a motion during the 35th Parliament calling for the 
government to make Crown agencies subject to the Privacy Act. 
This motion was passed unanimously with the support of all of 
the Liberal members, including the ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government did not follow up on it.  Yet now 
we have that same government wanting to interfere in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction while incapable of first putting its own 
house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the federal government's refusal to withdraw its 
bill, the Bloc Quebecois called for modifications in order to 
have it not apply in Quebec, where personal information is 
already adequately protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982, the Government of Quebec passed legislation protecting 
privacy in the public sector, and Quebec is the only state in 
North America to have legislation protecting personal 
information, which it has had since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec charter of rights and freedoms, which dates from 
1975, stipulates that everyone is entitled to the protection of 
his or her privacy.  The Quebec Civil Code also addresses the 
protection of privacy, placing it within a framework that 
addresses the fundamental principles governing the gathering, 
retaining and use of information relating to an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two acts to which I just referred complete the Quebec 
legislative framework by stating the rights, obligations and 
rules of public and private organizations in the matter of 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is obviously a leader regarding the protection of 
personal information, but this bill could reduce the protection 
provided to Quebecers. Indeed, contrary to what one might have 
expected, Bill C-6 does not even extend to the private sector the 
principles governing the protection of personal information in 
the federal public sector. The bill does not go nearly that far. 
Let us look at a few flaws in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing act, federal institutions are required to 
inform individuals that they collect personal information that 
concern them, and they must also specify how that information 
will be used. Under Bill C-6, this is merely a recommendation, 
not a requirement. The Quebec act is much more specific and 
strict, since it provides that any agreement relating to such 
disclosure or use of personal information must be expressed 
clearly and freely, and must be given in an informed manner and 
for a specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 relies on the voluntary CSA code, whose purpose is not 
to protect privacy. Also, the notion of personal information is 
not as well defined in that code, and the definition of consent 
is vague. Thus, it seems that the bill primarily seeks to 
promote electronic commerce, at the expense of privacy 
protection in the private sector. 
This is not surprising, since the Minister of Industry has 
always ignored the part of his mandate that concerns consumer 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the remedies provided in the bill are time-consuming, 
costly and ineffective because the federal commissioner cannot 
issue orders, but can only write reports. Canadians will have to 
go to the federal court to settle disputes, but only after the 
privacy commissioner will have issued a non-binding opinion, and 
only after all other recourses will have been exhausted. 
Finally, unlike the Quebec act, the bill does not provide for 
criminal penalties when the principles governing the protection 
of personal information are breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the flaws of Bill C-6 and the step backward it 
represents for Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has presented several 
amendments aimed at limiting the damage that may result from its 
overlapping the existing legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has presented several amendments which aim to 
limiting the damage that may cause its superimposition on the 
existing legislation. One of these amendments aims to explicitly 
exclude of the application of the bill the provinces that 
already have a legislation that protects personal information in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment that we tabled will eliminate the power of the 
governor in council to unilaterally decide to whom the federal 
law applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment presented by the Bloc Quebecois aims at 
maintaining the right to privacy insured to Quebecers by the 
provincial legislation in their relations with federal 
businesses operating in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, an amendment presented by our party aims at avoiding 
the establishment of new rules concerning the legal definition 
of signature and rights to a contract for the electronic sector 
because these questions fall under the provincial jurisdiction 
in matters of property and civil rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government are far from being 
the only ones in Quebec to oppose the passing of Bill C-6. They 
have the support of the Quebec Bar which wrote on February 4th 
on the then Bill C-54: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec legislator's approach seems preferable because it 
specifies even more the rights and duties in a legislative text 
that is relatively clear and simple to apply. We believe the 
Quebec plan to protect the personal information in the private 
sector is better than the one which is provided by Bill C-54. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Chambre des notaires, on April 7, they wrote this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that overlapping systems will, in our opinion, cause 
undue misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and 
for organizations subjected— We believe an amendment is needed 
in order to exclude from its application professionals, notaries 
as well as any person or organization otherwise subjected to 
Quebec legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on last March 23, the Quebec Interprofessional Council, 
which regroups all 43 professional corporations in Quebec and 
some 260,000 members, wrote this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Bill C-54 and the system it is proposing are 
highly inappropriate within the Quebec context, and we ask you 
to amend it in order to specify that it does not apply to 
persons or organizations already subjected to Quebec legislation 
in that regard. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the 1995 referendum, the Prime Minister presented 
his motion on distinct society and said that he would take this 
notion into account when bills were passed. On June 2, the 
Minister of International Trade stated in an article published 
in <I>La Presse</I> that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada decided not to eliminate differences, but to base its 
future on a system of accommodation between majorities and 
minorities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister added that Canada did not want a single legal 
system for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask the Prime Minister to respect Quebec society and 
withdraw this bill, which, in its present form, is not 
acceptable to Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it strikes me 
has a bit odd that a bill dealing with the protection of 
personal information has already been put under gag order, as we 
are just beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in the high forum of debate and democracy, and as 
soon as we begin it, because our electors have asked for it—301 
members have been elected to this House to speak on behalf of 
the voters—the Liberal government has the annoying habit of 
trotting out a gag order immediately, a time allocation order, 
and put an end to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look very seriously at this strategy.  The Liberal 
government has become the champion of the guillotine.  Some of 
my colleagues in the Reform Party have raised this point.  This 
concerns us very much.  There a lot of things that concern us 
about parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without revealing caucus secrets, I can say that we wondered 
about this type of expeditious and often time wasting measure, 
in which the government says “Into the closet with this debate. 
We have decided to put an end to it at a certain point”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we ask ourselves: is this where we are to express the views 
of the voters, yes or no?  I would point out that the right to 
speak is not just allowing someone to speak for ten minutes.  It 
is also how long the debate will last.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I recall the Liberals criticizing such proceedings with 
the Progressive Conservatives, when they were in power.  Today, 
they are in power and are applying the same principle, if not 
doing worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of other things that bother us too, debates 
without votes for example.  I realize that there are what is now 
called exploratory debates.  Members have a fundamental right, 
the right to vote.  Instead of asking members to speak and to 
vote, the government will say “You can speak now for three or 
four hours, for two days, but there will be no vote following”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members ought to support us and criticize these 
strategies as well. 
Without revealing what was said in caucus, I do hope they also 
had such a discussion. It is a fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that power is entirely centred in the Prime 
Minister's Office. Here, people learn of the government 
positions. These are fundamental democratic issues. Today, once 
again, we saw how the fundamental democratic values of 
parliamentarians can be violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally disgraceful. Strange to say, it happened in 
connection with a bill dealing with the protection of personal 
information. This is a fundamental issue in society. People are 
a bit fed up with their personal information being used and 
disclosed all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major concern of our constituents, and today we have 
just been told to “Make do with a limited debate on the 
subject”. This is totally disgraceful. I just had to start by 
condemning this measure by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the title. The last time, when we debated old Bill 
C-54, there were basic differences between it and the title of 
the Quebec legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Quebec legislation is entitled an 
“Act on the protection of personal information in the private 
sector”. Obviously, the Quebec government aimed mainly at 
protecting personal information. This is slightly different, and 
I would even call it the antithesis of the title of the federal 
bill being debated today. The title is quite long, but it is 
also quite revealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the first few words of the title of this bill:“an act 
to support and promote electronic commerce”. Right from the 
beginning, it is clear that the main issue is the promotion of 
electronic commerce. Let me read on: “by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not read the whole title because it is quite long, but we 
can readily understand that the purpose of the government is 
always the same, that is looking after the interests of 
business. Personal information and human rights are an 
afterthought. They are not important. We have very often 
criticized these priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at campaign contributions, it is easy to understand 
why the federal government would want to protect its friends. 
Furthermore, it is intruding into Quebec's jurisdictions. 
Once more, those who make big contributions to campaign funds 
will get special treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that our hands are not tied, because our 
party is financed through the small contributions of ordinary 
voters. We do everything we can to keep it like that. We go 
everywhere in the countryside and in the towns and cities to 
collect $5 or $10 contributions. That way, we are free to speak 
our mind, as we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also free to disagree sometimes with the federal 
government. Most of the time, actually. We have a perfect 
example of that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, many people have made their position clear on this 
issue. My colleagues have said a few words about that. The 
Quebec bar association, through its president, has taken a very 
interesting and significant stance. It goes like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's system has been in place for almost five years; it is 
well known and businesses have made the adjustment. 
Accordingly, the Quebec Bar Association supports the basic 
thrust of this recommendation by the access to information 
commission. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the commission says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid any confusion and so as to ensure that 
Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the 
protection of personal information, we submit that bill [—] 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, it is Bill C-6, previously Bill C-54, 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[—] should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal 
act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la 
protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go further still: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in our view, the bill should include a reference to 
Quebec's act, even in federal areas of jurisdiction, so as to 
avoid confusion, overlap and duplication of legislation in 
Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, for the minister and for the federal government, 
which is just as centralizing and paternalistic as ever, what is 
happening is exactly the opposite, given the sequence of events. 
On June 12, 1998, there was a meeting in Fredericton of 
ministers responsible for the information highway.  At this 
meeting, ministers from all provinces agreed that they wanted to 
be advised about any protection of personal information issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain what the federal minister understands by advising 
the provinces.  On September 21, two or three months after the 
meeting, the minister sent the bill in essentially the same form 
as it is today to the ministers concerned.  On October 1, a few 
days later, he tabled his bill, thus bypassing completely the 
jurisdiction of each of these provinces, as well as the very 
explicit jurisdiction of Quebec, where the law has obviously 
proven its worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of Quebec's bar association was not the only one 
opposed.  Other organizations spoke out as well. 
There was the Commission d'accès à l'information, which made a 
very positive assessment of the Quebec legislation five years 
after its enactment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a province passes legislation in one of its own areas of 
jurisdiction, Ottawa always tries to interfere and impose a 
federal policy coast to coast. Several members even add the 
third coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another thing that is working fine in Quebec, just like 
the millennium scholarship fund. We have implemented some 
remarkable practices in Quebec. The federal minister now wants 
to go over Quebec's head and do things his own way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting a bit tired of the way this government's 
approach, and our critic in this matter is right to say that the 
federal minister needs to step back and withdraw this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But once again, we have seen how the government operates. Not 
only does it not intend to withdraw the bill, but it wants to 
limit debate on a bill that concerns directly all voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the government is dealing not only with Bill C-54 but 
with all the issues I mentioned earlier is most disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I join with my colleagues to ask the government to 
withdraw this bill and let the provinces handle the protection 
of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing just fine in Quebec. The federal government should 
act in good faith and withdraw from this area. We will deal 
later with the government's attempts to undermine democracy and 
muzzle the opposition, which we cannot tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Vancouver East, child care; the hon. member for 
New Brunswick Southwest, fisheries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is always with sadness that we rise in this 
House when we feel it is the last time the government will allow 
us to speak on a given bill. First of all, let me say that I too 
feel it is an outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the protection of personal and private information in 
a bill regarding electronic commerce is something that obviously 
concerns us all because it very deeply affects all Quebecers and 
Canadians. One might wonder whether the government has something 
to hide. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind this House that the difficulty in developing a 
legislation is to identify the problem and to propose a bill 
that is so clear that it can also be implemented easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the minister is trying to create dissension 
because he disregards this first principle. Some of my 
colleagues just mentioned that, in the summer of 1998 or at a 
meeting held in the spring of 1998, the minister discussed this 
issue with his colleagues. However, he presented them with a 
draft of the bill in September and, if my memory serves me 
right, he introduced his bill in this House on October 1, 1998. 
So much for the discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like a game or electronic commerce that the minister is 
getting ready to do, he is making things appearing or wandering 
at his will. This could instil fears into people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wish to raise—and members will say that 
I am a member of the Bloc and that I am always sensitive to this 
question—is the issue of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when the British North America Act was first enacted, 
the issue of the protection of personal or private information 
in electronic commerce was surely not a concern in the 
legislators' mind. However, we must say that Quebec's Act 
respecting the protection of personal information in the private 
sector is a good one. It is applied in its jurisdiction. It is 
fully in force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not understand is that the federal government, by the 
back door, through its Minister of Industry, wants to pass an 
act on electronic commerce. By saying in clause 4 that the act 
applies everywhere in Canada, he is looking for trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said in my speech that the most difficult task was to find a 
justification for the enactment of a law and then to define so 
clearly the issue that the act can be very easily applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the minister is looking for trouble, I must say, if the 
bill is passed and if he continues to reject all amendments 
suggested by the Bloc, we will have two different jurisdictions 
regulating the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since everybody knows that electronic data travels very fast, 
merchants will have to ask themselves if the data they received 
or collected on a given day on their customers must be dealt 
with according to the Quebec act or the federal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they have to transfer data to another province or elsewhere, 
they will have to clarify the situation before sending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue I want to raise relates to the good faith of the 
Minister of Industry. In the speech he gave when he introduced 
the bill—I do not remember the date—he said that “Where a 
province adopts substantially similar legislation, the 
organizations covered by the provincial legislation will be 
exempted from the application of the federal law within that 
jurisdiction. 
Quebec already has privacy legislation similar to the bill 
entitled Personal Information Protection and Electronic 
Documents Act, so the province will be exempted from the 
application of the federal Bill”. That is what he said at the 
beginning of the debate, but I do not see anything in his bill 
that would confirm such a statement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will have to amend the bill because the present 
wording does not allow for such an exemption. The only provision 
concerning exemptions is found in paragraph 27(2)(d). That 
provision allows the exemption of an organization, an activity 
or a category from the application of the part of the bill 
concerning the collection, use or disclosure of personal data 
inside a particular province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that definition of the power conferred to the governor in 
council, organizations and activities are mentioned, but it 
cannot be used to exempt everything that is done in a particular 
province. 
We already know that the legislation will have to be changed or 
amended accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the bill's flaws, considering that electronic 
commerce is just beginning and will become much more prevalent 
in the future, and that this is a sensitive issue for Quebecers 
and Canadians, why did the minister not accept the Bloc 
Quebecois' proposal to withdraw the bill and to go back to the 
drawing board to harmonize this legislation with the Quebec act 
while also taking into account the need for legislation in the 
rest of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been easy for the minister to do that, 
particularly since the government postponed the beginning of the 
session. 
In the process, former Bill C-54 died on the order paper. In the 
new parliament, it has now become Bill C-6. It moved up in terms 
of its number, but not much has moved in the minister's head or, 
I should say, in the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why rush things now? Could it be that after this thundering and 
daring throne speech, the legislative agenda is such that the 
government must reintroduce old bills that are flawed and must 
rush them through parliament? I find it hard to understand. 
Perhaps this is what the throne speech was all about: do 
nothing, introduce old bills as new ones, come up with bills 
that we did not have time to finish debating during the last 
parliament. One wonders what kind of government we are dealing 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you are indicating that my time is almost up. 
This is unfortunate, because I would have liked to continue. I 
would like all parliamentarians who are here to understand—and 
I must point out the number of members opposite who are here on 
a Tuesday evening. It is remarkable to see the government 
benches full— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please. I must 
interrupt the hon. member to tell him that we cannot refer to 
presence or absence of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not refer to anyone's 
absence, at least I do not believe I did. But you will excuse me 
for being so enthusiastic on a Tuesday night. I want to be sure 
the government is responsible enough to consider the amendments 
since it refused to take the opportunity it was offered to 
redraft the bill from scratch. The government must stop 
interfering in areas under provincial jurisdiction, and 
everything will be fine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to wish us good luck in this new session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues, I am pleased, following the excellent work 
done by the member for Mercier on Bill C-54 in the previous 
session, to support the work of my colleague from Témiscamingue, 
which I am sure will be just as excellent, on this new bill now 
referred to as Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to my colleagues' speeches, and a 
particular remark made by one of my colleagues led me to 
slightly change my introduction to talk to you about a motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had forgotten to mention it in my speech. I think the motion 
has been adopted in early 1996 by the government party. It said 
that the government in its politics and decisions, should take 
into account the fact that Quebec is a society distinct from 
other Canadian provinces, motion we opposed to, need I remind 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, we opposed the motion not because of non 
recognition but because of the pathetic aspect of the motion or 
its role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an outright proof of the unfounded grounds and the lack 
of seriousness of a parliamentary motion when such a serious 
subject is discussed. And the government does not take into 
account this same motion in the application or analysis of the 
bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My voters were saying “Why did the Bloc Quebecois vote against 
this motion, since you were being recognized.” I gave them an 
example and please allow me to give you the example I used with 
my fellow citizens, who, by the way, were laughing a lot, to 
illustrate the role or importance of a motion. I expressed it in 
the following way: When we entered the House of Commons in 1993, 
several members had little or no experience. We passed two 
bills. 
In 1994 or 1995, legislation was passed recognizing hockey as 
Canada's national sport.  I myself had always thought that was 
the case, but they had just found it out, so we voted hockey to 
be the national sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then somebody realized that a group had been left out, and 
everyone must always be thought of.  The aboriginal people had 
been forgotten, so a national sport had to be found that 
included them.  The motion was therefore changed to read that 
hockey was the national winter sport, and that a summer one 
would be determined later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people do not know, the summer sport of Canadians is 
lacrosse.  That is what the motion passed in this House states. 
A motion is something very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following year, I was the critic for amateur sport, and I 
got a call from the national lacrosse team, informing me that 
their budget had been cut to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had just passed a motion that this was our 
country's national sport. They came up with that in 1994 or 
1995.  I am not familiar with the statistics on participation to 
this sport, but in my riding I know they are relatively low. 
The people that play this sport are not percentages. There are 
few people practicing this sport. The very same year, the budget 
of the national team was reduced to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you want to know what a motion is worth, I have two examples: 
that of national sport and that of Bill C-6. In both instances, a 
motion was passed. I think that the Prime Minister does not 
perhaps recall having voted on it. However, we can see the 
consideration that is accorded a motion when it is time for 
decisions to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I return to Bill C-6.  Often, in cavalier fashion, the 
government thinks, when a bill is analyzed, that we are wicked 
separatists and do so from a separatist standpoint. As a result, 
it covers its ears and does not bother to listen.  It prefers to 
read other things, like “Awake”, perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in this presentation, I will draw not on a Bloc Quebecois 
document, but on a document by the Quebec Access to Information 
Commission. Even though the word “Quebec” is part of its name, 
the commission is not dangerous.  It analyzed Bill C-54—now, 
Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues have used a lot of documents and 
committee briefs to present another vision, another aspect of 
Quebec's unanimous objection to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that the title and the intent of the bill are 
based on the constitutional power of the federal government to 
establish a climate of trust among Canadians in the way industry 
gathers, uses and transmits personal information to allow 
e-commerce to flourish. This sector is indeed growing vigorously 
and must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a little further along—and I will repeat the name of 
the group—the Quebec Access to Information Commission has said, 
and I quote, even if it is a bit long, but I have to quote it: 
“For nearly five years now, the act respecting the protection of 
personal information in the private sector affords all Quebecers 
a means of protecting personal information, has proven its 
mettle and its usefulness”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on Quebec's constitutional powers in the area of property 
and civil rights, Quebec's act is meant to complement Quebec's 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and its Civil Code. Quebec's 
legislation, which includes an act respecting access to 
documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal 
information, shows how important privacy is to the lawmaker. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector Act 
does not apply only to commercial activities, but also to 
personal information likely to be gathered, used or disclosed 
through electronic means. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Commission d'accès à l'information explained in its 
brief was that, on the basis of Quebec's constitutional powers, 
its Civil Code, its values and customs, and also, as my 
colleagues explained earlier, Quebec's experience with an act 
which has been working well for five years, it was saying no, as 
we are doing now, to Bill C-54, the current Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because clauses 4 and 27(2) of the bill define the scope of 
the future federal legislation and provide that organizations or 
activities might be exempted from federal rules regarding the 
protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the commission understands it, the federal legislation will 
apply to businesses based in Quebec or to part of their 
activities, unless an exemption is granted by the governor in 
council, which is not very likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if an order was made for a Quebec business operating 
outside of Quebec, the federal legislation would automatically 
apply to 28% of Quebec businesses involved in electronic 
commerce with other Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on in its submission, the Commission d'accès à 
l'information said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, several Quebec businesses will certainly be forced to 
apply both the federal and the provincial legislation at the 
same time, unless they have no commercial activities or none of 
the personal information they have is collected, used or 
disclosed outside Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would limit many Quebec businesses which are open to 
electronic commerce but would have no contact with businesses 
outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to oppose this proposal because every business in Quebec 
will have to deal with two jurisdictions, while the Quebec 
jurisdiction that has been existing for five years is in keeping 
with the standards of the OECD that were put forward by 
industrialized countries experimenting with electronic commerce 
means, even though Quebec has been demonstrating and applying 
them well for the past five years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All witnesses who came before the committee, on which the hon. 
member for Mercier, who has now been replaced by the member for 
Témiscamingue, sat, have been able to show this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in its submission, the Quebec Commission d'accès 
à l'information said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers can still 
enjoy a comprehensive protection of personal information system, 
the commission submits that Bill C-54— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is actually Bill C-6, which was designated as C-54 at the 
time. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—should be amended to explicitly provide that the federal act 
will not apply to businesses subject to the act respecting the 
protection of personal information in the private sector. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was made to understand, while following the debate on this 
issue, that this amendment was rejected by the Minister of 
Industry and by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are simply asking for the withdrawal of Bill C-6, 
so we can go back to square one and put in place a more credible 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, like my colleagues, I want to condemn the attitude of 
the government for two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government tabled the bill hastily, without even 
bothering to consult the provinces, to the detriment of the most 
sacred rights that can exist in Quebec. Second, having tabled 
the bill, the government does not even want it to be debated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve expressed 
our dismay and disapproval well when he spoke after the 
government House leader's announcement of the gag order. He 
basically said “Speak for a while and then the legislation will 
be passed, regardless of how well-articulated or useful your 
arguments may be to improve the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been sitting in this House for more than 15 years now 
and, after this government took office, I have noticed a loss of 
what I would call the democratic tradition of this House. In 
fact, I am reading these days a document on the history of the 
House of Commons, the first debates held in this place and how 
well, in the early days, the members of the different parties 
were listening to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that, when I arrived here in 1984, the tradition had 
been upheld. Amendments proposed by the opposition were often 
adopted by the government and consensus was often achieved, not 
always in the House but following a committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember that the government House leader who imposed the 
guillotine was part of a threesome called the “rat pack”. These 
people were hysterics who tore their shirts. They even had their 
acronym stamped on t-shirts that they distributed to people on 
the street to denounce the then conservative government for 
having imposed the guillotine on one or two occasions. It was 
unbelievable to see the force and the wisdom with which they 
defended the principle of the democratic debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people who were then the guardians of democracy are today 
its embalmers. 
These members have now become like sheep whereas they were 
roaring like lions a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister also, who was by his side, was proclaiming 
her indignation. There was also a third member, who kept his 
principles. He is sitting today as the independent member for 
York South—Weston. He roared, but when his principles were 
betrayed, what did he do? He left his party, and voters in his 
riding re-elected him. He is a principled man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not share entirely his views on everything, but I say that 
at that time he was shouting on that side, and later on he did 
not bow down like a sheep, he stood up and crossed the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> He did not knuckle under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> He did not knuckle under, as my colleague 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is suggesting to me very wisely and 
accurately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what those members came to do here if not only to vote 
when they are told to do so. A little while ago I saw many of 
them, and I still see some of them, bowing their head. They have 
been forbidden to speak to this bill. They are ashamed, and I 
understand why they are looking down. I understand why they are 
hiding behind the curtains. I understand as well why they made 
signs to their leader when he came in to put the gag on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to belong to a party that calls itself 
democratic and to be told: “Shut up. You are not here to think, 
you are here to vote when you are told to do so. We are four or 
five here to think for you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when they make speeches in their ridings, this is not 
what I hear. 
They say that they will defend firmly the rights of the 
individuals, associations, businesses, industries and citizens 
of their ridings. We are speaking of the rights of citizens and 
what do they do? They do not react. They accept to remain silent 
about a bill that is so important that it impacts on everyone in 
Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to these members. I remember some speeches that the 
hon. member for Beauce made in his riding when he said “I will 
do the same as Mr. Bernier did before me”, but Mr. Bernier would 
have reacted to a bill like this one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT88"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT88"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Beauce should be ashamed of what he said 
that time. If Mr. Bernier were here, he would rise and say “I do 
not accept that the rights of Quebecers are being trampled on in 
this way by this bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the member from Laval-Ouest? During the last electoral 
campaign, she engaged in debates and spoke constantly about 
human rights. She has not said a word about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine is always lecturing 
us about human rights in Quebec. But what is she doing today? 
She remains silent on a bill we are unanimously opposed to in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the member for Lac-Saint-Louis, a former Minister of 
the Environment in Quebec and a great human rights advocate 
doing? He also is keeping silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the member for Pierrefonds—Dollard. He is a physician. 
He must know what human rights are, what privacy means. But he 
also is saying nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, a former 
unionist and president of the CEQ. How many times has he talked 
about human rights in his speeches? I was expecting him to rise 
and say “No, this bill does not meet the expectations of the 
citizens of Quebec at all. It contradicts everything that was 
said by all the Quebec agencies who spoke on the subject”. But 
no, this public defender, this former great unionist now goes 
along, as his leader is doing, toeing the party line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what of the member for Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle,<B> </B>who was 
saying the same thing during the election campaign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worst still, where is the member for Brome—Missisquoi, a former 
president of the Quebec bar association? What does the bar 
association have to say? It says all that. However, when he was 
the president of the bar association, what did he do? He said 
“Vote for me, I will go and defend the interests of Quebec. I 
know that the Quebec legal system is different from what exists 
elsewhere in Canada, first of all because of our Civil Code”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization that he was heading has told us, and the member 
for Terrebonne quoted it earlier, that this bill was utterly 
useless, and that if we really wanted to pass it, it would have 
to be drastically amended. This organization sent a four-page 
letter to every member of parliament. Where is the former 
president of the bar association, now the member for 
Brome—Missisquoi? He also is remaining silent on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the member for Brossard—LaPrairie. 
I heard him in Shawinigan, during the 1993 election campaign, 
and during the 1992 referendum campaign. Together, we took part 
in debates. He was a great champion of rights and freedoms. 
Today, he is being silenced by his leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members from Quebec to rise and uphold the rights of 
Quebec. I appeal particularly to the famous minister, the member 
for Outremont, who said “I will speak out for the rights of 
Quebec within the Confederation”. The time has come for him to 
prove he can respect Quebec. Not only Quebec, because other 
provinces are opposed to this, but Quebec in particular. Five 
years ago, it was the first region in the western world to 
introduce such a bill and to enact it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all the ministers from Quebec, the Minister of 
Public Works, the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport. If he is 
now off his diet, is he now free to deal with human rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, I hope that in the last moments of this debate, 
all members from Quebec, no matter their political allegiance, 
will rise to tell the minister “Withdraw your bill”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to thank my colleague for 
Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour for his excellent speech. He has 
reminded us that government members have remained quite silent 
on an issue related to the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite something to see that they respect a self-imposed gag 
order to let a bill be passed, one wonders why, when it has been 
condemned by just about everybody in Canada and in Quebec, 
because it will be detrimental to the protection of personal 
information. It is totally unacceptable, and I hope the people 
who are watching us will take good note of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we disagree with this bill? This bill, which will support 
and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information in certain circumstances, was introduced by the 
industry minister just last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is identical to Bill C-54, which was introduced on October 1, 
1998. This bill has already been debated. We were hoping for 
some amendments when the minister introduced it again as Bill 
C-6, because it had been so heavily criticized. But the minister 
is coming back with exactly the same bill as Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we disagree? Because the industry minister has introduced 
this piece of legislation without any consultation with the 
provinces or anybody else. This bill is an intrusion into 
provincial jurisdictions. 
It will mean less protection for personal information in Quebec. 
Its implementation in Quebec will be a cause for confusion. If 
passed, this bill will be the worse administrative nightmare 
ever. Moreover, this bill is legally flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not clear enough. All those who have examined it 
and appeared as witnesses before the standing committee have 
said so. And the list of those witnesses is impressive. We had 
members of the Canadian Bar Association, the CSA, the 
Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, UQAM professors 
and one independent expert, Ian Lawson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote the Canadian Bar Association. “The standard was 
not drafted in strong enough words to make for a set of 
legislative rules. It does not really help to define the right 
to privacy or to tell the organizations to which the legislation 
applies how they should be protecting the people's rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Life and Health Insurance Association stated that “other 
provisions of the legislation are hard to interpret, especially 
the ones dealing with key issues such as the application and 
enforcement of the act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professors from l'Université du Québec 
à Montréal stated “If one wishes to truly protect the consumer 
in an area as formidable as personal information, one must adopt 
some strict rules and not rules written in the conditional tense 
that, for all useful purposes, do not obligate a company to show 
anything more than good faith. 
You cannot expect this to produce that result”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think one can be any clearer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the 
Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms that was proclaimed 
in 1975. Also, the Quebec government has passed the only act in 
America to protect personal information in the private sector. 
This act was enacted in 1994. As I said earlier, this act is 
considered a model throughout the world and should be used to 
draft the federal bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>God knows why the government is disregarding it. It is trying to 
give its bill precedence over Quebec's legislation, which is 
considered as a model all over the world. Why is the minister 
ignoring Quebec's legislation is a model all over the world? Can 
anyone explain why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry acted unilaterally despite his promise 
to consult all the stakeholders before introducing his bill. He 
may have done some minor consulting to make things look good, 
but he did not take anything said into account and proceeded to 
introduce his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, on June 12, the ministers responsible for 
the electronic highway met in Fredericton and decided to consult 
each other, if necessary, on the advisability of passing 
legislation protecting personal information in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 21, the federal Minister of Industry sent his 
provincial counterparts a draft bill and asked for their 
comments on wanted the federal government wanted to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the minister did not wait for the comments; he introduced 
his bill immediately, on October 1, 1998. His provincial 
counterparts received the draft bill on September 21, 1998, but 
the minister did not wait for their comments and introduced, on 
October 1, 1998, his legislation which was then called Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry is also responsible for creating a 
constitutional dispute that could have been avoided had he 
agreed to work in co-operation with his counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have jurisdiction in the area of personal 
information under the Constitution Act, 1867, which gives them 
powers with regard to property and civil law. Every expert 
consulted by the Bloc Quebecois recognizes that it is first and 
foremost a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-6 says that it will apply to organizations under 
federal jurisdiction in their commercial activities, to 
organizations that transfer personal information from one 
province to another or from one country to another, and to 
employees whose personal information is collected by an 
organization under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, clause 30(1) says that federal legislation will apply 
to private organizations, even though they are under provincial 
jurisdiction, if the federal government does not recognize the 
existence of similar legislation at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not interference in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction, I do not know what words to use to make members 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will be a big step backwards for Quebecers with regard 
to the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's legislation says, in section 14, that consent to the 
disclosure or use of personal information must be evident, free, 
enlightened and given for a specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to consent, Bill C-6 puts the consumer at a 
disadvantage by stating, in various clauses, vague principles 
that open the door to interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to give a thorough 
explanation of what is wrong with this bill. In closing, I would 
like to remind members that this bill was introduced without any 
consultations with the provinces, that it encroaches on 
provincial jurisdictions and that it represents a step backwards 
for Quebec with regard to the protection of personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement of this legally deficient bill in Quebec will 
create confusion. This bill is impossible to enforce, it is 
vague, it causes undue difficulties for Quebec businesses and 
considerably weakens the right of Quebecers to the protection of 
personal information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was going to say that I am rising on Bill C-54, but since the 
House was prorogued by the government leader, we have to redo 
our homework today. We also have to rename this legislation Bill 
C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the three and a half months the government had to 
prepare an appalling Speech from the Throne, it begged for three 
more weeks, and this of course led to all the bills dying on the 
order paper; this is unfortunate since the consideration of 
these bills was, for the most part, quite advanced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is sponsored by the Minister of Industry, the good 
member for Ottawa South in the federal capital region. When we 
watch this minister act, we sometimes ask ourselves if his 
judgment is failing him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same minister who, a few weeks ago, said of Quebec's 
minister Bernard Landry that it was stupid of him to have met 
the mayor of Boisbriand, where GM's plant is located. He said 
“Since there is a good dialogue between us, I will help you keep 
GM's plant”, when everyone knows full well that 95% of Canadian 
automobile plants are in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec only has 5% of them, one out of 15, and the minister 
would like to close it down. The Minister of Industry would not 
even help us keep our plant and he has the nerve to introduce 
Bill C-6, which will violate Quebecers' intimacy and 
confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of Bill C-6 reads in part “an act to support and 
promote electronic commerce”—everything is fine so far—“by 
protecting personal information that is collected, used”, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see how twisted and dishonest the government is. 
They changed the name of unemployment insurance for employment 
insurance. It means that you pay insurance policy and if your 
house burns down, the insurance company indemnifies you. In the 
same way, workers pay part of their wages to have protection 
against unemployment or lay off. The name of the plan was 
changed. Employment insurance was so much nicer! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Drummond knows perfectly well that only 42% 
of people who pay employment insurance premiums qualify for 
benefits when they lose their job. Why? Because eligibility 
criteria were hardened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Industry tells us that he will protect the 
privacy of Canadians. If he treats the confidentiality of 
personal data the same way he treats Canadian workers, there are 
reasons to worry. 
The way he treated Bernard Landry, the vice premier of Quebec, 
shows that the man does not have an ounce of judgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is so deprived of judgement that he acted 
unilaterally when he introduced his bill on personal data 
protection without waiting for the report of the very 
consultation committee he had created. I wonder how a man like 
him can be member of the cabinet. He created a consultation 
committee, but one week later, he went ahead without even 
waiting for the report of that committee. Isn't that bright? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is even worse. On September 21st 1998, 13 months ago, he 
consulted the provincial ministers. A few days later, on October 
1, he went ahead and introduced his bill, Bill C-54.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one, and the Bloc Quebecois is not the only 
one to object to the way the minister is behaving. In Quebec, 
his critics are unanimous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the government of Quebec, the Conseil du patronat, the 
CSN, the Chambre des notaires, Options consommateurs, the 
Barreau du Québec-of which the member for Brome—Missisquoi was 
president. There was a by-election after Mr. Peloquin, who 
represented this riding, died. The member who has replaced him 
said: “I will go to Ottawa to defend the interests of 
Quebecers.” He was then president of the Quebec Bar. 
Five years later, his former association says: “Bill C-6 is 
garbage, it should be thrown out.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, a group of constitutional experts said that Bill C-6 
was in violation of the constitution. A little while ago, the 
member for Drummond said that in 1994 Quebec had passed a bill 
protecting personal information. In Quebec, we already have an 
act. A few years later, the federal government is getting ready 
to destroy, ruin, put the axe to something which is working well 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the same thing in the throne speech we heard two weeks 
ago. In Quebec we have a drug plan which is working well. The 
federal government now wants to create it own. Once again it is 
going to cause trouble in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry knows full well that in Quebec we have 
what we call civil law and in the rest of Canada they have 
common law. 
I would like to read section 3 of the Civil Code. It 
is very short: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Every person is the holder of personality 
rights, such as the right to life 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agrees 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>, the right 
to the inviolability and integrity of his person, and the right 
to the respect of his name, reputation 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is, not saying anything against someone 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and privacy”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is section 3 of the Civil Code and it is from the latest 
volume that was just published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 should be put in file 13, shelved and simply be 
cancelled. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, want that Bill-6 be simply 
withdrawn for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Minister of Industry has tabled it without 
consulting the provinces. 
The bill would interfere with provincial jurisdictions. It would 
force Quebec to go backwards with respect to the protection of 
personal information, as the hon. member for Drummond argued so 
well earlier, because its enforcement in Quebec would produce 
confusion and because it is lacking on the legal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it uses electronic commerce as an excuse to invade the 
civil right of Quebecers and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wished that the Prime Minister, the hon. member 
for Saint-Maurice, would try to make the minister see reason, 
although I sometimes question his intellectual abilities, as he 
demonstrated about a week and a half ago. If he is not able to 
do so, he should get rid of him as Minister of Industry and kick 
him out of the cabinet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise after my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic.  I 
hope to be as eloquent as he was on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my other colleagues in the Bloc, I am somewhat perplexed 
and concerned by Bill C-6.  It concerns me because, as we all 
know very well—and my colleagues have mentioned this amply 
today—we already have in Quebec a law governing personal 
information, a law that has been enacted, works very well and 
covers the entire field, to the full extent of the law and the 
powers of the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the law covers all areas of personal information, and now we 
have the federal government with another law, Bill C-6, which, in 
legal terms, is inadequate as it fails to cover all it should. 
In addition, it causes serious confusion in business and does 
not even protect individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have spoken at length of various aspects of the 
bill.  I would like to focus for a few minutes only on the 
presentation made by the Quebec Conseil du patronat in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a sovereignist organization. It in fact is known to 
represent primarily big business in Quebec and has traditionally 
been federalist in its political views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54, they came up 
with a very detailed report to show that this bill was totally 
unacceptable for Quebec businesses because, once again, it 
creates confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 does not at all take into account the Quebec act, with 
the result that Quebec businesses will be subjected to two 
different legal systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its presentation, the Conseil du patronat says that for 
information collected, used and transmitted in the province, the 
personal information protection act that will apply in the 
private sector will be the Quebec act, while the federal 
legislation will apply to information transmitted outside the 
province. This is only one of many factors that will generate 
confusion among businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conseil du patronat provides a few examples. For instance, 
Quebec companies that come under federal jurisdiction and that 
do business outside Quebec, or that are governed by a Canadian 
act, will not know which legislation applies. Indeed, there will 
be two acts that will put contradictory demands on them and, 
moreover, that will not adequately protect people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a jurisdictional conflict, with the result that Quebec 
consumers will not be properly protected, while businesses will 
have two types of remedy. This is a total contradiction. And 
these are only two examples provided by the Conseil du patronat 
du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consent is extremely important when we are dealing with personal 
information. However, the provisions in bill C-6, which is the 
federal legislation, and in the Quebec act are different. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745
<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Quebec legislation, consent must be express, specific 
and clear.  On the other hand, according to the principle set 
out in section 4, schedule 1 of Bill C-6, consent is required. 
There is one contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others, for instance the one concerning the collection 
of information.  The Quebec legislation states that the 
collection of information from a third party cannot be done 
without the consent of the individual, except in certain very 
specific exceptional circumstances.  Bill C-6 on the other hand 
states that an organization may collect information without the 
knowledge and consent of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can anyone see his way clear through two pieces of 
contradictory legislation that are complete opposites in their 
vision and their application?  It is certain that this does not 
protect the Quebec consumer but, worse still, it places Quebec 
businesses in an extremely unfortunate position, because they 
are incapable of knowing whether they should be treating their 
customers according to federal or provincial legislation. 
Things will be even more complicated for companies carrying on 
business with out-of-province companies or those coming under 
federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of these. 
However, I would conclude with a quote from the submission by 
the Conseil du patronat du Québec: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all questions for which we find no answers at this 
time, and if Bill C-6 is passed as is, they will mean huge 
problems for businesses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the conclusions by a council that, I would remind 
you, is not a sovereignist organization.  It is one that defends 
the interests of Quebec business people and often comes across 
as federalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many questions raised by Bill C-6.  That is, 
moreover, the reason I am so concerned.  If the Conseil du 
patronat raises so many questions on Bill C-6, one may well 
wonder, given the potential conflicts and obvious 
contradictions, whether this bill is just an unplanned accident 
or a deliberate act by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal government have the deliberate intention of 
adversely affecting Quebec with Bill C-6, not only in its 
law-making powers, but also by harming Quebec businesses? Is this 
a possibility? I ask you. Does the government deliberately wish 
to harm Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-6, we are justified to ask this question 
because it is big and obvious and because the contradiction is 
also obvious. I wonder if, basically, it could be deliberate. 
There is no lack of recent examples regarding the federal 
government and its actions against Quebec, whether against the 
social union or the provincial powers. We have seen it in the 
health sector; we have also seen it recently in the education 
sector with the creation of the millennium fund. What an insult 
for Quebec. The only thing that could be worst could probably be 
Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government directly addresses the students on the 
issue of the millennium fund and even they are outraged to see 
how it shamelessly holds them hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not try to harm Quebec in a hypocrite and hidden way. 
No, it does it in broad daylight. Once again, Bill C-6 is an 
example.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is a good example of this attempt which is probably part 
of plan B, which is to despise everything that maintains the 
distinct character of Quebec, that is the privacy legislation 
for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as all my colleagues, I wish that the minister 
will finally wake up and have the good sense to withdraw this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, you 
can understand how happy I am to take part in this debate, first 
of all because we are back and I missed you a little, assuming 
that the reverse might somewhat be true. I want also to wish a 
good session to all the pages who are joining us for the year 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is also with some sadness that we have to join in the 
debate today. Who in this House could have imagined that the 
government, whose end of the regime we can already scent, would 
have the gall to re-introduce a bill that nobody wants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was unanimously rejected in Quebec. Through you, Madam 
Speaker, I challenge, not the agriculture minister for at this 
time he might not be awake, but any other minister to tell us 
who in Quebec supports a bill like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think it has any support in the union community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Do you think it has any support in the human 
rights community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Do you think it has any support in the legal 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Do you think it has any support in the Quebec 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> And that government is one of the best that has 
ever graced the national assembly, as everybody knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who saw the bill rejected, and I would even say 
thoroughly disliked, it.  But today the government, whose 
singlemindedness is second to none, presents us with a bill like 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I think it would be appropriate to express just 
how much we enjoyed the excellent and absolutely eloquent speech 
by the member for Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, he reminded us that Quebec has 
had a law since 1994, in addition to the Civil Code, which you 
have certainly had occasion to look through in your spare time. 
The member for Berthier—Montcalm, a lawyer himself, who studied 
in this city not far from the Hill, made the same point.  He 
also told me, in confidence, that he has wonderful memories of 
the years he spent studying law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone looking through the Civil Code will notice article 2, as 
the member for Frontenac—Mégantic mentioned, and articles 35 to 
41.  I should perhaps omit article 41, which talks about respect 
for the body after death, because this might give those who 
really want to do this bill justice some ideas.  We will stop at 
article 40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, article 35 is the most important article in the 
Civil Code when it comes to respect for privacy.  I will read 
it, because it captures the essence of what the legislator was 
trying to say about privacy.  I will dedicate it to the 
government members. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following acts, in particular, may be considered as 
invasions of the privacy of a person: one, entering or taking 
anything in his dwelling; two, intentionally intercepting or 
using his private communications; three, appropriating or using 
his image or voice while he is in private premises; four, 
keeping his private life under observation by any means; five, 
using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other 
than the legitimate information of the public; six, using his 
correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Civil Code is not a meaningless document.  It is not the 
Liberals' red book.  It is the very foundation of our legal 
system.  We are, and I have learned this myself in my law 
courses, a province, a country—soon, let us hope—with a civil law 
tradition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference between civil law and common law. Let us 
say that, in common law, judges can make the law, although this 
could be harshly debated. In our system, legislators and 
parliamentarians give some direction in a legal system where 
everything is codified or pass specific legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already passed a specific piece of legislation 
concerning the right of privacy. We led the way, as several of 
my hon. colleagues pointed out, and we cannot understand why the 
government is so eager to legislate in this area. Some people 
might find it easy to believe that I am too partisan, even 
though I can ensure everyone today as I have in the past that it 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have always been perfectly impartial and completely 
objective in this House, and to show my hon. colleagues that the 
point of view being supported by the Bloc members is not 
partisan, is not part of the Bloc agenda, I could share with the 
House the opinion of an authority that has always stayed clear 
of political partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking, of course, about the Quebec Bar Association. Has 
there been a more respectable institution in our society, a more 
neutral one, up until the day the former president of the bar 
decided to join the Liberal Party? But we like to think this is 
the exception to the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 4, 1999, not that long ago,the Barreau du Québec, 
with its recognized legal expertise through its president, Mr 
Jacques Fournier, not only condemned the lack of vision of this 
bill, and questioned its rationale, but also pleaded for the 
Quebec legislation to be extended to areas of federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read you something from Page 2 of the document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“To avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers continue to 
enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal 
information, we submit that bill C-54 should be amended so as to 
specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses 
subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements 
personnels dans le secteur privé, which is a Quebec law. We go 
further still, saying that, in our view, the bill should 
incorporate Quebec's act, even with respect to federal areas of 
jurisdiction, so as to avoid confusion, overlap and duplication 
of legislation in Quebec.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I should table the document so that it will be 
available to all parliamentarians. I am prepared to do so. 
But one thing remains: authorized people of the legal community, 
the main spokespersons of the lawyers, the president of the bar 
greatly wished that the Quebec legislation be extended. This is 
a paradox of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read the Speech from the Throne, we expected the 
government to budge in a number of sectors. I could give you the 
example of the air transportation sector. We expected the 
government to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, there has been a cabinet 
reshuffle. The Prime Minister has recognized that there were 
quite a few jacks in this government and that he needed some 
queens. He then has called to the cabinet a number of women and 
we expected the government to do something. Even you, Madam 
Speaker, somewhat wished it deep down inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected the government to budge in the air transportation 
sector. 
We expected it to do something in the area of organized crime, 
on the issue of money laundering, for example. So many other 
areas should have retained the attention of the government!

something, the government intervenes in an area of pure civil

integrity of the powers of the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, we have no other choice but to oppose this legislation. 
All my colleagues will do so with as much determination as our 
critic for industry and we will fight this bill until it is 
withdrawn.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
happy to rise on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to speak to Bill 
C-6, formerly Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some in the Quebec society and elsewhere who are 
questioning the role of the Bloc Quebecois here in the House. 
Madam Speaker, as a  representative of a Quebec riding, this is 
the perfect demonstration of the role played by the Bloc 
Quebecois in this House, which is, in addition to promoting 
sovereignty, to speak up for Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the other members from Quebec? Where are they? Let us 
imagine what would happen if we were still in the days of Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, to whom people are still paying homage today. 
If out of 75 members in this House we had 74 sheep, as was the 
case for Quebec in those days, what would they be doing faced 
with a bill on personal information such as Bill C-6? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an obvious intrusion, undue and unbridled, on the part of 
a minister who is displaying a self-serving attitude we did not 
think he was capable of. As we will recall, he introduced this 
bill on October 1st 1998, only days before the opening of the 
OECD meeting on electronic commerce in Ottawa. The then industry 
minister, who is the same as today, was hosting the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He probably wanted to look good to his international 
counterparts, pretending he was concerned about the real issues 
in his area, probably to raise his profile although this was 
going against public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus in Quebec according to which the federal 
government should not intervene in the field of personal 
information, since this issue is quite well covered by Quebec's 
law. As my colleagues already mentioned it, it is the bar and 
the Quebec council of employers, among others, and not only us, 
who are saying it. These organizations asked the Government of 
Canada where it was heading with its project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bar, through its president, Me Jacques Fournier, wrote on 
February 14, to my colleague of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“First, we are puzzled by the lack of correlation between the 
title of the act and its contents”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the president of the bar said. It is normally 
embarrassing for the government. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the bill has more to do with the protection of personal 
information in the private sector than with the promotion of 
electronic commerce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the subject of the meeting was electronic commerce. But the 
government wanted to show itself in the best light. The same 
thing happens when terms are changed, as my colleague from 
Frontenac—Mégantic said earlier. “Unemployment insurance” was 
changed by “employment insurance”. They are changing words to 
show themselves in a better light in front of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the bar continues to denounce the federal 
project by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's policy has been applied in Quebec for close to five 
years now. 
This policy is well known and businesses are accustomed to it”. 
Consequently, Quebec's bar essentially subscribes to the 
recommendation made by the information access commission, and I 
quote: “In order to prevent all confusion and to ensure that all 
Quebecers can continue to benefit from a complete policy in 
matters of personal information protection, we propose that Bill 
C-54 be amended by providing explicitly that the federal act will 
not apply to businesses already subjected to the Act respecting 
the protection of personal information in the private sector”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue quoting from the president of the bar: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would go even further. We think the bill should be 
incorporated by reference in the Quebec legislation, even in 
federal areas of jurisdiction, in order to prevent confusion, 
overlap, and duplication of legislation in Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been condemning for 40 years this duplication between 
federal and provincial legislation that makes such a mess in our 
institutions. That is why we are trying to convince more and 
more people in Quebec that sovereignty is the solution to all 
these problems. We should get out in order to be in a better 
position to deal with the rest of Canada as equal partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president said further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the Quebec plan for the protection of personal 
information in the private sector is better than the one in Bill 
C-54, now Bill C-6, particularly as concerns rights of appeal and 
efficiency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merits of the bill cannot withstand the serious examination 
made by the president of the bar or the Commission d'accès à 
l'information, which has a mandate to speak out, because we are 
dealing here with personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have been particularly impressed by what I read from 
the testimony of the Conseil du patronat. This organization is a 
legitimate advocate for business interests. It certainly has 
more ties with the Council for Canadian Unity than it does with 
the Parti québécois executive, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This organization has written a chapter that is as good as many 
sovereignist speeches. 
I will read it to you since I still have a little time left; it 
is absolutely beautiful because it shows, once again, the 
Canadian mess which becomes more and more institutionalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brief it submitted to the Standing Committee on Industry, 
the Conseil du patronat is critical of the communication of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the brief on page 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the double jurisdiction, the companies falling under 
provincial jurisdiction will wonder whether the personal 
information which is collected from them and consequently 
protected by Quebec's legislation and which is transmitted to a 
company falling under federal jurisdiction and carrying business 
in Quebec will be governed by Quebec's rules or Canada's rules. 
In addition, within a single file, some information could be 
subject to both statutes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to manage for someone who is in the private sector, 
who has to do business, who has to deal with a union, who has 
orders to fill and deadlines to meet—we know how complicated it 
is—and who is confronted with such legislation that clearly shows 
the existence of two solitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that nobody on that side of the House nor over there 
seems to be interested in this bill, with the exception of the 
Quebec's members, clearly illustrates the Canadian drama, the 
two solitudes, the fact that something is going wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, along the lines of Reed Scowen, the government is also 
addressing Canadians. Maybe the time has come for our country to 
reflect on where we are all going together. 
It might be better for each to proceed along its own solidly 
built road running in the same direction, rather than crashing 
head on and trying to gain the right of way in an area already 
governed perfectly well by provinces, and Quebec in particular 
with an entire culture behind it that is suited to this type of 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to go on with the disclosure of information, again quoting 
from the brief submitted by the Conseil du patronat: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the organizations whose activities are connected to 
federal jurisdiction, for instance loan companies and airports? 
One could even conceive of different rules applying to one and 
the same file, depending on whether the information collected, 
used or held is covered by Quebec or federal law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a constant muddle. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, any Quebec business with a branch in another 
province—such as an insurance company—that is required to send 
it information gathered in Quebec would have to know whether to 
refer to the Quebec or the federal legislation on protection of 
that information. Similarly, if the information in question is 
stored in a computerized data bank in Quebec but accessible by 
another company outside Quebec, which legislation would apply?” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, coming to the conclusion of this chapter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all questions for which we find no answers at this 
time, and ones that will pose huge problems to businesses if the 
bill is passed in its present form. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then, is what the business people have to say, the language 
they use, and these are the ones responsible for added value in 
our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to ask ourselves some questions when people like this 
speak up so courageously to government.  Normally, they are on 
the same side.  It is no secret that these are natural allies. 
But they are telling the government: “Stop, do not continue with 
this bill.”  This is, moreover, the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  It is an indefensible bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spending his time on such a bill, the minister should 
be focussing more attention on the GM affair. He should quit 
behaving to the Quebec ministers as if he were an Ontario 
minister and abandon the scornful tone he uses with Quebec's 
deputy premier and minister of industry and commerce. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
rare for me not to be pleased to be part of a debate on a bill, 
as is the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, formerly Bill C-54, which was criticized by most of my 
colleagues, remains a bill that should be treated as the Bloc 
Quebecois proposes, that is, it should be set aside. The 
Minister of Industry should be sent to do his homework so that 
everyone is satisfied.  To this point, one party is totally 
dissatisfied—Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unanimous in Quebec.  Everyone opposes this bill on 
e-commerce and personal information.  Why is everyone opposed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is as a matter of principle.  The federal government 
has an almost legendary propensity to meddle in jurisdictions 
other than its own. 
Every lead taken by Quebec in areas of its jurisdiction is 
penalized by the federal government with its wall to wall bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, there have been fairly remarkable examples of 
this.  In 1994, for example, we were all newly elected to our 
first term, and the Minister of Finance started talking about 
the appropriateness of establishing a Canadian securities 
commission. Securities are under Quebec's jurisdiction 
exclusively, and Quebec has worked very hard for the past 30 
years to create an effective system with highly interesting 
areas of jurisdiction that are in fact higher than what is found 
in most provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Quebec took the lead in the area of securities, in a 
field the Canadian Constitution recognizes as its own, the 
federal government decided, because the other provinces were not 
as well organized as Quebec, to establish a Canadian securities 
commission, wall to wall, with duplications, overlap and total 
confusion in this sector so vulnerable to uncertainty.  The 
Minister of Finance paid no attention to the problems this might 
cause Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples, such as that involving provincially 
chartered insurance companies. 
Quebec had an inspector general of financial institutions, a 
Commission des valeurs mobilières to monitor transactions and 
minimize the risk for shareholders and insured persons. However, 
that did not stop the Minister of Finance from deciding a few 
years ago to prevent a provincially chartered insurance company 
from Quebec, L'Entraide assurances, from acquiring a block of 
insurance from a federally chartered company.  The reason given 
was that it would create a precedent and other provinces would 
want to follow suit, although they were not prepared to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, with the levels of protection Quebec has introduced 
in the financial sector generally, and particularly in the 
insurance sector, we were penalized because the other Canadian 
provinces did not show the leadership that Quebec did in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back a little further, we will recall that Bill S-31, in 
the early 1980s, prevented the Caisse de dépôt et de placement 
from acquiring a large block of shares in Canadian Pacific. 
Once again, because Quebec had established an institution like 
the Caisse de dépôt et de placement starting in the 1960s, which 
was already a force to be reckoned with in the early 1980s, 
because Quebec had taken the lead, had opted for modern methods 
of managing the pension funds of Quebecers, it was penalized. 
The federal government wanted to stop Quebec from getting ahead, 
from modernizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships are the same thing all over again. 
Every time Quebec moves ahead, shows leadership, as we saw with 
the millennium scholarships, because the other provinces have 
not put together a system like Quebec's—once again, a 
coast-to-coast policy—with the millennium scholarships, the 
federal government is ignoring the consensus in Quebec opposing 
this project.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case before us, it is the same thing. Quebec has had a 
personal information protection act for five years. That act 
works well, and everyone is familiar with it now, both the 
consumers, who can invoke its provisions, and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's act protects not only personal information in the 
province, but also personal information that is sent by a Quebec 
business, for example, in other Canadian provinces, or personal 
information that is received in Quebec from other Canadian 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such a good act that it enjoys unanimous support in 
Quebec. It is not perfect. All laws are, in a sense, imperfect. 
Legislation must adjust to evolving situations. But the Quebec 
act enjoys the unanimous support of Quebecers. It is a good act 
with a good middle of the road approach that pleases everyone 
and that includes provisions to prevent any leak of personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so true that, as others have said before me, even the 
Conseil du patronat finds that it is a good act with which 
businesses can work, and with which they are now familiar, 
because it has been in effect for five years. Should Bill C-6 
come into effect, it would create total confusion among Quebec 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Conseil du patronat refers to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Quebec government in the area of personal 
information protection, as provided by section 92.13 of the 
British North America Act. The Conseil recognizes that Quebec 
has jurisdiction to legislate in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also feels that this bill will create confusion not only 
among businesses, but also among consumers, who will not know 
who to turn to, or to which legislation to refer to protect 
their rights and the information that concerns them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its brief, the Conseil du patronat said “As for Quebec 
consumers, they would always have to identify which act applies 
and to choose between two remedies, depending on whether the 
information is protected under one act or the other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would create total confusion. 
It has been criticized since it was first introduced as Bill 
C-54. It has been criticized by everyone in Quebec and 
particularly by those who take an interest in personal 
information protection and in the civil code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have mentioned before me, even the Barreau du Québec 
said that the best way to handle the situation—and one must think 
that nine Canadian provinces do not have personal information 
protection legislation—the only way to respect Quebec's choice 
and to avoid any harm to consumers and businesses who have been 
operating for five years under Quebec's act would be to enshrine 
in the bill a reference to that act confirming that it replaces 
the federal act on Quebec's territory and when personal 
information is exchanged between a Quebec company and a company 
from another Canadian province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal was made by the Barreau du Québec. It may be worth 
considering. As others have said, it is not that we hate the 
bill. 
We consider that it could very well be implemented in the nine 
other provinces but that, in Quebec, the choice made five years 
ago should be respected. This could be one of the flexibilities 
that people across the way like so much to boast about, 
particularly after the Speech from the Throne read by the 
Governor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that that could be a good way to prove that the 
government wants to improve a little bit the functioning of the 
system. It may also be advisable for the government, after six 
years in office, to show that it can respect the choices made by 
Quebec and recognize that it was a pioneer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our first day here, we have been asking the federal 
government to take action in its own jurisdictions. 
For example, it was asked to take action in the transportation 
industry during the debate on Air Canada, Canadian Airlines and 
Onex. Just recently, we saw another example of the federal 
government refusing to co-operate in the transportation industry 
with the way Quebec's finance minister was treated by the 
Minister of Industry with regard to the restructuring proposal 
for the GM plant in Boisbriand.

an area under federal jurisdiction. It is being asked to fight 
organized crime, reform our tax system, and give middle income 
Canadians a substantial tax break as early as this year and this 
fiscal year. But it refuses to take action in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always finds a way to interfere in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. It creates conflicts, and the opposition always 
finds itself in an awkward position when it would have been so 
easy for the federal government to say that this bill will apply 
to the other provinces, with a reference to the Quebec 
legislation regarding the protection of personal information for 
that particular province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, for all these reasons, we will vote against this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, everybody 
will understand that it is on a somewhat humble tone that I am 
speaking today to an issue of such a vital importance, after the 
many eloquent speeches from my colleagues. I am making 
reference, among others, to the members from St. Hyacinthe—Bagot, 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, Rosemont, Trois-Rivières and 
Frontenac—Megantic. All those who rose before me are only 
adding,  if you will, to my nervousness while I am speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your attention to this debate and your nods of agreement while 
we speak are only adding to the determination with which I am 
expressing myself here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 19, 1999—a few days before the birth of the first 
child of a couple that are friends of mine and to whom I wish to 
say hello—we can talk about an obsession of the federal 
government, the obsession of uniformity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only go back to the origins of this country, Canada, 
namely the Constitution Act, 1867. This document—until the fast 
approaching day when Quebecers will decide to leave 
democratically, and we are working passionately to that end 
every day—represents the rules we have to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution, although plagued with defects was nevertheless 
sometimes reflecting a certain wisdom. All the colleagues who 
spoke before me mentioned that section 92.13 of The British 
North America Act gave the provinces exclusive power on property 
and civil rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But another paragraph which remained almost unnoticed until now 
in the Constitution is section 94. 
Section 94 allowed the federal government to ensure the 
uniformity of legislation in the common law provinces at a time 
when there were four provinces in Confederation, that is 
Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This allowed the 
federal government to standardize legislation in Ontario, Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick, but not in Quebec, because it was 
recognized explicitly, not only in section 92.13 but in section 
94 as well, that the legal system in Quebec was distinct, based 
on a totally  different tradition, a civil tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recognition of the distinctiveness of Quebec's legal 
tradition is not upheld by those who want to be the heirs of the 
Fathers of Confederation, the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any observer from another country, or even one landing here from 
another planet, would say “My goodness, this does not make any 
sense. The ones defending respect of the Constitution of 1867 
are the sovereignists, the ones who want to ensure that Quebec 
is no longer bound by that document”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the defenders of federalism? Where are the defenders 
of the Constitution? They sit opposite, but say nothing. Even 
those who come from Quebec did not stand up to say “Wait a 
minute, we will not allow the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec 
to be flouted, put aside, forgotten, and even, as one my hon. 
colleagues put it so eloquently, scorned”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of course the Bloc Quebecois' position that I just 
mentioned, but it is widely shared by numerous stakeholders 
throughout Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Bloc Quebecois is the voice of Quebec in the 
federal arena, to the great displeasure of my colleague from 
Chicoutimi, whose speech I did not hear. I do not know if he 
rose to speak on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No, he hasn't. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau: </B>My colleague, the member for Chicoutimi, 
has not yet been heard. I hope that he will rise and, for once, 
defend the interests of Quebec in the House and that he will do 
so in a strong voice, with his friends from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Jean-Pierre Bernier, of the Canadian Life 
and Health Insurance Association. The last time I checked, that 
association was not exactly a supporter of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Mr. Bernier said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a constitutional issue here, since personal 
information, in my opinion, comes under provincial jurisdiction, 
under the heading “Property and Civil Rights”. Therefore, I 
think it would be very difficult for the federal government to 
pass legislation dealing exclusively with the protection of 
personal information. If you are able to relate personal 
information protection rules to an area of activity where 
federal authority is not in doubt, you have more chances to 
occupy the field, if I may put it this way. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather clear, but he is not the only one who thinks so. 
There is also Michel Venne, a well known and respected 
journalist in Quebec, who works for <I>Le Devoir</I>, the great 
newspaper founded by Henri Bourassa in 1910, the motto of which 
is “Do what you must”. We are doing what we must by opposing 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote: “The justice ministers of the provinces and the 
territories expressed strong concerns about significant 
invasions of provincial and territory jurisdiction found in Bill 
C-54—now Bill C-6. They asked the federal government to withdraw 
the bill and to consult the provinces and the territories. If 
the resolution passed in the House of Commons in December 1995 
and recognizing Quebec as a distinct society by its language, 
its culture and its civil code meant anything, Mr. Manley should 
have provided for an exclusion for Quebec in the original bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quote, I am reading it. 
According to the Standing Orders of the House, we may name a 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there is unanimity against the federal bill. Why is 
that? Because in Quebec, who have been at the forefront of the 
area for years or even decades, well before we came to this 
place, the Liberal government of the day, with the support of 
the Parti québécois, put in place its own personal data 
protection system in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That clearly shows that even at that time, the issue escaped 
partisan politics that is normal in any democratic society. 
However, the bill passed by the National Assembly in 1994 was 
only one element of the legal interest for privacy protection 
that already existed in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out earlier by my colleague for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, sections 37 to 40 of the Civil Code 
already cover the protection of privacy and the Civil Code on 
which is based all the Quebec legal system is not to be swept 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but another document which has almost a 
constitutional value in Quebec, that is, the Charter of Human 
Rights and Freedoms, also protects privacy. Thus, the Charter, 
which was adopted in 1974, if I remember well, and the Quebec 
Civil Code, which has been adopted only recently—we were 
governed by the Lower Canada Civil Code between 1866 and 1992 or 
1993, if my memory serves me right—all demonstrated how 
important the protection of privacy was for the Quebec 
legislator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government doing? Without any consideration not 
only for the importance that Quebec had given to the protection 
of privacy but also for the unanimous opinion of Quebecers of 
all political colours, it has decided to interfere directly in 
this area. And it is doing it very awkwardly.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
what is a national children's agenda without a commitment to a 
national child care program?  What is the practicality of a 
national children's agenda without any commitment or target and 
real program to end the poverty of children and the families they 
are part of?  What really is the national children's agenda when 
there is no sign of federal dollars for meeting the basic needs 
of housing in our society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions are front and centre and remain unanswered after 
hearing the Prime Minister's response to the so-called national 
children's agenda.  I wanted to get a clear answer and ask the 
Prime Minister directly if he understands that the so-called 
children's agenda is worthless unless it includes child care, 
especially as the Liberal government still has not fulfilled its 
promise for 150,000 child care spaces made way back in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the answers to these questions involving the 
credibility and believability of the national children's agenda? 
All we got were excuses from the Prime Minister saying that the 
provinces had rejected the offers he made for child care.  The 
Prime Minister is dead wrong.  There is nothing for the provinces 
to reject because they were not offered any serious initiative 
that could be characterized as a national strategy and plan for 
an early childhood development program.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we now?  Federal New Democrats, the child care 
advocacy movement, the labour movement and provincial governments 
that are eager to see the federal government show real leadership 
want to see the Liberal government get beyond the platitudes of 
helping kids and get serious now with a national plan for child 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is doing it and B.C. is doing it.  Why is the Liberal 
government not moving on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kids cannot wait.  New Democrats are saying to the federal 
government that if it is serious about ending poverty, if it is 
serious about the health and well-being of Canada's children, if 
it truly believes that Canada should be the best place to live 
for all Canadians, then it should end the vicious attack on 
Canada's poor, start building housing for families who 
desperately need it, make sure that the child tax benefit goes to 
all low income families and fulfil its commitments for child care 
spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like the Liberals are torn between two paths.  It is 
tempted by the lure of tax cuts, peddled by business elites 
without offering any real help to low and moderate income 
families.  While there are others within the Liberal caucus who 
know that after years of crushing cuts by their own government 
Canadians have as a first priority a reinvestment in programs and 
services that will help families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the Liberals to not use the provinces as a smokescreen 
for their own inaction.  I know B.C.'s minister responsible for 
child care, Mr. Moe Sihota, has gone very strongly on the record 
that he wants a comprehensive national plan for early childhood 
development and child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please, do not blame the provinces.  Just give us a straight 
answer.  Will the federal government implement with the provinces 
a comprehensive national child care program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the Speech 
from the Throne clearly indicates that children are the highest 
priority of the government.  Raising the next generation of 
Canadians is everyone's concern and that is why we are doubling 
the EI period of parental leave.  That is why early childhood 
development is a key theme in the national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of that agenda, we are committed to working jointly with 
our partners to develop an agreement on early childhood 
development by December 2000, an agreement with principles, 
objectives and fiscal parameters and a five year timetable for 
increased funding to achieve our shared objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that child care and indeed many services for 
children fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction but 
we have already made great strides with the provinces to improve 
the well-being of children.  The centrepiece of our progress is 
the national child benefit.  Thanks to the national child 
benefit, $2 billion will be going to modest and low income 
families with children by July 2000, bringing total federal 
assistance for families and children to almost $7 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the NCB, provinces and territories are reinvesting in 
complementary services for children and eight provinces have 
already invested in child care.  The member's own province of 
B.C. has had $80 million extra to invest in children, some of 
which they have chosen to invest in child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the Government of Canada, have also acted on our own through 
the First Nations Inuit child care program which has created or 
improved more than 7,000 child care spaces.  Through the visions 
program, we are supporting research projects to improve the 
quality of child care across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives are solid contributions to child care in 
Canada and the Speech from the Throne provides the potential to 
do much more.

<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on October 14 I rose in the House and asked a question 
of the minister of fisheries regarding the east coast lobster 
crisis in relation to the Donald Marshall supreme court ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held the minister's record up for review.  I pointed out the 
minister's record up to now:  no moratorium, homes burned, 
businesses destroyed, neighbour fighting neighbour, 200 years of 
harmony between natives and non-natives jeopardized and the fear 
and uncertainty in this free for all continues as it does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the question:  Can we expect more of the same from this 
minister, no leadership, no plan and no hope of a successful 
resolution? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT106"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT106"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1910
<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a resolution to the problem and there could 
have been.  Today there still can be, but the leadership is 
lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern comes from lobster fishermen who are eighth and tenth 
generation fishermen.  They remind me that today we have a 
healthy fishery, a lucrative fishery and a good fishery because 
it is well managed.  Fishermen exercise good custodial rights, 
which is what we want to see in this ruling.  There is no 
evidence that the minister is going to insist on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the lobster fishery we have trap limits.  We have areas 
or zones in which fishermen can and cannot fish.  They are 
designated areas or zones.   We have a season and a limit on that 
season.  We have a limit restricting entry into that fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years there has been a limit on the effort in that 
fishery.  That is one of the reasons this fishery has been very 
healthy and able to sustain many livelihoods over the past number 
of years.  That is what the minister has to guarantee those 
people, that it will be there, that their livelihoods will not be 
destroyed by mismanagement of the fishery.  There cannot be a 
wholesale entry into that fishery.  They have to have some 
comfort from the minister as to when that will happen.  That is 
part of the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our livelihood is threatened we react.  We understandably 
react sometimes harshly when we feel as though our way of life is 
going to be destroyed.  That is what the non-native fishermen are 
experiencing at this very moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see leadership from the federal minister.  At some 
point, when this is all laid to rest, the word compensation has 
to enter the equation.  If we have a fishery with no limit on the 
number of entrants, in other words allowing new players into that 
fishery, the entire fishery will be threatened.  That is what I 
see happening.  I think everyone on this side of the House can 
see that happening unless the minister takes strong, decisive 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could ask for another 30 seconds.  I do not want to 
see the minister continually abdicate his responsibility— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member.  As he knows, the rules are very strict for the 
adjournment debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the 
House for this opportunity to address an important matter in 
Atlantic Canada which concerns everyone in this country.  The 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has taken decisive action on his 
short term plan as well as a long term plan that all parties will 
consider fair and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. James Mackenzie has been appointed as the chief federal 
representative to work out practical arrangements on access to 
fisheries resources that reflect the affirmed treaty right and 
that are sensitive to the interests of those who rely on the 
fishery for their livelihood.  Mr. Mackenzie has an intimate 
knowledge of the maritimes and of the importance of the fishery, 
being from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and he has been the lead 
federal negotiator in comprehensive claim negotiations with the 
Inuit in my riding of Labrador.  I have every confidence that Mr. 
Mackenzie can find common ground on which we can build long term 
strategies that will be enduring and successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans met with both commercial 
representatives and with aboriginal leaders in the maritimes.  He 
met yesterday, along with the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and Mr. Mackenzie, with 50 aboriginal 
leaders.  Coming out of that meeting there was agreement to
