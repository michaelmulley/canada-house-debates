	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I was delayed 
in coming to the House today. It was my intention to introduce a 
Private Members' Bill. I would seek unanimous consent to 
revert to the introduction of Private Members' Bills.

introduction of Private Members' Bills?

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to present 
this Private Members' Bill. Members will know that those 
convicted of first degree murder are sentenced to life 
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years and 
those sentenced or convicted of second degree murder can be 
sentenced to life in prison without eligibility for parole for 15 
years or more.
<P>
	Under section 745 of the Criminal Code of Canada, these 
individuals can apply to have their parole ineligibility dates 
reduced to 15 years.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to delete 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. The net effect of this would 
mean that those convicted of first degree murder in Canada 
would be required by law to serve a minimum of 25 years and 
those convicted of second degree murder would be required to 
serve whatever the sentence of the court is.
<P>
	I am pleased that the Minister of Justice is in the Chamber 
today. I would urge the Minister of Justice to take into serious 
consideration the bill I am introducing today. He knows that 
there have been a significant number of these applications over 
the last several years. Seventy-five percent of these 
applications have been successful. In effect, if someone 
commits first degree murder in Canada today it no longer means 
that person has to serve a minimum of 25 years.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to support this initiative.

again on the question of section 745, as members know I have 
introduced in this House a significant number of petitions from 
Canadians requesting that the government delete section 745. I 
would like to introduce another with several hundred signatures 
today.
<P>
	The petition reads as follows: We the undersigned residents of 
Canada draw the attention of the House to the following: If those 
individuals convicted of first degree murder are sentenced to 
life in prison without eligibility for parole for 25 years, that 
those convicted of second degree murder can be sentenced to 
life in prison without eligibility for parole for 15 years or more; 
that section 745 of the Criminal Code of Canada allows 
murderers to apply for a reduction in the number of years of 
imprisonment notwithstanding having been tried, convicted and 
sentenced in a court of law; that those individuals convicted of 
first degree murder or second degree murder and sentenced to 
life in prison can become eligible for parole after serving only 
15 years by virtue of section 745 of the Criminal Code; that 
convicted murderers can be released after serving only 15 years 
in prison; therefore your petitioners request that Parliament pass 
legislation that would remove section 745 from the Canadian 
Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>

that conversion of oil pipelines to natural gas pipelines presents 
a number of risks to landowners.
<P>
	They face an environmental liability. They are faced with 
substantial costs to attend and to participate in National Energy 
Board hearings. The National Energy Board Act has no 
provision for the awarding of intervener funding or for the 
awarding of costs to landowners unlike provincial energy acts.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners humbly pray and call upon 
Parliament to urge the Government of Canada to amend 
immediately the National Energy Board Act to provide authority 
to the National Energy Board to award intervener funding and 
costs to landowners who intervene in proceedings before the 
board on issues of public interest relevant to the construction 
and operation of pipelines.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LANGUAGEUSAGE">LANGUAGE USAGE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want 
to comment on the report that was just read into the record from 
the table and to raise a question of privilege on the use of 
language in the House, in particular the use of the word 
chairman in the report.
<P>
	For some time in the House we have tried to use gender 
neutral language. My point is simply that the use of male terms 
in this way diminishes my role in the House and the role of every 
other woman member of Parliament and therefore diminishes 
my ability to be taken seriously in the House and to perform my 
duties as a parliamentarian.
<P>
	I do not want to make a long statement but I would like to 
make a few points. The use of male terms gives a status to the 
male sex and to male members of Parliament that it denies to 
women members of Parliament. I realize many members of 
Parliament may consider that these are traditional uses of the 
terms, and I grant that. They are traditional uses of terms that in 
fact have led to our understanding that certain jobs in society 
belong to men and certain jobs in society belong to women. This 
perception has for many years delayed the entry of more women 
into positions of decision making in our society.
<P>
	We can all rationally say we know what we mean by the word 
chairman. It does not refer to a man. However, it does reinforce 
the perceptions that become ingrained in our society that the 
positions of authority and responsibility belong to the male 
gender. It may be possible for us to rationalize that is not the 
significance of the use of those terms.
<P>
	However, we have a society in which it means that little boys 
and little girls grow up with a certain perception of where each 
of them belongs in society. As the Parliament of Canada I 
believe it is not worthy of us to continue that perception.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="2397"> 2397 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Therefore I come back to my original point that it undermines 
my ability to perform on an equal footing in the House. I would 
ask Your Honour to take this question of privilege under 
consideration to determine what measures are necessary and to 
ensure that we take all steps necessary to make sure we are using 
gender neutral language.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the point is quite valid and interesting, but I do not 
believe the member in question who tabled the report did 
anything improper; in fact our Standing Orders are presently 
worded in that way.
<P>
	I refer the House to page 2 of the index to our Standing Orders 
wherein it describes a number of positions, for instance ``Order 
and decorum, Chairman to maintain; See also Chairman of 
Committees'' and so on.
<P>
	Our Standing Orders are written in that way at the present 
time. If the House feels that the Standing Orders should be 
revisited in that regard, I am sure the standing committee on 
procedure would gladly examine those terms, if such a request 
were made of the committee, recognizing that the House has 
already referred a whole group of other matters to the 
committee. As one member of the committee I would certainly 
not object to revisiting that particular rule.
<P>
	Just to conclude, I do not believe the member who made the 
comment did anything to affect the privilege of others. It is 
rather the Standing Orders themselves that are written that way, 
and perhaps it is grounds to revisit the Standing Orders at the 
appropriate time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have problems with the House's trying to control 
whether or not I ever use chairman as a term of reference in my 
discussions. I would like the flexibility to use whatever words I 
feel are appropriate, whether it is chairperson, chairman or 
chairwoman.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have asked that you take this 
item under consideration. I do not want your consideration to be 
limited to how reports are presented. I do not want the comments 
of the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to necessarily 
limit your consideration of the question of privilege. I think it 
should go to the content of legislation presented before the 
House and a number of other things.
<P>
	Individual members can choose to use whatever language 
they wish. However, my question of privilege goes to how the 
House operates generally and the formal instruments of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point will be taken under 
consideration. Before I come back to deliberate and make sense 
of the matter I will endeavour to advise all three hon. members 
who have spoken today.
<P>

moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its inaction with regard to the 
reform of the criminal justice system, in particular its allowance of the rights of 
criminals to supersede those of the victim.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, while it is a privilege to lead off this 
debate in the House it is regrettable that it has to be to condemn 
the government for its inaction to introduce legislation to 
provide for victims' rights.
<P>
	For years the criminal justice system has been geared toward 
the rights of the criminal. From the moment the offender is 
arrested to the moment of the expiration of the sentence, our 
justice system is built around the criminal. The victim has 
generally been ignored. If Parliament is intent on protecting 
society, it will have to recognize and codify victims' rights.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	In all fairness there have been some minor steps in this regard. 
Some attention is now given to victim impact statements, but the 
courts generally view them as being secondary to the concerns 
of the criminal.
<P>
	An example of this was the section 745 hearing Greg Fischer 
held in January of this year. Sixteen years ago Constable Brian 
King of the RCMP was kidnapped and murdered near Saskatoon. 
The motive of the two killers was simply that they wanted to kill 
a police officer. In January 1979 Fischer was sentenced to life 
imprisonment with no parole for 25 years.
<P>
	At the hearing to determine if Fischer could apply for early 
parole, much was stated about how Fischer had improved 
himself in prison over the last 15 years. What had happened to 
the King family over the last 15 years was irrelevant. The King 
family was not allowed to address the court. It is time to give the 
victims of crime legal standing at all court and parole hearings.
<P>
	While there are some other positive developments such as 
police departments creating victim assistance programs, they 
are partial measures. Programs such as these usually have to rely 
on volunteers for staff.
<P>
	Is it not ironic that criminals receive professional legal 
advice, professional psychological counselling and education or 
job training skills all at taxpayers' expense, while the victims of 
crime have to rely on community volunteers or volunteer 
support groups for help in dealing with the trauma resulting 
from criminals' behaviour?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2398"> 2398 </A></B>
<P>
	Criminal activity costs everyone, whether or not they are 
direct victims of crime. It may be easy to see the injuries of 
an assault victim, but we tend to forget that the Canadian 
taxpayer is paying for the medical treatment of that victim. 
Likewise the loss of the burglary victim or a car theft victim 
is fairly evident, but everyone ends up paying more through 
higher insurance premiums.
<P>
	Each year motorists complain about their ever increasing 
insurance premiums. Over the past five years premiums have 
increased well beyond the rate of inflation. Much of the increase 
is due to criminal activity. Vandalism, car theft and insurance 
fraud account for a significant portion of every driver's 
insurance premium. Not only do Canada's drivers have to 
subsidize criminal activity but we as consumers are forced to 
pay the price as well.
<P>
	Retailers across the country lose millions of dollars each year 
to shoplifter and employee theft. These losses are passed on to 
consumers in the form of higher prices. Not only are Canadian 
business people faced with these problems but some are being 
driven out of business by crime itself. Small independent 
convenience store operators and gas stations located in high 
crime areas are finding it impossible to get companies to insure 
them and, if they can, the premiums are unrealistic. It is a shame 
that some profitable businesses are being forced out of business 
by crime.
<P>
	What is the solution to this problem? Let us start by making 
the criminal pay. Restitution to the victim or the insurance 
company should be automatic with a guilty verdict.
<P>
	The cost of crime to society does not end with the direct costs 
of the victim. The cost of the entire criminal system itself is 
immense. The costs of policing, the courts, corrections and 
parole are spread over all three levels of government. When they 
are combined they are staggering. In this age of fiscal restraint 
many governments have created user pay systems. It is time to 
do the same with the criminal justice system: make the criminals 
pay.
<P>
	If the government is serious about strengthening the laws to 
better protect society, it has to accept two basic concepts: first, 
that the protection of society has a higher priority than the rights 
of the criminal and, second, that the rights of a victim come 
before the rights of a criminal.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	This philosophy has to be the guiding principle behind the 
drafting of any new criminal legislation or the amending of 
current legislation. Without this recognition any effort to 
combat crime and violence will fail. The problems we have with 
crime today are not due to a lack of legislation. The problems 
stem from a principle that places the rights of the criminal above 
all else.
<P>
	The Charter of Rights and Freedoms has dramatically tilted 
the scales of justice in favour of the offender. The legal 
profession has created an industry from charter arguments in 
criminal cases. While this industry may be profitable for the 
legal profession, it has done nothing to protect the rights and 
security of society. Criminals are now routinely acquitted 
because of technicalities raised in charter arguments. How does 
this protect the average citizen?
<P>
	In effect the charter has given the criminals more latitude. 
Recent court decisions have outlawed non-threatening police 
procedures such as one party consent recordings and the placing 
of an undercover police officer in a jail cell with an offender. 
These decisions and numerous similar ones have made it 
tougher for the police and easier for the criminals. They have 
given constitutional protection to the rights of the criminals that 
have done little if anything to protect society as a whole.
<P>
	The charter of rights also guarantees Canadians the right to 
life, liberty and security of the person. Yet each and every day 
Canadians are deprived of these rights by the criminal element 
in our society.
<P>
	Ordinary Canadians deserve to have their rights protected 
more than the criminals do. Those Canadians victimized by a 
crime deserve to have their rights considered as well. It may take 
a constitutional amendment at some point but we have to make it 
clear that when the rights of victims are in direct conflict with 
the rights of criminals, the rights of victims must prevail.
<P>
	I believe that the majority of Canadians can accept the 
premise that criminals should lose some of their rights on 
conviction. Poll after poll shows that Canadians feel less secure 
in their own communities now than ever before. We must change 
this perception. We have to make it abundantly clear to 
Canadians that their protection is the main priority of our 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	It is easy to criticize, it is more difficult to provide a 
construction alternative. As always my party is prepared to 
present such an alternative. The first thing we have to do is pass 
legislation that gives the victims of crime legal standing in court 
proceedings and parole hearings.
<P>
	These changes do not infringe on the rights of the criminal but 
rather provide the court with a clear picture of the result of 
criminal activity. I would like to think that in many cases, 
especially those involving young offenders, it would be 
beneficial for them to hear what the results of their actions are. 
Even in the case of a simple break and enter, the offender should 
have to listen to the sense of violation the victim feels. If 
criminals still have a conscience maybe they can accept the fact 
that their activity has hurt another person and that it is not just a 
matter of insurance companies replacing stolen property.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2399"> 2399 </A></B>
<P>
	In more serious crimes, it is important for judges and juries 
to hear the extent of pain and suffering that is being brought 
on the victim and the victim's family.
<P>
	While some may argue that this is already in place, my 
response is that while the victim impact statements are no longer 
rare, they are still at the discretion of the court. We need to pass 
legislation that gives the victim legal standing in the process.
<P>
	Likewise, the same legal standing needs to be provided to the 
victims in parole hearings. Presently the victim can attend these 
hearings but their participation, if any, is at the discretion of 
parole board members. While the parole board members should 
hear how the criminal has done since his incarceration, they 
should also hear about the effect that crime had on the victim.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	The second major initiative of the House should be to pass 
legislation that makes the criminal financially accountable for 
his crime. Once an individual is convicted, there should 
automatically be a restitution order against the criminal. The 
criminal should have to make restitution to the greatest extent 
possible.
<P>
	Obviously there will be cases in which the accused has no 
hope of ever repaying the entire debt. However if they were 
required to pay a certain percentage of their income in 
restitution, there would be that constant reminder of their 
criminal activity.
<P>
	Even if criminals are sentenced to a correctional facility and 
their institutional income is minimal, they should still be 
required to relinquish a portion of that amount taken in a token 
bid of restitution. No matter how small the amount is, they 
should have that reminder of accountability.
<P>
	At the other end of the scale there are individuals who have 
been involved in very profitable criminal activity. The illicit 
drug trade and some commercial crimes are prime examples. 
Restitution for their crime should go beyond the immediate 
offence of which they are convicted. While there is legislation in 
place to deal with the profits of crime, it has not been enjoying 
the success that it should.
<P>
	Convicted drug dealers and other well to do criminals should 
have all their assets seized that are derived from the drug trade 
or other criminal enterprise. While it would be almost 
impossible to compensate all the victims of a major drug dealer 
there should be a formula devised to allocate funds among law 
enforcement agencies, correctional facilities and a general 
victim compensation fund.
<P>
	A few large seizures would go a long way in subsidizing the 
losses of victims who would have little chance to otherwise 
receive restitution.
<P>
	Mandatory financial restitution will in the long term serve 
two important functions. First it will provide the victims with 
some financial compensation. If the victim can be made to feel 
less victimized by this action then that in itself makes the action 
worthwhile.
<P>
	Second, restitution may bring a greater sense of 
accountability to the offender. If criminals are compelled to give 
up some of their income to compensate their victims maybe they 
will finally get the message that crime does not pay.
<P>
	These two initiatives are a beginning that is long overdue. We 
can no longer ignore the fact that the criminal justice system 
must officially recognize the victims of crime. It will be a 
significant step in showing Canadians that Parliament is 
prepared to make definitive changes to the system.
<P>
	It is difficult for any of us to ignore a petition that carries two 
and a half million signatures. The public is demanding change 
and it is demanding protection. Anyone who ignores this cry 
does so at his or her own peril.
<P>
	While I have a lot of respect and admiration for CAVEAT and 
other victims' rights groups it is a shame that these groups have 
to be created. The most inspiring leaders of these organizations 
have invariably been parents who have lost their children to 
violent crime. It is tragic that so many parents are in this 
position. I would like to think we could take some action so that 
their numbers do not expand in the years to come.
<P>
	In my response to the speech from the throne I mentioned that 
I had already spoken to parents of two murder victims. I now 
have spoken to the parents of three murder victims. It does not 
get any easier. As a parent I can imagine how difficult it would 
be to lose a child. The pain these parents feel is even greater 
knowing they have lost a child as a murder victim.
<P>
	We need to take whatever steps we can to ensure that fewer 
parents experience this pain. My caucus colleagues are 
dedicated to bringing justice reforms to fruition. I have also 
been encouraged by some of the comments and private 
members' bills from the government side of the House.
<P>
	I hope that members of all parties can get together to pass 
legislation to provide society with the protection it deserves. I 
do not imagine that many of us think it is necessary to cater to 
the criminal lobby. While I would like to think that the 
protection of society is a goal that all parties would strive for, I 
have yet to see any such commitment from the government.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	We have received vague promises of new legislation to deal 
with violence against women and children, yet violence against 
women, children and men for that matter is already illegal. What 
we do need is a change in philosophy. It can start with the 
recognition of victims' rights. If the government fails to recog-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2400"> 2400 </A></B>
<P>
nize these rights it  is telling society that victims should remain 
unseen and unheard.
<P>
	Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to stand in the 
House and congratulate the government for bringing in 
legislation that recognizes the rights of victims and takes 
precedence over the rights of criminals.
<P>
	I see no indication that the government is prepared to take 
such a step. That is why I stand in the House today to condemn 
the government for its inaction with regard to the reform of the 
criminal justice system, in particular for its allowance of the 
rights of criminals to supersede those of the victims.

that exist already. However, the law is enforced by men and 
women who use their own intellectual capabilities, limits and 
ways of tackling and understanding problems so that there is no 
consistency in the way it is done. As several of the member's 
suggestions are already in place, maybe we should do more 
education and ask judges to enforce legislation in a more 
consistent manner; I will come back to that when I have the floor 
later on.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the member concerns what 
could be done about the points she raised and particularly about 
the compensation she proposed be given to victims.
<P>
	If we examine the case of persons sentenced to prison or what 
have you, in most instances these people live on welfare or have 
hidden whatever they own and have nothing to their name.
<P>
	In such cases, should we restore prison sentences for civil 
debts? If so, would the member not agree that this would be like 
going the clock back two centuries? If not, who will compensate 
victims as she proposed before?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, we recognize that our prisons 
have some of the wrong people in them, people who are 
imprisoned because of their financial situation, because they 
cannot afford a good lawyer, because they have done petty crime 
due to their financial situation. We have to recognize that there 
is a better way of dealing with those people rather than throwing 
them into a prison system.
<P>
	As a parent I know that when my children damage something, 
I expect them to use part of their allowance, not necessarily all 
of it, to reinforce that what they have done is not acceptable.
<P>
	If the people who are getting minimum payment in prison for 
jobs have to give a small portion of that amount to the victim or 
into a fund that would go toward victims' restitution, they would 
be constantly reminded that what they did was not acceptable. It 
does not have to be a large amount but it is a constant reminder 
that  there are things in society that are acceptable and things 
that are not.
<P>
	I think the message is more likely to get through to the 
individuals so they do not offend again if we treat them in that 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the 
opportunity the hon. member's motion presents for us to discuss 
in the House today the important question of Canada's criminal 
justice system and the various issues that arise with respect to 
the competing values we seek to serve in the criminal courts.
<P>
	Let me acknowledge at the outset that this government and 
this minister recognize we have no monopoly on wisdom or 
insight. We welcome constructive suggestions from any quarter 
of this House. We will pay close attention today to those 
suggestions and proposals that come from members of all 
parties as we address this issue.
<P>
	Let me also make clear at the outset that I fundamentally 
reject two aspects of the motion the hon. member has put before 
the House. First there is her suggestion of inaction on the part of 
the government and I shall come in a few moments to the 
concrete and specific proposals we intend to implement. Second 
is her suggestion that our system has allowed the rights of the 
criminal to supersede the rights of the victim.
<P>
	It is suggested by the hon. member there might be some 
prospect of catering to the criminal lobby. Her submission today 
is suffused with the notion that criminals are running rampant in 
our criminal justice system and that victims' rights are being 
subjugated.
<P>
	What goes on in this country's criminal courts day by day, 
hour by hour is the prosecution of crime in accordance with the 
fundamental values of Canadian society. We reject torture as a 
manner of extracting confessions. We reject fraud as a way of 
putting proof before the court.
<P>
	We hold in this country that in the enforcement of our laws as 
with everything else government does there are standards of 
decency, of integrity and of fairness which must prevail. In 
every court case, in every courthouse in this country day by day 
and prosecution by prosecution the issue is whether the state can 
prove against an accused person criminal wrongdoing in 
accordance with those standards of integrity and fairness.
<P>
	Since the enactment of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
that process has become all the more exacting. It also reflects 
what the Canadian people expect of their system: that people 
will not be unfairly accused; that only evidence which is fairly 
obtained will be tendered to establish their guilt; that the 
appropriate test of reasonable doubt will be used in establishing 
whether the person is to be convicted; and that proper principles 
will be put into play in determining the appropriate sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2401"> 2401 </A></B>
<P>
	If one stands back and looks at that system, if one looks at 
this case or that, it is altogether possible and indeed relatively 
easy to find instances that can be used to support an argument 
that in a given case a certain victim was not given appropriate 
consideration or there is a disproportion between the sentence 
that was imposed and the gravity of the offence.
<P>
	We must not mistake in this House a commitment to 
fundamental fairness and integrity in the justice system for 
catering to the criminal lobby. It is an unfair and inaccurate way 
to characterize the exercise. I reject it at the outset.
<P>
	May I also express a word of caution about basing criticisms 
of the entire criminal justice system on reactions to our natural 
horror at certain specific crimes. We must not forget that 90 per 
cent of all reported crime in this country is non-violent and the 
vast majority of that is property crime. That is not to say that 
property crime is not serious, but I wish to put the issues here 
into a perspective that the facts afford.
<P>
	In 1991 the homicide rate in this country was 2.82 per 100,000 
of population; in the United States of America it is four times 
higher. The proportion of violent crime involving firearms has 
been decreasing over the last 10 years. In 1975 firearms were 
used in 42 per cent of all robberies. In 1991 it was only 27 per 
cent, a reflection in my respectful view of the effectiveness of 
gun control legislation in this country.
<P>
	In 1991 there were 59,000 drug offences in this country, a 21 
per cent decrease from 1981.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	In the 10 years between 1982 and 1992 the Criminal Code 
crime rate increased an average of 1.5 per cent per year. 
Compared with every other civilized country that is a modest 
increase in all the social circumstances and with all the social 
change we have experienced in this country.
<P>
	Any crime is too much crime, but I ask the hon. member and 
all members of the House to keep this discussion in the context 
of the facts of the Canadian experience.
<P>
	Let me turn to the steps that have been taken and are being 
taken by this government to address the needed improvements in 
the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system is not 
good enough. There is room for improvement. We intend to take 
steps in good faith to improve it.
<P>
	Before doing that let me touch upon the rising prominence in 
recent years of the role of the victim in the justice system and the 
sensitivity which the system shows to victims as it goes about its 
difficult business.
<P>
	In 1988 a statement of basic principles of justice for victims 
of crime was endorsed by the federal government and the 
provincial and territorial governments. This document serves as 
a guide for all of those governments in dealing with victims of 
crime.
<P>
	Many provinces along with the federal government have 
enacted legislation to reflect those principles. The Criminal 
Code has a number of provisions now relating to victims' rights. 
There are sections dealing with the identification and prompt 
return of stolen property; protection of the identity of witnesses 
or victims in certain offences including sexual offences and 
extortion; the imposition of a victim fine surcharge at 
sentencing, which was expected to raise $11 million last year; 
the use of victim impact statements at the time of sentencing. 
These and other measures have ensured that the focus is indeed 
on the victim.
<P>
	May I observe that when the crown attorney walks into the 
courtroom to present the evidence against the accused person, 
while the crown attorney represents the interest of the state, 
implicit in the presentation of the evidence and the prosecution 
is the interest of the victim as well.
<P>
	What is it that this government will do in an effort to improve 
the criminal justice system in Canada? We recognize that the 
criminal justice system alone will not succeed in dealing with 
crime and its consequences in Canada. We recognize that we 
need both an effective criminal justice system and a broad 
holistic and integrated approach by all departments of 
government for crime prevention objectives.
<P>
	I speak here not of vague promises, as the hon. member has 
suggested. I speak of concrete proposals for action. Let me come 
to them now. One aspect has to do with ensuring that the laws on 
the books are effective and can be enforced effectively.
<P>
	Turning to the Young Offenders Act, I have already made 
clear that we intend to take two steps. The first step is to 
introduce in the short term a bill that will propose specific 
changes in the Young Offenders Act to make what we regard as 
improvements, including longer maximum sentences for serious 
crimes of violence and more sharing of information about 
offenders with community groups, school boards and others 
where community safety requires.
<P>
	After my meeting next week with my provincial and 
territorial colleagues and ministers of justice I will bring 
forward a specific bill reflecting the approach of this 
government for needed changes in the act in the short term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2402"> 2402 </A></B>
<P>
	The second step is I will ask the House to turn the statute 
in its entirety over to a committee of Parliament so that a 
thorough review can be made of the Young Offenders Act in 
this, the 10th year of its life.
<P>
	That committee can hear the views of Canadians. It can listen 
to victims' groups, police officers, offenders, criminologists, 
sociologists and others who will speak of their experience over 
the last decade with the act. In my belief they will demonstrate 
that the act substantially has been a success and that in principle 
it is the right approach. I am certain improvements are needed 
but I am equally certain this process will result in a confirmation 
of the enlightened approach which the Young Offenders Act 
contemplates.
<P>
	This government will also undertake to introduce changes in 
the Criminal Code with respect to sentencing. This will be done 
to restate the broad and comprehensive purposes of sentencing, 
to put the focus on intermediate sanctions, to stress restitution 
and non-custodial sentences and to deal as well with the issue of 
dangerous offenders.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	We will deal with part 24 of the Criminal Code to ensure we 
are dealing as effectively as we can with those persons who are 
provided for in that part. We will deal with high risk offenders, 
those persons who may come to the end of their term of 
incarceration but who may not be safe to release back into 
society.
<P>
	Another specific proposal this government will put before the 
House will deal with pimps and the serious problem in many 
Canadian cities of heartless individuals who exploit the bodies 
of children for commercial gain.
<P>
	We will address the issue of violence against women. The fact 
is that domestic violence in this country and particularly 
violence against women is a national scourge. Statistics released 
just this morning confirm its seriousness and its extent. We will 
take steps in this House through legislation to deal with that 
matter, including more stringent provisions with respect to 
peace bonds which are often used in such cases, steps to remove 
the abuser from the home, and funds for shelters for spouses who 
are victims of abuse.
<P>
	We shall deal as well with gun control to make it more 
effective, including measures to counter illegal importation.
<P>
	Let me turn briefly to the second part of the government's 
approach to the criminal justice system. That is to recognize that 
the justice ministry alone cannot resolve the problem of crime 
and its consequences in Canadian society.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has asked me to co-ordinate the efforts of 
nine ministries of the federal government to deal with the issue 
of violence in Canadian society generally. I have met with my 
eight colleagues to begin that work. I met with the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women, the Minister of Health, the 
Minister of  Indian and Northern Development, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. Each of us in our own way has a part of 
governmental jurisdiction or responsibility that deals with 
violence in Canadian society.
<P>
	Surely this comprehensive and integrated approach is exactly 
what the all party Horner committee recommended when it 
called upon government to develop a holistic strategy for 
dealing with crime.
<P>
	The strategy should recognize the causes of crime. It should 
recognize the role of poverty, of racial intolerance and the role 
of family breakdown and of domestic violence itself. There is 
also the role of the parent who no longer accepts responsibility 
in providing standards for children. It must also recognize that 
sometimes whether a child has a hot meal has as much to do with 
crime prevention as putting a police officer on the beat.
<P>
	It must also recognize that the work being done by my 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, in 
modernizing and making more effective the social programs of 
this country has just as much to do with crime prevention as the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	I travelled across this country and discussed this matter with 
chiefs of police, school board trustees, civic officials, worried 
parents and troubled teenagers, victims groups. I discussed it 
with parents of murdered children, community groups and the 
John Howard and Elizabeth Fry societies.
<P>
	I have come to the conclusion that there is in Canada an 
enormous energy of enthusiasm at the local and community 
level toward crime prevention and addressing the underlying 
causes of the kind of behaviour we are talking about in this 
House today.
<P>
	As I spoke to those individuals in Moncton and Fredericton, 
here in Ottawa, in my own riding of Etobicoke, in Edmonton and 
Vancouver, I found that among the police departments and 
community groups and the parents there is an energy waiting to 
be tapped. Local initiatives are now being taken, many of which 
are very successful.
<P>
	In Edmonton, for example, the strategy for community 
policing and making Edmonton a safer city has over the last 18 
months resulted in a 26 per cent reduction in the crime rate, an 
extraordinary result. Imagine the savings in terms of 
government dollars let alone human suffering with a drop of 26 
per cent in the crime rate. If we could replicate that experience 
nationally, there would be no need for a debate such as we have 
in this House today.
<P>
	That must be our goal. This government is committed to 
creating a national crime prevention strategy. We will establish 
a national crime prevention council. Through that process we 
will bring together, we will harness and focus the energy and the 
commitment of which I spoke which is evident in so many 
communities across Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2403"> 2403 </A></B>
<P>
	We will recognize formally and effectively that if we are to 
do something about crime instead of simply talking about it, 
the answer lies not in simply putting more police on the streets 
and more guns in their hands nor in harsher sentences and more 
prisons. If that was the answer the United States of America 
would today be nirvana. That is not the answer.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Certainly we must deal effectively through criminal law with 
criminal conduct. That is why we are going to have the changes 
to which I referred earlier in the code and in statutes. Equally 
and at the same time we must mobilize an offensive toward 
crime prevention in this country that will truly produce results.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council will bring together 
those groups, those individuals, those interests, victims groups 
included, from across this country to a central place which will 
serve as a focus of leadership in this effort, a repository of 
information, an inventory of what is being done in various 
places across Canada, a source of advice for neighbourhoods, 
communities and cities that want to take action, and also a 
mechanism for innovative and constructive thinking as to what 
we can do in Canada to bring down the crime rate and address the 
causes of crime.
<P>
	Today in my response to this motion I reject absolutely the 
premises upon which it is based. First of all, this government 
does not propose inaction-quite the contrary. We will in the 
months to come be putting specific proposals before this House 
in respect of legislative change and we will be actively pursuing 
the objectives of which I spoke across the country for crime 
prevention.
<P>
	I reject as well the contention that criminals' rights supersede 
those of the victims. The system as it is at present is sensitive to 
victims' rights. That is shown in a variety of ways.
<P>
	There is room for improvement and, as I said at the outset, we 
are happy to have the constructive suggestions of members in all 
parts of this House. I look forward to the debate which this 
motion has begun today. I shall listen with interest to the points 
made by members of the House and I assure the House that this 
government is going to move quickly to implement the agenda 
of which I spoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for his statement. It is certainly one in which many 
Canadians are interested. They definitely want to see things 
change in this whole area.
<P>
	Will the minister clarify a point in reference to the support 
mechanisms for victims when comparing what is in place 
already for the offenders.
<P>
	An individual will commit a crime and immediately he has 
various people coming to his aid. In fact, he need not even ask. 
First, he has legal aid and he is represented at the expense of the 
taxpayer by a lawyer. He has  counselling at his disposal. He is 
placed in a system of incarceration that looks after his every 
need, health needs included. He has rehabilitation programs 
offered to him which he has no requirement really to follow 
through on. There is in effect little or no punishment other than 
the fact that he is removed from society and cannot move about 
with any degree of freedom, until he is placed on parole.
<P>
	Before the end of his sentence of course he is eligible for 
parole. The Parole Board gives every consideration to him and 
little consideration of the effect of his presence in society after 
that decision is made. Again, I am referring to the view that 
many people in society have of the parole department.
<P>
	As of late, several Supreme Court rulings have further 
jeopardized society, creating more victims, due to the fact that 
they have ruled on cases that have actually inhibited 
investigators from effectively doing their jobs.
<P>
	My question to the minister is where are the forces, the 
established agencies, you might say, rushing to the aid of 
victims when in fact everything is moving in the opposite 
direction?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Simply put, Mr. Speaker, there are not enough. We 
have to do better to deal with the victim, to provide that person 
with a sensitive and effective way of overcoming the trauma of 
crime and its consequences.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time the point that my friend makes is surely 
rhetorical. With regard to the characterization of the cushy 
experience for the offender, the free legal aid, the counselling 
and the rehabilitation, there is a fairer way to characterize that. 
In my response to the member please let me try.
<P>
	First, aid is nothing more than a recognition by society that 
those who are charged with an offence which might result in 
their incarceration are entitled if they cannot afford it 
themselves to make full answer and defence to the charge 
against them. I would not take my friend, the hon. member, as 
suggesting that we deny that. I hope not.
<P>
	It is fundamental in our society that if the powers of the state, 
the mechanisms of the police with all their investigative powers, 
the prosecuting authorities with all their resources and the 
power and majesty of the court itself are being brought to bear 
against an individual who might be put away as a result of the 
charge, and it is part of the values of this society that we are 
going to furnish that person with legal representation to answer 
the charge in that circumstance through legal aid if they cannot 
afford it.
<P>
	Second, my friend referred to counselling and rehabilitation. 
In the criminal justice system we try to achieve a number of 
things at the same time. Yes, we try for retribution when we can. 
We try always for fairness in our process and justice in the 
outcome but we also try for rehabilitation because it has been 
recognized throughout that unless we take the offenders and 
make  an effort to turn them around through counselling if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2404"> 2404 </A></B>
<P>
necessary, through rehabilitation if necessary, it is more than 
likely that they will be back again.
<P>
	If we can reduce that prospect and the financial and human 
cost that it involves through an investment in rehabilitation then 
that is the wiser course. I do not take my hon. friend, the hon. 
member, as suggesting that we abandon that as one of our 
responses to crime.
<P>
	In terms of prisons themselves they must be humane. 
Obviously we are revoking the person's liberty. The last time I 
visited it did not seem to be a terribly comfortable environment. 
Often it is terribly uncomfortable. Prisons reflect the values that 
we have as a country. We incarcerate. Our purpose is not to 
torture.
<P>
	In terms of parole, the system expressly falls upon the parole 
authorities to take into account all circumstances, including the 
victim and the offence itself. I can assure the hon. member that 
is exactly what happens in parole hearings from day to day.
<P>
	Are we doing enough for victims of crime? We are not. We 
must make every effort to be responsive to their needs and to 
ensure that their perspective is brought to bear throughout the 
system. At the same time I suggest that there is a balancing as in 
everything else in life. At present matters are roughly in 
balance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the minister for sharing with us once 
again his views on the present legal and judicial system. I can 
even say that I share the views he espoused in his 
``philosophical'' speech because it touched on broad principles.
<P>
	However, it remains to be seen whether I will still agree with 
him after he has put forward the amendments he has in mind. In 
light of the speech that I just heard, I would ask the minister to 
proceed with caution, as he seems to want to get involved with 
local problems that fall under provincial jurisdiction. The 
minister should take care not to always present bills with a 
national flavour, as he seems to want to do, because some of 
Quebec's laws could contradict what he is proposing. Quebec is 
feeling pressed on certain issues that were raised by the 
minister.
<P>
	My question is very concrete. The problem with the motion 
presented by the Reform Party is primarily one of public 
perception. In the red book, the government referred to the fact 
that public perception was very negative, particularly in terms 
of how battered women and children are treated by the justice 
system.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	In its red book, the government made an undertaking to 
provide or increase funding for agencies that assist battered 
women and their children. In my view, this would, be one way of 
showing the public that the system does in fact consider the 
rights of victims and not merely those of criminals.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us what additional funding was allocated 
to these agencies in the last budget and how these agencies plan 
to use the funds?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, if there are specific programs or steps 
in place in the province of Quebec that touch upon the issues I 
have covered in my speech, I would be happy if the hon. member 
would let me have the particulars. I am not sure what programs 
in particular he is referring to, but I would be happy to give my 
assurance to work in collaboration with local authorities as we 
will across the country.
<P>
	I recognize that crime prevention in particular will only work 
if it is driven at the local and community levels. It is for that 
reason that the municipalities and community groups are going 
to have a role of prominence in crime prevention.
<P>
	The federal role must surely be one of leadership and 
co-ordination. This is the approach we are going to take, 
enabling communities across the country to work together.
<P>
	The hon. member asked about funding for shelters and 
transition houses for spouses who are abused. Even in this 
fiscally challenging time this government is going to stand by 
the commitment it made in the campaign to provide that 
additional funding.
<P>
	I do not have dollar amounts which I can give the hon. 
member today. I can say how it will be spent will be determined 
in consultation with the provinces and the local authorities and 
community groups which may know best how most value can be 
received for the money.
<P>
	I do not have the dollar amounts at this point but I can tell the 
hon. member the commitment remains and as to where the 
money will go we will determine that in consultation with the 
groups we intend to benefit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try 
to make my statement very quickly.
<P>
	Nobody on this side of the House including myself disagrees 
for a moment that prevention has to have a high priority in our 
system of dealing with people, particularly when it comes to 
crime.
<P>
	I want to get down to the grass roots, down to the level of 
things. How is this government finally going to answer? I say 
finally because I have been involved in this since the early 1970s 
and even before when I was mayor of a town and crime was a 
serious problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2405"> 2405 </A></B>
<P>
	I am thinking particularly of violent crime. When is the 
government going to come forward with something for the 
seniors I talked to on a radio talk show in Calgary, which is 
certainly not a renowned city of crime in comparison with 
others, who say they are scared to death. One lady said she lives 
alone with her cat and she is scared to death every night that 
somebody is going to tear her door down, bash her head in and 
steal all her belongings. They live in fear.
<P>
	In rural communities you see bars on the stores and on private 
homes. Law-abiding citizens lock themselves in to try to protect 
themselves from what is on the street on the loose.
<P>
	During the lifetime of this 35th Parliament, we are going to 
have 80 parole hearings. My research shows 80.
<P>
	If we have a record like we have had in the past I fear for a lot 
of people. Our research has already provided approximately 40 
names of people who have been released on parole who have 
killed a high number of people. One of those persons who got out 
of jail said before he killed four other people: ``The only thing 
crazier than me is a system that allows me to get on the street and 
do what I did''.
<P>
	We hear this from the criminals themselves. We hear it from 
the victims. When is the government going to quit the rhetoric 
and get down to the grassroots, talk to the people who are 
suffering and listen to what the victims of violence are saying 
and do something about their causes and concerns?
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Time is almost up. Please be brief in 
your reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I will be brief, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member says 
that he has been involved in this for 20 years. I respect his 
experience, but I predict that we are going to be involved in this 
for a lot longer than 20 years to come. It is part of the human 
condition.
<P>
	We are going to do our level best to balance the interest we 
have been talking about. So far as fear is concerned, I am aware 
of the fear to which the hon. member refers. One thing we must 
be careful not to do is feed into or amplify those fears if they are 
disproportionate to the reality.
<P>
	The unkindest thing we can do to the senior citizens to whom 
the hon. member referred is to play on those fears, to make them 
worse by suggesting that the problem is worse than it really is, 
that the challenge is greater than it really is.
<P>
	Of course we have a challenge in front of us, but let us keep it 
in perspective. As I said earlier concerning high risk offenders 
in the parole system, we recognize that changes have to be made. 
We have to take the person at the end of the sentence and 
examine them to determine whether they are fit to be returned to 
society. If they are not, we have to find a way of working with 
the health system to keep them confined for our own protection.
<P>
	Next week when I meet with my colleagues in the provinces I 
will be talking about that, among other things. We cannot do it 
alone. We will do it in concert with them. I am very aware of the 
problem and we will address it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion put forward by the Reform Party is not a 
simple one. If we are not careful, it could foster an ideology 
which is not in agreement with who we are as Canadians and 
Quebecers. What this motion calls for is not approval or 
disapproval, but a thorough review of the current system.
<P>
	In my legal practice, I sometimes heard people say, in a fit of 
anger over a gross injustice in a court of law or an irrational 
judgement on the part of a judge, that the legal and judicial 
system protects criminals better than victims.
<P>
	Let us not jump too quickly to that conclusion. Many 
extraneous factors, factors outside the legal system, can 
influence a sentence, a release, the judgement of a lenient judge 
and even-and we hear of it happening more and more on the 
news-of a dissident judge or one advocating reform.
<P>
	We must, however, look at the means at the disposal of the 
judicial branch to enforce the legislation that we legislators pass 
in this House. For example-and I shall be brief since I have 
only 20 minutes-how can a judge send a first-time offender to 
jail, knowing that our penitentiaries are overcrowded? If the 
judge finds in favour of the Crown and the victim, the offender 
will indeed be sentenced to imprisonment. But he will soon be 
discharged, conditionally. It happens all the time.
<P>
	When faced with this kind of judgement or finding, people 
dealing with the judicial system are always left to wonder. But 
the judge has no other choice.
<P>
	For years now, there has been a general consensus that 
violence can take many forms. This is not to say that our society 
is necessarily more violent than others on the whole, but rather 
that we are better at recognizing violence and its various 
manifestations and at doing so more quickly. There has always 
been violence. It is just that we talk about it more today. Victims 
are less intimidated by the system and come forward more 
freely, but violence in itself is nothing new.
<P>
	The question we have to ask ourselves is this: Do the rights of 
criminals supersede those of the victim in the present legal 
framework? If so, what can the government do to correct the 
situation?
<P>
	I think that this issue involves competiting rights between 
victims and criminals and the two members who spoke earlier 
really put their finger on it. Both Quebec and Canada have 
passed legislation that brings out this duality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2406"> 2406 </A></B>
<P>
	However, discrepancies between the rights of the parties to 
a criminal case have existed for a very long time, since the 
Quebec Act of 1774 clearly addressed these concerns by 
introducing British criminal law to Canada. Section XI of this 
act reads in part as follows: ``And whereas the Certainty and 
Lenity of the Criminal Law of England, and the Benefits and 
Advantages resulting from the Use of it, have been sensibly felt 
by the Inhabitants, from an Experience of more than nine Years 
[-]shall continue to be [-]observed as Law in the Province 
of Quebec, as well in the Description and Quality of the Offence 
as in the Method of Prosecution and Trial; and the Punishments 
and Forfeitures thereby inflicted-''
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	We must not forget that they had capital punishment back then 
and that the victim's only consolation was the condemned 
person's last breath.
<P>
	That said, we must define the issue raised and, in order to 
resolve it as clearly as possible, we must first determine if this 
finding is justified and true, or quite simply false in legal and 
social terms.
<P>
	What in our current system could help us weigh the pros and 
cons without being swayed by feelings and sensational cases 
that quickly stir up the emotions?
<P>
	Daily newspapers emphasize the system's failures rather than 
its successes. The press usually focuses on the negative and that 
is what readers remember.
<P>
	It must be said that, in recent decades, our society and 
therefore our legislation have quietly put a particular 
emphasis-I am not saying that everything is just rosy and that 
there is nothing left for us to do-on the victims of crime, at the 
urging of federal and provincial lawmakers.
<P>
	The laws of Quebec and several other provinces that deal with 
the victims of crime are a striking example.
<P>
	We must also be honest and mention that the Criminal Code 
contains provisions aimed at helping crime victims. There are 
for instance the provisions on the identification of criminals and 
the restitution of stolen goods. An hon. member said earlier that 
there should be such provisions, but I think they already are in 
the Criminal Code. We would only have to enforce them. We 
should urge the courts to enforce the current legislation 
designed to protect witnesses who testify and to award 
exemplary damages or impose fine surcharges-this principle 
still exists today. Do the courts apply the law in all cases? That 
remains to be seen.
<P>
	Legislators are not here to make laws for the sake of it because 
they could make a lot that would never be enforced. I think there 
is a principle that legislators do not act frivolously. If they make 
changes, it is to make things better and not to leave everything 
up to a court that would not enforce them anyway.
<P>
	Is this not enough for victims? Perhaps, but we should not 
endanger the whole legal system by trying to correct an age-old 
duality.
<P>
	Another argument in favour of balancing rights between the 
victim and the criminal is the release on bail of the accused. It 
may be where we see an increasing number of reports in the 
press, which has a field day whenever a judge makes a wrong 
assessment. Again, society gets a negative impression of the 
legal system.
<P>
	Under the Criminal Code's general rules, the police officer 
responsible for the temporary detention of a person charged with 
an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of five 
years must release this person, unless he has reason to believe 
that it is necessary in the public interest or to ensure that the 
accused will show up for the trial.
<P>
	Of course, the decision to release the accused is left to a 
justice of the peace. As the legal evaluation criteria are very 
complex, I will not go into them in this debate. One thing is for 
certain: a presumably impartial judge-and I think it is true in 
major cases-looks at the facts before deciding to release the 
accused.
<P>
	In some cases, in particular in murder and hard-drug 
trafficking cases, it is up to the accused to prove that he should 
not be detained while waiting for his trial. In both cases, there is 
a major reversal of the burden of proof that somehow helps make 
the victim more secure.
<P>
	The current code also requires the judge to issue a firearms 
prohibition order for anyone released on bail who is charged 
with an offence involving actual, threatened or attempted 
violence. In many cases, the judge will also ask for a 
commitment not to disturb the peace.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the judge can ask any accused person to make 
certain commitments and you will say that in many cases they 
are not respected. What little experience I have, although I am 
not a criminal lawyer, shows me that in most cases, people who 
are released under certain conditions respect them. We do not 
see them in the newspapers, because what is interesting about 
knowing that someone obeys the law; it is much more 
interesting to know who does not obey it.
<P>
	You will tell me that is all very well on paper, but that in 
reality there are injustices and victims who are afraid, victims 
who are victims of the system. I must reply that unfortunately it 
is so. A perfect system where everyone would seem to win in a 
balanced legal system does not exist. The big problem in this 
question of justice between the victim and the criminal is, I 
think, one of society's perception.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2407"> 2407 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, the verbal excesses of some judges have damaged the 
esteem in which the present legal system is held. Fortunately, 
these verbal excesses are condemned by scathing criticism from 
society and by the peers of those who commit these excesses. 
Legal cases which make it to the front pages of the newspapers 
are not necessarily typical of everyday reality. These articles 
contribute to the mistaken opinion people have of justice.
<P>
	I think that the observation we are considering does indeed 
reflect society's perception, but it should be qualified from the 
legal point of view. To show why I am saying this, we must refer 
to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I wish to 
remind this House that this charter is the same one that Quebec 
did not have the privilege to endorse when the Constitution was 
unilaterally repatriated in 1982, as the present Prime Minister 
surely recalls. So I am in a special position to criticize it.
<P>
	Let us look for a moment at some provisions of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms regarding the rights and legal 
guarantees of individuals and of criminals. We are told that the 
Charter is the highest law in trials and in the legal system, so let 
us look at what this charter provides both for criminals and for 
victims.
<P>
	Section 7 says: ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and 
security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice.'' Section 8 gives ``everyone the right to be secure 
against unreasonable search or seizure.'' Section 9 says: 
``Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or 
imprisoned.'' Section 10 says: ``Everyone has the right on arrest 
or detention (<I>a</I>) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; 
(<I>b</I>) to retain and instruct counsel without delay -and (<I>c</I>) to have 
the validity of the detention determined by way of <I>habeas 
corpus</I>.''
<P>
	In any case, I thought on reading these sections that everyone, 
criminal or victim, is indeed protected by law. Nevertheless, the 
legislators felt the need to insert additional sections on the rights 
of an accused person. That is the whole series of section 11 of 
this charter, where it says that ``any person charged with an 
offence has the right to be informed without unreasonable delay 
of the specific offence'' -I thought this redundant, given the 
previous sections-to be tried within a reasonable time, not to 
be compelled to testify against himself, to be presumed innocent 
until proven guilty, not to be denied bail without just cause, to 
the benefit of trial by jury, except in the case of an offence under 
military law tried before a military tribunal, not to be found 
guilty on account of any act or omission, if finally acquitted of 
the offence, not to be tried for it again, etc., etc.
<P>
	Section 11 adds several factors to what was already there for 
the accused.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I wanted to read this, even though the members of this House 
are well acquainted with the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, to highlight the existing imbalance, in my view, in a 
law which supposedly supersedes all others, between the rights 
of the accused, the criminal, and the rights of the victim.
<P>
	The Charter of Rights of which the Prime Minister is so proud 
clearly brings into focus our negative perception of the justice 
system. There is absolutely nothing in the Charter to protect the 
victim, to ensure that he or she benefits from the support of the 
state throughout the lengthy criminal justice process. And this 
process is very lengthy indeed. More money needs to be 
invested in this process. It is not legislation that is lacking. We 
need to allocate more funding to the administration of justice. It 
is not by enacting laws that we will strike a better balance 
between the rights of victims and of criminals.
<P>
	However, I think it should have been stated clearly in the 
Charter that victims' rights always take precedence over the 
rights of the accused, of criminals. Since no mention is made of 
the need for this kind of balance, those who come before the 
courts only hear about how the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms protects the accused, about how it is invoked to obtain 
the release of an accused person or to quash a ruling by a lower 
court which convicted a person, or how, as a result, the accused 
is released following a review on appeal.
<P>
	Quite often, at the appeal stage, the issue is not whether a 
crime was committed, but whether all of the provisions of the 
Charter were upheld. The victim ends up being the one who, 
quite often, suffers extreme prejudice. Using the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms as an example, we can easily demonstrate 
the apparent imbalance between the rights of the victim and 
those of the criminal.
<P>
	However, the public's generally negative perception of the 
system goes much deeper than its appreciation of a particular 
piece of legislation. That is why I believe in the justice system 
given to us by our ancestors. We must not call everything into 
question for the sake of achieving a punitive, excessive 
objective. We have to be rational and pursue efforts to 
modernize the system, while looking to education. A more 
highly educated society which understands its rights is a society 
that has a greater appreciation of its justice system.
<P>
	Since we know what the priorities of the Minister of Justice 
are in this 35th Parliament, and we heard them again in the 
House this morning, we will have an opportunity to get some 
messages across to him. We should seize this occasion to give 
greater importance to victims and, in the process, improve the 
perception that those who come before the courts have of our 
justice system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2408"> 2408 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, it would not necessarily be viable for Quebec 
and Canada to seek to improve the lot of victims solely at the 
expense of criminals. We should be focusing our energies on 
education, prevention and rehabilitation instead of on handing 
down heavier sentences to criminals. Does Canada want to 
become a totalitarian country insofar as the treatment of its 
criminals is concerned?
<P>
	The members on this side of the House would like to establish 
a sovereign country, one in which a fair balance will be struck 
between the rights of victims and the rights of criminals. In my 
opinion, this balance will not be achieved by pitting the rights of 
one party against those of another.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech, I 
appreciated his carefully prepared arguments, and I think he 
gave a very clear analysis of the situation.
<P>
	Certainly, individuals who commit violent crimes against 
women make us hate both the nature of the crime and the person 
who commits the crime. We must realize, however, that the 
proportion of such crimes is much smaller than you would think 
when you read the newspaper headlines and listen to the news, 
because we never talk about what is good and normal in society. 
When crimes are committed, they make the headlines and cause 
high levels of fear and anxiety, because these are very serious 
matters.
<P>
	Since my colleague, the Minister of Justice, has shown that he 
has an open mind on the matter and would appreciate the 
participation and collaboration of all members of the House to 
find out what they think and let them help us all make any 
necessary improvements, could the hon. member tell us what he 
sees as the most important initial step towards dealing with the 
situation?
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the people 
facing me were elected to govern and to draft legislation, and 
that they should do what they feel is useful and necessary, on the 
basis of their consultations and the principles outlined in their 
red book.
<P>
	I would say that in many respects, the changes being 
requested are unnecessary. Take the bill to amend the Narcotics 
Control Act and the Food and Drugs Act, which is before the 
House. We already have a Narcotics Control Act. The 
government wants to update and amend this legislation, but as 
was explained in the House, in some very obvious cases this 
legislation is not even enforced.
<P>
	We can pass as many bills as we want, but if the legislation we 
adopt is not enforced, if we do not have the political will to do 
so, what is the use? I say we should first look at what we already 
have and see if we can enforce those laws.
<P>
	Another item that will soon be before Parliament is the Young 
Offenders Act. I discussed this with judges on several occasions, 
and they said: Mr. Bellehumeur, the existing legislation is not 
even enforced. We could refer some young offenders to adult 
court but we do not, although we are allowed to do so under the 
Act.
<P>
	That is my question: why? Because the system does not give 
us the tools we need. Are we going to send a young offender to a 
prison for adults, where they learn more about crime than 
anything else? Judges prefer to hand out a minimum sentence 
and then release young offenders or make arrangements to have 
them supervised by someone who will help them get back on the 
right track.
<P>
	I think that before we consider extensive changes, we should 
look at the system we have now, and draw our own conclusions. 
Are these laws enforced? Do we give judges and the courts 
enough power to enforce them? Instead of extensive changes, 
perhaps we should improve the way this legislation is used.
<P>
	Even if the hon. member wished, I will not go into great detail 
about extensive federal amendments to Canadian laws. I simply 
want to say that we already have laws, and we should find out 
whether they are properly enforced.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for his comments. He 
explains the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and some of the 
problems in the charter very well, and also some of the laws that 
we have on our books.
<P>
	We have many laws on our books, but the frustration is that 
people perceive that the courts are not really carrying out the 
mandate they have been given.
<P>
	I would like to say too that while we disagree on a lot of things 
like debt and deficit and so on, if there is one issue we must get 
together on it is the issue of criminal justice reform and the need 
for it. We need to be co-operative about this thing, not 
confrontational.
<P>
	One of the problems people see is that the courts often hand 
out very light sentences for very serious crimes. For example, in 
the southern part of my riding very recently an elderly 
gentleman was lured out of his home and savagely killed. The 
main perpetrator of that crime received four years and will be 
getting out shortly on parole. People find it very unacceptable 
that this man committed a terrible murder and will be out in a 
very short time because of extenuating circumstances. But the 
courts have found him guilty. People find this a real problem. It 
is not that the laws are not there but it is perceived that many of 
these people are getting away with murder.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2409"> 2409 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I have a question that people have asked me to pass on. When 
these people are sentenced should they not lose some of their 
rights? For example, could these people not be put into work 
programs when they are in prison? The issue of restitution has 
been brought up. People feel that a percentage of the earnings of 
prisoners could possibly be used to compensate victims of 
crime. In this case, it was a terrible hardship for the wife when 
her husband was lured out of the home and killed. Work has a 
way of producing self-esteem and people very often feel this is 
something that is lacking and can have a very therapeutic effect.
<P>
	I wonder if maybe the hon. member would like to make some 
comments about the courts being part of the problem and not just 
our laws.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate should not be on 
specific cases or on a particularly disgusting crime. If you use a 
specific case where the victim went through hell and the 
sentence was relatively light, you will obviously come to the 
same conclusion as the Reform Party. But these cases are a 
minority and as long as our laws are implemented by judges who 
are human beings, there will be some personal appreciation 
involved in their decision, which can lead to differences, as I 
was saying earlier.
<P>
	As for the second part of the hon. member's question 
regarding the judge's comments, I think that a whole set of 
measures are already in place to compensate victims. I said 
earlier that in the case of stolen goods, I have seen judges 
sentence the guilty parties to return or repay the goods or even 
do community work. In Quebec, a whole series of measures are 
in place regarding community programs. But the problem is the 
follow-up. Indeed, the problem lie not in the legislation but 
rather in the means and how to deal with the whole issue.
<P>
	We could pass laws which, for example, would provide that 
for a specific offence, the offender would have to pay a certain 
amount. However, if that person is on welfare, or is so well 
organized that he or she does not own anything, what are we 
going to do? What are we going to seize to recover the 
equivalent of what was stolen? We will get into proceedings and 
we will go through trials just to save face, because in the end we 
will be left with unenforceable sentences. What good will that 
do? None whatever. I think that we already have the necessary 
legislation. It is simply a matter of implementing it. Perhaps the 
judges and those who administer the law should be given 
additional resources for a follow-up, but it is especially 
important not to get into specifics, otherwise we will really get 
bogged down.
<P>
	The hon. member might want to formulate his question during 
Oral Question Period and address it to the Minister of Justice in 
the coming month, so that we have something before us 
regarding his suggestion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Macleod is next. 
I believe he plans to share his time with the hon. member for 
Yellowhead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel this is 
probably one of the easiest topics to speak on in the House. 
Surely we have a very common desire on this topic, to see justice 
and fairness in our justice system enacted.
<P>
	I would like to start off by saying that in my view Canada does 
have a justice problem. It is a problem that is typified by the fact 
that homicides are climbing, our schools are unsafe and 
smuggling is rampant. We have recently had House business that 
dealt with smuggling. Fraud in our country is commonplace.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to put criminal justice on a priority list for 
members who are close to me on this side of the House. We have 
gone through social programs and priorized them. We put health 
care at the top of our priorities along with education, pensions 
for the needy and environmental issues. We put justice as the 
one area in our social program system that we would spend more 
money on. This is the one area, in spite of our deficit and debt 
problems, we would spend extra money on. We put a high 
priority on this specific issue.
<P>
	This discourse is not in any sense meant to be confrontational. 
This discourse is meant to be informational. I hope it will be 
taken in that context.
<P>
	Some statistics in our country trouble me: 3 per cent of the 
population are natives and 11.3 per cent of our penitentiary 
inmates are natives. I have talked to the native elders and have 
tried to ascertain what they thought the answer to that problem 
was. They think the old values of the native community need to 
be better taught. They talk of sweetgrass ceremonies, sweat 
lodges, and improving the status of the individual by their old 
cultural methods. I say we need a return of dignity and 
self-sufficiency for natives. People can only be proud of their 
culture when they are proud of themselves.
<P>
	Another thing I would pause to reflect on is something I call a 
prison revolt. This revolt comes from the sociologists and 
criminologists in our society. They approach crime with the 
viewpoint that crime is not the fault of the criminal in many 
instances. It is simply the fault of upbringing, of poverty and of 
abuse. I recognize there are major problems in our society that 
contribute to crime. I recognize that education, prevention of 
poverty and prevention of child abuse are extremely important. 
They say the answer to the problem is compassionate, caring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2410"> 2410 </A></B>
<P>
therapy in a nice warm jail, with retraining opportunities and 
better recreation and library  facilities than people on assistance 
have. I frankly disagree. That is not the answer to that problem.
<P>
	We allow prisoners to vote. We release dangerous offenders 
on unsupervised leave. We sentence them to life but that means 
little. In my view in some ways we as Canadians have lost our 
marbles.
<P>
	Turning to some other backward moves in our criminal justice 
system, we take our law enforcement officers, our RCMP 
trainees, and do not pay them very well. As trainees we give 
them a relatively low wage scale. As they go through their 
training process they reach a point at which they are ready to 
take on the more major responsibilities and with our frozen civil 
servant wages we leave them at the training wage scale. What 
talented young men would want to serve in the law enforcement 
agency realizing that they would be penalized? This is one area 
in which the civil service wage freeze is absolutely unfair.
<P>
	When gun control measures were started, they were started to 
curtail violence with guns, a proposition that no one could argue 
with. Homicides with guns have not improved over the lifetime 
of gun control. Stricter gun control has no correlation whatever 
to better results on homicides with guns. I hear now that one of 
the reasons for stricter gun control is that guns are inherently 
dangerous. I also hear that we are going to prevent accidents and 
suicides by having stricter gun control. It just is not the reason to 
have gun control. On the other end of the scale we have a free 
vote coming up that is going to allow doctors to assist in 
suicides. These are the two ends of the scale that I think are 
completely wrong.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Honest gun users are also having weapons declared restricted 
and then confiscated without pay, a provision that is entirely 
unfair.
<P>
	Another issue that I found fascinating about gun control is 
that when RCMP officers take their weapons off their hips, 
either in the detachment or in their homes, they must place bore 
locks in their weapons. Their weapons are then locked so that 
they cannot be used.
<P>
	I spoke with RCMP officers at home and asked: ``What 
advantage is there to you in doing that?'' They said: ``There is no 
advantage to us at all. We have always been extremely careful 
with our weapons, extremely careful because our own children 
could get the loaded weapons. The only advantage in that is to 
the criminal''. In fact a criminal could wander into the 
detachment and spray the RCMP officers with rifle fire while 
they scramble to unlock their weapons. Again in my view in 
Canada on some issues we have lost our marbles.
<P>
	It is not good enough to stand in the House and just complain, 
mutter and say that everything is wrong. It is only useful if we 
have some constructive comments to make. I would like to turn 
to that portion of my address now.
<P>
	In our society family values have become less important. This 
has a major part to play in our problems with our criminal justice 
system. Single parent families today are 13 per cent of the 
families in society. Many reasons are given for this but a few 
stand out to me. More teens today are choosing to keep and raise 
their babies. There are fewer forced weddings and there is much 
more divorce in society today. I have tried to look very critically 
at why families are breaking down. I am partial to the one that 
says that families are spending too much time trying to raise 
their sights financially rather than raise their sights on their 
children.
<P>
	When I was a young man of about 13 years of age and in grade 
seven my parents got their first home. It was a 1,300 square foot 
home; not very big, not very expensive. If they had paid for that 
mortgage over the span of their lives, they would have paid for it 
by the time that they were in their early sixties.
<P>
	I look with interest as young families today set out very early 
in their lives to get big homes. Homes much bigger than 1,300 
square feet would be the average. They borrow earlier. They take 
on more onerous financial duties. This forces both parents to get 
out into the workforce to try to pay that debt. This conscious 
decision does not allow as much direct parental contact with the 
children. I believe that contributes to some of the problems in 
our justice system.
<P>
	Day care is not the same as parent care. Television care is not 
the same as parent care. A new BMW in the garage is not the 
same as close, loving parental care of a loved child.
<P>
	The solution in part would be to change the tax rules so that 
there is encouragement for one parent to stay home. That need 
not be the woman; it could well be the man. Another change that 
could take place would be to allow our workforce to adjust hours 
so that there could at least be one parent at home.
<P>
	The other specific area I wanted to address does not have very 
much to do with jails and what not. There is a very expensive 
area in our justice system. I want to refer to an article in the 
<I>Medical Post</I> from December that talked about obstetricians 
recommending defensive medicine to prevent lawsuits. The 
obstetrician in this article said that every single baby, just after 
it is born, should have a brain scan and the brain scan should be 
done to prevent a lawsuit ensuing in the future if things showed 
up in that baby's development. If cerebral palsy ensued the 
obstetrician could be blamed for problems at birth. Every single 
baby that had potential problems should have a brain scan, 
according to that obstetrician.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2411"> 2411 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The lawsuits that this obstetrician is trying to prevent are 
lawsuits that involve huge amounts of money in our court 
system and huge amounts of money in terms of the actual awards 
that are given, settlements of up to $7 million.
<P>
	In my view the confrontational legal system we are 
developing in our country mimicking the U.S. system when it 
comes to medical legal issues is costing untold amounts of 
money. The end result of the meeting-and this was a meeting 
that had a number of solicitors in it-was to suggest that no fault 
medical insurance would go a long way toward preventing the 
gladiatorial events of doctors against lawyers in our court 
system. I propose that as one specific item that we should be 
looking at. It involves the health ministry. It involves the justice 
ministry as well.
<P>
	The justice issue transcends every political party. This issue 
transcends every personal philosophy, every level of income, 
and every age group. I want to co-operate in the House to make 
sure our criminal justice system is improved.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of the 
hon. member.
<P>
	As a model prototype of the penal reform system we are in the 
process of building a women's prison in Truro, Nova Scotia. 
That prison will be built on the model of a small home where 
women will learn to cook nutritionally with the guidance of a 
dietitian. They will take care of the home properly. They will 
have their children brought to them. They will be integrated into 
our community; into community recreation, into community 
education and into community training of various types. This is 
an integrated model so that when these women are free to be 
released to society they will be productive, sensible, mature 
women in the sense that they can be self-sufficient and go back 
to a so-called normal life. I hope this will be the model the 
country will establish and follow so that we do have results for 
the tax dollars invested.
<P>
	The second point I would make is that in his comments the 
member appears or seems to project the notion that moral values 
can be legislated. We on this side of the House and I believe the 
people of Canada will watch with great interest and anticipation 
as his leader takes on the role of delegating moral activity and 
moral responsibility with regard to their own membership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might comment on the 
idea of legislating moral values.
<P>
	I am sure the issue of code of conduct is one the member 
opposite would not care to disagree with. This issue has been 
blown all out of proportion, as a code of ethics is simply a 
statement that as public persons a very important part of our 
lives is now public. I am sure the member opposite will be most 
interested in seeing what our code of conduct looks like when it 
comes out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask three questions of the previous 
speaker.
<P>
	First, he referred to the aboriginal people of Canada and I 
would agree with him 100 per cent about the condition in which 
they find themselves. Has the hon. member taken the time to 
read our red book? It speaks of giving Canada's native people 
their own place, their own lives, their own destiny.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	That has been the subject of many questions here relating to 
better education, better training for the workplace, a better 
health system and conditions. Finally it speaks of giving them 
their own justice system and eventually transferring to their 
hands the whole of the huge budget of the department of Indian 
affairs. Does the member not agree that the solution has already 
been advanced and should be debated very constructively here?
<P>
	Second, in regard to better gun control I do not think solutions 
are simply in gun control. The minister of justice has advanced 
the positive idea that unless society as a whole works itself on a 
holistic basis and we clean ourselves from within, gun control 
once more is only part of the puzzle.
<P>
	At the same time to argue today that gun control is not 
necessary is to fly in the face of the opinion of 85 per cent of 
Canadians. It flies in the face of the fact that one of my friends in 
Montreal, Michael Hogben, was killed by a fellow teacher 
because of loose gun control. It flies in the face of Marc Lépine 
who killed 14 young women at the École polytechnique in 
Montreal. It flies in the face of Brady who was pleading for more 
gun control in the United States-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for 
Macleod very briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, to talk specifically about 
the gun control comment, I am not for one second saying that 
gun control should not exist. What I am saying and will say very 
strongly is that more stringent gun control measures are not the 
answer.
<P>
	As the member speaks of Lépine's gun, he should realize that 
Lépine's gun would not be removed from Canadian society 
under our current gun control legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak in support of this motion. This 
House has been in session for two months now. Finally we are 
dealing with an issue which many of my constituents have told 
me is very important to them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2412"> 2412 </A></B>
<P>
	I am in the process of drafting a private member's bill on 
victims' rights. I welcome this opportunity to address an 
important dimension of victims' rights, namely restitution and 
compensation.
<P>
	One hon. member mentioned we should not look at individual 
cases. Too often we speak in general terms and we lose touch 
with real events and real persons.
<P>
	One of the first inquiries I received in my office was from a 
man in Sturgis, Saskatchewan who had his vehicle trashed by a 
group of teenagers in June 1992. The car was totally written off 
by the insurance company for a total cost of $6,500. The victim 
was required to pay the $500 deductible and the cost of a rental 
car so he could get to work. Total out of pocket expenses for the 
victim were $817.45.
<P>
	The owner applied for restitution to the RCMP in August 
1992. In September the victim wrote to the Saskatchewan 
minister of justice expressing his disappointment that charges 
had not been laid against the teenagers who had destroyed his 
car. In December 1992 the RCMP advised the victim that 
charges were being laid against a number of individuals.
<P>
	In May 1993 the crown prosecutor and the defence council 
negotiated for four hours. Charges were dropped against the six 
young offenders and one adult and charges proceeded against 
three others.
<P>
	It appeared to the victim that the main consideration of the 
courts during the sentencing was that there would be no hardship 
imposed on the accused. What about the victim being out of 
pocket over $800? What about the $6,000 paid out by 
Saskatchewan Government Insurance? What about the 
inconvenience of losing the use of his car until he got another 
one?
<P>
	The three convicted teenagers were ordered to pay $500 
restitution and two were fined for assault. The fines and 
restitution were to be paid by August 31, 1993. At the end of 
September after numerous phone calls to the provincial 
officials, the victim again wrote the Saskatchewan minister of 
justice complaining that he had not yet received the $500 
restitution. In November the minister responded saying the 
criminals had paid $50 to the court and that he should be in 
receipt of it. After many phone calls to the RCMP, the provincial 
court wrote a cheque for $50 which arrived on November 25. 
The victim wrote another letter of complaint to the courts and 
asked for the remaining $450.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I remind this House it is now a year and a half since the 
victim's car was demolished. The victim, by this time in a total 
state of exasperation, wrote to me, his member of Parliament. 
We wrote the federal Minister of Justice on behalf of the victim.
<P>
	In January the victim wrote informing us that the balance of 
the restitution order had been received. In February 1994 the 
minister responded saying there was nothing he could do and 
suggested the victim file the  restitution order with the courts 
and have it enforced as a civil judgment in accordance with 
section 725 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I have taken the time to explain this case because I want 
members of this House to get a feeling for what it is like to be a 
victim of a senseless crime. I want members of this House to put 
themselves in the victim's shoes and try to feel how this victim 
felt as he was being jacked around by the system.
<P>
	Our goal as Reformers in this House is to make sure that laws 
are passed that put the rights of the victim first, ahead of all 
other considerations, especially the rights of criminals.
<P>
	When we researched this particular case we proposed a 
number of possible improvements to the existing laws with 
respect to restitution and compensation for the victims of crime. 
The Minister of Justice in his reply to our letter also suggested 
some improvements which should be enacted.
<P>
	Following are some suggested improvements which we will 
be including in our victims' rights bill. The rights of the victim 
and compensation for the victim's losses should be the top 
priority of the courts.
<P>
	Restitution orders should be mandatory and not at the 
discretion of the courts. Restitution orders should compensate 
the full costs incurred by the victim, including losses resulting 
from personal injury and/or loss or damage to property, 
including insurance claims. Restitution orders should be 
enforceable.
<P>
	Why should the only recourse be for the victim to pursue the 
matter in civil court? We send people to jail if they do not pay 
their fines. Why not garnishee a portion of the criminal's wages 
until the restitution order is paid in full? I believe there is far too 
much emphasis on rights and we forget that we also have 
responsibilities. In fact, we should not be entitled to our rights 
until we first discharge our responsibilities.
<P>
	The province of Saskatchewan places a surcharge on every 
$100 paid in fines. These are set aside in a victim services fund, 
but there is no legal obligation on the part of the province to 
spend the revenue collected exclusively on victims. Nor is there 
any compulsory requirement for the victims to be financially 
compensated for their losses.
<P>
	In some provinces criminal injury compensation has been 
combined with workers compensation providing quicker 
response to the victim. This may be a solution for compensating 
victims of crime where convictions are not obtained.
<P>
	What about the responsibility of the convicted criminals to 
pay for their crimes? Are they only responsible to the state after 
they are convicted? Are criminals not also responsible for 
repairing the damage they have done? I and many other 
Canadians feel they are not only responsible but should also be 
totally accountable for their actions and compensate their 
victims in full.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2413"> 2413 </A></B>
<P>
	The charges against the young offenders in the case I reported 
earlier should never have been dropped. The very least the court 
should have done was make the young offenders pay their share 
of the damages. They had the fun of wrecking the victim's car; 
let them at least learn a lesson by having to pay their share of 
the damages out of their own pockets.
<P>
	How many of these young offenders who are let go have gone 
on to commit other crimes? If young offenders are unable to 
compensate the victims of their crimes, then the parents of the 
young offenders should be held totally responsible for 
compensating the victim. This will ensure that parents take a 
greater interest in what their children are doing outside the 
home.
<P>
	When criminals are serving time-and I am talking about low 
risk offenders now, those who do not pose a risk of physical 
violence-they should be involved in work programs. They 
should not be granted the luxury of lounging around at taxpayer 
funded correctional centres. Convicted criminals involved in 
work programs should have a portion of their wages deducted. 
This revenue should be used to repay the victims of the crime. 
Another portion of the wages should be used to help pay for the 
cost of the correctional services, including guards, food, 
accommodation and so on.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I have outlined nine ways in which the government could act 
to place the rights of the victim ahead of those of the criminal 
specifically as they relate to restitution and compensation. As a 
now famous politician once said, we have a lot of work to do. For 
far too long victims' rights have had to take a back seat to the 
rights of criminals. It is time to bring some real justice to the 
justice system.
<P>
	The man who had his car trashed by the teenagers did not get 
justice. He lost the use of his car for days. To get to work he had 
to rent a car for which he was not compensated. He had to wait 
20 months to get the partial compensation the courts awarded. 
He had to make many phone calls and write many letters at his 
own expense to get the restitution ordered by the court. Add to 
that 20 months of worry and frustration.
<P>
	The criminals in that case got away with one more thing: They 
have not made restitution for the $6,000 paid out by 
Saskatchewan Government Insurance. Every policyholder in 
Saskatchewan will have to pay higher premiums as a result.
<P>
	The government can take action which would improve the 
situation for victims immediately and would not require any 
change in legislation. As an interim measure victims must be 
better informed of the limited rights they now have.
<P>
	Much of the frustration suffered by my constituent could have 
been avoided if he had not been forced to fight for his rights with 
bureaucrats and politicians for over a year and a half to get back 
just some of the money owed to him.
<P>
	If the victims of crime were a real priority of the justice 
system this travesty of justice would not have occurred. Why 
should honest, law-abiding citizens have to pay for the 
misdeeds of criminals? It is cash out of their own pockets in 
higher premiums paid to insurance companies.
<P>
	In closing, as a member of this House I vow to support 
common sense criminal justice reforms regardless of the party 
or member initiating them. That is why this morning I was 
pleased to second a private member's bill introduced by the hon. 
member for York South-Weston calling for the repeal of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code which would put an end to 
early parole for first degree murderers who have been sentenced 
to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole.
<P>
	I look forward to the continued debate on this. We need to 
work together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found the 
hon. member's comments very interesting. I am not a lawyer or 
a notary, and I have no particular interest in judicial matters, but 
I represent a constituency that includes the inmates of 
Bordeaux, a well-known prison in Montreal. In fact, I heard 
several remarks during the two previous speeches made by 
members of the Reform Party which seem to reflect some 
prejudice against the penal system, in that they call for yet more 
legislation but ignore the lack of resources endemic in the 
system.
<P>
	Bordeaux prison is a provincial institution, in other words, for 
offenders sentenced to two years or less, and it is full of 
so-called weekend inmates. The penal system does not provide 
enough prisons, and often when inmates who serve their 
sentence on weekends come to the prison, they are told: No 
room, come back next week. And this can go on for two years.
<P>
	We do not need more legislation. We need resources, as my 
colleague argued earlier.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I heard some remarks by my Reform Party 
colleague-speaking of prejudice-who referred to nice, warm 
jails. I do not think they are nice, warm jails. This smacks of 
demagogy, and we can do without that. I think we should 
concentrate on improving the availability of resources.
<P>
	I have a more specific question about the hon. member's 
speech. He made a presentation on a private member' bill 
concerning compensation for victims of crime. At the present 
time, victims can go to civil court to sue criminals. However, 
criminals usually do not have any income or resources to pay 
fines and that sort of thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2414"> 2414 </A></B>
<P>
	Could he explain how this would be dealt with in his bill, 
to give victims a better chance to sue criminals for damage 
arising from their crimes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pick up on a couple of things the hon. member has 
mentioned. One is the people who spend their weekends in 
prison. Very often we sentence people to sentences that may not 
be appropriate. I would like to put this idea forth.
<P>
	Many times when we send people to prison, instead of 
improving on their attitude and their lot and so on, they in fact 
deteriorate because they get to mix with other people who may 
be of more disrepute than they are.
<P>
	With regard to non-violent offenders, possibly the courts 
could have the option of putting them into work programs rather 
than sending them to prison. The prisons could be reserved for 
the worst offenders, the most violent offenders in society. This 
ties in with the second matter that was raised, how would these 
people be compensated.
<P>
	That is where work programs need to be put in place in the 
prisons. A percentage of the wages these people earn could then 
be used to compensate their victims. A problem we have is that a 
victim has to go through the civil courts, through the whole legal 
and justice system to try to get back some of that money. It is a 
great inconvenience and very often unsuccessful because the 
criminal has no income to be able to pay the victim.
<P>
	If there were a work program this would help solve that 
problem. Work would also give these people a better feeling 
about themselves. It is no different for them than for us. When 
someone meets someone else for the first time, the one thing 
they ask is: ``What work do you do, what job?''. It does 
something for us and I think it would do the same for many of 
these people in society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief.
<P>
	In terms of charging the parents under the Young Offenders 
Act if they cannot charge the child, what is the hon. member's 
recommendation as to punishment? Quite often we find that the 
parents have very little asset or ability to pay or to compensate 
the victim.
<P>
	I work closely with the Citizens United for Safety and Justice 
in my community and we see that there is no real asset or 
opportunity to make the parent pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
saying that we should be charging parents. Do not get me wrong. 
My constituents are telling me that very often parents have the 
attitude that it is someone else's problem. I think it is that 
attitude we are trying to get at. If they were required to make 
some compensation in that regard and if they were held 
accountable for what their children are doing, they might take a 
greater interest in what they are doing. This is the kind of 
attitude we need to foster. It all ties in with the erosion of family 
living  that we have in Canada and I think we need to address that 
whole area. It is not going to be done in just one minute.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity this morning 
to speak on this motion.
<P>
	I realize in our country at the present time there is a 
tremendous outrage against crime. It is not the outrage against 
crime with which I have a problem. On the contrary, I have 
trouble understanding and I condemn the simplistic solutions to 
complex interdependent and intertwined problems that exist in 
our society which cause crime.
<P>
	As long as we as members of Parliament and members of 
society say that there is a possibility for quick fixes, we cannot 
count on the support of the people of Canada to work with us.
<P>
	The problem today is that crime is not like a common cold, it 
is not like a mortgage, it is not like foreign aid. It is something 
that is entirely different. It is something with which all of 
society must become involved.
<P>
	I have listened to the member for Yorkton-Melville and I 
appreciate the point he made that prisons are not the answer for 
punishment for all those who have offended. This is true.
<P>
	This is especially true with respect to young offenders. In 
prison young offenders do acquire some of the tricks of the trade 
that allow them to be professional criminals when they are 
released.
<P>
	Maybe there is a way of working with young offenders that 
will be to the benefit of young offenders other than the standard 
incarceration in adult institutions. Certainly watching television 
and playing pool during the incarceration would not be the 
answer. There has to be rehabilitation but there has to be an 
appreciation.
<P>
	I do not agree that people who offend should not be entitled to 
rights until they discharge their responsibilities. There we are 
creating a very dangerous line, a line that people in our society 
are not entitled to rights. Criminals, people even though 
incarcerated, have to be entitled to rights. We have to say that all 
Canadians are entitled to rights. If not then we absolutely revert 
to barbarism.
<P>
	These rights are defined in the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in the Criminal Code. We cannot say that these rights 
can only be extended to some Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2415"> 2415 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley talked 
about the fact that our Charter of Rights and Freedoms has been 
a problem. There are people who have offended who got away 
from the punishment they deserved because the lawyer was able 
to rely on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That is just 
absolutely and utterly wrong.
<P>
	The Charter of Rights and Freedoms takes the rights of all 
Canadians and enshrines them. These rights are fundamental. If 
we do not abide by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
acknowledge these rights are applicable to all Canadians then 
we are in fact one step closer to chaos.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	We are one step closer to saying that there are certain rules 
that apply to one group of Canadians and not to another group of 
Canadians. Incarceration takes away privileges that certain 
Canadians will hold. There is no question about that and that is 
as it should be. Rights have to be fundamental. If they are not we 
get into the situation in which people in our society tell other 
people what they can have and what they cannot have, not only 
the courts.
<P>
	The courts then lose the power to weigh a matter and decide 
what is going to be the punishment. If we take away these rights, 
then when do these rights reappear? Who is to say when these 
rights reappear? Who is to say that the person taking away the 
rights from somebody is not going to be the person who loses 
these rights at some later date?
<P>
	We cannot destroy the fabric of the law in trying to solve the 
problems in our society today. That is not to say of course that 
there is not a great deal that needs to be done.
<P>
	The resolution talks about condemning the government for its 
action with regard to reform of the criminal justice system. I do 
not think any politician can cop out and say: ``Well, we inherited 
this from the former government''. I think it has to be a 
consideration. To say that we should have legislation in place is 
somewhat unreasonable in many instances considering the fact 
that the House did not convene until January 17.
<P>
	However, there is a great deal that is in place and ongoing at 
the present time. The Minister of Justice mentioned that next 
week on March 23 and 24 there is going to be a 
federal-provincial-territorial conference on justice matters that 
will examine all of the important details, concepts and subjects 
that have been brought forward in this debate today.
<P>
	This is very important. It is fundamental because we live in a 
federal system of government in which certain responsibilities 
in the same sphere of activity are shared by the federal 
government, provincial governments and territorial 
government. We must get these governments working together.
<P>
	In so many areas things have fallen between the chairs so that 
justice is not being done, not because the rules and the laws are 
not there, not because the determination is not there, but because 
we have not had the two systems of government working 
together. That has to be the case. It has to be the case certainly in 
family concerns, in violence against women and in custody 
matters with respect to children where there are federal, 
provincial and territorial jurisdictions in these subject matters.
<P>
	We have to be able to enforce maintenance orders to look after 
the children who are left by fathers and in fewer cases mothers 
who do not want to remain with their family.
<P>
	In the red book we call for a national council on crime 
prevention. This is tremendously important. We have here in 
this interlocked system this complex problem with really two 
main aspects.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	First, what do we do with those who are offending at the 
present time? Second, how do we prevent these types of offences 
from happening in the future? While it is unrealistic to say that 
certain offences will not happen in the future, if we work 
together and if we are prepared to look at new concepts, we have 
in our power the means of reducing these crimes. We have to do 
that.
<P>
	I want to start with the recommendation in the red book which 
calls for a national council on crime prevention. The Minister of 
Justice has said he has spoken with the provincial and territorial 
ministers responsible. This matter will be brought up at the 
conference next week. The concept is taking shape. How it is 
going to be implemented is not an easy matter but one which is 
well on the way to complete definition.
<P>
	This will bring together departments whose activities can 
relate to the prevention of crime. For example, Canada 
Mortgage and Housing with respect to housing, which is a factor 
in crime; the Department of Health which is a factor in crime; 
the Solicitor General-these departments will come together 
and work together through this council under the leadership of 
the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	What will they do? They will be able to look at all legislation. 
We look at the legislation and we want the best for all 
Canadians. Through this council legislation will be looked at to 
find out how crime can be prevented more effectively. How can 
this legislation deal with possible crime in the future? This is an 
aspect that is so important.
<P>
	Also on this council will be agencies from the aboriginal 
society, from the provincial society, from all of the working 
groups that are dealing with crime prevention.
<P>
	Through the council we will look at how we can prevent 
crime, with the input of these groups, which will enable us to 
work down into society itself through the provincial and 
munici-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2416"> 2416 </A></B>
<P>
pal levels and determine how on  each of these levels the work of 
the national council can be broadened and improved to become 
more effective.
<P>
	At the municipal level, for instance, how can community 
policing more effectively deal with crime. How can we have 
police stations or depots in more areas of the community, where 
officers can patrol the community on foot, and where people can 
relate to the officers of a particular police station and go to them 
for advice?
<P>
	On the provincial level as well, how can we work through 
education. Right now the situation is that education is the right 
of every young Canadian, regardless of how obstructive or how 
destructive a student may be. Is that going to continue to be the 
case? Can we have an educational system, for instance, where 
we can at an earlier age try to identify the children at risk? We 
have to be able to identify children at risk at an earlier age. They 
are together in our educational system, certainly today that is 
not the role of the teacher. But should it be? Should it be an 
aspect of education? Should we have special classes that deal 
with children at risk? Should we be able to say that this is a 
common problem of society and not just the problem of the 
parents?
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the parent is a single mother who is working as hard 
as she possibly can to keep a roof over the head of herself and her 
children. She wants to do more but she cannot and still provide 
for that child. Is it not then that society must step in to try to 
help? We cannot just throw money at people in need, at low 
income people with children at risk. There has to be community 
involvement. We have to start identifying where we can best 
make this involvement, where we can best have this input.
<P>
	When we did our study on crime prevention last year, a 
psychiatrist appeared before us. He was asked at what age could 
we have the best impact on children and how they conduct 
themselves as they grow up. The psychiatrist said that from the 
day a child is born to that child's third birthday is the time when 
we can have the biggest impact on how that child will turn out 
through his or her youth and adulthood. This is a very important 
consideration.
<P>
	A teacher came to me two years ago from the Toronto area 
who wanted the age of the Young Offender's Act lowered 
because in his school where he was principal a 10-year old and 
an 11-year old both turned up at school with handguns. No one 
would take responsibility. No agency would get involved and 
finally the principal sent the two children home with the 
handguns. Later on that afternoon he received a call from 
somebody in the children's neighbourhood blasting the 
principal for daring to send two children into the neighbourhood 
with handguns. As far as that person was concerned it was fine to 
have them in school with handguns but it was not fine to have 
them in the neighbourhood with handguns.
<P>
	Something is sadly lacking. We have to find out where we are 
going in this regard. We are not only talking about victims 
although victims are tremendously important and we have to be 
more mindful of their rights. They are in the law. We have 
always considered victims to be part of the law that we dispense 
in this country.
<P>
	Perhaps we can do more with compensation for the wrong that 
was done to a victim. We have to consider it more in terms of 
compensation rather than incarceration. We cannot have both. 
One cannot have someone paying what in the opinion of the 
court is a full penalty and then come out of incarceration and 
have for a good part of his or her life thereafter to pay a large 
sum of money to the victim. It does not give the person who 
committed the wrong any incentive to change his or her ways if 
he is constantly being reminded and torn by his or her mistake.
<P>
	The victim suffers a tremendous harm, there is no question 
about it. This harm has to be compensated as best as possible. 
Part of this compensation to the victim however is that we have 
that person coming out of incarceration able to live in society.
<P>
	With young offenders no matter what crime they have 
committed, they are going to be coming out of incarceration. If 
they come out of incarceration more confused, more jaundiced 
toward society than when they went into incarceration, then we 
have failed. We have paid $60,000 a year for the right to fail.
<P>
	This is a very complex situation but we have to be able to 
address the wrongs that are done today. We have to be able to 
anticipate and guard against future wrongs and reduce our crime 
rate. The two working together have to mesh but they both have 
to be aspects of what we are trying to do.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The government is beginning well with the co-operation of all 
members of the House of Commons and with the open dialogue 
which the Minister of Justice has encouraged. I think all 
members would agree he is open to discussion, and of his own 
volition has initiated dialogue on gun control, and will be doing 
this with other subject matters as well.
<P>
	I look forward, as I know the Minister of Justice does, to 
working with all members in dealing with this very complex and 
important situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments and speech of the 
hon. member for Cape Breton-The Sydneys. I would have two 
questions for him.
<P>
	First, does the hon. member agree with me that the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms puts too much emphasis on the 
accused and the criminal and not enough on the victim? Does he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2417"> 2417 </A></B>
<P>
agree with me on that? Would he be prepared to add something 
to the Charter  to favour victims, to have the rights of victims 
supersede those of the accused?
<P>
	Second, and this is more a clarification than a question, I hope 
I heard wrong, in the part of the hon. member's speech where he 
talked about municipalities, community policing and an 
educational system providing special classes for children at 
risk. I just want to make sure that the government does not 
intend to intervene in areas which could not be more under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to confirm that he brought this 
up in his speech but that the federal government plans no direct 
intervention in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to deal with 
both of those questions.
<P>
	First, the rights of victims are very important and have to be 
of paramount consideration in our criminal justice system. The 
Minister of Justice stated in his speech that they are being 
considered at the present time in the Criminal Code and that they 
are a very integral part of the dispensation of justice in Canada 
right now.
<P>
	We have also said that we are looking at ways of increasing 
this. The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
spoke about the rights of the victims and said there should be 
more dialogue and interfacing between the offender and the 
victim. That is a very good point if the offender, especially if it 
is a young offender, can get an actual appreciation of what he or 
she has done, then it may go a long way toward helping that 
young person rethink the way they have conducted their 
activities.
<P>
	I think that maybe we can, through diversion programs, deal 
more with the compensation of the victim, more with the rights 
of the victim. Certainly to say the rights of the victim are not 
being considered would be incorrect.
<P>
	With respect to community policing and education I was 
talking about them on two different levels, with the community 
policing on the municipal level and education on the provincial 
level. Just to give the hon. member an idea of what I meant, there 
is in my riding right now a project which I am working on and 
which I am encouraging called The Learning Centre.
<P>
	This centre has young people who have dropped out of school 
and who have had problems with different types of learning 
systems. The centre offers a learning mode in which there is 
more of an interest in the individual. The success of this 
institution has been absolutely incredible. I hope we can develop 
and expand it so that it will have positive effects through the 
whole country in time.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like the hon. member to comment on a couple of things in regard 
to crime prevention of which I am a strong supporter regardless 
of what some people might say. I am also a strong supporter of 
punishment. I believe in both ends of the spectrum.
<P>
	I like the idea of setting up the national council. The minister 
suggested some ideas of who should be members of this council. 
I did not hear the possibility of there being members from 
Victims of Violence, from the good old grassroots, the farmer 
who never had anything more than a grade six education, or the 
ordinary Canadian. From his speech it seems it could be stacked 
with people who have the class and the ability to speak 
rhetorically, as we hear so much, and yet do not get to the root of 
the problem. Would the government consider including all kinds 
of people on this council?
<P>
	Second, on the children at risk program, I tried to implement 
that program in the school where I was principal. We had a great 
deal of success with it at the beginning but that success 
deteriorated. It was hindered because parents complained that 
we were attempting to move in on certain children without their 
permission although they were targeted. Under the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms we virtually had to withdraw and therefore 
could not provide any help. The charter was a hindrance to the 
program in my view.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member's comments on those two 
points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Wild 
Rose for those questions. With respect to the national council on 
crime prevention I agree with him most emphatically that at 
least one member on the council should be from Victims of 
Violence or a similar organization.
<P>
	The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley talked 
about CAVEAT and her appreciation and tremendous respect for 
it. However, one problem she had was that there had to be these 
organizations to bring these concerns forward.
<P>
	We are always going to have these organizations and we are 
going to be better for it. They have done a tremendous amount of 
good in bringing concerns forward. They certainly helped me in 
understanding the concerns. Only people who have gone 
through the trauma and tragedy can fully understand, but the 
work these organizations do allow the rest of us to understand. It 
is very helpful.
<P>
	With respect to children at risk, there really are two problems. 
The hon. member identified one as being the parents. There is a 
concern here. The other of course is that it is a provincial 
jurisdiction and the federal government is very limited in what it 
can do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2418"> 2418 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a precedent in that the Canada food guide is very 
much a part of the school curriculum. We have to deal with this 
matter at some point in meetings of the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments.
<P>
	I applaud the member for having tried the program. I 
appreciate what he ran into but I still feel he was on the right 
track. It is hoped that with a more broadly based project and an 
idea of the pitfalls, thanks to his sharing with us the problems he 
ran into, we will be able to anticipate where the problems lie. 
Then if it is decided this is the way to go, we will be able to carry 
it through to society's benefit.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of our Reform motion. It is to 
stimulate new Canada thinking about where we have been with 
the justice system and what are the emerging expectations of the 
community about where we need to go. As we formulate a vision 
of hope for a new Canada of equality, the sense of proportion and 
balance in the justice system needs to be examined.
<P>
	Many in my community of New Westminster-Burnaby are 
fearful, frustrated and angry about the operation of the justice 
system. In fact they make the point that we do not have a justice 
system at all; we merely have a legal system.
<P>
	It is seen that this legal system is largely unaccountable to the 
community and that the community has no sense of ownership of 
what goes on in this seemingly convoluted system. The legal 
system operates on doublespeak, legalese and jargon and is 
characterized by a professional ``we know best'' attitude toward 
an interfering community.
<P>
	There are glimpses of hope, however, such as the community 
policing efforts of the last few years, the block watch programs, 
and extensive volunteer programs such as the Burnaby RCMP 
victims assistance program.
<P>
	This program began in January 1987 and currently involves 
50 volunteers. During the seven years of service the program has 
been in contact with 9,250 victims or witnesses. In 1993 it 
handled over 1,650 files and volunteered 6,700 hours.
<P>
	The primary role of the victim assistance program is to 
provide emotional support. It provides information and updates 
on police files, court information, court orientation and 
accompaniment, referrals to community agencies and 
information on legal services and criminal injuries 
compensation.
<P>
	In Burnaby the police based team of volunteers is on call 24 
hours a day to provide assistance in whatever way possible. Also 
in New Westminster-Burnaby and in New Westminster 
specifically we have a similar program which is run out of the 
crown counsel's office.
<P>
	However, it is time that a more cross-systems approach be 
applied in bold terms to put the victim's and the community's 
general concerns before the offender's concerns. There is a 
relationship between the offender and the offended, whether that 
be another individual, a family or a community.
<P>
	In reference to the community as victim, the Young Offenders 
Act passed by a previous Liberal government has become the 
single chapter of criminal law that is in most disrepute. Poll 
after poll reflects it and the news clipping service of the 
Solicitor General is full of references to community 
dissatisfaction. Even the Liberal red book reluctantly admits the 
act needs review.
<P>
	It is with the Young Offenders Act that the community feels 
most left out. The operation of the act violates the fundamental 
sense of equity and balance the community expects.
<P>
	The wording of the motion today and our proposals for 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act are directly connected.
<P>
	For example, section 3(1) of the act states: ``Policy 
application with respect to young offenders''. There are nine 
paragraphs of definition, then a total of 70 sections limiting how 
the substantive part of the Criminal Code and other criminal 
statutes will be administered for young offenders.
<P>
	Allow me to paraphrase parts of section 3(1) of the Young 
Offenders Act: (b) society must be afforded the necessary 
protection from illegal behaviour; (c) a young person who 
commits an offence requires supervision, discipline and control, 
and because of their level of maturity they also have special 
needs and require guidance and assistance; (e) a young person 
has rights and freedoms as is stated in the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and should therefore have special 
guarantees of their rights and freedoms; (g) young persons have 
the right to be informed as to what their rights and freedoms are.
<P>
	Not once in the preamble list is there mention of the rights of 
the victim. The act largely drives how social services are 
administered. There is little to make a young offender realize 
there is a victim or someone who has been hurt and that it is the 
community to which the offender should be held accountable.
<P>
	We need an additional paragraph in the Young Offenders Act 
preamble that reads something like this: ``The community, or 
victims in particular, shall be given equal consideration where 
making dispositions for youth and victims shall be heard upon 
their request at sentencing and at reviews''.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	In almost every instance the victim or the community is 
barred from knowledge of what is happening or is going to 
happen to the offender. The system is similar to what goes on at 
most job interviews when the employer tells the hopeful candi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2419"> 2419 </A></B>
<P>
date: ``Don't call us, we will call  you''. All of us know the 
employer will only call if the candidate is needed.
<P>
	In the case of a victim, the victim is forgotten after the offence 
has occurred. They are made to feel they did their part and 
should now step aside because the offender is the one who really 
needs the attention. Is it any wonder then that the public is so 
frustrated with the justice system.
<P>
	A victim is usually not asking for a great deal. In most cases it 
is just for a bit of involvement, some dignity and more than 
anything else, some empathy. In response to that my riding has 
two volunteer programs but it is now time for recognition of 
victims in legislation.
<P>
	In some jurisdictions an overreaching interpretation of the 
Young Offenders Act does not permit the young offenders court 
list to be displayed on the courtroom door.
<P>
	In British Columbia fortunately the youth court is open to the 
public and exclusion orders are not very common. However, no 
local reporter can advise the community as to what goes on there 
or report when an offender is going to be released. The 
community as victim has the right to know who the offenders are 
through the media.
<P>
	It seems disproportionate to the public for youth court to 
revolve only around the offender. For example youth workers 
cannot disclose what they know to a high school counsellor. 
Social workers in the community cannot always inform the court 
of everything they know about a situation.
<P>
	We fall all over ourselves to protect or avoid a potential 
negative circumstance for the offender with secrecy. The Young 
Offenders Act also contains provisions to deliberately mislead 
the court at sentencing concerning a youth criminal record 
because of the time limits stipulated in the act.
<P>
	Who focuses on the victim? When one carefully looks at the 
act it is glaring in its absence of a provision that the plight of the 
victim be heard at court or become real to the young offender in 
the process. I recently read an article in the <I>Toronto Star</I>. It 
concluded that victims of crime can be victimized twice, first by 
the criminal and then by the system.
<P>
	Victims and witnesses have special needs and they must be 
treated with dignity and respect. Offenders must be held 
accountable for their acts. The law should reflect current values 
held by the majority of Canadians. The legal system should be 
accountable to the society it serves for its operations, methods 
and results.
<P>
	What should be paramount in the Young Offenders Act is the 
protection of the community. Let me give an example of a case 
that took place in Alberta in 1990.
<P>
	A young offender was so infatuated with his girlfriend that 
after she broke off the relationship he knifed her but fortunately 
did not kill her. As a young offender he only received eight 
months in custody. Apparently he told workers he still wanted to 
kill his former girlfriend. Exactly one year from the first 
incident the young offender killed the girl. In this case the 
victim had no chance because the rights of the young offender 
had to be protected.
<P>
	The act has a title: the Young Offenders Act. It should truly 
deal with young offenders, not youthful adults. The natural 
sense of balance the victims want restored would envision an 
age application of 10 years to 15 years inclusive. This is the 
most significant and fundamental required change to restore 
credibility to the trust that is now broken within the Canadian 
community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member on his thoughts. I want to relate 
to him some incidents with regard to people falling into that 
category. My 31 years in the field of education gave me the 
opportunity of coming across many youngsters who would fall 
into that category.
<P>
	More specifically, I made reference in my maiden speech in 
this House to one young fellow who had run away from a boys' 
school where he was being held in custody. He returned after 
going home to North Battleford to his parents. Upon his arrival 
his father said: ``What are you doing here? I thought you had run 
away. Get your belongings. You have 15 minutes. Get out of this 
house and don't ever come back''. I remember the cases of many 
others. In particular I asked one individual: ``What was your 
family background? How did you get into this kind of thing?'' 
He could remember 30 homes he had lived in and he was about 
15 or 16 years of age.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	In the city of Regina two youngsters of about 10 or 11 years of 
age physically abused youngsters who were 7 and 8 years of age. 
My concern is what we are to do with them. A speaker on our 
side said that between the ages of zero and three we had to make 
some impact on the lives of young people. Having heard the 
proposals and knowing the youngsters with whom I have come 
in contact, I would ask the hon. member opposite what should 
we do to alter the lifestyle of these people? Does he really think 
that if we incarcerate them we will resolve the problem?
<P>
	Specifically I think of a young fellow from the Northwest 
Territories who spent six months in incarceration where more 
damage was done to him than he would have ever done in the 
north in 60 years.
<P>
	In summary, the member may have some answers. I would be 
interested in knowing them because I had to deal with some of 
these youngsters. How would he resolve some of these issues in 
light of where we are going?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2420"> 2420 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, the medical model or philosophy 
in correctional rehabilitation that someone is sick and therefore 
an institution is somewhat like a hospital has been long 
abandoned.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act in general sends the wrong message 
to the community. We should check with the young people 
themselves instead of with professionals in the justice system. 
We should go to high schools to find out what seems to be the 
community sentiment. The greatest pressure I receive from my 
community is often from the high schools indicating that the 
balance is off and that balance needs to be restored more in 
favour of the victim and accountability to the community.
<P>
	That is not to say that the Young Offenders Act is completely 
unworkable. There are some good measures it, especially the 
provision of alternative measures and the possibility of giving 
due process. It was certainly an improvement over the old 
juvenile delinquents act.
<P>
	The typical response is to throw more money at the problem. 
We need more community learning situations, work programs, 
more social workers or whatever, rather than continue to throw 
money at dispositional alternatives.
<P>
	My comment today arises out of the community sentiment 
that the Young Offenders Act inherently sends the wrong 
message. We must bring the impact of the consequences more 
directly to offenders. The community message out there that the 
Young Offenders Act is a soft touch must be changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to approach the motion from a different angle. I support the 
motion and I want to talk about the healing process victims must 
go through.
<P>
	Because of legislation and certain things that seem to take 
place in our government the healing process is hindered a great 
deal. This motion is intended to help-and I believe it could-a 
great deal in the healing process. The thing I fear about raising a 
motion in the House is that it seems like, in my short four 
months, that if a Reformer from the west stands to speak about a 
motion he or she has to be one of those ultra right redneck 
scoundrels. We should be careful about what how strongly we 
say things. At the same time a person like me could stand and 
think of experienced individuals on the opposite side of the 
House who have been here for a number of years. I could attach 
the name Liberal to them, but I have to be cautious that I 
suddenly do not think I am trying to talk sense to some people 
who are nothing more than bleeding hearts and surely it will fall 
on deaf ears. Those extreme attitudes should not exist. I hope 
somehow or another we can pull those attitudes together and 
address a motion which I believe is essential to helping victims.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I refer to the specific case of a lady in her mid-forties, a 
mother of three children. I may not have all the facts straight, 
but I know about the case. She was apparently working in the 
church secretarial office on a Saturday. An intruder came in and 
apparently beat the lady severely, raped her a number of times, 
and caused a great deal of havoc in her life. By the way, the 
perpetrator was out on a day pass. Apparently he had been 
incarcerated in the past for the same kinds of charges.
<P>
	This lady went through the turmoil and trauma of the event. 
She is scarred the rest of her life, physically to some degree but 
certainly mentally to a larger degree. This will impact on the 
lives of her family, her children and her husband, over the years. 
I realize they are seeking help and would like to do something 
about the healing process.
<P>
	The victim in this case would very dearly like the criminal 
tested for HIV-AIDS since he comes from a high risk category. 
That is a very simple request. It comes from the heart. With all 
the other traumatic things they will have to live with, they would 
certainly like to be able to eliminate that thought. When it 
reached the courts under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms it 
was declared that he did not have to submit to an HIV test, to 
protect his rights.
<P>
	In a nutshell the motion is trying to address those kinds of 
situations. It is not that the criminal should not have some 
rights. However, if the situation is going to create a conflict, for 
heaven's sake let us use common sense and help the healing 
process to take place in the lives of this woman and her family. 
We should demand that criminal be submitted to this test and 
eliminate that problem or worry, or at least give them the 
opportunity to do something about it.
<P>
	It is a conflict between the rights of two individuals. We 
constantly see these conflicts in our judicial system. The 
circumstances are not the same but there are similarities. We 
must consider the rights of the criminal and the rights of the 
victim. In practically every case the criminal's rights override 
the rights of the victim. The particular case I have just 
illustrated would probably be the worst example of saying to a 
victim: ``We are sorry but we cannot do it because of his rights''.
<P>
	This is not a simplistic solution. It is a common sense 
solution. For the life of me I cannot understand why any 
government would say that it is going to take ages to resolve 
these problems. They could be resolved overnight if there is the 
political will to do it. These problems do not need to exist. We 
could wipe them out if we developed an attitude in the House 
that regardless of where the motion comes from it makes sense.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Recently I had the opportunity to visit for a length of time 
with a mother in the city of Calgary. She was the victim of 
violence in that her five-year old daughter was taken from her 
backyard where she was playing. It was  not until later that night 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2421"> 2421 </A></B>
<P>
that the young girl was found. She had been mutilated, beaten, 
her throat cut and dumped in a garbage dumpster in an alley 
behind their home.
<P>
	An arrest was made of a 37-year old man who admitted to the 
crime. He was quoted in the papers as saying he had a difficult 
time controlling himself because he was sick and tired of this 
little girl always coming on to him. Everyone in the House must 
agree that some pretty traumatic things are taking place in that 
family. This little girl had brothers and sisters as well.
<P>
	Immediately the 37-year old man had a lawyer to provide 
legal assistance. There was nothing for the victim. Immediately 
the 37-year old man had psychologists, psychiatrists and 
counsellors at his disposal. There was nothing for the victim. 
There was nothing for the mother. I take that back. There was 
something for the mother. She could have the same services but 
she had to pay $50 to $100 an hour out of her own pocket.
<P>
	When we asked for help to be provided to this family we were 
brushed aside. We do not have anything in legislation that would 
allow for this to happen. The boys on the great white hill in 
Ottawa have not come up with anything in the charter of rights to 
protect victims.
<P>
	I cannot for the slightest moment believe anybody would not 
want to vote in favour of a motion that would protect the rights 
of victims like the ones I am talking about. It is high time we did 
it.
<P>
	My last point is why have we not brought in some legislation 
that would help tremendously? It has been proven throughout 
many countries, parts of the States and other parts of the world, 
that we could legislate DNA testing. There would be some real 
value in that. It is my understanding that it is incorrect one in 
thirty billion times. In samples of skin, hair, semen or whatever 
the case may be, no two people in the world can have the same 
DNA with the possible exception of identical twins.
<P>
	It would be a useful tool for our enforcement officers to apply 
for a conviction and, believe it or not, to have someone released 
who was wrongly charged.
<P>
	It is has been reported to me that in British Columbia there are 
45 unsolved murders, 20 sexual assaults and several other 
serious crimes where DNA evidence is available, but there is no 
law that allows them to make a suspect give a sample. A sample 
cannot be taken from the suspect because under the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms the criminal has the right to refuse the test. 
I could go through several examples. Consequently there are 
people walking the streets who ought to be behind bars.
<P>
	Do we have the political will or the courage to stand and allow 
the people of our country to have the right to be safe from people 
who would be behind bars if we took the proper action? The first 
step is to recognize the rights of victims.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member's speech and 
he said a few things that I do not agree with. I cannot understand 
how, in 1994, we can still hear such comments.
<P>
	I said earlier that today's debate should not be limited to 
repugnant cases that were extensively covered by the press. I too 
could mention cases showing the opposite, cases where, after a 
realistic rehabilitation period, young offenders were 
successfully reintegrated into the system. Some people returned 
to society after psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
<P>
	If I understand the logic used by the hon. member from the 
Reform Party, we should put everybody in jail without 
treatment. My question is how will we have enough prisons if we 
put everybody in jail without anything to treat them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	The cases I cited are sample cases of an extremely violent 
nature where there is a direct conflict between the rights of the 
criminal and the rights of the victim and it has always gone 
toward the rights of the victim.
<P>
	I did not talk about incarceration other than the fact that when 
we have those kinds of dangerous people on the street they 
should be locked up. Does that mean we throw away the key, not 
feed them and not treat them? I did not address the penal system. 
I will be more than pleased to give another 10 minute speech on 
what I think we should do there.
<P>
	I believe in rehabilitation. I believe that we need to treat and 
do as much as we possibly can, but I also believe that we have to 
be realistic in our penal system, realistic enough to realize that 
across the way or anywhere the world, if we work hard and earn 
money, we probably will eat pork chops and steak and will love 
it. If we go out into the same world and do not work and are not 
able to achieve as much as some other people, we may have to 
resort to something less than that.
<P>
	Maybe in a realistic sense that is part of the treatment that 
needs to take place in the penal system. Let us provide a work 
program. If one works hard in this penal system it will be like in 
society, one will eat well. If one does not work in this penal 
system, one's reward will be the same as in society. One will eat 
macaroni and cheese and may not get any cheese.
<P>

<B><A NAME="2422"> 2422 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
found the discourse by the member for Wild Rose extremely 
interesting.
<P>
	In a sense I thought it was an overview given by <I>Reader's 
Digest</I>. It was very anecdotal. At one point he mentioned two 
examples, two anecdotes, one being the very tragic case of the 
lady who was raped. He made the observation and the 
conclusion that in most cases the rights of the accused are 
greater than those of the victim.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member what empirical data he has for 
this. This is one example given. He jumps to a very broad 
conclusion.
<P>
	He also made the observation of the very tragic case of the 
young girl who was murdered. He then made the conclusion that 
there is no one to act for the wife or the mother in this case. I 
want to ask him in a very open ended way, who does the crown 
act for if it does not act in this case for the mother of this child?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the crown acts for the 
state. If we take it down to an individual case, we have a 
different ball game. When we talk individually we talk about (a) 
one person, the criminal, and (b) person number two, the victim.
<P>
	I referred to a conflict where a person was a rape victim, 
requested an HIV test and that request was denied to protect the 
rights of the criminal. I can give lots of examples. I have a whole 
briefcase full of them. That is difficult to do in 10 minutes. If 
every member of this Parliament has been paying attention to 
what is going on out there, I am sure they can find case after 
case.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Another examples is a fellow by the name of Thompson-no 
relation. When in prison he stated that he was going to kill his 
estranged wife when he got out. He was going to eliminate her 
and others associated with her. He stated that over and over. The 
victim, the lady in question, requested the authorities to please 
not let him out as he meant it. Nothing was done about her 
request. They simply followed the line of the rule: He was up for 
parole and was eligible because he had been a good boy and he 
really did not mean it. However, we will request that he stays in 
Toronto and does not go out to the west coast.
<P>
	Big deal. He got to the west coast and he accomplished his 
mission. Three people are dead because nobody listened to the 
potential victim.
<P>
	That is not asking too much. I am sure the hon. member will 
agree that if we ignore the wishes of the victims as we have in 
the past and only concentrate on the straight legal legislation, 
we are doing a disservice to our people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the 
motion put before this House by the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	The hon. member has put forward the motion that this 
government should be condemned for its inaction with regard to 
the reform of the criminal justice system. Specifically the 
motion accuses this government of allowing the rights of 
criminals to take precedence over the rights of victims.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite right. In the five short months that 
this government has been in power it could have done much 
more than it has done to take action on criminal justice issues. 
We could have taken the easy road and won cheap popularity by 
pandering to those who want change without proper 
consideration of the consequences. We could have acted 
precipitously rather than proceeding deliberately and 
systematically.
<P>
	We rejected this type of approach in favour of a broad and 
reasoned strategy to reform our criminal justice system. In 
short, this government honoured the pledge it made to 
Canadians in its electoral platform to work for a fair, balanced 
and humane justice system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, a key component of our election platform, better 
known as the red book, is a program designed to ensure safety in 
public and private places. We propose a comprehensive 
approach, namely a twofold initiative which recognizes the need 
for measures against violent crimes and high-risk criminals, 
while also emphasizing the importance of crime prevention.
<P>
	The project is well under way in all these important areas. It is 
obvious, however, that some members are not aware of the work 
being done, or of the reasons why we concentrate our efforts on 
these particular areas.
<P>
	I want to provide members with some information to enable 
them to better understand what the government is doing, and 
why it is doing it. Let us first look at the important issue of crime 
prevention. It is no surprise that the costs associated with crime 
in our country are enormous, both human and financial costs.
<P>
	We know that the United States is the only nation in the 
Western world which has a higher rate of incarceration than 
Canada. In 1991, the costs related to our police, courts and 
correctional services reached a staggering $8 billion. We know 
that the human costs of crime and fear of crime, including the 
consequences of victimization for communities, are also very 
high.
<P>
	The facts speak for themselves and we must adopt a 
comprehensive approach against crime in our society, one which 
recognizes the traditional role of our established organizations 
but also takes into account our social policies.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2423"> 2423 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	To be truly effective, crime prevention must tackle the social 
and economic factors linked to crime; it must go to the roots of 
the problem, which include poverty, unemployment, drug 
addiction and family violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that the human costs of crime and the fear of crime, 
including the effects of victimization on individuals in our 
society, are all too high. I believe the facts speak for themselves 
when I say that we must pursue a broad based approach to crime 
in our society, an approach that recognizes the traditional role of 
our established agencies, but also examines social policies.
<P>
	To be truly effective the prevention of crime must involve 
examining the underlying social and economic factors 
associated with crime and criminality, the root causes of crime 
such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, alcohol and 
substance abuse and finally violence, to name but a few.
<P>
	Fundamental to this approach is a shared responsibility 
among governments, their criminal justice systems, social 
service agencies, education systems and communities not only 
to fight crime but to deal with the social problems which 
ultimately lead to criminal activity.
<P>
	The establishment of a council on crime prevention that 
would bring key players together to address crime prevention 
and safety within our communities is one of the commitments of 
this government. It is one that the Solicitor General is working 
on in collaboration with the Minister of Justice. The council will 
serve as an advisory body to all levels of government on broad 
policy priorities and activities related to crime prevention.
<P>
	The composition of the council will reflect the wide variety of 
stakeholders in crime prevention and social development. To 
succeed then in our efforts to prevent crime and find practical 
solutions we must not only work in tandem with our partners in 
the criminal justice system but broaden our partnership to 
include our communities and neighbourhoods.
<P>
	Without this support we cannot present a strong and united 
front in solving the difficult problems that touch us all, whether 
our efforts are directed at family violence, youth at risk, 
illiteracy, high risk offenders stemming from the drug trade or 
eliminating hate crime. Crime prevention is also an important 
part of the work of the National Parole Board and Correctional 
Services of Canada. Both of these agencies are concerned with 
the safe reintegration of federal offenders, those who have 
served sentences over two years, in society.
<P>
	It is a fact that the majority of federal offenders, two-thirds, 
serve their sentence and do not break the law after being 
released into the community. Ensuring greater public safety for 
Canadians entails reducing the risk of those who do reoffend. 
Public safety remains the primary and constant factor of all 
correctional decision making. It is recognized that public safety 
is best served  when offenders are given the treatment and 
training they need to successfully reintegrate into the 
community.
<P>
	Correctional Services of Canada's life skills program for 
offenders is a good example of the type of fundamental work 
under way in our federal penitentiary system to help offenders 
acquire the skills they need to make a clean start in life.
<P>
	I said earlier that our approach to fighting crime is a two 
pronged approach. The other side of the public safety coin is the 
need to find more effective ways of dealing with repeat violent 
and sex offenders. Improvements to handling and treatment of 
these offenders in the federal corrections system is a priority.
<P>
	In its election platform the government recognized that 
Canadians want better protection from dangerous offenders and 
we are serious about following through on our commitment. 
Several reports, including those coming from inquests and 
Commons' committees on justice and legal affairs, have 
stressed the need for action in this regard.
<P>
	We are developing a series of amendments to the Criminal 
Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. For 
example, we are working on measures that would enable us to 
more easily detain until the end of the sentence repeat sex 
offenders who victimize children.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The Solicitor General has also stated that he wants to look at 
tightening up the sentence calculation process so that offences 
committed by repeat offenders on conditional release will result 
in more time served in penitentiaries.
<P>
	We are also reviewing with the provinces a number of 
measures which could improve public protection from high risk 
offenders, including the greater use by the provinces of the 
dangerous offender provisions at the time of original conviction 
and sentencing. As well, the federal government will take steps 
to address the release of high risk offenders into society at the 
end of their custodial terms.
<P>
	Society must protect itself from individuals who may be unfit 
for release and we are working with the provinces to deal with 
this issue in a way which is consistent with the charter.
<P>
	Also being studied are methods of bringing the corrections 
and mental health fields together in a co-ordinated and 
integrated manner. While supporting tougher measures for 
violent and repeat sex offenders we must also highlight their 
need for enhanced rehabilitation programs while in prison to 
reduce the chances of these individuals reoffending.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2424"> 2424 </A></B>
<P>
	The government in line with its red book commitment is 
putting various measures in place to improve the parole 
process. Among them are better training for National Parole 
Board members, legislative changes to better deal with those 
who are not performing satisfactorily and the requirement that 
members' appointments be based on merit, competence and 
integrity. After all, parole board members have a difficult and 
demanding job and only the best qualified people will be 
considered for future board positions.
<P>
	In recent years a relatively small number of well publicized 
cases involving high risk offenders on conditional release have 
done much to erode public confidence in the institutions that 
have been entrusted to protect society.
<P>
	In the parole system the Solicitor General is working to 
rebuild that public trust and restore that confidence. I believe 
the government's commitment to work to improve public safety 
from high risk offenders and to improve the parole process are 
firm examples of the type of action that will put us on the right 
track to win back that confidence.
<P>
	Another example is the government's commitment to address 
the issues of youth violence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I can of course only be concerned about the marked increase 
in violent crimes committed by young Canadians in recent 
years. We have all heard or read media reports on youth gangs 
and their criminal activities. Most incidents occur in large cities 
such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, but small 
communities are not completely immune to the problem.
<P>
	We do not yet know the real scope and seriousness of the 
problem of violence and criminal gangs among young people in 
Canada. According to some research on criminal justice, the 
crime rate among young Canadians is rising, but the rates for 
homicides and serious offences involving violence have 
remained relatively stable.
<P>
	The number of charges for minor assaults such as slapping, 
punching and kicking has significantly increased. However, we 
do not know if this reflects an actual increase in the number of 
violent offences, or if it simply means that victims are more 
inclined to go to the police, or that the police is more likely to 
lay charges.
<P>
	I want to be clear: I am not trying to minimize the problem of 
violence among young people, which is unfortunately 
worrisome. As a concerned citizen, I know how acts of violence 
can generate fear and intimidation in our communities.
<P>
	In its program to promote justice and fight crime, the federal 
government clearly states that one of its priorities will be to take 
action on the increase in violent offences and delinquency 
among young people. Canadians of all ages should be able to 
enjoy the fundamental right of being safe in public and private 
places.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last, I would like to turn to the issue of victim's rights. When 
the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
tabled the motion we are debating she was obviously unaware 
that victims have more rights under today's criminal justice 
system than at any other time in Canadian history. Victims of 
crime are now formally recognized as legitimate and essential 
players in the federal corrections and parole process.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	This recognition ensures that victims can be kept informed of 
an offender's prison and parole status if they so do request. 
Information from victims can now be considered at parole 
hearings and the victims may now attend parole hearings at the 
discretion of the parole board. No longer is their attendance 
dependent on the agreement of the defendant.
<P>
	Aside from these changes police services and courts across 
the country are now much more sensitized to the needs of 
victims and this sensitivity is embodied in guidelines and new 
police policies which reflect an understanding of victims and the 
emotional trauma that they have often suffered.
<P>
	These are positive and much needed changes. The 
government also recognizes that further change to accommodate 
the needs of victims is still necessary. As I said in my opening 
remarks we are not going to act in haste only to have to repent at 
leisure. When the government brings about change to the 
criminal justice system it will be lasting change, change that 
will stand the test of time.
<P>
	Last year we travelled across the country meeting and 
listening to thousands of Canadians and seeking their input as 
we built our electoral platform. We did not spend all that time 
reflecting, consulting and listening just to turn our backs on 
Canadians the moment we were elected to office.
<P>
	Canadians told us then and they are telling us now that they 
want change based on a thorough examination of all the issues, 
consultation with all interest groups, and a calm and rational 
appraisal and weighing of all the facts.
<P>
	That is the type of change that we are committed to bringing to 
the criminal justice system and that we are working for even as I 
speak. It is the type of change that Canadians expect and deserve 
and the type of change that the government will deliver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
attentively to the hon. member's speech. I found it an affront 
that this member would suggest we are asking for a quick fix.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2425"> 2425 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a newspaper clipping here that tells about an injustice 
that occurred to Mr. Howard Gowan from the Swift Current area 
of Saskatchewan where 27 years ago he was picked up by the 
RCMP and taken from his farm and interned in the Weyburn 
Psychiatric Centre where he underwent a month of electroshock 
and drug therapy. After that month was up he was released.
<P>
	The commissioner of the RCMP then sent him a letter 
expressing his sincere regrets, trusting he had not been 
inconvenienced and acknowledging that the RCMP member 
strictly speaking acted outside the authority provided by the 
Saskatchewan Mental Health Act. This man and his family have 
been striving for some degree of reconciliation with the justice 
system for 27 years without avail. I am sure that this man would 
find the comments of the hon. member quite hard to understand 
and accept.
<P>
	The weaknesses of the Young Offenders Act have been 
emerging over the last number of years and are clear to all who 
want to examine it. We have been waiting and waiting for some 
kind of action that would show up the weaknesses of that act. We 
are still waiting.
<P>
	I suggest that we have a cottage industry built around 
consultation in the justice system which simply results in delay 
and more delay. It was this government that produced the Young 
Offenders Act and the Conservative government that 
implemented it. Where was the leadership at that time when it 
came to enacting new laws? Where was the foresight and the 
vision that produced that kind of a flawed legislation?
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	We have talked, both in the House and privately with 
members, concerning the whole question of the mercy 
applications I have spoken about here and privately with the 
Minister of Justice where again there seems to be an inordinate 
amount of delay in the process of our justice system.
<P>
	Look at the stories in the newspapers today with regard to 
over 30 charges, indictments against Alan Eagleson by the 
American justice system. My examination of that case indicates 
that the law enforcement agencies in this country did nothing for 
long periods of time, which included the RCMP, the Toronto 
Metro Police and the Law Society of Upper Canada which is the 
law society of this province. They did nothing with the 
complaint information and nothing was done until the 
information was being looked into by the justice department of 
the United States of America. Only then was something done 
here.
<P>
	This motion is appropriate and I believe we are filling a 
proper role. We do not know what the justice department is 
doing at the present time. Understandably this is all done behind 
closed doors and it will be brought forward at a later date.
<P>
	Perhaps our job in bringing forward this motion is to put the 
pressure on the government and hold it accountable as is the 
rightful role of members in the opposition. I believe this motion 
is proper at this time.
<P>
	I would invite the hon. member's comments on anything that I 
have had to say in response to his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member raised a number of interesting 
comments.
<P>
	He should keep in mind that the percentage of incarcerated 
people in Canada is second to the United States. We should also 
add that there are costs, $8 billion a year. He is also telling us 
that the U.S. judicial system is somewhat better than the one that 
we have in Canada. When we look at the number of crimes, 
murders committed in the United States, it is nothing 
comparable to what we have here or anywhere else in the 
civilized world I should add.
<P>
	I am shocked that the hon. member is saying that they have a 
better system when we know in the city of Detroit there is more 
criminality going on in one year than all of Canada put together. 
Look at the statistics.
<P>
	I am asking the hon. member to check the facts. We have been 
here for four months. We have taken various initiatives. It is a 
very complex matter. We are dealing with aboriginals. We are 
dealing with children. We are dealing with all walks of Canadian 
life. It is not an easy issue to solve, granted. We know there are 
problems. There are cracks in the system.
<P>
	The initiative being taken by the government is to ensure that 
we close these gaps. That is why we need the co-operation of the 
opposition. We also need their compassion. That seems to be 
lacking with the party opposite, certainly with the member 
opposite who says he is appalled at the way we want to address 
this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I find it really offensive to hear the opposition 
member tell us that the American system is much better than the 
one we have here in Canada.
<P>
	In closing, I am convinced that the plan in the government's 
red book will make all Canadians more secure in the years to 
come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard everything today. Some members on this 
side want to separate while others seem to want annexation. 
There are some things that I do not understand.
<P>
	Still, we have been discussing this Reform Party motion since 
the morning and many speakers have talked about the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I would like the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to tell me which section 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects the 
rights of victims and whether there is a balance between the 
rights of victims and those of the accused.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not able to talk to you about the 
provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but I am here 
to confirm to hon. members that the government intends to deal 
with this rather sensitive situation.
<P>
	We know that the crime rate is rising in Canada. The other 
opposition party tabled a motion asking for a total change in the 
way we treat not only victims of violence but especially 
prisoners. I will simply remind it that the government's purpose, 
which I am sure the hon. member will applaud, is to strike a 
better balance in the penal system and justice system we have in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion presented by the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley on behalf of the Reform Party reflects in 
its wording and intent the obsessive fears of a society 
manipulated by certain media.
<P>
	What I find disturbing in this motion is that it is a perfect 
example of disinformation. It cultivates and takes advantage of 
a tide of public resentment. Clearly, the motion before the House 
today is an expression of the gothic fantasies of an extreme right 
that is not living in the real world. I hope the hon. member does 
not base her concept of what is wrong with society by listening 
only to public rumours.
<P>
	The motion asks us to condemn the government on two 
accounts. First, for its alleged inaction on reform of the criminal 
justice system and, second, because its penal laws allow the 
rights of criminals to supersede those of the victim.
<P>
	Every single word, idea and gratuitous statement in this short 
motion raises a host of questions. What we have here is a 
compendium of reactionary, preconceived ideas. While we are 
at it, we might as well blame the government for the terrible 
winter we just had. The Liberals were elected in the fall, 
remember.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is not over yet.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> And as the hon. member just said, winter is not 
over yet.
<P>
	According to this motion, we should reform the whole 
criminal justice system. Does the Reform Party know why it 
wants this reform? Does it have any alternatives to suggest? 
What does it not like about the system? We all have complaints 
about the judicial system. Saying the system is not perfect is one 
thing, but to say it should be overhauled, without suggesting any 
alternatives, is something else altogether.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party want to change our penal laws and the 
Criminal Code? Does it want to change the powers of the 
Minister of Justice, of our judges and lawyers? Is it dissatisfied 
with the procedure in the courts? Does it want to abolish the 
presumption of innocence? What does it want, Mr. Speaker? We 
do not  know, and I really wonder whether the Reform Party has 
a single constructive idea on the subject.
<P>
	If I understood the motion correctly, it raises the whole issue 
of the rights of criminals as opposed to the rights of their 
victims. Here again, the Reform Party is echoing public 
dissatisfaction. I think this House should remind them of certain 
facts and explain some of the centuries-old principles of our 
criminal law. For better or for worse, since the Magna Carta, 
Canada, the United States and all democracies that adhere to the 
British system of law have enshrined certain incontrovertible 
rules in their laws and judicial systems.
<P>
	The Reform Party is actually blaming the government for five 
centuries of Western jurisprudence. This may enhance their 
prestige with people who listen uncritically to what they have to 
say, but it is a clear demonstration of ignorance taken to 
rhetorical heights.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The presumption of innocence, to start with this absolute of 
our criminal law, protects and, unfortunately, will continue to 
protect for many centuries, all criminals in society. Our laws 
oblige the police arm of the state to prove that an accused person 
is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. The Reform Party cannot 
change this. It is the basis of our criminal law. Fortunately, that 
same rule of law also protects the honest citizen who is accused 
by the state.
<P>
	When we say rule of law, we also mean procedural fairness for 
all accused persons. Our civilized society does not condone 
lynching. At one time, in some parts of America, people were 
hanged on mere suspicion. People wanted a conviction at any 
price, so they took the law into their own hands, committing 
murder in the process. In these societies, the presumption of 
innocence, reasonable doubt, due process and the right to a fair 
trial were concepts as foreign as cellular telephones. Sometimes 
I wonder, when I hear this kind of motion, whether its movers 
realize we are more living in the era of the cellular telephone.
<P>
	The right to a fair trial is enshrined in the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. If the Reform Party wants to withdraw the 
fundamental constitutional document of this country, let it say 
so, and we will have an interesting debate on the kind of society 
we want. I am not sure Canadians are prepared to tear up the 
Charter, which represents what is universal in our society. How 
many citizens would follow the Reform Party in a crusade 
against the Charter? I think all the converts to this new religion 
would comfortably fit into a telephone booth.
<P>
	I agree that our democracy pays a very high price for 
protecting fundamental rights and democratic freedoms. I am as 
upset as the next person about abuses of a judicial system that is 
often defeated by criminals who are aware that its weaknesses 
are in direct proportion to the generous principles by which it is 
guided. I know that murderers, rapists and swindlers manage to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2427"> 2427 </A></B>
<P>
survive because they are able to take advantage of the rules of  
law that protect them as they protect all honest citizens. 
However, the Reform Party should have checked certain 
statistics, and especially one that is very reassuring. In this 
country, nine out of ten accused plead guilty or are found guilty. 
Ten per cent of accused persons are acquitted, and I am sure that 
even if any of these were guilty, the rule of law helped to prevent 
conviction of the innocent. That is democracy, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The Reform Party should have made certain distinctions in its 
motion and subsequent presentation. It should have told 
Canadians that the Criminal Code and the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act are two different things. It should have 
said that the Criminal Code cannot be any stricter than it already 
is. If the judge does not impose the maximum sentence provided 
under the Criminal Code, as often happens, his judgment is 
dictated by the circumstances. Every case before the court is 
different, and judges have wide discretion in sentencing a 
person who has been found guilty.
<P>
	We cannot say that the system gives criminals an unfair 
advantage in this respect. The police and the Crown prosecutors 
do their best with the resources they have. The courts hand down 
judgements. They are the judicial arm of the government. They 
are, and must remain, independent. When a judge hands down a 
judgement, he speaks as the judiciary power, not as the 
government. That is another fact that is often overlooked.
<P>
	I believe our Criminal Code is an effective instrument in the 
fight against crime. It will be amended again and as often as 
required by changing circumstances, but it reflects a 
contemporary social consensus on what constitutes 
reprehensible behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Once the sentence has been handed down, it is no longer the 
criminal justice system, but the Correctional Service, which is 
responsible for the individual who has been found guilty and 
sentenced to a prison term. I do not know if the Reform Party is 
calling for the repeal of the legislation governing the 
Correctional Service of Canada, but, hey, why not. And since we 
are considering reviewing all of the legislation governing the 
criminal justice system, why not simply throw everything out 
and start over, using the brilliant ideas of the right wing which is 
all-knowing since it has a direct line to God Almighty.
<P>
	I would have liked to see the Reform Party deliver an 
enlightened and motivating speech, a speech inspired by a 
serious review of the shortcomings of our criminal justice 
system. Yet, even when she expresses compassion for the fate of 
victims, the hon. member who presented the motion is using a 
well-worn argument. The hon. member could have pointed out 
that the Criminal Code allows a judge to order the guilty party to 
compensate his victim. He can do so at the moment of 
sentencing by ordering the persons found guilty to reimburse to 
the victim an amount equal to the value of the material damage 
suffered. The judge can also order the guilty  person, in a 
probation order, to compensate his victim for bodily harm 
inflicted. The courts have these powers. They are in the 
legislation. We can only encourage the system to use them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do I have time to continue?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You have at least one minute remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne: </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will not have time to 
finish, but I will continue, nonetheless. I would have liked to see 
the Reform Party give an objective speech. I would have liked it 
to focus not only on the public's dissatisfaction which itself is 
aroused, fuelled and sustained by the media which regards the 
public as someone it can easily win over. The public, whether 
rightly or wrongly, has a negative view of the protection which 
the courts afford victims of crime. It would be easy to go on and 
on about public sentiment, but we are being remiss in our duty as 
elected representatives when we use this dissatisfaction for 
purely political purposes.
<P>
	When they speak about victims, why do Reform Party 
members fail to mention that the purpose of the criminal courts 
is not to arrange compensation for victims, but, first and 
foremost, to punish the guilty, according to the applicable rules 
of law?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that you are about to rise.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock, perhaps the hon. member 
would agree to continue following oral questions.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed 
to Statements by Members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa west):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
International Women's Day and Week for 1994 have passed into 
history. Tragically what is still with us is the violence that has 
damaged the lives of more than half of Canadian women.
<P>
	One form of violence against Canadian women is sexual 
harassment. While 37 per cent of women experience sexual 
harassment, less than 40 per cent do anything about it because 
they feel they have no options.
<P>
	A survey in our Canadian forces shows these equally 
frightening statistics.

<P>
	Sexual harassment both reflects and perpetuates womens' 
economic inequality. Like other employers the federal 
government is legally responsible to ensure a workplace free 
of sexual harassment. Yet I continue to hear from victims of 
harassment who are often revictimized when they try to take 
action.
<P>
	I therefore urge ministers of the crown to take personal 
responsibility to ensure that in their departments zero tolerance 
is not just a pronouncement but a reality.

the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on its Canadian 
Newsworld Service broke into regular programming for an

dominating American television for weeks.

	Why are Canadians paying $1.1 billion per year to support the

concerned about the distribution of survivors' benefits under the 
Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
	A surviving spouse can be either a legal or a common law 
spouse to qualify for the survivor's benefit. A common law 
spouse must have been living in a conjugal relationship for at 
least one year. This is controversial because often a common law 
spouse gets all the survivor's benefits after a brief relationship. 
Meanwhile the legal spouse who was part of perhaps a much 
longer relationship gets absolutely nothing. This is just not fair. 
The government has already established the principle of 
dividing pension credits.
<P>
	In 1978 provisions were introduced into the CPP providing 
for the division of pension credit on divorce or annulment. In 
1987 this was extended to marriage breakdown resulting from 
separation.
<P>
	I urge the government to apply this principle to split 
survivors' benefits for legal spouses. Surely if this principle is 
sound for one, it is sound for another.

the federal government seems to pay little attention to those

Alcan in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region in return for the

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	In a surprising statement, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has 
announced that Canada will no longer tie Canadian foreign 
assistance to a country's human rights record. In so doing, the 
government is casting aside the policy announced at the 1991 
Commonwealth Summit in Zimbabwe and later reaffirmed at 
the Francophone Summit in Dakar, a policy which ties Canadian 
foreign assistance to respect for human rights.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the minister's statement that the 
government had a sudden change of heart and decided that from 
now on business comes first, even if it means willingly ignoring 
systematic human rights abuse in countries under dictatorial 
rule, just to establish trade relations with these countries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian government obviously has no intention of 
turning a blind eye to human rights abuse which may be reported 
in a certain number of countries around the world.
<P>
	In the speech I made before the House, and in the presence of 
the Leader of the Opposition, I very clearly expressed the desire 
to pursue, but in a different way, our goal of getting all countries 
to respect these most fundamental civil rights. I also stated that 
it was not wise or appropriate to sever our ties with countries 
which may not pursue the same democratic goals as we do.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that we are 
confronted with high unemployment which has to be dealt with, 
that our government's priorities are economic recovery and job 
creation and that, consequently, part of our economic recovery 
plan depends on greater efforts to promote international trade.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem is not with the minister's speech in this 
House, because it was an excellent speech espousing a very 
generous vision of Canada's contribution to restoring a kind of 
balance between countries of the South and the North. We even 
praised the minister for his magnanimous remarks. The problem 
is the surprise we had on hearing the minister say one thing 
outside this House, whereas he had said the opposite in this 
chamber. Outside the House, the minister said that Canada's 
trade policy was not tied to the issue of human rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2432"> 2432 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to know if the minister recognizes that this new 
policy, which he defined outside the House-because there are 
two policies, one for the House, and one for outside the 
House-would not have allowed Canada to take part in the trade 
embargo which ultimately brought about an end to apartheid 
in South Africa. Furthermore, should we expect Canada to ease 
the trade sanctions imposed on Haiti to force the return of 
President Aristide?

Speaker, I see that Bloc members are applauding their leader for 
expressing a desire to support President Aristide. They are well 
aware that the government is stepping up its efforts to bring 
about the Haitian President's return to his country as soon as 
possible. Therefore, in response to the opposition leader's 
question, obviously we will not yield on the sanctions issue. We 
will continue to push for President Aristide's return to his 
country.
<P>
	As for the other part of his question, as to whether what I said 
in this House differs from my statement outside the Chamber, I 
want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for praising my 
speech in the House. However, I would remind him that one 
should always proceed with caution and check to see if the 
newspapers have reported all, and not just some, of the facts.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, never in my five years in politics have I denied 
statements which the print media ascribed to me. I am not one of 
those who deny statements which the newspapers attribute to us.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there appear to be two policies, one for poor 
countries which are guilty of human rights violations-and 
here, Canada takes a very harsh stand-and another for wealthy 
countries which are also guilty of human rights violations. In 
their case, however, the government turns a blind eye.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not recognize that the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs was laying the groundwork for his trip to China, 
a wealthy country, when he made this statement outside the 
House? Could it be that the Prime Minister, in an attempt to 
restrict the focus of his trip to China to trade issues, was hoping 
not to have to deal with the human rights issue in China, even 
though dissidents have been waging an admirable fight to bring 
democracy to that country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have spoken with the President of China and each time Canada 
has diplomatic contacts with the Chinese, we remind them that 
we are not pleased with the human rights situation in their 
country. However, this does not mean that we will not do 
business with them.
<P>
	If the hon. Leader of the Opposition is telling us that we 
should have nothing to do with China, then we will take note of 
his position. However, if we refuse to do business with every 
country having a political system that is not to our liking, then 
we will not be doing business with very many countries. We are 
monitoring the human rights situation in China, but it is equally 
important-and this may be the best way to improve human 
rights in countries such as this-that we do business with them 
to open the country up to the world. This is the way to achieve 
democracy. This is precisely what happened with the Soviet 
Union. When the Soviets finally understood that human rights 
and democratic freedoms, as enjoyed by the Western world, 
were the right choice, that is when the Berlin Wall crumbled.

	According to information received from the publishing

Furthermore Mr. Pitfield confirmed recently that he had never

<P>
	Is the Minister of Canadian Heritage aware of the fact that Mr. 
Pitfield, the representative of CIDC on the board of directors of 
Ginn Publishing, has never seen a contract of sale between 
CIDC and Paramount, and can the minister tell us whether or not 
the deal has effectively been completed?

my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

<P>
	The minister has been consistently unable to define the 
government's vision of aboriginal self-government except to 
refer to vague generalities in the red book. I ask the minister, 
whatever new order of government is negotiated with 
aboriginals, can he assure the House that the spirit and the letter 
of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms will be respected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for that assurance.
<P>
	As the minister knows the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
guarantees everyone: aboriginal, non-aboriginals, Reformers, 
even the member for Athabasca, freedom of thought, belief, 
opinion and expression.
<P>
	How tragic it would be if a House which professes a profound 
respect for the charter would become the place where anyone 
who questions language policy is accused of being anti-Quebec, 
where anyone who questions immigration levels is denounced as 
being anti-immigrant and where anyone who questions a 
non-existent aboriginal policy is denounced as anti-Indian.
<P>
	Why should Canadians believe any of the minister's 
assurances regarding respect for the charter when he denounces 
members of Parliament who disagree with him as racist and 
rednecks.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, throughout the campaign and our 
four months here it is apparent we have a different philosophy 
and it usually involves groups at risk, whether it is linguistic 
groups in the province of Ontario where we have a half million 
francophones, whether it is women, whether it is aboriginal 
people or whether it is multicultural groups or whether it is what 
we talked about yesterday.

	The minister apologized for calling Reform supporters Indian 
haters a few weeks ago. Just one day ago he called a fellow

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government says that its decision to transfer training activities 
from the College in Saint-Jean to Kingston was motivated by 
the need to save money. Unfortunately, we cannot get any 
credible figures. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said in the 
House: ``I do not need to spend more money to see or to have 
experts tell me that we do not need three military colleges for 
65,000 members'' of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Considering that it will cost $6 million to maintain an empty 
building in Saint-Jean, that it will cost a lot more to train 
students in Kingston instead of in Saint-Jean and that the Prime 
Minister's project may end up costing a lot of money, is the 
Prime Minister not afraid that all these expenses will 
considerably reduce the amounts saved by concentrating officer 
training at the college in Kingston?

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, either the 
Prime Minister and his Minister of National Defence have the 
figures and they refuse to make them available to Canadians by 
tabling them here in the House or the Prime Minister made this 
decision to close the only francophone military college on the 
spur of the moment, to save his Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to answer this question. First of all, I want to say that 
Saint-Jean is not a French college but a bilingual college, like 
Kingston. And I am very pleased to hear that people who fought 
against bilingualism in Quebec are anxious to keep a bilingual 
institution in Quebec.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as I said before, we are making major spending 
cuts. The United States, with two million service men, have 
three military colleges. In Canada, we have 65,000, so we can 
dispense with two of our colleges. We have decided to 
consolidate the two bilingual  colleges, Saint-Jean and 
Kingston, and make one college in Kingston.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	I also think the hon. member will realize that, if he looks at 
this objectively, the defence cuts in Quebec were less severe 
than in other parts of Canada, and if I had acted on his leader's 
recommendations, we would have cut far more, because we did 
not cut 25 per cent of the defence budget.

is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	It is becoming clearer all the time that the minister does not 
understand the widespread concern over the meaning of 
aboriginal self-government. The minister must know there are 
several fundamentally different definitions of what 
self-government actually means. These range from the minimal 
concept of municipal government to the opposite extreme of 
absolute sovereignty as a nation state.
<P>
	Does the minister still not understand why so many Canadians 
both inside and outside the aboriginal community believe we 
must define at least some broad parameters around what is and 
what is not acceptable in the definition of aboriginal 
self-government before it can be agreed to even in principle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member. It is 
a very difficult subject.
<P>
	Self-government is something we are working with. That is 
part of our consultative process. As the hon. member knows, we 
have allocated $4 million for discussions over the next six 
months. There will be models evolving which are culturally and 
regionally sensitive. It will come.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member for two things: be patient and be 
constructive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, aboriginal 
self-government sometimes if not always is a frustrating issue. 
The minister has demonstrated time and time again his inability 
to control his emotions when dealing with it.

is very difficult for me to blame the minister of Indian affairs for

<P>
	The hon. member said that he was proud to be a redneck. He 
got up and said that a few minutes ago. Maybe he wants to 
withdraw what he said in the House. I never used that term 
myself. I invite the member from Edmonton and everyone else 
to be very generous with the diversity of this country.
<P>
	When I was in Edmonton, I knew it would not be a popular 
statement on his part but the premier of Alberta said that he 
believed it is a good thing for Canada to have a policy on 
bilingualism. To me it is not imputing motives to people who do 
not subscribe to that but I have been in public life for 30 years. 
The fact that we have two official languages in Canada is a good 
thing. I can see some progress because some members of the 
Reform Party apparently are taking French lessons. I am very 
happy about that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, we on this

ministers who are making inappropriate remarks.

Kahnawake of 143 families affected by the band council notice 
contradicts principles in the Indian Act as well as in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Quebec minister 
responsible for native affairs, Mr. Sirros, recommended that 
federal authorities issue an injunction to prevent this eviction.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Indian Affairs intend to take appropriate 
action to ensure that none of the 143 families are evicted from 
the Kahnawake territory, and not only the persons explicitly 
protected by the injunction currently in effect?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the information I had yesterday 
which I brought to the attention of the hon. member was on the 
main action. There is an injunction. It stays there until the court 
hearing.
<P>
	On the rest of the individuals, they received notice that if they 
sit tight it is up to the band to bring some type of judicial 
process. If the band does this then it is open to the rest to do the 
same thing and ask for the same type of injunction.
<P>
	As I understand the situation now, no one is being forced to 
move until after the court case. If the court case solves the 
problem, so be it. If the court case does not solve the problem 
then we will have to look at legislation.
<P>
	I do not think we should be interfering in a judicial process 
every time someone issues a writ. Under our custom and our 
creation we wait until a decision is rendered and deal with the 
decision accordingly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, will the 
government finally assume its twofold responsibility under both 
the Indian Act and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? How 
does it intend to respond to the Quebec minister, who refuses to 
negotiate on a discriminatory basis?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Again, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing to 
negotiate or legislate until the court deals with the issue.
<P>
	As I indicated several times it would be inappropriate for me 
to comment on this judicial process. Naturally I will be making 
comments on the outcome of the process.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. I raised this issue in the 
House several days ago.
<P>
	My question is based on the report that a researcher in 
Montreal has falsified information on breast cancer research. 
Incredibly it is suggested that he used patients in a study without 
their consent. The conclusions from this study have helped to 
formulate breast cancer treatment for the last 10 years.
<P>
	Could the minister assure the women of Canada that the 
treatments they are receiving are safe and the very best 
possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very much concerned with what happened in the report that 
has come out of Montreal.
<P>
	Let me assure Canadians first that no Canadian dollars were 
used to fund any of the research by this particular physician. 
Many other studies have proven the kinds of treatments being 
administered in Canada are good and effective in the treatment 
of breast cancer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
acknowledge the hon. minister's comments to me. Having said 
that then I am certain the hon. minister will definitely agree with 
the statement that I am now about to make.
<P>
	Women across the country are outraged by such an incident. 
The medical community has known about this for three years. 
The Canadian public has been misled by yet another health 
related cover-up.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be meeting early in the coming week with the Medical 
Research Council which governs the use of research dollars and 
the studies which come out of those research dollars.
<P>
	I am very interested in establishing some kind of practice 
guidelines for these kinds of reports in order that we can 
reassure Canadians that when these reports are made public they 
are indeed factual, using factual information and data.

	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
for the Minister of the Environment is about the recent spill of 
over 820 kilograms of the pesticide Busan-52 into the Winnipeg 
River by Abitibi-Price.
<P>
	Abitibi-Price took four days to report the spill. Meanwhile 
3,000 of my constituents who live on the Sagkeeng First Nation 
reserve and another 3,000 of my constituents in the Pine 
Falls-Powerview area were unaware that they may have been 
drinking contaminated water.
<P>
	What is the minister doing about this intolerable action by 
Abitibi-Price?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to meet 
with representatives of the band who obviously are very 
concerned about the negligence shown by Abitibi-Price in this 
particular case.
<P>
	Subsection 36(2) of the pulp and paper regulations makes it 
very clear that when there is a spill, the spill is to be reported 
immediately. In this case it is intolerable that the company 
waited four days before notifying authorities that 828 kilograms 
of this particular pesticide were dumped into a river which 
subsequently serves as drinking water for Canadians.
<P>
	We are vigorously investigating with provincial authorities. 
There are a series of charges being contemplated, both charges 
for non-reporting and charges for deleterious substances being 
released into the river system. We intend to report back to the 
member and to other interested members on this issue as soon as 
we have a final conclusion.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The electronic highway will have a major impact on many 
aspects of society such as consumer activity,  personal privacy, 
industry and education, to name only these. We have learned 
that the committee that will develop the government's strategy 
will meet behind closed doors.
<P>
	My main question is this: Given the electronic highway's 
strategic and determining role in the economy, how can the 
minister justify his decision to have this committee hold its 
discussions behind closed doors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
decided to have a consultative process with a committee, a fairly 
open process. All those with opinions to express can inform us if 
they wish; we even have an Internet address for submissions to 
help us prepare our policy on the electronic highway.
<P>
	I do not understand why the hon. member thinks that a 
committee must open all its business to the public. Perhaps 
when the Bloc wants to open the doors to its caucus discussions, 
we can consider it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a second 
question. To avoid looking too much like the Conservatives, 
whom the government denounced on many occasions in the past, 
does the minister not agree that the government should be more 
open and involve the public and Parliament in the work of this 
committee?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the member misunderstands what we are trying to do here.
<P>
	We have formed an advisory committee. Everyone in the 
country is not on it. Therefore by its very nature some people are 
going to be excluded. The process is multifaceted. There are 
many ways for people to express their points of view.
<P>
	With respect to the advisory committee itself, as we explained 
yesterday the committee will be receiving submissions from 
people as they wish. Reports as they become available will be 
made open to the public. For that matter, if the chairman and 
members of the committee wish to hold public hearings as far as 
I am concerned they are most welcome to do so.
<P>
	We want a process that is both functional and inexpensive to 
get us to the conclusion of this part of our policy development 
process as expeditiously as possible and as I am sure the member 
would like us to do.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Yesterday I asked the minister if she would table the 
guidelines that help to guide her department in the allocation of 
advertising contracts under her jurisdiction. I hope to get those 
guidelines sometime soon.
<P>
	When it is a sizeable contract, like the one that has been 
awarded to McKim Advertising in Winnipeg, surely the minister 
has conducted a detailed investigation into this or any 
prospective contractor, especially if the agency has come under 
new management just two weeks before the major contract was 
awarded.
<P>
	Was the minister personally aware of the political background 
of the new owner of McKim Advertising when she signed off the 
new contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me explain to the hon. member how this all works.
<P>
	McKim is the advertising agency on specific issues for my 
department. It was chosen through the competitive process 
prescribed in the government communications policy and 
overseen by the advertising management group of the 
Department of Government Services.
<P>
	By the way, this particular agency was chosen before this 
government came to office. Pending the review by government 
of contracting procedures for advertising companies, Health 
Canada was authorized to extend the contract to McKim for six 
months. It is not a huge contract. I believe yesterday the amount 
mentioned was $185 million. That is the whole tobacco strategy. 
This extension of contract is very small.

some of the blame on me for his government unacceptable 
abdication to the American giant Paramount.

	What he suggested is absolutely false. I have never been 
associated in any way with this issue. It is the minister's 
responsibility to name the anonymous entity behind which he is 
taking cover to justify this abdication on the part of his

redneck in my terms and I stick to it.

<P>
	Military police investigations into the incidents commenced

disposition by courts martial.

board of inquiry is completed. Phase two will not commence

one does not provide a lot of specifics. It simply tells us about 
how things should normally proceed from now on. But we want

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert has seven minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will now resume my comments on the Reform Party's motion. I 
was talking about damage and compensation suits that fall under 
the jurisdiction of civil courts.
<P>
	Several provinces have programs to compensate victims of 
crime. Provincial and federal legislation on this is still 
inadequate, I agree, but let us at least be honest in our remarks.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We all know that the judge in a criminal trial is not there to 
pass the sentence desired by the victim.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would ask the two hon. members to my 
right to maybe move to the back if they want to talk to each 
other. Thank you.
<P>
	As I was saying, we all know that the judge in a criminal trial 
is not there to impose the sentence we or the victim would like to 
hear but one that he deems fair and acceptable taking into 
account social standards and the circumstances of the case.
<P>
	That a victim or his or her loved ones are dissatisfied with the 
accused's acquittal or shocked by a light sentence is 
understandable. Many people see a criminal trial as legitimate 
revenge on a thief or an assailant. They identify with one side of 
the criminal trial and see themselves as prosecutors. For these 
people, the trial is a game between themselves and the accused. 
We must correct this mistake and not reinforce it through 
comments such as those made in today's debate.
<P>
	We must tell Canadians that the criminal justice system is 
adversarial. We have the public prosecutor on one side, the 
accused on the other, and the judge in the middle. And they all 
get together to decide if the evidence supporting the charge 
against the accused is conclusive.
<P>
	The victim is a witness, not a party at the trial. That is where it 
would be appropriate, in my opinion, to suggest major changes 
to the spirit of the Criminal Code and to court proceedings. That 
is what the Reform Party should say if it is sincere in its motion.
<P>
	Either the system remains as designed and victims continue to 
play the role of ordinary witnesses at trials, or the victim 
becomes a party in the proceedings. That is the true problem: 
victims as witnesses or as parties at the trial.
<P>
	I am convinced that we will not start a real debate on 
improving the lot of victims before the courts unless we make a 
radical choice between these two conceptions of the criminal 
justice system. Either the criminal trial remains a judicial 
inquiry where evidence is presented against the accused, whom 
a judge or a jury must find guilty or acquit after hearing the 
defence.
<P>
	Traditionally, the two opposing parties are the public 
prosecutor and the accused. Each party calls its witnesses who, 
in principle, are total strangers and independent in the case.
<P>
	In this system, the victim must testify on the events he or she 
experienced, mainly to identify the accused as the one who 
committed the crime.
<P>
	Once the evidence is presented, the accused is found guilty 
only if there is no reasonable doubt about the  essential facts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2442"> 2442 </A></B>
<P>
with which he is charged. That is our system. In most cases, it 
works when the evidence is conclusive.
<P>
	There is an alternative to this system which has reached its 
limits. We could now allow the victim to be a civil party in a 
criminal trial. If I understand what is behind the concerns 
expressed by the Reform Party, I believe that such a proposal 
would win immediate support from most of the public. I can 
very well imagine a victim participating actively in a criminal 
trial in support of the accusation, making representations on the 
sentence and demanding full monetary compensation for the 
material and physical damage suffered.
<P>
	In France, for example, the victim can be a civil party for such 
purposes and I do not see why we could not amend our criminal 
legislation to permit an active presence of all interested parties 
in a trial.
<P>
	The victim could be represented by lawyers, produce his or 
her own witnesses, question and cross-examine those brought 
by the Crown and by the defence, plead on the evidence 
presented, suggest the sentence or take part in negotiations; in 
short, participate in the whole judicial process and even appeal 
any judgement.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We found out the wording of the Reform Party's motion only 
late yesterday afternoon. I would have liked a little more 
research on the subject of the motion, but I excuse the Reform 
Party because I believe that the motion was improvised and 
made up just hours before. We will agree that it only conveys a 
vague criticism of the whole judicial system and of the 
underlying legislation.
<P>
	Still, I must admit that this slapdash motion gives us an 
opportunity to propose a major change in the spirit of criminal 
law to the government. I believe that the victim cannot be a mere 
passive witness outside the proceedings in which he or she 
should be a full participant, like the accused.
<P>
	I think that if people feel that criminals are better treated than 
their victims by the courts, this perception is largely due to their 
exclusion from the proceedings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. member. I 
was anxious to hear it. At first I was under the impression that 
she was a newly elected member such as myself who has been 
here for only a little while. Shortly after listening to the 
beginning of her speech I began to realize that she was not a 
newly elected member because she was running on with the 
rhetoric we have heard over and over from various members 
who have been here in the past.
<P>
	It is the same kind of thing we hear constantly. Things are 
going well. We have a great system. We do not need changes. 
She was making statements that had nothing whatever to do with 
the motion before the House but was  suggesting that the motion 
states that a fair trial for criminals should be eliminated.
<P>
	On searching the motion I cannot see anywhere it suggests 
anything like that. We are trying to say that in a number of cases, 
and it is an unlimited number, we have evidence that the rights 
of the victim are being overrun by the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	I would ask the member the same question which I referred to 
earlier. To give a lady in Montreal peace of mind, to give her the 
ability to continue the healing process she is going to have to go 
through after being raped a number of times by an individual, 
she requested the perpetrator be tested for AIDS so she could at 
least eliminate that from her worries. The courts in our system 
ruled that the criminal did not have to submit a sample to 
determine if he had AIDS and the request from the victim was 
denied.
<P>
	Had the hon. member been the person to make the choice I 
would like to know if she would honour the request of the victim 
and have the criminal tested for AIDS or would she make the 
decision the court made, that the criminal did not have to submit 
under his rights under the charter.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, we keep saying that we are here 
as legislators and nothing else. So, I will not put myself in the 
shoes of a judge and, based on the very succinct summary of 
facts presented by our colleagues, tell you what I would have 
done. First of all, I would need to be apprised of all the facts, as a 
judge would, before I could hand down a judgement. I think that 
it is inappropriate to ask me what I would have done in the place 
of a judge, since I did not get to hear all the witnesses as the 
judge did at the time. I think that the hon. member's question is 
totally unjustified.
<P>
	On the other hand, the member's comment tends to indicate 
that the system is flawed. That is exactly the point I made in my 
speech. In case the hon. member did not hear, I will repeat what I 
said, because that is exactly what I said: our system is flawed 
and there certainly is room for improvement. In fact, I brought 
up a suggestion whereby the victim would no longer be just a 
victim but rather take an active part in the proceedings. I think it 
was an interesting proposal, at least that was my opinion, but 
that may not be what the hon. member heard. So, this is my 
answer to the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with some interest to the first part of 
the hon. member's comments. I was a little surprised to hear her 
criticizing the motion that is before the House. It talks about 
changing that which has been part of the Canadian system over 
centuries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2443"> 2443 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it that when my party talks about changing something 
because we feel it is not serving its purposes that we are 
criticized and yet the party that she represents is questioning 
the whole make-up of the country because it does not believe 
that it is justified? How can she criticize us for wanting to 
change the justice system when she wants to change the whole 
fabric of our country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member heard 
correctly. I did criticize the motion, which is very vague and is 
reminiscent of what any small tabloid would use as a main 
headline. That is what prompted me to say this motion was 
haphazard, disjointed. It is like saying that we are all in favour 
of virtue and hate winter. In fact, that is very much the style of 
this motion. I made an effort to debate it in an intelligent and 
appropriate manner because I found it to be incredibly general. 
That is why I criticized it the way I did.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak against the motion of the hon. member.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Burlington I spent much of 
my election campaign discussing these issues. As previous 
speakers on this side have quite rightly pointed out, the 
government has barely passed the 100-day mark in office.
<P>
	My constituents are very concerned about justice issues. They 
are also concerned about crime. They look to the government to 
address these issues and they want changes that will have a 
positive impact on Canadian society.
<P>
	The government has just assumed its position. We have only 
been here for 100 days but we have already signalled quite 
clearly and the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General 
have forcefully stated that we are committed to action to reform 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
	I speak here of balanced, thoughtful reform that addresses the 
needs of Canadians for protection and Canadians' belief in 
compassion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must remind hon. members that this government has already 
provided full details on its policy concerning criminal and 
justice issues. Even before the election, we laid down our 
agenda for reforming the criminal justice system once we would 
be in office.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	This agenda reflects the expectations of Canadians, as they 
have expressed them. The Liberal Party has consulted the people 
of Canada and obtained their full support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a party we said explicitly what action we intended to take 
on a range of issues, issues such as young offenders, crime 
prevention, gun control, prostitution, sentencing and 
rehabilitation of sex offenders, violence against women and 
children, and we talked about parole.
<P>
	The range of issues speaks volumes. It cries out for a 
comprehensive approach, one that considers root causes, that 
thinks of prevention as a key element of every solution, not just 
shutting the barn door after the horse has gone.
<P>
	That does not mean, as the hon. member opposite would have 
us think, that considered approaches somehow place the rights 
of criminals over the plight and the rights of victims. This is a 
cant. This is a one dimensional perspective that does not stand 
up to scrutiny.
<P>
	As I have said, we have already signalled clearly that we 
intend to follow through on our promises. The Minister of 
Justice and the Solicitor General have indicated that work is 
already well in progress on these areas. This work will reform 
our system so that the victims of crime, the public, both 
specifically and in the larger sense, are first, the paramount 
consideration in the operation of our criminal justice system.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has indicated in the House that he 
intends to bring in amendments to the Young Offenders Act. The 
Solicitor General has said here and elsewhere that he intends to 
bring forth amendments to the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.
<P>
	I am pleased that all the foregoing topics are on the agenda 
next week at the meeting of federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers of justice which both the Minister of Justice and the 
Solicitor General will attend. The government has also signalled 
its intent to bring forth amendments to sentencing, again with 
the intent of improving the lot of victims during the judicial 
process.
<P>
	Probably the most crucial plank in our paper on crime and 
justice issues had to do with crime prevention. I am pleased that 
we are working on the elimination of root causes of crime. Many 
of Canada's criminals have known a life of poverty and 
inequality, an environment that taught them little about positive 
conflict resolutions, an environment quite unfamiliar to many 
members of the Chamber.
<P>
	I am pleased we are focusing on a national crime prevention 
program because we can perhaps make the biggest strides in 
helping victims there. I believe we must do our utmost to ensure 
that as few Canadians as possible become victims of crime in the 
first place.
<P>
	Members opposite would have us believe that one 
dimensional answers such as increasing the rate and length of 
incarceration would be a key solution. We already have one of 
the highest incarceration rates in the world. If locking up people 
was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2444"> 2444 </A></B>
<P>
measure of absence of crime we would be one of the most crime 
free countries  in the world. As I have said, we are looking at 
approaches that address underlying causes of crime and that 
integrate crime prevention strategies.
<P>
	Law enforcement has been the traditional mainstay of crime 
prevention strategies, but law enforcement is not enough on its 
own and that has been demonstrated. Experience shows that for 
truly effective crime prevention law enforcement must be 
integrated with social development, including social programs 
and better education, community level participation in crime 
prevention and in crime solutions, not just locking up people.
<P>
	Burlington as part of the Halton region has been extremely 
successful in its crime prevention strategy. Under the direction 
of Chief Harding, Burlington in the Halton region has become 
the safest community in North America. Block Parent programs, 
community involvement in conflict resolution strategies and 
incorporating support groups such as rotary clubs ensure that we 
will have a multipronged approach to crime prevention.
<P>
	It is important to remember as well that Burlington has seen 
some very sensational crimes and has been wracked as a 
community by crime. Two of our young women died very 
violent deaths: Nina de Villiers and Leslie Mahaffy. Kristen 
French from down the highway a ways was found in our 
community. We were all brought home very horribly one 
summer to the reality of violence in our communities.
<P>
	However, the government recognizes that when incarceration 
is the only solution to protect the public it is in fact what we 
must do.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The Solicitor General has promised tough measures for repeat 
sex offenders and high risk offenders who offer little hope of 
immediate rehabilitation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General has enumerated the reforms the minister shall 
be bringing forth to offer better protection from those who 
would prey on the vulnerable. He has also noted that the 
government does not intend to give up on these offenders.
<P>
	Surely the mark of a civilized society is how it treats its 
offenders. Communities need to become participants in the 
process of safely reintegrating offenders into Canadian society. 
Rehabilitation programs need to be expanded and improved so 
that offenders return to our communities with a much lower risk 
of reoffending. We need more victims aid programs, to be sure, 
and our crime and justice paper focused on that concern. It also 
identified the need for more public education and research on 
criminal justice, recidivism, crime prevention and alternatives 
to incarceration and victims aid.
<P>
	Surely a grave cause of concern in the area of victims of crime 
is the suffering caused by violence within our families. Family 
violence results in a great many victims, both directly and 
indirectly. I believe we are paying a very high cost for allowing 
such violence to continue. We have pledged as a government to 
do our utmost to break the cycle of family violence.
<P>
	Statistics demonstrate the undeniable link between sexual 
abuse of girls in their own families and prostitution. Many of 
Canada's prostitutes are also drug addicts, condemned to a very 
dangerous life because of the misfortune of being born into an 
abusive family.
<P>
	I believe the Reform motion is motivated out of fear. While 
we cannot ignore the very real fear and the very justified fear 
some Canadians feel, we must temper it with rationality. As a 
woman I am aware that I can become a victim in two ways. 
Merely because I am a woman I am more vulnerable to assault 
including sexual assault and, second, the fear of crime takes 
away my freedom. Like other vulnerable groups, children and 
the elderly, women must always be conscious of their 
environment on the streets, at home and at work. We must think 
of these issues all the time. We must never let our guard down. 
Sometimes it is exhausting; always it is unfair.
<P>
	The member speaks of elderly women at home and afraid. I 
too am very concerned about this issue, not just because I have a 
significant number of single and elderly women in their homes 
in Burlington. I also recognize that at one point I too will be one 
of those women. However, I am encouraged that some of our 
young women are starting movements and marches such as 
``Taking Back the Night''. My old high school in Hamilton, 
Cathedral Girls, organized such a march after the death of Nina 
de Villiers.
<P>
	I am also aware that pornography, killer cards and sometimes 
advertising campaigns which present women as objects rather 
than as persons deserving respect and safety, encourage 
violence against women.
<P>
	As a nation we must address these issues. We must educate 
our young people to respect others, to respect their person and to 
respect their property. The government must lead that 
discussion. We must enact laws that reflect our abhorrence of 
violence against women, against children and against the 
elderly. These are the issues we must address if we are to ensure 
the rights of victims. I hardly think we can be expected to 
redress imbalances in these complex issues overnight, but we 
can be expected to think long and deep about solutions and to 
ensure these solutions are comprehensive in scope.
<P>
	There are many crimes, many victims of crime, and many 
causes for such crimes. That is what our crime and justice issues 
paper recognized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2445"> 2445 </A></B>
<P>
	Any knee-jerk reaction that promises to help victims is 
doomed to failure. I do not condemn the outrage crime causes, 
especially to its victims. On the contrary. What I do condemn, 
however, is offering simplistic solutions to complex 
inderdependent and intertwined problems of society. For 
example, perpetuating the perception that all criminals are 
violent is grossly misleading, as is the myth that the system is 
somehow dedicated to the rights of criminals over the public.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Maintaining that solutions to crime simply involve the 
criminal justice system getting tougher, meaner, stiffer, is to 
offer totally inadequate and in the end bankrupt answers. In fact 
such a philosophy will prevent us from ever getting to and fixing 
the root causes of crime and victimization. As long as we 
pretend to the public that there is the possibility of easy answers 
we cannot count on its support and participation in the search for 
a multidimentional solution to crime will be limited.
<P>
	I will concede and even argue that the public is increasingly 
concerned about crime and about being victimized. That is why 
the Liberal Party took the unprecedented step of laying out a 
comprehensive crime and justice agenda almost one year ago. 
The government plans to act deliberately, methodically and 
systematically with this agenda. I for one will be an active 
participant.
<P>
	We do not wish to rush in with hastily drafted laws, with a 
scatter-gun approach, so that when the smoke has cleared 
something would not measure up. These are crucial issues. They 
need to be carefully addressed, closely studied by Parliament 
and properly debated. They need a wider public airing in cities, 
in towns, in villages and in neighbourhoods, and often even 
within families.
<P>
	In the end we will be measured by what we accomplish, not by 
what we promise. We will proceed in a measured pace with our 
agenda, an agenda I remind members that recognizes the 
complex nature of crime, its origins, and the corresponding need 
for proper solutions.
<P>
	The Canadian public expects solutions from the government 
and we will deliver on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member's comments. Her approach is very 
generous and her objectives noble. I know that she is not a 
Cabinet member, but I would appreciate it if she could elaborate 
on some comments she made concerning young people and 
prevention.
<P>
	As the opposition's youth critic, I have a particular interest in 
this issue. Young people are often described as being a problem 
when, in fact, they are the human resources of the future. I 
believe it is very important to have programs, especially for 
first-time young offenders, to rehabilitate them, to help their 
social reintegration, so that they can become productive 
citizens.
<P>
	I want to make a comment before the hon. member answers. I 
notice that, in spite of the observations made by government 
members in general, a whole slew of measures, such as 
legislation on young offenders, juvenile prostitution, etc., are 
announced by the government. Yet, when we ask why nothing is 
done, we are invariably told about how difficult it is to 
implement even existing legislation. There is nothing wrong 
with suggesting a new piece of legislation, and parliamentarians 
will certainly co-operate, but it is obvious that the government 
has some problems with implementation.
<P>
	I now go back to my question, which is: What specific 
measures will the government take for prevention and 
rehabilitation?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. This is a pressing issue in my riding and I often 
referred to it in the election campaign.
<P>
	I believe there is a serious problem. We seem to be saying in 
our committee that there is a problem with young people, that 
young offenders are really dangerous, that they are terrible 
children, that they murder people, etc. This is not fair since it 
does not apply at all to the young people I know. We must do 
something about this notion some members have in our 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	There is a problem with some young people. When a young 
person breaks the law, it must be recognized that such an offence 
will have consequences, and it must be understood that there are 
laws in our society and that they must be respected.
<P>
	We often hear some people say that they would like to see 
young offenders appear before an adult court, which I think is 
very dangerous. I have a problem with that approach. I think that 
if you send a young man to Millhaven, you are only giving him 
the opportunity to become a smarter criminal which, I think, is 
terrible. This government discussed amendments to current 
laws with provincial justice ministers, because provinces are 
responsible for rehabilitating children and young people.
<P>
	It must be spelled out in the Act that some young people are 
dangerous and we must have another approachor them, I think. 
We must have specific rules on this.
<P>
	I think we must review changes to the system by having, for 
instance, a record that would follow these young people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will have to speak in English on this part or I am going to get 
myself into trouble.
<P>
	We have to change it so that there is a record kept on youth 
who have committed crime, especially when they are very 
dangerous. We have to ensure that society is protected and that 
in some cases the record is not wiped out. In some cases we 
could do a better accounting of these young people and ensure 
that they do not get caught up in worse crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2446"> 2446 </A></B>
<P>
	However, in terms of crime prevention I think we can do a 
lot through education and by removing the root causes of crime. 
I mentioned family violence in my speech. Kids learn this stuff 
at home and from television sometimes. They learn it from an 
environment that is hostile to many people in our communities. 
They learn that it is okay to be violent against women.
<P>
	All of us have to take responsibility for that and we have to 
change that system. We have to tell kids that it is not okay, that 
they can resolve conflict by discussing things, by coming to 
resolutions, by using alternative methods whether it is in the 
school yard, in the family or with others as they grow up.
<P>
	I think we can do a lot as a nation about improving our society 
if we can address that. We as a community have done very well 
in Burlington on some of that. I have been pleased by some of 
the initiatives in the greater Burlington area and the greater 
Hamilton area that have incorporated Rotary Clubs and school 
children and teaching them this sense.
<P>
	However, we do have to address those issues.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, I think 
the hon. member missed some of the point in the motion of the 
Reform Party today, the point being that when there is a question 
of whether the convicted person's rights are to be weighed 
against the victim's rights that the victim's rights should 
supersede in every instance.
<P>
	The member referred to prevention as far as crime is 
concerned. That is great. That is exactly the route that we have to 
go in the long run.
<P>
	If your house were burning down, I suppose you should at 
some time figure out what caused that, but before you do that 
you should put out the fire. That is kind of what we are facing 
here today.
<P>
	We have problems with young offenders particularly. I would 
ask the hon. member if she agrees with the way young offenders 
are treated today, especially repeat offenders who are not tried in 
adult courts. I know she made some allusion to adult court 
treatment. Nobody in the Reform Party, by the way, agrees with 
incarcerating young offenders in facilities like Millhaven.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I gather the hon. 
member is asking the hon. member for Burlington to respond. 
With unanimous consent I can give the member a couple of 
minutes to respond, if she wishes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> I do not think that I in fact missed the comments 
in the motion.
<P>
	I think there is a perception perhaps by some members of our 
community, and some members of the Reform Party, that 
suggests that the house really is on fire and that we are all 
running from it at this very moment. That is not correct.
<P>
	I have heard hon. members say that people are falling left and 
right every day. That is not what is happening in Canada. That 
might be happening in the United States and I certainly will be 
working to make sure that our community of Canada is never 
like the United States. But the house is not on fire. There is 
smoke in one of the rooms, maybe in two rooms, but the house is 
not on fire.
<P>
	We have to address the right of victims. I for one believe that 
we have to consider victim impact statements. In Burlington 
CAVEAT and other groups addressed this issue and they are 
working on solutions with the government.
<P>
	I do not buy this perception and the encouragement of this 
perception that we are all at risk all the time. I am probably at 
risk most of the time, but we have to recognize that there is a 
careful balance. I do not want this government to turn around 
and have knee-jerk reactions to everything that is going on. We 
need to have a very careful balance. We need to have a 
methodical approach. Otherwise we run the risk of making 
mistakes that will only further encourage crime in our 
communities and I do not want that.
<P>
	I will be encouraging the minister, as I have on many 
occasions, as he will say. I think we are big enough to address 
crime prevention as well as some of the issues related to the 
Young Offenders Act and current criminals, as well as 
prevention and removing some of the root causes of crime. I 
think we can handle the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very 
strong motion. It is strongly worded in that it condemns the 
present system. Condemn is a strong word, but the people of 
Canada are in fact doing that.
<P>
	Certainly in my area of the country they are condemning 
various aspects and portions of the criminal justice system that 
turns murderers and rapists out on the street to commit those 
offences again, that cannot even hold 10-year-olds accountable 
for criminal conduct. These are some of the things that I will be 
touching on in my speech.
<P>
	I am sure the Young Offenders Act was not a knee-jerk 
reaction. It was well thought out and planned by the previous 
Liberal government. We see the fruits that are being borne by 
that ill-conceived piece of legislation, at least in parts of it 
where now it has to be reformed. I ask, as I asked before in this 
House, where was the leadership and where was the vision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2447"> 2447 </A></B>
<P>
	Past and present governments inaction with regard to the 
reform of the criminal justice system, which is of course the 
topic of today's opposition motion, is of particular concern to 
me.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I rise today to speak about a section of the Criminal Code 
which I believe is a blatant example of the growing disregard for 
the rights of victims versus the rights of criminals.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code, which gives convicted 
murderers access to the courts to seek a reduction in the number 
of years they must serve in prison before being eligible for 
release on parole, is a prime example of this disregard and 
makes a mockery of the term life imprisonment.
<P>
	I would like to briefly provide members of this House with a 
history of this section of the Criminal Code. Murder was first 
classified as capital or non-capital in 1961. Before then only 
one punishment was prescribed for murder which was the death 
penalty. After 1961 only capital murder was punishable by 
death. This was the murder that was planned and delivered for 
the murder of a police officer or a prison guard. This was further 
reduced and only the killing of a police officer was punishable 
by death.
<P>
	Persons convicted of non-capital murder were sentenced to 
life but were eligible for parole after seven years. However, this 
too changed and after 1967 all those serving a life sentence for 
murder could not be recommended for parole before serving at 
least 10 years.
<P>
	In 1974 amendments were made to the Criminal Code which 
allowed the sentencing judge to increase the parole eligibility 
period to a maximum of 20 years. On February 24, 1976 Bill 
C-84 was introduced to abolish the death penalty and to create 
two new categories of murder, first and second degree murder, 
both of which carry the minimum sentence of life imprisonment.
<P>
	Those convicted of first degree murder would serve 25 years 
before being eligible for parole, while second degree murderers 
would serve between 10 and 25 years prior to parole eligibility.
<P>
	Apparently the 25 year minimum penalty was the trade-off 
for achieving the abolition of the death penalty. Instead of the 
death penalty, society was to be protected by incarcerating 
murderers for a minimum period of 25 years. Prior to Bill C-84, 
death sentences commuted to life imprisonment had resulted in 
an average of only 13.2 years served prior to release on parole.
<P>
	Contained within Bill C-84 was a clause which created 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. Although first and second 
degree murderers are not eligible for parole for 25 years, under 
section 745 after 15 years murderers can apply for a parole 
review which effectively decrease their sentence.
<P>
	Section 745.(1) of the Criminal Code reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where a person has served at least fifteen years of his sentence-he may apply 
to the appropriate Chief Justice in the province in which the conviction took place 
for a reduction in his number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for 
parole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In my opinion section 745 makes a complete mockery of the 
so-called life sentence. It provides what one parliamentarian 
said: ``A glimmer of hope, if some incentive is to be left when 
such a terrible penalty is imposed on the most serious of all 
criminals''. This former parliamentarian obviously had no 
consideration whatsoever for the victims of murder or their 
families.
<P>
	What murderer in this country has ever given his victim or his 
victim's family a glimmer of hope? When a murderer takes an 
innocent life it cannot be returned. The victim cannot be brought 
back to life, and likewise when a murderer is given life 
imprisonment it should mean exactly that, life, with no glimmer 
of hope nor any incentive to ease the burden or the severity of 
the punishment for this awful crime.
<P>
	The glimmer of hope advocates have made a farce of our penal 
system by extending to murderers a right they denied to their 
victim. Section 745 had not been reviewed until 1991 and 1992 
when two private members' bills were introduced in the last 
Parliament challenging the existence of section 745.
<P>
	This morning the hon. member from York South-Weston 
introduced a private member's bill to get rid of this law which 
gives convicted killers a chance for early parole. I would like to 
tell the hon. member that he has a great deal of support from our 
party for that bill. I am confident he will also have the support of 
many Canadians, including the Potts family of Hamilton, 
Ontario, whose daughter was murdered 15 years ago by Norman 
Joseph Clairmount.
<P>
	In 1978 Clairmount was handed the statutory life sentence 
with no chance of parole for 25 years for the brutal and savage 
murder of the innocent 19-year old Potts girl.
<P>

	On February 8, 1993 an Ontario jury deliberated less than 
three hours before deciding to reduce the number of years. This 
murderer is eligible for parole in 18 years instead of 25 years. 
Because of section 745 and the jury's finding in favour of 
Clairmont, he was immediately eligible to apply to the National 
Parole Board for unescorted, temporary absences. He is now 
eligible to apply for full parole in 1995 instead of the year 2002.
<P>
	This is not an isolated case. A number of convicted murderers 
have been successful with their section 745 applications.
<P>
	Brian John Boyko of B.C., convicted in 1974 of capital 
murder, won a reduction in the period of parole ineligibility to 
16 years from 20 after a 1990 hearing.

<P>
	At a 1990 review hearing in Winnipeg, Larry Sheldon, 
convicted in 1974 of non-capital murder in the rape-murder 
of a nine-year old girl and sentenced to life imprisonment 
without parole for 20 years won a reduction to 17 years.
<P>
	Convicted of first degree murder in the shooting of a Calgary 
policeman during a credit union hold-up and hostage taking in 
1976, William John Nicols won a reduction of his parole 
ineligibility period to 20 years at an Alberta hearing.
<P>
	Jean-Louis Rodrigue, convicted of second degree murder in 
the killing of a Montreal peace officer, Charles Simard who 
murdered two teenagers and convicted killer Gilles Levine, all 
of Quebec, won reductions in their parole ineligibility period to 
15 years.
<P>
	Also in Quebec, Real Chartrand, sentenced to hang in 1972 for 
killing a police officer after an armed robbery, obtained full 
parole after serving 17 years of his sentence because of section 
745.
<P>
	There have been numerous applications made under section 
745 of the Criminal Code. Some murderers have been successful 
and some have not but those who have not can make application 
again and again, all at a tremendous cost to the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Under section 745(1) the convicted person must apply to the 
chief justice of the province in which the conviction took place. 
The jury review must take place in the same province which 
means the inmate must be transported to the appropriate 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association believes this is only the 
beginning. It says that approximately 655 murderers over the 
next 15 years and as many as 180 in the next four will apply for 
early parole under section 745. This, it contends, will 
effectively reduce a life sentence by about 40 per cent. In other 
words, killers could serve just over half of their 25 year 
sentences. This raises two important concerns.
<P>
	The first is with regard to the financial aspects and the second 
involves the integrity of the criminal justice system. Repealing 
section 745 will result in an enormous reduction in the costs 
associated with holding jury reviews and in transporting 
inmates to the province in which they were convicted.
<P>
	The greater issue at the heart of this matter and the purpose of 
today's opposition motion is that the criminal justice system is 
allowing the rights of the criminal to supersede those of the 
victim.
<P>
	Section 745 is a prime example of this fact. It gives a 
convicted killer the right to apply for a reduction in his sentence 
in which a jury reviews only selected evidence-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Madam Speaker, I see 
from the hon. member's speech that he has spent considerable 
time and effort in doing research and obtaining statistics.
<P>
	Could he tell the House if he spent an equal amount or any 
effort in looking at some of the proposed measures in crime 
prevention that have been studied by committees of the House in 
the past? Has he reviewed any of the recommendations in 
looking at whether any of the measures would be of assistance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to be as 
straightforward and frank in answering questions as possible. I 
will try not to duck them or dodge them.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to make specific reference to the 
reports and surveys that have been done. I spent 14 years as a law 
enforcement officer and we looked at all sorts of plans and 
programs in the area of prevention. I support any program that 
will successfully provide results in the area of prevention.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I know that the Young Offenders Act was designed to do that. I 
know that some of these other measures were designed to do 
that. However, I would advise the hon. member that mercy does 
not rob justice. When very serious acts are committed against 
individuals which denies them freedom to move and takes their 
lives in many cases, then there must be an appropriate penalty. If 
through our desire and feelings for mercy we create a justice 
system that is not going to hold an individual accountable for his 
or her acts, then do not expect the system to prevent crimes of 
that nature as a result of the sentence that is imposed. That 
simply will not work.
<P>
	If we do not to enforce the law in areas where there is law, if 
we do not amend those areas that do not hold people accountable 
for their actions such as in the area of the Young Offenders Act 
and I refer specifically to 10 year-olds, all the preventive 
programs in the world are going to fail. We have tried many of 
them.
<P>
	I hope my answer satisfies the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to intervene and comment for the purpose of 
clarifying the section 745 provision and ask a question of the 
member. I have considerable sympathy for his position on this 
issue and how his views relate to the position of victim, which is 
of course the way the opposition motion is phrased today.
<P>
	The section 745 provision enables someone who has a 25 year 
minimum incarceration to ask a jury if they might have an 
earlier parole eligibility date than the 25 years. A person who is 
sentenced to life imprisonment has a sentence for life. 
Therefore, it is parole eligibility that is shortened not 
necessarily the sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2449"> 2449 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the member comment on how that would relate to the 
position of victims, victims beyond the person who is dead of 
course. I guess we are talking about family when we talk of 
victims of a murder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. I was not able to complete my speech. Perhaps if I 
had I would have been able to cover that area. The concerns 
raised by members of families of murder victims, when they see 
the murderer released early, are very significant. We would like 
to see provisions whereby the victim's family can appear and 
testify at the section 745 hearings. We would like that section 
removed. I would like to see it removed entirely.
<P>
	The hon. member brings up a good point of whether or not a 
parole should be granted to someone who is sentenced to 25 
years in prison. Those who have advocated section 745 and 
would advocate the retention of it would say yes. But then where 
do we stop?
<P>
	If the murderer in court says: ``I am sorry and I will never do it 
again'' should that mean we should release the person? Or 
sentence the person to a month imprisonment? I think there is an 
area of penalty here that we must address and I do not think the 
system is addressing it.
<P>
	I hope I have answered the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to take part in the debate today. I would like to 
commend the hon. member for Crowfoot on his comments. I did 
not know until he spoke just now that he was formerly a member 
of a law enforcement agency. I would like to say that in my years 
as a practitioner of law, both as a defence counsel and as a 
prosecutor, I worked extensively with members of various 
police departments; municipal police in Halifax and Dartmouth 
and the RCMP, and I have great respect and admiration for them 
in what is a very tough job. I know that the hon. member has 
obviously worked in that area and knows what a tough job it is.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I want to make perfectly clear that I am not specifically 
referring to the member for Crowfoot here, I am referring to the 
resolution itself but when we debate these matters we tend to 
forget the basis on which our law is built and the fact that the 
system which we live under and the system that governs us is, at 
best, faulty. But it appears to be in the evolution of both politics 
and law enforcement the best thing we have come up with thus 
far.
<P>
	I look at the words of the resolution: ``That this House 
condemn the government for its inaction with regard to the 
reform of the criminal justice system, in particular its allowance 
of the rights of criminals to supersede those of the victim''.
<P>
	I guess I have to say that the resolution is almost charming in 
its naivety. I am not going to get into the question that the 
government has been in power a scant four months and that there 
are many things that have to be done within the legislative 
calendar to ensure that the government runs as it should and that 
the government fulfils its promises, which it has done to date 
and will continue to do. I want to talk about the phrase ``the 
allowance of the rights of criminals to supersede those of the 
victim''. As always I like to declare my prejudices early in any 
debate.
<P>
	As those on this side of the House know, I represent the city of 
Halifax in the province of Nova Scotia. There is a name that will 
ring down the annals of criminal justice in Nova Scotia for many 
years to come, and that is the name of Donald Marshall Jr. I do 
not know whether my hon. colleagues on the other side of the 
House are aware of the Marshall case-they certainly should 
be-but I can tell them that for a period in the province of Nova 
Scotia, finishing in 1989-90, this case was a preoccupation of a 
great percentage of the legal profession, both prosecutors, 
defence counsel, the judiciary. There was a special royal 
commission to look into what had happened.
<P>
	Donald Marshall was a young man who served 11 years in 
prison for a crime he did not commit. Some terrible things were 
uncovered in the Marshall inquiry in the way criminal justice 
worked, or conversely did not work, in the province of Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	We have talked a lot in the House lately about questions of 
racism and bigotry. There is no question that one of the reasons 
Donald Marshall served 11 years for a crime he did not commit 
was racism. One of the reasons was bigotry. There were police 
officers who suborned perjury, there were dreadful miscarriages 
of justice, a complete lack of accommodation for cultural and 
lifestyle differences in the fact that even the ability to 
communicate on the part of the accused was ignored and so on. 
Evidence was suppressed. It is a black mark on the escutcheon of 
the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The Marshall inquiry report is 26 volumes. I know I have a 
copy in my office and I have read major parts of it, but in the life 
of a member of Parliament it would be hard to read the entire 
thing. But it is something that most practitioners of criminal law 
in Nova Scotia have availed themselves of and have read.
<P>
	Over and over again what rings through your mind when you 
read the reports of the Marshall inquiry, when you read the 
reports of what happened to Junior Marshall, the words 
``innocent until proven guilty'', ``the rule of law'', ``due 
process'' come back again and again.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to make another thing perfectly clear. In my years in 
the courts and practising law, particularly in my years as an 
advocate for women's rights and for the protection of women 
who are abused and battered and of  children who are abused and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2450"> 2450 </A></B>
<P>
battered, I probably spent more time enraged at the lack of 
protection that our system has for victims of crime than 
anything else.
<P>
	This country is littered, as unfortunately are other countries of 
the west, with the detritus of violence against women and 
children. Nonetheless we have to look to the whole picture to 
solve the problem and not merely zero in on one side and what I 
think, with the greatest of respect to the framers of this motion, 
what is ostensibly an inadequate response.
<P>
	We have talked here about lowering the age of young 
offenders and with the greatest respect I do not think that is the 
answer. I can tell you as someone who has thought long and hard 
about this, someone who has served on committees dealing with 
criminal legislation in this House over the past five years, the 
situation that I think we must all remember is those two little 
boys in England who murdered the baby. This a situation that 
must come to the fore when we are talking about this very thing 
today.
<P>
	I was discussing this in the lobby just a minute ago with one of 
the minister's staff. On the one hand we both agreed that we are 
horrified at the actions of those two boys, 10 years old when they 
killed the baby, to even go back and think of the testimony that 
came forward at that trial of that two-year old who kept getting 
up when he was hit again and again.
<P>
	I am equally horrified that two 10-year old boys are found by 
the courts in English justice to be bad seeds, if you will. I think it 
very strange and very unlikely, too much of a coincidence, that 
two innately evil creatures would end up living next door to each 
other. There has to be more to it than that.
<P>
	I use that example to illustrate the fact that merely increasing 
sentences, merely incarcerating for longer periods of time, 
merely going at the punishment angle is not going to give us the 
answer.
<P>
	What we have to do is look at the causes. There are a variety of 
causes. I know that my colleague from Crowfoot and my 
colleague from Calgary who is also a former police officer 
would agree that other things come into the formation of 
criminal activity, that poverty is a part of it, that lack of 
education is a part of it, that poor nutrition is a part of it, that 
lack of education is a part of it, that the cycle of violence within 
the home is a part of it and on and on and on.
<P>
	Criminals are made. They are very rarely born.
<P>
	The whole question of how we deal with victims and how we 
deal with criminals should not be connected in this death battle 
if you will that is one before the other. The rights of victims must 
be respected. They must be listened to. There must be services 
for victims unquestionably.
<P>
	The fact that we have not addressed this as a nation and as a 
society is, I agree entirely with the mover of the motion, 
something that we have to deal with and we have to deal with 
soon.
<P>
	It is not an either-or situation. It is not going to improve the 
lot of the families for example of the McDonald's victims in 
Sydney River, Cape Breton, if you extend the sentences for the 
murderers, now convicted. Revenge is not what the framers of 
the criminal law should deal in. What we deal with in legislating 
the criminal law has to be deterrence and protection of society. 
Those are the reasons that we legislate in criminal law.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	If we look at it as redress, how do we redress the families of 
the McDonald's victims? How do we redress those families? We 
cannot restore the lives of the victims. We cannot restore 
shattered families in the emotional sense. No money could 
possibly come along to fill that terrible void at the loss of young 
people. No money can do anything to restore the fact that the 
McNeil girl has major and serious brain damage and that 
however long she lives, she will never be the bright articulate 
young woman she was when she went to work in that 
McDonald's restaurant last May. Nothing can change that. It 
should not be connected.
<P>
	Yes, we prove the crime and we have the appropriate response 
to the crime and we deal with the victims, but we are dealing in a 
separate theatre. We are dealing in a separate area.
<P>
	When we talk about the rights of victims vis-à-vis the rights 
of criminals, I go back again to the Donald Marshall case. To 
hon. members across the way who I feel think that we on this 
side are somehow lax on the criminal law, I say to each one of 
them to remember the adage that those of us who suffered 
through law school will all remember, that it is a truism in legal 
education that it is better for a thousand guilty to go free than for 
one innocent to be convicted.
<P>
	I wonder whether those on the other side would agree with 
that or not. I see that my friend from Calgary does not agree. It is 
an interesting point that that phrase has hung around for a very 
long time. I wonder if each of those members on the other side 
would look at that question and if it was not objective, if it were 
subjective-in other words, if you were the innocent 
victim-does that phrase become more valid? If it were your 
child who was the innocent victim, does that phrase become 
more valid? If it was your neighbour's child-all politics is 
local, all issues are local-think of it within the context of your 
own group, your own circle, and whether that makes it more 
relevant.
<P>
	It has been talked about here today that we should lower the 
age of young offenders. I do not have children. I borrow my 
friend's because I can give them back. I know that most of you 
on the other side are parents and you do have children and you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2451"> 2451 </A></B>
<P>
know that children get into  difficulties. They make mistakes. Is 
the answer to deal harshly?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> It is? I guess I have to say that is the reason that 
you are on that side and I am on this side and we are the ones 
with the majority, praise the Lord.
<P>
	I can only say that in my years as prosecutor under the old 
Juvenile Delinquents Act I saw a number of cases where the 
child was given the benefit of the doubt. I remember one in 
particular where a young man came up before us accused of 40 
counts of break and enter. He had made the mistake in the 
particular exercise on the day. He was breaking into cars and 
stealing car stereos. He happened to be doing it in a shopping 
centre in Halifax. The cars were all parked against the fence and 
an off duty policeman who happened to be mowing his backyard 
heard the noise, looked over the fence and the inevitable 
happened.
<P>
	The boy was charged and I was prosecuting. There were a 
number of people who came along. It was a very difficult family 
background.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	A very well respected school principal came to speak for the 
boy, who had scored very well on intelligence tests, who had 
certainly a lot going for him as he had a lot going against him. In 
consult the prosecutor, the defence, the judge, the probation 
officers, the police officers, everybody got together and asked: 
``What are we going to do about this?'' There was a compromise 
reached. A family member would be willing to take 
responsibility for this young man and ensure that he was not 
subjected to the same influences he had been subjected to in the 
family group, that he would not see the rest of the family who 
were the bad influences, et cetera.
<P>
	To make a long story short, that young man eventually won a 
scholarship to a famed international institution of higher 
learning and is today leading a very productive and wonderful 
life in this country where he is making a great contribution.
<P>
	I do not hesitate to say in the interests of truth, justice and the 
Canadian way that was one of the success stories. As I know my 
two colleagues on the other side from law enforcement would be 
quick to agree, we did not have a lot of those success stories. We 
had more of the other kind.
<P>
	The point again is if that young man had been, as we used to 
say in those days, piped to the juvenile detention home I do not 
think he would be where he is today. I do not think he would be a 
productive member of society. I think he would probably be in 
super max or he would be dead in all likelihood.
<P>
	I guess I have to say that success story means more to me than 
all the ones with whom we did not succeed because they were 
too far gone, it was too late and so on. The ones with whom we 
did not succeed went through the detention process, many of 
them in detention until they had passed the age of being 
juveniles, until they turned 18 whereupon they went out and 
committed some further offence and went to Dorchester 
Penitentiary or Sackville correctional centre.
<P>
	If we do not take risks to attempt to save young people then we 
are just consigning young people to a life of crime. That is why I 
speak against this motion. That is why I say we have to look at 
the way the child is going. The word child is very important here 
because we are talking about children when we talk about young 
offenders. We are not talking about hardened criminals.
<P>
	I also in conclusion would like to say that given the tenor of 
this motion and given the statements I have heard from the 
members of the Reform Party in particular, I am sure that we can 
then count on the support of such members as the member for 
Crowfoot and the member for Calgary Northeast to support us 
when we come in at some future time, as I am sure we will, with 
stronger gun control measures. I am sure as former police 
officers both of these gentlemen know how important it is that 
guns in particular be kept out of the hands of a majority of 
people who have no idea how to use them.
<P>
	What about those kids who are potential criminals. You do not 
want guns lying around the house do you?
<P>
	I hope that hon. members will see their way clear to support 
this kind of legislation when and if it comes up in this session of 
the House.
<P>
	I have spoken with police officers in my riding in the province 
of Nova Scotia and among the strongest supporters of tougher 
gun control legislation are indeed the members of the police 
force.
<P>
	At any rate, I would just like to say that I am delighted to 
speak on this topic today because I am very proud of the crime 
and justice package that was in the red book. I know that the 
crime and justice package will in due course come into this 
House in the form of legislation. I am sure that as with all of the 
promises in the red book those legislative measures will make 
Canada a better place. Also remember that being a better place is 
also a place of humanity and compassion.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Frontenac-the environment; the hon. member for 
Brant-guaranteed annual minimum income.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2452"> 2452 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to apologize to the member for Fraser Valley 
West for having missed his turn. We will now have the 
10-minute questions and comments period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Madam Speaker, I can 
only applaud what was said by the hon. member for Halifax, 
especially her concluding remarks on the issue of gun control. 
As you know, following certain tragic events, a committee was 
asked to make a thorough review of this question, but the result 
was a bill that was a compromise, both in substance and form, 
since in most cases any action that may be taken will be based on 
regulations that have yet to be approved by Cabinet or the 
government. At the time, the minister was able to get a bill 
through Parliament that could be seen as a major step forward 
but left the government with considerable discretion in drafting 
regulations, unlike the previous legislation, and this, we felt, 
was a major shortcoming.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, we now have regulations that are largely 
unsatisfactory. For instance, so-called semi-automatic 
weapons, which are practically assault weapons, are still sold 
across Canada. The weapon used at the Polytechnique can still 
be purchased as a hunting weapon.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Justice intends to take action. I simply 
want to point out that he can act very quickly on many aspects of 
gun control through the regulations, without having to go 
through the legislative process.
<P>
	I may add that we would welcome improvements to the 
legislation itself, especially with respect to the registration of 
firearms. In the course of our consultations, I met many hunters 
and groups of hunters who had no objection to firearms 
registration. And contrary to what was said at the time, 
especially with respect to the cost, since we register cars and a 
number of other products, it would not be very difficult to use 
our current system to register firearms. We both encourage and 
request the government to act.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Halifax support us in our 
endeavour to get the government to speed up the passage of 
firearms legislation, perhaps even before the Act comes into 
effect?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. As he knows, unquestionably the minister has 
responded in the House on several occasions by referring to his 
own commitment to the subject of gun control.
<P>
	On the actual legislative itinerary the member will have to ask 
the minister. Certainly it is part and parcel of our policy. 
Certainly, as the hon. member knows as well, this question is 
extremely close to my heart and one that I along with many 
members on this side support very strongly.
<P>
	I suggest to him that if he is just patient all things will come in 
due course.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member has quite a spirit of debate, undoubtedly obtained 
through her years in the courtroom. I should point out that to 
debate an issue such as this, there has to be some basis of fact.
<P>
	The example of the Marshall affair in Nova Scotia was one 
where Mr. Marshall had actually contributed to his own demise 
in the sense that he lied to the police as was evident at the trial.
<P>
	I would also like to point out the member brings to mind 
certain things that happen in society that may be contrary to the 
norm, where mistakes in judgment could be made in court. We 
do not live in a perfect society. This is one of the reasons we 
have laws. We also have high expectations for members of 
Parliament, yet often they have gone awry. MPs should be held 
accountable and are not above the law, yet it has happened that 
they seem to have been above the law on occasion.
<P>
	Justice must not only be done but it must be perceived to be 
done. I believe the hon. member should get out of the 
committees she is on and into the society which she talks about. 
We cannot have deterrence if we do not have punishment. Would 
the hon. member address that point. How can we have deterrence 
if we do not have punishment?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast for his questions and comment. First let me 
speak to something that has been addressed because I know he 
would not want to carry on with a misconception.
<P>
	The question of whether Junior Marshall contributed to his 
own misfortune was addressed by the inquiry. The appeal court 
judges who sat on the case were reprimanded by the judicial 
counsel for saying exactly what the hon. member said, with the 
greatest respect. I know the member did not mean to perpetrate 
it. He did not contribute to his own misfortune. He did not lie, 
absolutely not. He was in the park that night and was hurt by the 
same man who killed Sandy Feal. He did not lie and the judges 
who said that were reprimanded by the judicial counsel, in the 
words of Casey Stengel. The hon. member could look it up.
<P>
	At any rate with regard to deterrence, not at any time did I 
suggest to the hon. member or to the House that there should not 
be deterrence and punishment. I did not say there should not be.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Capital punishment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Capital punishment, not on this side of the 
House. The hon. member should wait; he might get another 
chance. I never at any time suggested there should not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2453"> 2453 </A></B>
<P>
adequate punishment. Of course there should. That is why we 
have the Criminal Code. That is why we have the sentencing 
policies that we have in  place. Some of them are insufficient 
and some of them must be changed.
<P>
	My point to the hon. member was that we do not, to use 
another cliche similar to justice must not only be done but must 
be seen to be done, throw the baby out with the bath water. We 
have children in this country who go wrong. We must do 
everything we can to put them back on the right track. 
Necessarily lowering the age to 10 and frying them is not the 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
do not intend to be so kind about the criminal justice system 
when I talk. I am not a lawyer but I am one who has been affected 
by such things as the criminal justice system and I live in an area 
with many prisons around it.
<P>
	I want to refer quickly to a newspaper article that appeared not 
too long ago in the Abbotsford Times in my community:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Corrections Canada reports all 57 inmates granted temporary absences this 
Christmas from B.C. prisons have returned to jail.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But that doesn't impress local police.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am going to refer to this point a little later. It is nice to see 
they came back from their Christmas break.
<P>
	I rise today to speak to one of the most contentious emotional 
aspects of the Canadian criminal justice system, the reform of 
parole. The entire issue of the rights of victims revolves around 
the parole system and how it has let us down. Let us not mix 
words here tonight. It has let us down.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Parole horror stories have become so commonplace in the 
media that the majority of Canadians has completely lost faith in 
the system. Nowhere is this more evident than when we talk to 
people who have lost someone dear to them as a result of the 
breakdown of that system. When we sit in the living room with a 
family whose life has been forever altered, as I have recently in 
Langley, British Columbia, we see their eyes. These people are 
victims. There is sadness, despair and anger in their eyes. It has 
been a powerful, moving experience for me. I do not know if I 
would have the strength to be as forgiving as some of those 
victims are.
<P>
	What drives me to distraction is the attitude of the 
bureaucracy responsible for the tragedy. There is no emotion in 
those eyes; just cold, hard, vacant stares, and endless recital of 
the regulations. No one is responsible. It is no one's fault. No 
one seems willing to do anything about it.
<P>
	In my riding we are surrounded by federal correctional 
institutions, as I have said, and there are no shortages of 
incidents involving parolees. Also the article in the <I>Abbotsford 
Times</I> quoted local RCMP members saying that whenever they 
have an unsolved crime they just check the list of parolees loose 
in the street, find out what they were doing at the time of the 
crime and, bingo, the crime is solved. At the time of story their 
success  rate for solving crimes in this way was 75 per cent. 
While there were not a large number of those cases, the lasting 
impression in the public's mind was that criminals were simply 
being let out too soon.
<P>
	What response do we get from the criminal justice system 
when it breaks down? I realize the Parole Board and Corrections 
Canada are two separate bodies, but in a recent meeting with the 
head of corrections for the Pacific region I was told that the 
responsibility for improving the criminal justice system lies 
with Parliament. They simply follow the rules laid down by 
politicians.
<P>
	Another common response is to quote surveys. The Parole 
Board likes to quote a particular number. It says that long term 
research shows that 75 per cent of paroles granted were 
concluded without any return to federal custody during the 
sentence. As we all know, statistics are a matter of perspective 
and in some cases outright deception.
<P>
	Benjamin Disraeli said it better: ``There are three kinds of 
lies: there are lies, there are damn lies and there are statistics''. 
If it is true that 75 per cent of paroles are successful, I want to 
know what the cost was to society of the other 25 per cent. In my 
eyes it is a failure rate of one in four and that is just not good 
enough.
<P>
	It is time the rules were changed. It is time to stop awarding 
old friends and party hacks with appointments to the Parole 
Board. It is time to establish competency tests for board 
members which address the need for an understanding of the 
justice system. It is time there was a system of redress for 
victims who have been injured as a result of incompetence of the 
board. These board members must be held accountable. Most 
important, it is time criminals did real time for real crime.
<P>
	At the heart of this discussion is the fact that somehow we 
have lost the resolve as a nation to stand and say that when a 
criminal is sentenced to 10 years he should serve 10 years; not 3, 
not 5, but 10 years. Sentencing reform is key. It must be 
mentioned in this discussion as an integral part of the solution.
<P>
	Where do we start? One of the major hurdles is the way the 
public sees these issues as falling under one umbrella. In a sense 
they do. It is all in the justice system. What happens typically is 
that public outrage is diluted because it often takes a scatter-gun 
approach. People blame the police for not warning 
communities, even though they are handcuffed by the charter of 
rights. They blame jails for letting prisoners out, even though it 
is the Parole Board's job. Or they blame judges for not imposing 
stiffer sentences when it might have been a poor submission by a 
crown prosecutor who caused the miscarriage of justice in the 
first place.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2454"> 2454 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned before, no one is to blame. If the system is so 
complicated and intimidating to those not close to it, then the 
first step we must take is to make it clear. We must commit to 
allowing victims greater access to the halls of what now passes 
for justice. The public has the right to take part in the decision 
making process. It must be an integral part of parole hearings.
<P>
	Before that, victims must be given greater opportunity to be 
heard at the trial stage. Victims' impact statements are not given 
enough credence in the system as it now stands. In short, the 
simple request we have for the criminal justice system 
establishment is ``open your eyes and open your doors to the 
people whose rights have been trodden upon, the victims of this 
country''.
<P>
	I would like to close on a personal note which will help to 
explain why I referred earlier to the eyes of victims. I recently 
sat in the home of Mr. Chris Simmonds of Langley, British 
Columbia. There is a picture on his coffee table of two beautiful 
daughters. The picture and the memory is all that is left to one 
daughter, Sian.
<P>
	She was brutally murdered by a hired killer who claimed he 
was only trying to scare her with a loaded gun. He was out on 
bail on his own recognizance at the time. I do not have time to 
explain this complicated case today but what is striking about 
Mr. Simmonds is his calm resolve to have justice done.
<P>
	The latest travesty in this case is the decision of the court to 
move the trial of the man alleged to have contracted the killing 
to Port Alberni from my constituency. The court says that he can 
receive a fair trial safe from the influence of the media. Once 
again, the victim's rights are secondary. The criminal's rights 
come first.
<P>
	Out of respect for the Simmonds privacy I will not detail the 
effect of this savage murder on the remainder of the family. 
Besides the financial strain, emotionally they are near ruin. 
However they fight on.
<P>
	When Mr. Simmonds approached victims' assistance for 
some kind of compensation for the extra expense of travelling to 
and from Port Alberni he was told by another steely-eyed 
bureaucrat that he did not qualify because he did not witness the 
death of his daughter. This is the only point in the story where 
Mr. Simmonds eyes give him away. He told that man: ``Don't 
tell me I did not witness my daughter's death. Every night when 
I go to bed I close my eyes and I see her die''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, from time to time in this House, you are 
called on to witness a vote and say that the yeas have it. When it 
comes time for us to vote on the long overdue reform of the 
criminal justice system, I for one will remember the eyes of 
Chris Simmonds.
<P>
	I call on every one of my colleagues to join me in saying yes to 
the reform of parole and no to those who would put the rights of 
the law breakers ahead of the rights of the victim of crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed the hon. member's speech, as I do all the 
speeches in the House.
<P>
	My questions to him are these. First, what is his position on 
gun control and second on capital punishment? On this side of 
the House we are proposing changes to the laws. Is he prepared 
to let us know what his positions are on these two issues so that 
they can be taken into consideration by us and by Canadians 
watching us today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I will give 
my position on both of those but all we are hearing today is that 
we are going to study, study, study, talk, talk, talk.
<P>
	This is not a new phenomenon, the criminal justice program 
we have and the problems we have with it. This is something that 
has been going on for years. If we study this for another term 
there are going to be some serious problems in the country. Let 
us stop talking and discussing. Let us just get on with the job.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I suspect members opposite differ because they would be 
more liberal, but I think we have to stop worrying about trying to 
control the guns of recreation users, farmers and hunters and 
worry a lot more about the criminals and the guns they have. In 
fact if a crime is perpetrated by someone using a weapon while 
robbing a bank, in my opinion there should be two separate and 
distinct charges. Get off the backs of the recreation users, the 
farmers and the hunters and start worrying about the criminal for 
a change.
<P>
	On capital punishment, I support capital punishment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am particularly pleased to follow my hon. colleague 
from Fraser Valley West. I thought he used a particularly 
poignant example to conclude his address. After hearing it, it is 
very difficult to move to another phase of the debate. However I 
would like to talk about the cost of crime as it pertains to 
ordinary citizens. We do not even think about it on a day to day 
basis.
<P>
	I know when I was door knocking during this campaign, and I 
am sure it was the case of virtually everyone in the House, what 
we noticed was that everyone has a burglar alarm. Did hon. 
members notice that? When we went into the higher income 
areas, then everybody had burglar alarms plus dogs.
<P>
	The cost of crime and the paranoia associated with crime and 
the fear of crime is a tax every one of us pays to businesses 
which have increased costs because they have had to install 
burglar alarms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2455"> 2455 </A></B>
<P>
	For those of us here and those Canadians at home watching, 
we all know what happens when we have been the victim of 
crime. During the campaign when I was making this point I 
would just ask people: ``How many people here in the last year 
have been a victim of crime either personally or someone in 
their family?'' Members would be amazed. I think it was 
something like 15, 20 or 25 per cent of the people would raise 
their hands every time. That was just in the past year.
<P>
	I know as a victim the first thing that happens is you feel like 
you have been violated. You think your sense of safety is no 
longer there. The street that you have lived on, the neighbours 
that you have had all those years, all of a sudden you are locking 
the door. You just do not feel good about it anymore. Gradually 
that fades. You get over it. You get your alarm company. You get 
your alarm in. You start feeling good about it. Then you go into a 
drawer to get something that you have forgotten about and you 
find it is not there because that is one more thing stolen.
<P>
	The frustration comes back in the neighbourhood with young 
offenders, when people know who is breaking in. A street with 
20 or 30 houses and 5 of them have been broken into and they are 
all the same people.
<P>
	That is the situation. It is partly due to our wonderful Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms that has put the cart before the horse. We 
have the rights of the criminal paramount to the victim.
<P>
	Let me give another example. A rape victim wanted to find 
out whether she had been infected with AIDS. She went to court 
to get a court order so the convicted rapist would be tested for 
AIDS but it was said to be a violation of his rights. He raped this 
gal and it is a violation of his rights that she cannot have the 
peace of mind of finding out whether she ended up with AIDS 
because of what he did.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	My friends, we have to rethink, we have to deal with the 
situation as it is. No wonder people think that we have lost the 
handle on this.
<P>
	In doing a little research I asked: Where did we start to go off 
the rails? No one on either side of the House got up one morning 
and asked: ``Well, how are we going to screw up the criminal 
justice system? How can we make it worse instead of making it 
better''? It did not start that way. But that is how it has ended up.
<P>
	It is only a mistake if it is recognized as a mistake and it is not 
changed, then it is experience. Let us get some experience from 
it.
<P>
	This is how it started and I quote from <I>Hansard</I>, Thursday, 
October 7, 1971, and the words I am going to read from the Hon. 
Jean-Pierre Goyer, Solicitor General, are going to shock you.
<P>
	Folks at home, when you hear the words I am going to say you 
are going to realize why we got into the mess we are in. It is quite 
a long and involved quote but it says: ``Consequently we have 
decided from now on to stress the rehabilitation of individuals 
rather than the protection of society''. That is right out of 
<I>Hansard</I>. The Solicitor General of Canada, Thursday, October 7, 
1971 in this very House and I well bet he was standing right over 
there somewhere when he said: ``Consequently, we have 
decided from now on to stress the rehabilitation of individuals 
rather than the protection of society''. Is it any wonder we are 
where we are at today?
<P>
	It started because in 1971 the recidivism rate was 80 per cent. 
People went to jail, they served their time and 80 per cent of 
them were back in after they were released. Something was 
wrong somewhere, so we had to change things. This was an 
attempt to change things.
<P>
	I think they were on the right track. They just went too far. It 
ended up with the rights of the criminals coming before the 
rights of the victim. It has come to the point where we do not 
have enough money to go around to pay for day care and other 
things that people would love to have but we can put $675,000 
into expanding the recreation complex at Bowden Institution. Or 
we can build a jail in Grande Cache where all the rooms face the 
mountains.
<P>
	I want to point out the fact that we did not get started on this 
track yesterday. We have been on this road for a long time and it 
is now time to make about a 180 degree U-turn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in listening to the member's speech I note that the 
quote was taken from a time, while certainly not the middle 
ages, some 23 years ago.
<P>
	I would also point out and perhaps the member could respond, 
that about a year and a half ago in passing legislation dealing 
with corrections and parole, the statute dealing with 
penitentiaries and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
and in reviewing the draft of the statute the priorities which were 
to be considered by the department were listed in the statute. For 
some particular reason and we did not know why, the safety of 
the public was not number one.
<P>
	I say that in revising the statute for passage we in the 
committee moved the item up from No. 3 or 4 up to No. 1. I want 
to suggest that perhaps the pendulum is swinging back the other 
way after some 20 years. I accept the member's approach and I 
wonder if he would comment on the swinging of the pendulum.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> I thank the hon. member for the question. 
That was on my list but I did not get to it. That is a good example 
of one of the cases where we have to be careful. We do not want 
to let the pendulum swing too far in either direction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2456"> 2456 </A></B>
<P>
	At the time of reforming the penitentiaries in 1971 it was 
very Draconian and there is no question we were not saving as 
many souls as we were possibly able to under those conditions. 
Therefore in swinging the pendulum there is a very good 
possibility we went too far in the other direction. Now is the 
time to put the rights of the victims at least where they should 
be, which is always ahead of the rights of the criminals.
<P>
	I accept the hon. member's point and thank him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I foresee the hon. 
member rising on a point of order. There was a mixup in the lists. 
Members of the Reform Party were splitting their time and had 
lost a 10-minute slot through an error of the Chair. I gave it back 
to them and the government spoke and now it is back to 
opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, is it your 
intention to have two members from the same party speak in a 
row?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is what I was just 
explaining. There was an error on the part of the Chair when I 
overlooked one Reform member and passed to a government 
member in his place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
indeed an honour to be able to address the House on an issue of 
such importance. I only hope that my colleagues on the other 
side of the Chamber will look upon this motion seriously and 
thoughtfully.
<P>
	In the minds of a vast number of Canadians there is no more 
important issue than crime and the failure of the justice system 
to deal adequately with crime.
<P>
	During the course of my campaign I had the opportunity to 
unscientifically poll the mood of the public in my constituency 
to find out which issues held their attention the most. In my 
riding perhaps no other issue touched people as directly as 
crime.
<P>
	There is no more glaring and headline generating problem 
than that of crimes committed by non-citizens, especially those 
who have come to this open country. Some of them have actually 
abused Canada's generosity and to make matters even worse, are 
coddled by our justice system.
<P>
	I know that given our present levels of immigration the 
number of immigrant offenders is relatively low. Certainly 
immigrants are overwhelmingly committed to living peacefully 
and making a better life for themselves in Canada. Nonetheless 
there is a broad opinion that the rights of criminals who are not 
citizens or legal residents of Canada are being given precedence 
over the rights of law abiding members of society, both citizens 
and non-citizens alike.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, there have been numerous examples of 
criminal activity on the part of illegal residents and new 
residents of Canada. The focus of these headlines and the 
subsequent public outcry over these examples has not been on 
the crimes per se, but on the  fact that those criminals have been 
cycled through the Canadian justice system rather than simply 
removed.
<P>
	In my own city I recently acquired information about two 
convicted drug traffickers, both of whom were in Canada 
illegally, having overstayed their visas. Both were sentenced to 
significant amounts of jail time. The obvious question to ask is: 
Why are these two criminals, neither of whom possess legal 
status in Canada, still in Canada after having committed these 
criminal acts and have served their time, or at least a part of their 
time? That is a good question to ask.
<P>
	That is not the end of the story. These two gentlemen, 
predictably, did not serve their full sentences in prison. Instead, 
after a fraction of their sentences had been served they were 
released on parole. They were released back into the community 
where they could visit and live and begin to re-establish their 
lives despite the fact that neither of these men were legal 
residents of Canada.
<P>
	The story still is not over. At the time of this case, one of these 
drug pushers when out on parole acquired the status of 
whereabouts unknown. In other words, he violated his parole.
<P>
	The criminal justice system did not have the sense to simply 
run these two out of the country on a rail. Instead it used tens of 
thousands of taxpayers' dollars to prosecute and imprison them 
for a short time. Then the justice system was kind enough to 
allow these two out on parole, never mind the fact that neither 
should legally be allowed on Canadian soil in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	When I spoke to the parole officials concerning this case, they 
informed me that any Parole Board decision imposed on an 
illegal alien took precedence over deportation proceedings. This 
particular case is not an isolated one.
<P>
	Some may interpret this as an attempt on the part of the justice 
system to dole out just punishment. However, my constituents 
and many more Canadians across the country see examples like 
this as a drain on the system and a risk to our communities posed 
by a justice system that is rule driven, not common sense driven.
<P>
	When Canadians are forced to support criminal illegal aliens 
through years of incarceration on our soil and then are forced to 
live among them when those criminals are released on parole, 
then all of us become the victims. We are victims not only of 
crime but also victims of a criminal justice system that does not 
have the sense to deal expediently and in a common sense way 
with people who come to Canada and commit crime.
<P>
	I wonder if this House is aware of the fact that refugee claims 
are often heard not in the offices of Immigration Canada nor in 
offices abroad, but rather in Canadian prisons. As hard as it is to 
believe, current policy allows for refugee claims to be heard in 
prison. Even more difficult to believe is that refugee board 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2457"> 2457 </A></B>
<P>
members are not permitted to take into account the character of 
the  claimant as demonstrated by the fact that the claimant is in 
prison as they assess the individual's acceptability as a refugee 
claimant.
<P>
	There are two issues apparent here. The first is the ridiculous 
disregard for character inherent in the refugee process. The 
second is Canada's willingness to house in prison law breakers 
who have not yet received the right to legally reside in the 
country.
<P>
	Canadians are outraged that this government would not only 
subsidize the trials and incarceration of aliens, illegal or 
otherwise. They are also outraged that their safety is being 
jeopardized when instead a speedy deportation order would be 
the way to go.
<P>
	One of the guiding principles of the Reform Party is the 
attention we pay and the regard in which we hold the common 
sense of the common people of Canada. People outside the 
justice system, but who nevertheless provide for its funding 
through their taxes and who are the victims of it when it fails to 
provide for their protection, have expressed to me and my 
colleagues that Canada's justice system is in dire need of some 
common sense reform. That is not just shared by the Reformers 
on this side of the House, but I hope members on the other side.
<P>
	My colleagues have pointed out the tragic irresponsibility of a 
system that promotes and protects the rights of criminals over 
victims. I stand before this House to report that Canadians have 
lost faith in the justice system which spends thousands of dollars 
to harbour illegal aliens when they commit crimes. As I stated 
before, that victimises every Canadian who either has to foot the 
bill for such nonsense or is forced to live in a community that 
must needlessly be the home for criminals from abroad.
<P>
	Recently the existence of another kind of foreign criminal has 
been brought to light in Canada. It has been discovered that 
Ottawa is the home of a former minister of justice in the brutal 
Barre regime of Somalia.
<P>
	The existence of this individual in Canada has been known for 
some time now. Members of the Somali community in Toronto 
have brought to my attention the fact that they had made this 
government aware of the presence in Canada of several other 
members of that regime, people who may also have perpetrated 
horrible crimes against their own people in Somalia, but to no 
avail.
<P>
	After a great deal of correspondence with the government and 
several pieces of investigative journalism which proved the 
existence of such people in this country, law abiding Somalis 
who now call Canada home are still waiting for justice to be 
done.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	So many Somalis have fled Somalia and have come to Canada 
hoping to find a refuge. They soon discovered that Canada's 
immigration system seems unable to distinguish between 
genuine and non-genuine refugees. Also they discovered that 
Canadian politicians do not have the political will necessary to 
take action to apprehend and deport political criminals who have 
followed them to Canada. This is yet another example of the 
apparent disregard for the rights of the innocent and the law 
abiding while the rights and privileges of criminals are 
protected.
<P>
	When will this government display the political will 
necessary to enforce laws that are on the books? I am concerned 
that we may never see that sort of political will exercised as long 
as this government is in power. Instead of firm proposals to help 
protect all Canadians from both Canadian and non-Canadian 
criminals, we will hear more soft talk about the charter, about 
the need to be fair, and about the need to protect the rights of the 
few.
<P>
	This government will be in grave danger in four years. The 
unprotected may rise up in anger and demand that the criminal 
justice system be taken back from the constitutional attorneys. 
They will demand it be taken back from the special interests and 
brought back into the hands of those who can listen and respond 
to the common sense pleas for protection, truth, justice and 
national security which are being made across the land.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member who just spoke and some of his colleagues touched on 
some quite particular aspects. We see that they each chose a 
subject in turn. In this case, it is illegal immigrants who commit 
murders while they are in Canada illegally.
<P>
	The motion before us today concerns victims' rights, we must 
agree, but it is very, very general. I would just like to point out to 
the hon. member that a study, which I do not have on hand now, 
reports that about 80 per cent of the murders in Canada are 
committed by family members or someone in the victim's 
immediate circle. We must keep that in mind, because a very 
large majority of murders are committed in such circumstances. 
Knowing that, I think that we should deal again with the whole 
issue of the availability of firearms or other dangerous weapons 
that violent spouses or other persons in the victim's circle might 
use.
<P>
	There is also another aspect. Murder is not the only crime, 
theft is another, but all studies show that such crimes are often 
related to poverty and social problems.
<P>
	I would like to hear what the hon. member has to say on these 
two aspects in particular and not only about illegal immigrants, 
which he emphasized before, since all in all, crimes committed 
by illegal immigrants account for very little of the problem that 
we are talking about today.

	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, I made general comments 
about more than just murder. If the member would recall, in my 
statement I was referring to drug pushers who have come 
illegally into this country although I am aware of other 
situations certainly. In several of them illegals have committed 
violent crimes as the member speaks of such as murder, robbery 
or assault.
<P>
	It is not a question of directing our attention elsewhere. We 
have many problems in enforcement. There should be a 
deterrent to those with any serious negative intentions as far as 
our laws are concerned when individuals come into this country.
<P>
	What I am expressing here is that they are not adequately 
being dealt with when they are perpetrating acts of this kind. We 
have laws. They should be enforced.
<P>
	The opinion among the judiciary seems to be that aliens 
should be handled in a different way. People are fed up with that 
kind of thinking. They are looking for action. If you commit 
crime in this country, I do not care what your background is, you 
should be dealt with. You should be placed on the same plane as 
the individual who lives here and is breaking the law, the only 
difference being with the outsider is he should be immediately 
deported upon serving his sentence.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for York 
South-Weston. I will try to cut mine down so that we both get 
time to do our share.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on this motion by the third party that 
indicates a concern that this government is not acting to reform 
the criminal justice system. I do not want to be too critical of the 
Reform Party. However I want to set the record straight about 
this government's action to bring reform to the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	Of course we are concerned about the rights of victims and 
those who are closely associated with victims of crime. These 
Canadians want us to take not just short term, but long term 
actions and to include the public in decision making, including 
the victims. The Liberal approach is an integrated approach. We 
want to get tough on criminals. We are looking to clean up the 
justice system.
<P>
	As the minister stated on January 27: ``Crime prevention must 
take account of the deep causes of crime: poverty, sexual 
exploitation of children, family dysfunctions, racial inequality 
and inefficient or underfunded social services''.
<P>
	He further stated: ``Our government is determined to develop 
an integrated crime prevention strategy. Together with the other 
levels of government, the police, victims' groups and the 
community organizations, we will make a priority of looking at 
the deep causes of criminal behaviour and eliminating them''.
<P>
	I personally find it astounding that the Reform Party seeks to 
condemn the government for its inaction when they know the 
Minister of Justice the moment he was sworn in began to listen 
and act. In fact the motion before us seems to condemn the 
minister and this government for listening, something I thought 
was high on the priority list of the Reform Party. They should 
praise the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Finally we have a Minister of Justice who is taking action 
based on what Canadians want. Certain actions have already 
been initiated. A national crime prevention council is being 
actively planned and will be functioning within four to six 
weeks. Amendments to the Young Offenders Act will be tabled 
early in May. The re-establishment of the law reform 
commission is well under way. The court challenges program 
will be reinstated in about six months. Appointments to the 
National Parole Board are now made on the basis of merit and 
expertise.
<P>
	Yes, we have to take further steps. The minister has promised 
that from the beginning. In his speech on January 27 among 
other things he promised to address concerns about the release 
of high risk offenders into society at the end of their custodial 
terms and to address the serious problem of violence against 
women and children. He has promised to tackle the problem of 
illegal arms smuggling. He will be looking into the broad 
category of equality before the law.
<P>
	The minister will search for better ways of ensuring that 
justice needs of aboriginal people are recognized and acted 
upon. He will introduce legislation to deal with the sentencing 
aspect of criminal law.
<P>
	I have worked for two and a half years with Priscilla de 
Villiers whose daughter Nina was murdered August 1991. 
Priscilla de Villiers began a petition telling the government that 
there are serious deficiencies in the criminal justice system of 
Canada. The petition asked that Parliament recognize that 
crimes of violence against the person are serious and abhorrent 
in our society.
<P>
	We learned that Nina's experience was not unique. The 
petition brought to light similar cases where the justice system 
had failed. In fact 2.5 million Canadians have demonstrated 
their concern by signing the petition. The hon. justice minister 
accepted those petitions at a press conference on February 7 and 
stated his objective to provide and maintain the fairest and most 
effective system of justice for Canada and Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2459"> 2459 </A></B>
<P>
	Mrs. de Villiers realizes that violent crime cannot be 
addressed through the justice system alone. We all have to make 
a long term commitment to a safer society that  rejects violence 
and instils non-violent values in our children.
<P>
	Through an organization called CAVEAT which Mrs. de 
Villiers formed, many deeply concerned Canadians will 
continue to promote public awareness and crime prevention in 
its broadest sense.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Many groups across Canada are participating in dialogue 
regarding the changes that are needed in the justice system. The 
Canadian Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Police Association 
are both putting forward a suggested bill of rights for victims. 
Local police in many areas including Hamilton are moving 
directly into the community to better understand the needs of 
our citizens.
<P>
	I have been listening and have become more and more 
convinced that we need this national, rational debate that is 
going on across the country. We all need to share our 
experiences. I find it strange that the Reform Party wants us to 
take action without taking the time to consult with all 
Canadians, including the victims of crime.
<P>
	The opposition has to get a grip on reality. It needs to see the 
link between crime and the social structures of our society. It 
needs to see the need to consult with the citizens of Canada, with 
victims themselves, to make changes in the justice system truly 
meaningful.
<P>
	In truth, we need to compliment our Minister of Justice. He 
has been listening not just in the House but across Canada. 
Priscilla de Villiers mentioned to me only this morning that she 
feels that the minister is moving in the right direction with his 
consultative process and the suggestions for change that he has 
been proposing.
<P>
	The member who moved this motion may be interested that 
the minister while in Vancouver last weekend met with a group 
of victims and personally heard their concerns. The members of 
the opposition need to listen to their constituents and need to 
bring their concerns to the consultative process here in the 
House.
<P>
	This would be a more effective use of our time and would 
better serve our common goal to bring meaningful change to the 
justice system. I look forward to working with members on both 
sides of the House while we work together toward our common 
goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the motion before us by the Reform Party is a 
mischievous motion.
<P>
	The Reform Party was elected in part based on a platform that 
said that rather than being mischievous in the House, its 
members would be constructive and work with the government 
in order to achieve changes for the common good of the country. 
Therefore when the Reform Party puts forward a motion 
condemning the government for its inaction, given the early 
mandate of this government I would suggest that it is 
mischievous.
<P>
	I would have expected more from the Reform Party. I would 
have expected its members to provide some constructive 
alternatives or suggestions in order to assist this government in 
its changes to the criminal justice system.
<P>
	The Liberal Party in the last election campaign made it very 
clear in its red book that it would deal effectively, unlike the 
previous administration, with changes to the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	All I need do is refer the hon. member and the Reform Party to 
page 84 of the red book where the Liberal Party set out its 
commitment in advance of the election campaign with regard to 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
	We said on page 84 that dealing with the growing incidents of 
violent crime will be a priority for a Liberal government. I can 
assure the member that members on this side of the House are 
dedicated and committed to changing and correcting the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	I have every confidence that the Minister of Justice will bring 
about significant change. He will ensure that in due course 
Canadians will once again have respect for and confidence in the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	The minister earlier today indicated a number of initiatives 
that he has taken. All I can ask of the Reform Party is to work 
co-operatively with the minister and other members on this side 
to ensure that the changes take place.
<P>
	I have but a few short minutes to discuss some of the matters I 
wanted to discuss with regard to the criminal justice system. 
There is no question we agree that the justice system is in 
desperate need of reform.
<P>
	I have before me the Criminal Code of Canada which is the 
basis of our criminal justice system. It tells us how we deal with 
criminals in this country and yes, this thick book needs a lot of 
reform. There are two areas that I have addressed through the 
private members' process in the last several weeks.
<P>
	Today I introduced a bill that would eliminate section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. Section 745 as I indicated to the House 
earlier today allows individuals convicted of first or second 
degree murder to apply to a court to have their parole eligibility 
dates brought forward. In effect it means that a first degree 
murderer, for example, someone who commits a deliberate 
murder, premeditated, can apply to the court after 15 years to be 
released from prison. I do not believe that that provision has the 
support of the public.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2460"> 2460 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It means that life does not mean life. Most Canadians realize 
that when you commit a first degree murder it does not mean you 
are going to serve the rest of your life in prison. Most Canadians 
believe that life means 25 years. It does not even mean that. 
Under section 745 it could mean 15 years.
<P>
	The likes of Clifford Olson will be eligible to apply in less 
than three years. Helmut Buxbaum who had his wife murdered 
would be eligible in the next five years. Colin Thatcher, in 
several more years, after 15 years will be able to apply for a 
reduction. That particular provision is a significant error in our 
criminal justice system in the Criminal Code and it ought to be 
eliminated.
<P>
	The next subject I want to touch upon briefly is the Young 
Offenders Act. We all know that the Young Offenders Act is not 
working.
<P>
	On February 17 I introduced in this House a private member's 
bill that would address three areas, and there are a number of 
other areas that must be addressed, that I believe must be 
addressed at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
	The first is to change the age limits under the act. At present 
the Young Offenders Act defines a young offender as a child, if 
you will, between the ages of 12 and 17. The bill I introduced 
would redefine a young offender as being a child between 10 and 
15. In effect 16 and 17-year olds would be dealt with as adults in 
criminal court. They would be prosecuted just like any other 
adult would be prosecuted.
<P>
	In my view a 16 or 17-year old understands and knows the 
difference between right and wrong and ought to be dealt with 
accordingly.
<P>
	With regard to the second aspect of my bill, the minister has 
already indicated that in the amendments that he will bring 
forward he will increase the maximum penalty for first degree 
murder to 10 years. I applaud the minister for that initiative.
<P>
	The third aspect of this bill would allow for the publication of 
the name of the young offender after the second indictable 
offence.
<P>
	In effect the young offender would be given two chances. The 
third time around, in my view, the public interest would dictate 
that the public should know the identity of the young offender 
and the circumstances of his or her crime.
<P>
	There are other areas that have to be addressed. The minister 
indicated a number of the areas that he will be dealing with in the 
months ahead. I have taken the position in the past for example 
that the parole system is in desperate need of reform again. 
Mandatory supervision, the automatic release of inmates after 
serving two-thirds of the sentence, in my view ought to be 
eliminated. Sentencing reform is a package that the minister 
said he would bring forward. Parole reform again is very 
important. In the area of prostitution changes are necessary 
because of the effect of prostitution on communities right across 
the country.
<P>
	In the few moments that remain I want to indicate to the 
Reform members that they certainly do not have a monopoly as 
far as having concern about the criminal justice system and 
reform of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Members of the cabinet and backbench members of the 
government are all dedicated and committed to making changes. 
I would ask members of the Reform Party to come forward with 
their ideas because I know that the minister and others will 
listen. In a years time or two years time I would ask them to look 
back and I think they will be proud of the work of this 
government in the area of criminal law reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their contributions 
today. There have been a number of important suggestions and 
recommendations.
<P>
	Everyone heard the Minister of Justice say today that he 
would listen very carefully and in fact welcome the ideas of 
people.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I have heard a number of points. I want to make a very brief 
comment. There is a tendency and a real need to ensure the 
victims of crime have many more supports than they now have. 
The Minister of Justice indicated that he agreed and wanted to 
do something about it.
<P>
	There is also a feeling that for certain crimes there ought to be 
much tougher sentences. I applaud that and I believe it is true, 
but we have to be very careful, as one colleague in the Reform 
Party indicated, not to let that pendulum swing too far. 
Otherwise we distort the system in another fashion which is 
perhaps just as bad.
<P>
	How important is it to attack the causes of crime embedded in 
poverty and unemployment in order to reduce crime? I would 
just like to get my colleague's opinion on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Madam Speaker, there is no question that a 
balanced approach is necessary. We have to deal with those 
people who commit criminal offences. That is a must. We have 
to deal with them effectively, taking into account the public 
interest and the rehabilitation of the offender.
<P>
	I agree with those persons who say the pendulum has swung 
too far in one direction. We have to seek that equilibrium or that 
balance. On the other hand we have to do what we can to ensure 
that people do not embark on a life of criminality. We have to 
deal with and address root causes of crime such as 
unemployment. I am convinced the government will deal with 
the question of unemployment. If people are working they are 
less likely to commit crime.
<P>
	Also we have to deal with the question of poverty and the fact 
that so many Canadians go to bed hungry at night. If we deal 
with poverty we will deal at the same time with crime. We will 
reduce criminality. A multifaceted approach is necessary. I 
agree with the hon.  member that we must deal with the root 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2461"> 2461 </A></B>
<P>
causes of crime because in the long run that would be a more 
effective way of dealing with crime in our country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.34 p.m. it is 
my duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 
81(19) proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River)</B> moved that 
Bill C-219, an act to amend the Immigration Act (visitors' 
visas), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the background to the bill takes us 
into the inner workings of the Immigration Act. A bill similar to 
this private member's bill was presented in the last Parliament. I 
guess it is fair to say we are taking another crack at the issue.
<P>
	The background relates to the procedures which are used by 
visitors who wish to come to Canada, visitors from what we call 
visa countries, countries where it is necessary for residents to 
get visas from Canada before they visit here. The bill would 
permit the Canadian relatives of such visitors to put up a bond or 
a surety. It would require a Canadian immigration officer who 
was considering a visa application to take the existence of that 
surety or bond into account when the application was made.
<P>
	The best way I can describe the types of difficulties that the 
bill is aimed at resolving is by referring to an individual case. 
The individuals involved know I will be speaking about the case 
because I mentioned the same case a couple of years ago in 
Parliament. They are good enough to permit me to use it as a 
good example of why the bill might be of assistance.
<P>
	It relates to members of the Saravia family who live in 
Scarborough. They have lived in Canada for about 20 years. 
They are originally from Bolivia. They have brothers, sisters 
and other family in Bolivia.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	A couple of years ago after some discussion it was proposed 
that one of the brothers visit for Christmas. He had never met his 
nieces and nephews here, and everyone thought it was a good 
idea. The mother had successfully visited Canada with a visa 
about a year and a half prior to that time. In this instance the 
visitor, Mr. Torres, travelled to Peru because we do not have a 
visa issuing office in Bolivia. He made his application about a 
week prior to Christmas. He went with his airline ticket and a 
document sent to him by the family here and was turned  down 
for a visa. Regrettably while in Lima he was robbed by some 
people there. The Christmas visit did not take place. That was 
the bottom line and my constituents were unhappy about it.
<P>
	This is one case in hundreds I have had to deal with as a 
member of Parliament. I know all members of Parliament, 
particularly those of us from urban areas, have had to deal with 
the problem of applications by family members for visitors' 
visas.
<P>
	In this particular case we received a letter of explanation in 
our office. It was a good letter, a good response. I am not in any 
way critical of our officials in Lima. They replied and gave their 
version of an explanation. I am going to read portions of the 
letter because they help describe some of the background. They 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Visitors visas are a very tricky part of our work. As you know, a great number of 
aliens enter Canada each year as tourists and try to stay after their original stay has 
ended. We have to determine in each case, with very little information at hand if 
the applicant is really a visitor or if the person is an immigrant trying to enter 
Canada on a tourist visa. The only way an applicant can convince us that he or she 
is really a visitor is by demonstrating that he or she has very strong ties to his or 
her home country which will force him to return to that country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is what we expressed to Mr. Torres to show us. He explained he was 
leaving his wife and two children behind. He declared he had a job in Bolivia to 
which he wanted to return. Unfortunately he showed absolutely no proof that 
his financial situation in Bolivia was comfortable or that he had any property or 
good reasons to return.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is very frustrating for a Canadian resident to know that a 
brother, sister, mother, father, son or daughter cannot make a 
family visit because he or she does not have financial resources, 
when often the family in Canada does have some resources.
<P>
	Therefore the bill is intended to rectify the omission from the 
process. We were just speaking a few moments ago about the 
criminal process where the victim has been excluded from the 
process. Here is another process, the visitor visa process, where 
the resident Canadian, the relative, the person who has invited 
the father or mother to come and visit, has been excluded from 
the process and does not have role. The bill will provide for a 
surety or a bond that will give these Canadian families an 
opportunity to participate in the process and provide greater 
assurance that the visas will be followed through.
<P>
	The surety proposed does not require cash. The amount would 
be set by the Department of Immigration in the ordinary course 
as it sets other bond amounts. It provides the resident Canadian 
with a role in the process. It gives the Canadian a stake in 
ensuring that the terms of the visitor visa are met. Because these 
are family members there is a reasonable amount of suasion 
existing. There is a bond, a relationship between the visitor and 
the inviting family. Surely there is a degree of what I would call 
suasion in having the visitor fulfil the terms of such a visit.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="2462"> 2462 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The current law in section 8 creates a bit of a catch-22. 
Subsection 8(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where a person seeks to come to Canada, the burden of proving that that person 
has a right to come into Canada or that his admission would not be contrary to this 
act or regulation rests on the person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the visitor. It has nothing to do with the Canadian. 
Subsection (2) indicates:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person seeking to come into Canada shall be presumed to be an 
immigrant until that person satisfies the immigration officer examining 
him-that he is not an immigrant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Basic visitors have to obtain visas and are basically presumed 
not to be bona fide visitors. There is a presumption that they are 
not bona fide visitors. They are presumed to be immigrants.
<P>
	That is built right into the act. It is a great procedural device to 
put the burden on the visitor. If I were a Canadian with a family 
visitor from abroad, I would not be too happy about it.
<P>
	I suggest it is a bit of a catch-22. It is not fair to these 
Canadians. The challenge of setting aside that catch-22 is 
exacerbated when there is a language barrier. Many visitors 
coming to Canada do not speak English as a first language. If the 
visa officer is looking for some subtleties in intention here, it is 
going to be awfully difficult to pick up on those subtleties when 
the language being spoken is not a first language. In the few 
questions that are asked the information exchanged is going to 
be pretty basic.
<P>
	Turning to some of the statistics behind the bill on the surface 
do not look bad. In 1993 the department issued 545,000 visas or 
over half a million visas around the world. It turned down almost 
82,000 around the world. That is not a bad statistic. One might 
say that is not too bad in the face of half a million visas issued. I 
think about 79,000 of those turndowns were relatives of my 
constituents but that is not true. It just takes two or three of them 
to frustrate the heck out of a member of Parliament.
<P>
	Over 50 per cent of the people in my riding are immigrants. 
This means it is likely many of those Canadians have families 
and relatives abroad who want to visit. Therefore 82,000 is a big 
number. Even if there were only 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 affected 
by the bill, it is a big number when we are talking about 
Canadians who want family visits to take place.
<P>
	There are two perspectives worth noting. One is the huge 
increase in the number of families in Canada with relatives 
abroad. People are moving all over the globe now. There are 
huge increases in travel and large increases in the numbers of 
immigrants to Canada so hopefully many more family visits can 
take place.
<P>
	Second, the refugee claims process has poisoned the 
atmosphere for visitor visa applications. In all cases visa 
officers are on the lookout for phoney refugees. There might 
even be a real refugee who is trying to get here through a visitor 
visa. Our visa officers put their careers on the line when they 
grant visas. I understand and I am sure other members 
understand that they cannot be seen to be making many 
mistakes. Every time a fake refugee claimant stays here on a 
visitor visa the dollars start to add up. It is not $1,000; it could be 
$20,000 or $30,000 in costs to the federal, provincial and 
municipal taxpayer by the time we are done with legal aid for a 
lawyer, welfare support during processing, the cost of the 
processing, the accommodation and so on. It is a very frustrating 
and high stakes games. These are some changing realities we 
have to keep our eye on. Canadians have been neglected in this 
process.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I want to conclude by outlining some of the salient features of 
this private member's bill. It provides a formal role for resident 
Canadians to participate in the process. Right now all we have 
happening with resident Canadians is sometimes they will go to 
a lawyer or a notary and get a letter prepared that says: ``My 
brother, John, is going to visit and I will support him while he is 
here''. They get the notary to seal it. The notary charges them 
$50 or $100. I will not comment on the appropriateness of the 
fees. As can be seen in the letter from Lima, Peru that kind of 
intervention by the Canadian family did not carry much weight 
in the decision.
<P>
	Second, my bill would provide a material financial assurance 
of compliance with the visa by the visitor.
<P>
	Third, it provides a real linkage between the applicant and the 
Canadian family doing the inviting.
<P>
	Fourth, my bill would not prejudice those applicants who do 
not have a relative in Canada or do not put up a surety. The bill 
specifically provides that the absence of a surety is not to be 
taken into account by the visa office.
<P>
	Fifth, it provides for individual applicants who have Canadian 
relatives the same ability to be bonded as group visitors 
currently have under the existing act. Group visitors can have 
bonding arrangements. Individuals at the moment cannot.
<P>
	Sixth, it will not change the test for visitor visas. It will not 
change the underlying test and we will have the same test and the 
same safeguards. It will provide a significant role for family 
members here and provide a further assurance of bona fide 
fulfilment of the terms of the visa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2463"> 2463 </A></B>
<P>
	To conclude, I am hopeful that the government will listen 
carefully and include this type of amendment, this mechanism, 
as a new feature of the Immigration Act when it next considers 
amending our Canada Immigration Act.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly not a coincidence that Bill C-219, whose 
purpose is to amend section 9 of the Immigration Act, is being 
discussed today, March 17, St. Patrick's Day. Wishing a happy 
holiday to Canadians and Quebecers of Irish descent is a 
privilege for me as one of my ancestors on my mother's side 
came from green Erin. To my Irish compatriots, in particular 
those from Quebec, who are proud of their roots and their 
culture, I am pleased to wish a most enjoyable holiday.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Members of the Official Opposition 
have, on many occasions in this House, pointed out the 
considerable contribution made by new Quebecers and new 
Canadian citizens to the building here of a pluralistic society 
open to the world. A large number of people from every part of 
the world have made Quebec and Canada riches with their 
cultures and their skills.
<P>
	Incidentally, the composition of this House mirrors the 
Canadian mosaic as many members, in addition to being 
Canadian citizens, also have deep ties to their or their parents' 
native countries. On Canadian soil, it has been proven that there 
is a place and a warm welcome for people who choose Quebec or 
Canada, be they from Europe, Asia, Africa or Latin America. 
But their new lives do not erase their strong attachment to their 
friends and families still scattered all over the globe. These ties 
are essential and their value must be recognized by any civilized 
nation by amending legislation to make it fair and humane.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	We believe that, if passed, Bill C-219, the bill to amend 
section 9 of the Immigration Act before us today, will make it 
easier for non-Canadian relatives of Canadian citizens and 
permanent residents to obtain visitors' visas. This bill is a 
legislative amendment which is both fair and humane.
<P>
	The members of this House know that, depending on the 
planned duration of their stay on Canadian soil, certain people 
must obtain a visitor's visa from a Canadian embassy abroad.
<P>
	To be granted entry, people requesting permission to come 
into Canada must meet a number of requirements. They must 
hold a valid passport and return ticket. They must also state the 
reasons of their visit. In other words, foreign visitors who apply 
for a visa to come into Quebec or Canada and visit with relatives 
must prove that they are genuine visitors and comply with the 
provisions of the Immigration Act and Regulations. They must 
also  prove to the visa officer handling their application that they 
have enough money to support themselves while in Canada and 
that they fully intend to return to their country of origin.
<P>
	We agree with the law that people who want to Quebec or 
Canada for a visit must have sufficient financial resources for 
the cost of living in Canada. This provision stands to reason, 
since the length of the stay is usually one to six months, with the 
possibility of extending it once in Quebec or another province.
<P>
	However, figures from the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration for 1992 indicate that Canadian visa offices abroad 
have rejected over 100,000 applications. The majority of these 
applications, Madam Speaker, were made in Third World 
countries and certain Eastern European countries.
<P>
	Are visas actually denied mainly on financial grounds? It may 
very well be so. As the movers of this motion, we think it is 
immoral and totally unjustified to assume that less wealthy 
visitors who come from these countries would not act in good 
faith.
<P>
	Consequently, it is important that persons applying for a visa 
who are not well off have their applications examined by an 
official much in the same away as applications from persons 
who are more financially secure are considered, if indeed 
members of their family in Quebec or in Canada or members 
who are permanent residents are prepared to put up a bond or 
surety.
<P>
	Some people may object to this bill on the grounds that 
increasing the number of visitor's visas only increases the 
number of refugee claimants. They will point to recent figures 
released by the Department of Immigration which show an 
increase in the number of refugee claims made by persons 
entering Canada with only a visitor's visa.
<P>
	Our answer to them must be that whether in possession of a 
valid visa or falsified papers, persons fearing persecution for 
political, religious, ethnic or other reasons have rights which are 
recognized under international law, notably under the Geneva 
Convention to which Canada is a signatory.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, it is neither a crime nor immoral to seek 
refuge in a country which respects human rights.
<P>
	In conclusion, the members of the Official Opposition, who 
believe in the fundamental values of Quebec society, values 
such as generosity and open-mindedness, will unequivocally 
support Bill C-219. The amended Immigration Act will show 
even more respect for the citizens of this country who, through 
their differences and their work, enrich our society.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
on the interesting work he has done on behalf both of his 
constituents and all Canadians on this issue.
<P>
	I might add, and I know the hon. member made mention of 
this, that it is not just in this Parliament but in the previous 
Parliament as well. He deserves congratulations. His interest in 
this is both timely and a good reminder to all of us who work in 
this area.
<P>
	This is an area that interests all Canadians and that is why the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has announced a new 
consultation for a 10-year immigration framework and one that 
the minister hopes to be making the first statements about this 
coming fall.
<P>
	Canada's Immigration Act lists clear policy objectives to 
facilitate the entry of visitors into Canada for the purpose of 
fostering trade and commerce, tourism, culture and scientific 
activities and international understanding.
<P>
	The decision to issue or not to issue a visitor's visa is based on 
the intention of the person seeking to visit Canada. It is very 
interesting that this bill should come up for debate today 
because I was discussing this very matter with senior 
departmental personnel earlier today before an appearance at 
the committee. One of the more senior public servants was 
telling me that one of the things he makes a point to do when he 
visits our offices abroad is to go to the visa office and observe 
the visa officers.
<P>
	I think it is very true and something that bears repeating here 
in the House that the particular knowledge and ability of our visa 
officers, who are a very small but very specialized group in our 
foreign service, to make the decision right there on the ground 
particularly in some of the offices that are very crowded, that are 
over-subscribed by vast numbers of people wishing to come to 
Canada for a variety of reasons, to make good decisions and to 
make the right decisions is pretty amazing. The senior staff I 
spoke to today made mention of this more than once as 
something that we should be very proud of, our foreign service 
officials who are working for Canada.
<P>
	We have in place a network of 47 full service and 25 
specialized officers abroad located in Canadian embassies, high 
commissions and consulates who are ready to process visitors' 
visa requests all the time.
<P>
	In 1993 Canadian officials overseas received 627,394 
applications for visitors' visas. They issued 546,457 of these 
visas. Only 81,937 of these requests were refused or withdrawn. 
That is an 87 per cent acceptance rate and I think that is, again, 
an amazing figure. Most of these visitor visa requests are 
completed within 24 hours.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	In general, the problems we hear of as members of Parliament 
make up a very small percentage of the volume that is done by 
our Canadian offices abroad.
<P>
	I want to make very clear that the minister believes the hon. 
member raises some very important issues with his private 
member's bill. They are issues certainly worthy of review. I am 
sure the minister responsible for citizenship and immigration 
will take the member's words and bill for review. A great deal of 
interest such as has been generated here today will continue 
certainly on behalf of the minister and the department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to be able to speak on the subject of immigration for 
the second time today.
<P>
	I am going to be taking another side to this debate. I should 
point out this House has not been active in the promotion or 
discussion of legislation dealing with immigration and I applaud 
my hon. colleague for breaking ground.
<P>
	Our current Immigration Act despite its enormous length has 
the appearance of having no teeth as its enforcement is sorely 
lacking. This also applies in the area of visitor visas. In the 
minds of many Canadians it fails to ensure that Canada is 
adequately protected from abuse.
<P>
	Canada needless to say is a nation with a sterling reputation 
for compassion and openness. However when that openness is 
abused the result can be a backlash and a decline in Canadians' 
tolerance for newcomers or even more so directed toward the 
legislation that does not seem to fit the abuse. Polls indicate that 
this is precisely what is happening now.
<P>
	Canadians see example after example of abuse in the system. 
They fail to see that immigrants are not to blame per se since 
those immigrants or visitors who are abusing the system are 
only taking advantage of the incentives for abuse that our 
present immigration law provides.
<P>
	One area of abuse that may not make the headlines frequently 
but that is nevertheless a growing strain on our immigration 
system is the failure of many to leave the country after the 
expiration of their visitor visas. As a result of this abuse, 
immigration officials have been tightening up the requirements 
needed for visitors to enter Canada on visitor visas.
<P>
	Currently one of the determining factors in whether or not a 
visitor visa will be granted to an applicant is if the applicant 
poses a risk for non-compliance with the terms of departure 
from Canada. This security is especially hard on young males 
and unattached people who it is often determined may have little 
reason to return to their native land. This is especially so when 
Canadian immigration is unable in most cases to undertake the 
process of apprehension and deportation of people who have 
overstayed their visas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2465"> 2465 </A></B>
<P>
	However if family members who are citizens or permanent 
residents of Canada were able to post a bond and the posting 
of that bond were allowed to influence the decision making of 
the immigration official, then not only would the possibility of 
overstaying be reduced but so would the likelihood of unjust 
rejection for visitor visas. At least that is how it should work 
in theory.
<P>
	In reality however this legislation may have the effect of 
actually encouraging more abuse of the system. This legislation 
if passed, may result in even more people coming to Canada 
with no intention of leaving and then staying on without ever 
being apprehended. Allow me to explain why.
<P>
	This bill makes no mention of the size or the type of bond, 
whether it is cash or security. Therefore we must assume that the 
bond will not be overly sizeable. If that is the case then citizens 
or permanent residents of Canada who desire to bring to Canada 
a family member may well end up making a rational, economic 
decision to buy a family member into Canada using a bonded 
visitor visa rather than going through the long and complicated 
process of sponsoring under the family class.
<P>
	Further, when one sponsors a relative there is an obligation to 
support the individual for a lengthy period of time. I know this 
requirement has been ignored by many and is also rife with 
abuse. Nonetheless it is a requirement that presents an 
obligation which could be enforced, if this government would 
only demonstrate the political will necessary to enforce it and to 
support its enforcement officers and divisions.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Were one to sponsor a visitor visa by posting a bond, there 
could be at most the loss of a couple of thousand dollars. No 
further financial or more important, legal obligation would be 
pending. Instead of accomplishing what this bill on its face 
seems to, this bill would in fact open the doors for further abuse.
<P>
	I have brought the text of this bill to the attention of 
individuals with far more knowledge than I possess in the field 
of immigration. After review, the response I received from them 
was that while this bill could help to make the visa process 
somewhat less discriminatory, the price could very well be a 
flood of visitors who intend to take up residence in Canada by 
overstaying those visas.
<P>
	Furthermore I was told that it is virtually impossible due to 
manpower shortages and legal limitations to track down, 
apprehend and deport illegals who have overstayed their visas. 
A huge percentage of illegal immigrants to Canada have used 
this route to enter the country. This legislation, by making the 
process of acquiring a visitor visa easier for those individuals 
who pose a high flight risk could make the number of illegals 
that much higher.
<P>
	Further this legislation could make it impossible to charge a 
citizen or permanent resident of Canada with aiding or 
harbouring an illegal immigrant. After all if one has posted a 
bond and then forfeited the funds then legal recourse may be 
exhausted.
<P>
	There is also the issue of fraud to consider. Fraud permeates 
the immigration process in Canada in the form of faulty travel 
documents, falsified visas and the transfer of documents. It is 
regrettable that this bill does not address this issue. Rather this 
bill seeks to make the acquisition of visas even easier and 
ignores the rampant abuse of the visitor visa system that 
currently exists.
<P>
	One other point should be made regarding this bill. This bill 
assumes there is some mechanism to determine if and when a 
visitor on a visa leaves the country. How else could the 
forfeiture of a bond occur? However there is no such process. 
While visa visitors do have their date of entry logged with 
Immigration Canada, their date of departure is not. Thus this bill 
is premised upon an enforcement mechanism which by all rights 
should exist but does not.
<P>
	In short, I applaud my hon. colleague for having introduced 
this bill and to attempt the beginnings of a badly needed 
restructuring of immigration law. However this bill is 
shortsighted and suffers from the same malady that reflects so 
much of the legislation that comes into this House.
<P>
	In theory we have a good idea here. I know the intentions of 
my colleague are laudable, but this bill would make a presently 
existing problem even worse. To make our immigration system 
function any worse than it does now would be to be jeopardize 
the future of all immigration into Canada by further raising the 
level of intolerance that this failed system has begun to create.
<P>
	I respectfully oppose this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I second the private member's bill of the hon. member 
for Scarborough-Rouge River. In my riding of Don Valley 
North about 50 per cent of the population are new Canadians. Of 
course I am one of them.
<P>
	This bill will help the system in many ways. It will cut the red 
tape in our embassies or visa offices overseas. It will help the 
families living here. It will give them the opportunity to 
celebrate holidays, important days, religious days or weddings 
together.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	It will help tourism in Canada. The more visitors we have and 
the less restrictions there are on visitors, the happier they are to 
spend their money and generate revenue to Canadian businesses.
<P>
	I am more than happy to second this bill. I urge this House to 
accept this recommendation and take it to committee. In 
committee we will certainly support this bill. I hope the other 
committee members will do so when it comes to the vote in 
committee.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2466"> 2466 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Madam Speaker, I proudly 
rise to support this bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River. He has set a course that is practical 
and realistic in terms of solving some of the problems we 
presently have in the immigration system.
<P>
	I would like to see this idea expanded toward the family 
sponsorship of immigrants. There are increasing numbers of 
experiences where families sponsor immigrants to come to 
Canada. Then in a very short time for whatever reason they 
abrogate their contract with the federal government to continue 
their support. Therefore, seems that the principle of bonding 
would be a very practical means of accomplishing this.
<P>
	I also suggest to the hon. member that in terms of student 
visas, young people who come to Canada to get their education, 
the principle of bonding could be applied as well. That would 
allow Canadian educational institutions to offer their services to 
young people from other parts of the world.
<P>
	I speak from personal experience. Some of my friends and I 
attempted to have a young Dominican man admitted into Canada 
to complete his education which he could not get in the 
Dominican Republic. He was turned down twice. A write-in 
campaign was launched with the minister and with the 
adjudicating officer in Santo Domingo. He had to participate 
and take documentation with him to show he had won the 
president's citation four years in a row in that country and that 
he was a highly respected member of his community, and so on.
<P>
	Finally after the third attempt, this young man came to 
Canada. He is here now completing his education in computer 
science. He will go home bringing something very new and 
special to that country. His mother continues to reside there.
<P>
	This is a very positive step. Having run this idea by my 
constituents in the last few months in speaking to chambers of 
commerce and various people I have received only positive 
response. They felt very strongly that this was a good new 
direction to take and that it would help very much to solve some 
of those problems that end up often causing a backlash among 
settled citizens in this country. Anything we can do to overcome 
that is a positive step.
<P>
	My constituency office has been in touch with various people 
in the immigration department. The suggestion has been floated 
there. I can say it has received positive response even there.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member. This is an excellent move. I 
would like to see it expanded and moved into a larger base. I do 
not believe for one minute that my friends in the Reform Party 
can be serious that this would simply be tacked on as a cost of 
doing business, if you like, for somebody to buy their way into 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that all that needs to be dealt with there is how 
that bond is applied and at what level. This is a mechanical 
process and I do not think it needs to be simply the price tag for 
getting into Canada.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to endorse this bill.

deemed to have been moved.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
are starting the adjournment debate 10 minutes early, and 
although I cannot make any assumptions about the absence of 
members from this House, I would nevertheless appreciate it if a 
member of the government would respond to this motion.
<P>
	On Tuesday, I put a question to the Minister of the 
Environment about Phase I of the St. Lawrence Action Plan. I 
protested the fact that Industry Canada spent only $5 million in 
Quebec on Phase I to clean up a river which flows mainly 
through Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2467"> 2467 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest we look at the figures that were given initially. I 
will round off the figures for the sake of convenience. Initially, 
Industry Canada had budgeted $20 million. Because of the 
recession, the government cut $2 million, which leaves $18 
million. More than $6 million was spent on projects which, in 
the end, did not make the grade, so that Industry Canada 
actually invested a mere $11.3 million of the initial $20 million 
that was to be used to clean up the river. However, the worst 
part is that Industry Canada spent only $5 million in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the St. Lawrence River flows mostly in 
Quebec. Consequently, I find it hard to understand why an 
amount close to $6 million was used to subsidize an Ontario 
pulp and paper company located in Miramichi, in New 
Brunswick, several hundred kilometres from the St. Lawrence 
River. After all, there are dozens of plants like that one along the 
river. Why choose the Miramichi facility?
<P>
	I also find it hard to understand the $450,000 subsidy to 
Marsh Engineering, from Port Colborne, on Lake Ontario, for 
the treatment of oil discharged by ships which could some day 
navigate on the St. Lawrence River. Again, there are many ports 
along the St. Lawrence in Quebec, including Montreal, Quebec 
City, Trois-Rivières, Sept-Îles and quite a few more.
<P>
	So, why was only $5 million of the $12 million spent in 
Quebec during Phase I of the St. Lawrence Action Plan? After 
all, as I said, the river flows mostly in that province.
<P>
	I remember clearly that, in the 1980s, there was a serious 
problem with maple trees in Quebec. The Government of 
Quebec did not buy a plantation of evergreens or oaks to study 
the problem, It bought an enormous sugar bush, and its officials 
conducted tests and soil analysis, and found solutions to the 
problem.
<P>
	To clean up the river, it would have made sense to concentrate 
efforts where the river flows. I find the attitude of the 
Department of Industry unjustified.
<P>
	In conclusion, the report on this issue states clearly that the 
partnership between Environment Canada and the Department 
of Industry is a failure. The two departments went in opposite 
directions as regards technology.
<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Minister of the Environment made a formal 
commitment to the effect that all monies allocated to the St. 
Lawrence Action Plan would be spent in Quebec. Can she tell us 
now how she will control the monies invested by other 
departments during Phase II of the Action Plan, in order to avoid 
a repeat of what happened during Phase I?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>First of all, what I told the House was that 
the funds earmarked for Phase II of the St. Lawrence Action 
Plan will be spent on cleaning up the river.
<P>
	Having said that, I must point out that the St. Lawrence runs 
all the way from Brockville, Ontario, before reaching the sea in 
the Lower St. Lawrence district. My brother's father-in-law has 
a cottage in Carleton, on Chaleur Bay, just across from New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	What we want to do it is to clean up the St. Lawrence and that 
is exactly what we have committed to do before this House. All 
the funds earmarked for this project will be spent on pollution 
control.
<P>
	That being said, I think that the hon. member is taking a 
narrow view when he claims that, in the event of technological 
problems, investments will necessarily be distributed on a 
geographical basis. He must have heard of Dr. Jonas Salk, the 
medical researcher who developed the vaccine to stop the polio 
epidemic afflicting so many people around the world.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We did not tell Dr. Salk, who was with the University of 
Toronto, that the funds had to be invested in Toronto.
<P>
	What is important is to use the right technology. The 
technology used to clean up the St. Lawrence has to be good, 
whether it is developed in Quebec or elsewhere. If there were a 
problem in Lake Ontario or Hamilton Sound, near where I live, 
and a research scientist from Montreal could find a way to solve 
the problem, I would not tell him not to just because he is from 
Quebec.
<P>
	I think that the decision to invest in cleaning up the river is a 
sound one. Our government is not the one that signed the 
agreement under which the funds were not distributed properly. 
This five-year plan for cleaning up the St. Lawrence River was 
signed by the current Leader of the Opposition, who was 
Minister of Environment at the time, and his Conservative 
colleagues. This plan did not specify how much was to be spent 
on pollution control. That is only part of the problem anyway.
<P>
	The other one is making sure the right technology is used. I 
am sure that high-tech environmental companies in Quebec are 
very competitive and would not appreciate it if we decided that 
all funds for the Great Lakes could come only from companies 
around the Great Lakes. What we are looking for is good 
environmental technology that can be used in Ontario as well as 
in Quebec or in other provinces. That is what real environmental 
technology is about.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUARANTEEDANNUALMINIMUMINCOME">GUARANTEED ANNUAL MINIMUM INCOME</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
follow up on a question I posed on March 15 regarding the 
concept of a guaranteed annual income.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2468"> 2468 </A></B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development continues 
his review of social policy, I want to encourage him to fully 
consider and do a cost benefit analysis on the concept of a 
guaranteed annual income.
<P>
	Today I would like to present five benefits that I believe 
commend this notion to the minister for further consideration.
<P>
	First, in terms of efficiency, we need a comprehensive 
program to consolidate the patchwork of social programs that 
presently exist. We could consolidate the guaranteed income 
supplement, child tax credit and exemptions, married 
exemptions, federal Canada Assistance Plan transfers, old age 
security and possibly GST tax credits under a guaranteed annual 
income. Unemployment insurance as well or parts of that 
program could also be included.
<P>
	Does it not make sense to provide one form of support instead 
of continuing the multiple programs process and bureaucracy 
that exist presently?
<P>
	We talk about streamlining government. The guaranteed 
annual income could help us in this regard.
<P>
	Second, what about work incentives? Many people fear that a 
guaranteed annual income will encourage people not to work. I 
believe that is precisely what our list of programs does right 
now. Currently, social programs have a high taxback rate on 
additional earned income, some up to 100 per cent, that in many 
cases makes it not possible for recipients to return to work. If by 
finding low wage employment a person risks losing certain 
other important support, that person really cannot leave the 
system.
<P>
	Because the guaranteed annual income would be integrated 
with the tax system it could provide a gradual taxback of 
benefits as a recipient finds other sources of income.
<P>
	My sense is that there is only anecdotal proof that a 
guaranteed annual income would be a disincentive to work. In 
fact, the real proof may exist on the other side. A recent study of 
the Mincome experiment in Manitoba found that a guaranteed 
annual income did not affect people's work habits.
<P>
	As well, the National Council of Welfare recently released a 
study which showed that low income Canadians respond to 
incentives to work better than people with above average 
incomes. A person struggling to make ends meet does not have 
the luxury to relax instead of work.
<P>
	I am convinced that Canadians want to work and if properly 
structured a guaranteed annual income will support Canadians 
to do so.
<P>
	As for effectiveness, social policy can be more effective if it 
responds to the different needs of Canadians. A guaranteed 
annual income is able to do just this. Flexibility in the taxback 
rates and guarantee levels can provide effective income support 
for Canadians who cannot be expected to enter the workforce 
and those who  are able to work as well. As well, in our changing 
economy skills and training are essential elements that create 
opportunities for lower income Canadians.

	A guaranteed annual income would provide income support 
for those people who participate in training and skills 
advancement.
<P>
	Let us consider economic benefits. Good social policy makes 
good economic sense and allows us to get lower income people 
the money they need to buy the resources they need to serve their 
families and they spend it in our local communities.
<P>
	Finally, let us talk about dignity for Canadians. I believe that a 
guaranteed annual income protects the dignity of lower income 
Canadians. First of all, it provides effective income support so 
that Canadians are able to meet their basic needs.
<P>
	Second, there would be no requirement to go through the 
humiliating needs test that are part of the Canada Assistance 
Plan.
<P>
	With a guaranteed annual income people do not need to 
remain on welfare just because it does not pay to work. 
Moreover, Canadians will have the support needed to gain the 
skills necessary to compete in today's job market.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe and I try to show that a guaranteed 
annual income could provide significant benefits for all 
Canadians. I urge the government to do a thorough cost benefit 
analysis of this concept. It is time to consider a real step change 
in Canada's social assistance policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has asked me to furnish a response on 
his behalf this evening.
<P>
	I know the minister would want me to begin by recording his 
gratitude and admiration for the continued interest of the hon. 
member for Brant as well as for the thought provoking 
suggestions which she has put on the record this evening.
<P>
	I say on the minister's behalf that the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development has been listening to Canadians 
express their views on social security reform. The minister has 
also appointed a small task force of Canadians involved in 
matters of social security and employment reform to help him 
pull together the elements of the reform process.
<P>
	In April the minister will be presenting an action plan setting 
out the options and the choices for the standing committee to 
consider during the course of the summer, using the widest 
possible means of public dialogue.
<P>

<P>
	The concept of a guaranteed annual income program to meet 
all the needs of persons with insufficient income has been 
considered time and again by previous governments, both 
federal and provincial.
<P>
	The broad outlines of a guaranteed annual income are 
consistent with the department's goal of overhauling and 
streamlining current programs to make them more effective at 
addressing the social security needs of people today.
<P>
	A guaranteed annual income would require major reforms to 
the structure and financial arrangements underlying several 
components of the income security network, including 
unemployment insurance, social assistance, child benefits and 
taxation.
<P>
	One guaranteed annual income proposal which has garnered 
much attention in recent months has been the income 
supplementation program for Newfoundland and Labrador 
prepared by that province's economic recovery commission.
<P>
	Federal and provincial officials are working together to 
review and assess the Newfoundland proposal to see how it 
could fit into the government's national social security reform 
process.
<P>
	However, this government cannot consider a guaranteed 
annual income outside the context of the broad social security 
reform process.
<P>
	A guaranteed annual income is a very innovative approach to 
reform that is not constrained by the existing program structure. 
Such a proposal could be presented as one of the many options 
available.
<P>
	Before any such option is considered, careful consideration 
will have to be given to various government objectives, 
including job creation, achieving current fiscal objectives and 
addressing the inequities inherent in the current system of 
government programs.
<P>
	The social security reform process is an ambitious plan with a 
tight timetable that will result in major changes for Canada. The 
action plan review process will be open to the public. 
Consideration on all options will require the participation of our 
partners, the provinces, as well as the Canadian public as a 
whole.
<P>
	These are essential programs and this government does not 
intend to leave any stone unturned in considering how best to 
reform the social safety net.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.35 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1)
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
