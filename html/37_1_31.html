<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SUPREME COURT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-234, an act to amend the Supreme Court 
Act be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to the 
bill today.  I am only going to address one-half of the bill 
because the motion is not votable and there is only one hour of 
debate.  So in the interests of time I am going to only look at 
the second clause of the bill that would limit the application of 
charter decisions by the supreme court.  If a decision is not 
unanimous on the part of the supreme court judges, then the case 
at hand would apply only to the case at hand and would not be 
broadly applied as is the usual case now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill arises from the fact that so often when an appeal is 
brought before the supreme court that has charter implications, 
when the supreme court rules, whether it is a unanimous decision 
or a majority decision, the government, Mr. Speaker, usually 
applies its decision universally.  It takes it as a direction in 
law and a charter direction, and it usually has enormous impact 
on Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern for this issue arises out of the Marshall case about 
two years ago.  In that case, Donald Marshall and several other 
aboriginals were caught by fisheries officials with 464 pounds of 
eels that they had taken out of season and were selling.  They 
had even used an illegal net.  In other words, these individuals 
were poaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were brought before the courts and would have been subject 
to a considerable fine but their defence before the lower courts 
was that they had a right to take the eels under a treaty of 1760 
between the British crown and the Mi'kmaq.  That went through two 
levels of courts, the provincial court and then it was appealed. 
Finally, it came before the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must bear in mind that the convictions were upheld by 
the two lower courts.  However, when it came before the supreme 
court, seven justices sat, five ruled in favour of the accused. 
In other words, they overturned the decisions of the lower 
courts.  Two ruled in favour of the lower courts and upheld the 
conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have to see how it works.  The appeal process that goes 
to the supreme court chiefly consists of bringing before the 
court, and the court accepts the particular case at hand.  The 
supreme court reviews all the evidence of the lower court and 
allows one hour for each side to present its case.  There is a 
certain provision in time for interveners who the supreme court 
can decide to allow to intervene or not.  All in all the entire 
decision making process takes less than three hours in open court 
and for the most part the deliberations are done in camera with 
the justices using their law clerks to prepare a digest of the 
evidence.  They make their decisions based on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in this place it may take many days and many levels of 
debate in order to pass legislation; first reading, second 
reading, report stage, third reading and the Senate.  In the case 
of the supreme court, it is a matter of only a few hours of open 
court and the rest by law clerks and individual justices 
themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Marshall, this decision to uphold the rights of 
Mr. Marshall and others to gather the eels out of season, it is 
not really the problem of how the justices came to that decision 
which concerns us here today.  If we put 100 people in a room and 
asked them whether they would agree with the decision in the 
Marshall case, I think we would probably find only 3 or 4 would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implications of the Marshall case were that it allowed 
aboriginals to not only fish out of season but to fish for 
commercial reasons, for sale.  The five supreme court justices 
who upheld the appeal cited reasons that we find difficulty 
following.  They said it was the honour of the crown.  They had 
to read into the treaty of 1760 that which was not there because 
they had to put it in an historical context.  They admitted that 
they were doing something historians were expected to do.  They 
were at odds with historians but they took it upon themselves to 
be the historians and set the expert testimony aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justices also admitted that while they did not hear all the 
particular testimony, they still felt that they could come to 
this conclusion regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They even made a political decision. They said in their 
conclusion that the aboriginals were entitled to make a moderate 
livelihood and they said that regulations could certainly be made 
to make this work.  Where we in the House would spend days to 
devise a policy with respect to the fisheries, just to devise a 
policy, and have extensive debate to establish the rules 
pertaining to the fisheries, the five judges in the Marshall case 
determined that it could be done just like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into questioning the decisions of the 
justices.  The point is, Mr. Speaker, is they came down with 
their decision with the two judges dissenting and the two judges 
who were dissenting simply said that the treaty of 1760 applied 
to 1760 and we could not apply it to the present.  We would agree 
with that.  So they rejected it and five accepted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue.  What happened right after that, which 
concerns us here and is the reason for this legislation, is 
immediately the Department of Fisheries and Oceans issued an 
internal memo.  One of the clauses of the memo about the 
implications of the Marshall decision, which I remind members was 
a split decision, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the immediate focus is on access to the fishery, the 
judgement will have application to other resources.  Development 
of a comprehensive response will involve many departments of the 
federal government, and provincial governments as Treaty 
beneficiaries pursue harvest of wildlife and timber. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Mr. Speaker, the federal government immediately 
saw in Marshall a broad application to aboriginal rights to all 
resources to not only gather it for sustenance, but to gather it 
for a moderate livelihood, in other words, for sale.  It is no 
wonder that a few days later the Minister of Indian and Northern 
Affairs came out publicly and said that this was a decision that 
was going to entitle aboriginals across the country to have 
special rights to natural resources, to not only exploit natural 
resources but to sell them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened.  There was a terrible conflict around 
Burnt Church in Nova Scotia.  That conflict continues.  There has 
been a tremendous unease across the country with the thought that 
there could be a situation where aboriginals have rights to 
natural resources and rights to the exploitation of natural 
resources based on race alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not need to be that way.  In fact, there is nothing in 
Canadian law anywhere that says that a decision of the supreme 
court, any decision for that matter, has broad application when 
it is a charter decision.  It just does not exist.   What has 
happened is that a myth has been created since the charter was 
passed in 1982 that somehow the supreme court in Canada has the 
same context in the interpretation of laws and the application of 
laws as in the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact this is not so at all.  For the supreme court, or high 
courts as we have, interpreting constitutional law, is basically 
something that has evolved since the second world war.  For the 
most part, most countries prior to the second world war 
functioned on a parliamentary democracy system.  What has 
happened since the second world war, and probably as a result of 
the second world war, is many countries, including Canada, felt 
there should be some restriction on the opportunities of the 
executive.  Thus high courts were implemented, including our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the constitution that was brought back in 1982 
actually defines the role of the supreme court.  There are a few 
passing references only, but nothing dictates that the federal 
government should interpret split decisions of the supreme court 
as being broadly applicable across the country.  We do not need 
to go down that route.  One of the sad things about this entire 
situation is that there has never been a serious parliamentary 
debate examining the role of the supreme court's decisions and 
its application to charter law and how charter law should be 
applied to Canadians.  I think it is high time that this 
situation was brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other classic case involving the supreme court, just to give 
another example of what has happened, is the charter was passed 
in 1982 and in 1986 a challenge was brought before the charter 
that led to the Singh decision.  It involved seven convention 
refugees who were all in Canada illegally.  One in fact had come 
in on a visa with a forged passport.  The refugees were caught 
and the court ruled, after various levels had suggested that they 
should be expelled without a full hearing and according to the 
legislation at the time, that they were entitled to a full 
hearing and upset the lower courts' rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a lot of people do not realize is the Singh decision was 
not a unanimous decision.  Three judges only found evidence in 
the charter that suggested that the existing immigration law was 
not charter compliant and was unfair to the accused.  The other 
three justices came to their decision based on the Canadian Bill 
of Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to understand that the Singh decision was a 
split decision.  Indeed, the three justices who chose the 
Canadian Bill of Rights to argue that the seven should have a 
full hearing specifically said that they were not considering the 
charter in their decision.  There we have a classic example where 
a split decision of the court has had manifest impact on Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has it made it very difficult for Canada to control 
aliens coming into the country who perhaps have criminal 
connections or whatever, but every one of us in the House has a 
problem with people seeking visas to come to visit their loved 
ones and relatives in the country.  Every office has this 
problem.  What we need to do is turn those people back because 
according to the Singh decision there is every possibility that 
if they decide not to return according to their visa then they 
have recourse to due process.  Tens of thousands of people are 
denied entry into Canada because of the Singh decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to realize that the Singh decision was 
confusing.  The three justices decided on the basis of the 
charter that the seven accused were entitled to an oral hearing. 
However it was the other three, in terms of the Canadian Bill of 
Rights, who cited section 2(e), which said that no law should 
“deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance 
with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination 
of the rights and obligations”. It was that section which led to 
the problem where we are turning back all these visa 
applications.  It is not a charter problem at all.  It is the 
problem of the interpretation of the Canadian Bill of Rights in 
the Singh decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that at the beginning of that section it says that 
there is a notwithstanding provision in the Canadian Bill of 
Rights, that the government has the choice under the Canadian 
Bill of Rights to suspend 2(e) in special circumstances, and yet 
the government has never done it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is simply that it is not the supreme court with 
which we have difficulty.  It is not the charter with which we 
have difficulty.  The problem is we have difficulty with 
successive governments that have interpreted the decisions of the 
courts more broadly than anything in law requires them to do, and 
indeed more broadly than anything in parliamentary tradition that 
Canada, the United States or Europe requires them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to review the situation with respect to how government 
interprets the decisions of the supreme court.  It is high time 
that parliament, both the House of Commons and the Senate, took a 
look at what the government is doing and set rules whereby, in my 
view, it should be only unanimous decisions of the supreme court 
that should be broadly applied, not split decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot for bringing this matter 
before the House today.  I will be asking for unanimous consent 
that this matter be deemed votable and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has articulated his comments very succinctly.  As he 
indicated, this is an issue that has not received much discussion 
in the House or in committees.  The member, in bringing this 
forward, does a great public service not only for the House but 
for the courts and for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues that I would like to raise.  I do 
not necessarily agree with everything in the bill but I think 
that is why we need to have discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would amend the Supreme Court Act by adding a number 
of paragraphs, the first being that when the question heard by 
the court is of a constitutional nature that the court consider 
parliamentary and other extrinsic materials, such as the 
<I>Debates</I> of the House of Commons, the Senate, legislatures, 
and law commission reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is when the question heard by the court is of a 
constitutional nature and the decision of the court is not 
unanimous, the decision should not be considered a precedent in 
other circumstances in which the same constitutional issue 
arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some concerns with respect to the first matter.  The 
courts in many circumstances routinely consider this type of 
information when it is presented to the court by one or more of 
the parties.  The courts hold that this type of information is 
admissible and then consider the weight of this evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am familiar with this evidentiary issue.  In my former life I 
was a constitutional lawyer.  I was the director of 
constitutional law for the province of Manitoba.  The legislative 
evidence to which my colleague referred provides an important 
context in assisting with interpreting the legislation.  As a 
director, I often referred to this type of evidence, which is 
important in order to give the court a clearer understanding of 
this legislative background.  This type of evidence was called a 
Brandeis brief.  That is an American term but is utilized quite 
extensively in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would not only allow the introduction of Brandeis 
briefs by counsel but, in addition, puts a positive onus on the 
court to consider the intent of the legislators and not simply go 
off on a frolic of its own, as has often been the case with some 
judicial activists on the court.  It is a very important and 
positive onus on the courts which I think should be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second paragraph in my colleague's bill, 
there is some concern that it may cause some confusion to the 
principles of precedent that have been established in Great 
Britain, in Canada and, to a lesser extent, other Commonwealth 
countries, and indeed the United States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am sympathetic to this provision because the intent 
is clearly to get the judiciary to focus on the issues before 
them and to attempt to arrive at greater uniformity and clarity 
in the judgment.  This is so important given the fact that the 
rights and freedoms of Canadians hang on the interpretation of 
these words.  Multiple judgments only serve to cause confusion 
among those who are required to carry out, enforce and obey the 
laws.  Again, the examples my colleague brought forward to the 
House are very germane to the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that when the courts criticize legislation for 
being vague and over broad, the courts often do so in language 
that is itself vague and over broad.  My colleague has brought a 
few examples to the attention of the House.  There are many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read judgments of the court where they criticize legislators' 
language and yet the language that they use and their conclusions 
are so hopelessly over broad and vague that they have done 
nothing to assist in the administration of justice or the 
enforcement of laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only beneficiary of these multiple types of judgments are 
the legal profession.  I, too, am a lawyer so I include myself in 
this as well.  However, the only beneficiaries of these multiple 
judgments are the legal profession who are then free to embark on 
a new, fresh round of litigation involving the same issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of discussion, whether the bill is accepted as such or 
otherwise, is very important for us to try to have the courts 
focus on what is important, on the issues that are in fact before 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, I would express my overall support for the 
bill.  Despite my concerns, I think the intent of the bill is to 
grant elected members of parliament a greater voice in the 
constitutional decisions that influence the laws of Canada.  I 
would also say that the bill is in part a reaction to the 
phenomena of the judiciary substituting its legal and social 
preferences for those made by the elected representatives of the 
people in parliament and the legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions made by the supreme court have a tremendous impact on 
the principles and institutions of our democracy.  We want to 
preserve our democracy.  We want to live in harmony with the 
courts.  We recognize the very valuable function of the courts 
but our respective roles as parliamentarians, as those who pass 
laws that implement social and legal policy are interpreted by 
the courts in their proper legal context.  We do not want that 
straying of the courts into the area of social and legal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the dangers of legal and constitutional anarchy that 
are reflected in some of the former judgments of the Supreme 
Court of Canada, and I cannot think of a better example than the 
Singh decision.  This decision certainly created difficulties for 
our bureaucrats and others who want to see fair laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite made the point about this depriving 
legitimate visitors to Canada who would like to see their 
families but are denied access because there is now an 
overabundance of caution that parliamentarians have to exercise 
because of some very misguided and confusing decisions.  Perhaps 
confusing is a better word than misguided.  I am sure the courts, 
in going through these judgments, are also trying to do their 
best.  We need to focus more clearly on the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated earlier that I would ask for the unanimous consent 
of the House that Bill C-234 be deemed votable and referred to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Failing that, 
I would move that the subject matter of the bill be referred to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague opposite for bringing the matter forward. 
It deserves the support of all opposition members and certainly 
all members from the party that the member opposite represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
actions such as these show us that the system has become a bit 
outmoded.  Sometimes we get to make fine speeches here without 
even any chance to vote. We are not even able to really have a 
finger on the pulse of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional aberration: the bill is presented by a government 
MP and it is the members of the government who are refusing to 
have it made votable.  That is a pretty special situation. 
Independent of whether people are for or against such a bill, I 
believe the House should be allowed to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vote would allow us to make it very clear that we in the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot support such a bill. 
This would at least show the consequences of such actions and 
would also make the government's position known.  We have a bill 
being presented by a member of the government side and the 
government is saying no to making votable.  This is rather 
unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I will address the bill directly since I have only 
10 minutes or so to discuss it and to tell the House what an 
extremely dangerous bill it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support such a bill since it mixes up some key 
principles which provide Quebec and Canada with a justice system 
that works overall.  We agree that there is always room for 
improvement. 
Generally speaking, however, Quebec and Canada have a justice 
system that has developed over the years into something that in 
large part meets the expectations of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons it does work is that Canada has a 
separation of powers which and this is important for a balanced 
justice system.  In other words, we have the legislative, the 
judiciary and the executive components of the one state called 
Canada.  That is why we can end up with decisions that may not 
suit us, decisions from the higher courts that we might have 
liked to see otherwise, but when the rules and the law are being 
applied, the system generally works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who lack familiarity with the rules I have just 
mentioned, the legislative system is us. 
People pass legislation that applies to everyone.  Especially, 
since the arrival of the charter of rights and freedoms, the 
laws have applied to everyone, unless parliament decides, 
through the use of the notwithstanding clause, that a law does 
not apply to a particular category or, more specifically, to 
others.  Let us be clear that up until now, no legislature has used 
the notwithstanding clause. The laws apply to everyone, 
as the legislative system provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judicial system comprises people who apply the laws passed 
by the legislative system.  How do they do it?  By interpreting 
each of the sections of the law.  There is a principle of law, 
of justice, which provides that the legislator is not deemed to 
speak in vain. 
Therefore all the clauses of a bill have significance and they 
are interpreted one after another by the judicial system.  It 
is however possible to not agree with a given decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a free for all if parliament intervened whenever the 
Canadian constitution was involved or whenever the rights set 
out in the charter were involved.  In nearly all decisions the 
supreme court examines, one of its criteria for agreeing 
to examine them is that the matter involves the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms or, very specifically, the interpretation 
of a statute of significance to Canada and a province, such as 
Quebec, for example, if the decision comes from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important points the supreme court addressed in 
recent years was the interpretation of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 
If Bill C-234 came into effect, the House would always have to 
deal with issues and interpretations relating to the 
constitutional validity of an act. The issue is whether or not 
the act respects the Canadian constitution or the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We would always be ruling on 
issues, thus depriving the supreme court of one of its 
responsibilities so as to keep us parliamentarians busy doing 
something. This is not how the system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive branch is the third level of power. It is the 
government that sets in place the judiciary and the executive 
branches. The separation between these three branches is 
extremely important and must continue to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member drafted his bill in a way that would obviously 
jeopardize the balance that currently exists. The Bloc Quebecois 
cannot support that. 
Regardless of the fact that we are sovereignists and that we 
support Quebec's sovereignty—this is the best thing that could 
happen to Quebec in terms of the legality of the justice 
system—over the years, Quebecers have made major contributions to 
improve Canada's justice system. I want to preserve that system 
and I will fight to protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill such as the one just introduced by the member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot does not make sense. I might 
have understood if it had been proposed by the Canadian 
Alliance, but I am very surprised to see this from the Liberals. 
The sponsor of the bill could easily cross the floor and join 
the Canadian Alliance. I hope he represents only a very small 
minority among government members. This is dangerous 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, did members listen to his speech? His 
intentions were barely veiled. He said that supreme court 
justices make rulings without even examining the substance of 
the issue and that they render repetitive judgments. We know 
that supreme court justices are extremely competent and they are 
serious when they issue rulings. They have clerks working for 
them. They have access to a whole staff of researchers and to 
libraries. The supreme court makes Canada proud, and even Quebec, 
as there are Quebecers who sit on the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that members should draft our laws because 
we review them very thoroughly. I want to give him an example. I 
am a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights. There are Quebecers and members from other regions of 
Canada who sit on that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give one example of how ridiculous the member's 
arguments are, in the case of the young offenders bill, the 
committee heard from 60 or so witnesses from Quebec.  No one 
in Quebec supports the minister's bill.  During clause by clause 
study, all members from Quebec present voted in favour of the 
bill.  What is the point of spending hours and hours going over 
something if the ultimate decision lies with the Prime Minister 
anyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all sincerity, I would far rather have competent judges 
handing down rulings on a case by case basis in light of existing 
statutes and regulations, independently of the legislative arm. 
Cases such as Shaw may involve treaties and customs but we also 
take these into account when we pass legislation here.

clauses in the bill to amend the Supreme Court Act in order to 
rebut, as it were, all the arguments brought in support of this 
bill, which does not really deserve our serious attention.  We 
should move on to something else as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to this private 
member's bill, and I commend the hon. member for bringing it 
forward.  I think we all agree that the subject matter bears 
consideration in the Chamber.  It is an issue of critical 
importance to the way we do business as a nation, to the way we 
engage in debate, and to the role the Supreme Court of Canada 
would play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the substance of the bill for a moment, it refers to 
the ability of legislators to demand or to mandate that the 
supreme court should take into consideration debates of the 
Chamber and debates that may transpire in committees.  That is 
not a bad idea in and of itself.  The difficulty I have is 
perhaps in the way it is worded, in that it would require or 
demand that the courts do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous speaker, who is a former attorney general of Manitoba 
and a constitutional lawyer, succinctly summed up best what is 
currently at work:  the courts, the supreme court included, have 
the ability to look at legislative debates.  They have the 
ability to ponder the background of how decisions were arrived at 
when legislation was drafted.  They have the ability to go quite 
far afield.  It is critical to say that in that context it is up 
to the lawyers who may be arguing the case, or the parties to the 
matter before the courts, to bring the matter forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unheard of for the supreme court or superior courts 
throughout the land to have researchers delve into this field.  I 
have difficulty with the mandate to tie the hands of the courts. 
I understand the background reasoning, but it is basically saying 
that we are important and have to be considered by them in their 
deliberations.  There are many members, myself included, who have 
some difficulty with imposing that upon the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On issues of constitutional considerations or charter cases the 
bill would require, in essence, a unanimous decision.  That would 
be required in all cases where the charter came into play.  We 
know that charter issues seem to be predominant in the number of 
cases before the courts.  We would very much be curtailing the 
way the courts function, the way the courts have independently 
acted since the mists of antiquity, since the times the courts 
were assembled to preside over and to protect citizens from an 
unruly or dictatorial legislator.  I will refrain from making any 
references to the current administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that in every case there has to be a unanimous decision 
troubles me.  There have been many instances of important dictum 
or comment by the court in the context of a judge who did not 
agree with the majority.  Looking at the circumstances and the 
way in which decisions are arrived at by the courts, I would say 
that this would perhaps unduly constrain the way judges react and 
interact with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reluctant to delve into the tying of the hands of judges in 
what some would argue is sacred ground.  The impartiality of the 
courts would be impugned to a degree, to say they had to be 
unanimous in each and every case where constitutional issues were 
before them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize, and as part of the debate I think it is 
important to recognize it, that there has been a number of 
decisions.  The hon. member opposite referred specifically to the 
Marshall case.  I say to him with the greatest respect that a 
great deal of responsibility for the way this case was decided 
rests in the hands of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
in the hands of the department of aboriginal affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision, which incidentally came from Antigonish 
county in Nova Scotia, dealt with native fishing rights as they 
pertain quite narrowly to eels.  What we saw resulting from the 
Marshall decision has opened a huge debate in the country.  An 
enormous chasm has occurred when it comes to natural resources, 
because we know this case will have application or that at least 
there will be an attempt to apply it to all natural resources and 
to land rights. 
We have already seen references to the case throughout the land 
where native rights are currently before the courts.  That is not 
to say that because of what transpired in the Marshall case we 
should react quickly in somehow rejigging and reconfiguring the 
way the courts operate.  I agree that it is an important issue 
that must be debated.  Perhaps what we need to do as a matter of 
course is look at the entire Supreme Court Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very much behind the sentiment of the hon. member is the idea 
that we should be looking at the way the courts have currently 
construed their powers.  To a large extent we have seen instances 
where legislators were sidelined or completely put to one side 
and instances where, the Chair will recall, the supreme court has 
told legislators that they must come back and fix something, even 
within a specific time period.  We have known instances where 
legislators did not comply, much to the chagrin I am sure of the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implications for any changes to the Supreme Court Act are 
long term.  For that reason alone I do not think we can trundle 
into this exercise with any degree of levity.  We must look very 
carefully at what we are mandating the courts to do, because 
again there are very distinct roles.  The hon. member from the 
Bloc Quebecois set out quite succinctly the different roles that 
are to be played by legislators, the executive branch and our 
courts, our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision is probably not the best starting point 
when we enter into this exercise because, for any number of 
reasons, emotions are certainly running high at this point.  I 
have one correction for the record:  Burnt Church is in New 
Brunswick, not Nova Scotia.  I say that with the greatest 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bands are currently facing a situation, not to get off into 
a separate debate, where the interim agreements will expire this 
month.  That certainly brings a real sense of urgency to 
resolution of the issue of natural resources and access to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the commentary in the debate about the 
language that is often used and the need for clarification.  We 
saw that occur in Marshall.  We know that rulings which contain 
specific references to things such as moderate living are open to 
a great deal of interpretation and misinterpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case comes to mind where the supreme court talked about 
exigent circumstances in police pursuits.  It resulted in a great 
deal of consternation in the law enforcement community.  We have 
seen ample evidence of supreme court decisions where legislators 
are either implicitly or very directly called upon to come in and 
fix what their decisions will result in because of the confusion 
that can reign from what the supreme courts have handed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot, I would suggest, take out certain sections of the 
Supreme Court Act and attempt to try, in what is often an old 
legal maxim, to do through the back door what one is prevented 
from doing through the front.  We cannot try to somehow, in a 
roundabout way, get the courts to behave differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a broader context, either at committee level or perhaps in 
some sort of broader study, we must try to examine the role of 
the courts vis-à-vis elected officials who, I would suggest and 
certainly many in this place would agree, have a much broader 
mandate.  They have the same constituency, but a much more 
specific mandate as to what their role is to be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing the matter to the floor 
of the House.  This is the proper forum for the discussion.  I am 
reluctant to support the legislation in its current form, 
although I realize that it is brought forward for debate and to 
flesh out a problem that currently exists in the courts of 
Canada.  We must preserve the independence and the separate roles 
and look at the issue again perhaps in a broader circumstance in 
the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the Minister of Justice to address Bill 
C-234, an act to amend the Supreme Court Act, introduced by the 
hon. member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is healthy in a democratic country such as ours to have 
debate about the respective roles of the judiciary and parliament 
and the dialogue between those institutions.  I thank the member 
for giving us the opportunity to debate the issue before the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After consideration of Bill C-234 and the effect of the proposed 
amendments on judicial independence, it would be impossible for 
the minister to support the bill.  Allow me to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-234 proposes two amendments to the Supreme Court Act. 
Both amendments would apply only in constitutional cases.  The 
first amendment, section 52.1, would require the supreme court to 
consider parliamentary and other extrinsic materials that deal 
with the purpose or intended effect of a provision or act when 
the constitutional validity of a statutory provision is at issue. 
The amendment lists commission of inquiry or law commission 
reports, debates of the House of Commons or Senate, and debates 
of the provincial legislatures as examples of the types of 
materials the court would consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment at best simply codifies an approach that 
has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada since at least 
the Anti-Inflation Act reference of 1976.  In that case, Mr. 
Justice Ritchie wrote that it was not only permissible but 
essential to consider the material the legislature had before it 
when the statute was enacted.  It is expected that parties before 
the court will bring evidence of the purpose and intent of the 
impugned legislation to the court's attention.  Such materials 
indeed form an integral part of the government's arguments under 
section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a danger that the provision could be more 
broadly interpreted as requiring the court to independently 
research any such evidentiary materials that have not been 
brought forward by the parties.  Such an application of the 
provision would significantly increase the court's already heavy 
workload and could result in possible delays in the 
administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the reading of the proposed section would run 
contrary to a basic tenet of our common law and adversarial 
system: that it is for the parties alone to decide the issues and 
the evidence that will be brought before the court.  As a result, 
the Minister of Justice is unable to support the proposed 
introduction of section 52.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the second proposed amendment in Bill C-234 which, 
in only a couple of sentences, would create uncertainty in the 
law and raise serious questions about equal access to the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment would make only unanimous supreme court 
decisions on constitutional matters binding on all Canadians. 
Where the decision was not unanimous the judgment of the court 
would be deemed to be only applicable to the case being heard. In 
other words, the decision would not be considered a precedent in 
relation to other circumstances in which the same constitutional 
issue arose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is equally unable to support the 
proposed amendment.  The amendment is clearly contrary to the 
doctrine of precedent that underlies Canadian constitutional law 
and that supports the need for certainty in the law.  Pursuant to 
this doctrine, the decisions of a court are binding on courts 
lower in the judicial hierarchy regardless of whether the 
decisions are unanimous or by majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only Canada but all common law countries have accepted the 
doctrine of precedent which enables parties to rely on a court 
judgment with the knowledge that people in like circumstances 
will be treated alike.  Adoption of the proposed amendment would 
result in confusion, uncertainty and increased litigation within 
the Canadian legal system as parties, including governments, 
would be required to repeatedly contest or defend the 
constitutional validity of legislation whenever a unanimous 
decision was not reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment of section 52.2 could have the further consequence 
of creating an unequal application of laws.  Under the proposed 
provision, the circumstances of individuals or organizations 
other than the parties before the court would not be covered by a 
majority decision and further litigation would be required for 
redress.  However not all those affected by the challenge 
legislation have the necessary means to assert their rights in 
court and consequently would not enjoy the same benefits of the 
law.  The minister cannot support such unequal application of the 
law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is further compelled to oppose both of 
the proposed amendments to the supreme court act as they will 
quite likely be construed as violating the constitutional 
principle of judicial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments impinge directly on the decision making process. 
Judicial independence is a fundamental principle under the 
Canadian constitution.  Its dominant requirement is that judges 
be completely separate in authority and function from all other 
participants in the judicial system, including the legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the three essential elements of judicial independence is 
the constitutional independence of the court with respect to 
issues bearing directly on its judicial functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process by the which the court reaches its decisions is 
clearly an integral aspect of its judicial functions.  That 
process includes the evidence the court is required to take into 
consideration, as raised by the proposed section 52.1.   Section 
52.2 of the hon. member's bill could be seen to even more 
directly infringe upon judicial independence if it has the 
purpose or effect of forcing courts to make unanimous decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision would contravene the individual as well as the 
institutional independence of judges to make their decisions 
impartially and free of extraneous influence.  Such interference 
with judicial independence could only serve to erode public 
confidence in Canada's judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together the two provisions raise serious concerns regarding 
both their constitutionality and their legal efficacy.  In light 
of these considerations the Minister of Justice is unable to 
support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me sound a warning.  There is a myth 
that exists here in this place, and perhaps in the bureaucracy as 
well, that our supreme court is mandated in the same way as the 
U.S. supreme court under the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just heard the parliamentary secretary's remarks and I must 
have missed something, but in fact I do not see anything in our 
constitution that describes the role of the supreme court and 
judicial independence.  It only gets a passing reference.  The 
role of the supreme court is in fact defined under the Supreme 
Court Act rather than our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The warning I would like to sound is this: in fact, our supreme 
court has no protection from parliament.  In fact, we can change 
the role of the supreme court.  We can do whatever we want with 
the supreme court by changing the Supreme Court Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we can basically nullify the impact of the supreme 
court by the use of the notwithstanding provision.  We do not 
want to do that, but I am afraid that if the supreme court's 
decisions continue to be interpreted in a way that is out of sync 
with Canadian society the supreme court will lose its 
credibility.  It only exists in the parliamentary system because 
we believe in it.  I believe in it here in this legislature, but 
it has no protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not do something as parliamentarians to ensure that 
public confidence, instead of being eroded as is the case now, is 
enhanced in the supreme court, then maybe another justice 
minister 10 years from now will act in the public interest, or as 
a result of public sentiment, and fall down upon the supreme 
court and reign it in, in ways in which we on all sides of the 
House would not want to see.  Once public confidence in the 
supreme court is lost it can never be recovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the supreme court, when it comes to 
legislation, can only make a decision based on the information 
presented before it.  If the government lawyer or the government 
side, for example, does not present a full case, the justices 
will come to a decision that is in error because they have not 
heard the full case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Marshall, the justices said that there was no representation 
made by the government on whether the 1760 treaty rights had been 
extinguished.  Had the government made that representation the 
court would have considered it.  It did not make that 
representation because the government was convinced that it would 
win just basically because the treaty itself was not applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Singh it was a similar situation.  The justices there said 
that had the government made an argument under the reasonable 
clause or the reasonable provision in section 1 of the charter of 
rights, that might have changed its decision with respect to the 
seven convention refugees, but because it was not presented it 
was not considered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have to come up with some sort of plan whereby if 
it is a unanimous decision, it is acceptable, and that is fine. 
If it is unanimous, then obviously there has been sufficient 
evidence before the court that we as the Canadian public—not 
just members of parliament but the Canadian public at large, if 
there is unanimity—can believe or have reasonable reason to 
believe that the court has sufficiently considered the issue and 
that should be the last word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is a split decision, when some of the justices in their 
wisdom have gone on the other side of the case, as in 
Marshall—if we read the two decisions they are like black and 
white—I would say the majority of Canadians would agree with the 
minority decision.  So we have this terrible situation arising in 
which there is a split decision that has been applied to all 
Canadians forever and the government has interpreted it to apply 
to all aboriginals across the country, all natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an intolerable situation.  The answer is not just to 
debate.  I realize the government can never accept a change such 
as I was proposing.  Never in a month of Sundays would it have 
ever accepted some radical change like that, but as the members 
opposite have suggested, there has to be debate.  I suggest that 
if a debate cannot be had in the House of Commons, then this is a 
subject matter that should be sent to the Senate and the senators 
should consider this for as long as it takes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I put the motion on the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that in all Contribution Agreements 
between the Federal Government and individual Indian Bands, the 
use of any public funds be publicly reported and audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout today my colleagues in the official opposition will 
identify many reasons why the present policy of the federal 
government concerning in this regard is simply not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the debate develops, it will be clear that the motion is 
intended to speak out on behalf of all taxpaying Canadians as 
well as the many aboriginal Canadians who are not receiving the 
answers to their questions from their own chiefs and councils 
when it comes to matters of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time aboriginal people do not have the tools to 
hold their chiefs and councils accountable, the tools necessary 
to track either public or private funds.  Our motion today asks 
the government to bring in legislation.  In so doing we hope the 
government will realize that there needs to be a separation of 
the revenue streams of public and private moneys going into the 
bands and the expenditures derived therefrom.  This is so 
important so that when audits are performed they clearly track 
this money, how it is being spent and where it is going.  In this 
way band chiefs and councils can be held accountable for their 
own spending habits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all part of the kind of accountability for which people 
are calling, people such as the Assembly of First Nations 
National Chief Matthew Coon Come, the Canadian Alliance, of which 
I am a part, and many other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are accountability issues such as the monitoring of band 
elections by Elections Canada, self-government issues in terms of 
greater democracy and transparency at the band level, and even 
public consultation on the owning of private property on 
reserves.  These issues continue on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear from the outset.  We on this side of the 
House understand fully the 1989 federal court Montana ruling. 
However, we believe that the federal government has fallen far 
short of its obligations to the Canadian taxpayers who demand 
full public disclosure and accounting for all of their tax 
dollars, not just some of them, regardless of what department 
they are being used in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, band revenues earned by band interests should be 
reported in a timely, accurate and transparent manner to all band 
members.  I have even heard from aboriginal people who believe 
that these funds should also be publicly reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, the Liberal government has been derelict in its 
duties to the Canadian public on this matter.  It has been 12 
years since the Montana ruling came down and yet the federal 
government has not taken the necessary steps to clarify, define 
and separate the reporting of public and private funds.  Today's 
motion provides a solution to the government's pathetic response 
to the problems of band financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for the benefit of members of the House and those who may 
be viewing this on television, let me be clear on the scope of 
the budget we are talking about.  The 2000-01 estimates for 
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada show that the department will 
spend $4.9 billion directly and that Health Canada, CMHC, Human 
Resources Development Canada and other departments will supply an 
additional $2.13 billion, for a total operational budget of $7.03 
billion.  We are not talking about change here; we are talking 
about huge amounts of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have every right to know how one of the largest 
government departments not only spends its tax dollars but what 
kind of return it is getting on its expenditures.  It is not a 
fiscal return necessarily.  We are talking about the social 
return:  the betterment of health for first nations and the 
improvement of housing conditions, levels of education and all 
kinds of things.  These are some of the things that are really 
important to all Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not blind to the plight of aboriginal people.  Yet 
they consciously wonder why, when over $7 billion is allocated to 
the department and to the government, many of our aboriginal 
brothers and sisters live without proper housing, without running 
water or proper toilet facilities, without full educational 
opportunities, and why they live with soaring unemployment, poor 
health, high suicide rates and epidemic substance abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are real live flesh and blood issues which are singularly 
killing aboriginal people, killing the body and wounding the 
soul.  For far too long they have been ignored by government and 
even by their own leadership, and this simply has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for truth to be spoken in the nation in this 
regard.  The truth very often is not politically correct.  There 
are people who do not want to hear the truth because of their own 
vested interests.  The truth, however, is not ambiguous.  The 
truth is not something to be feared.  The truth is clear and 
concise.  The truth is to be embraced because it is unchanging. 
However the truth will do no good at all if it falls on deaf ears 
and is never acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several decades the Indian and Northern Affairs 
Canada has moved to divest itself of the direct operation of 
programs.  To a certain extent I agree with this.  All people 
need to be seen to be as responsible as possible for themselves, 
but we all know that not everyone is able to take full 
responsibility until one given the tools that will equip one for 
the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ask a council at the band level to suddenly take on the 
housing or health care issues facing its band is irresponsible, 
unless that chief and council have all the tools in place to 
ensure that they are able to meet the needs of their people. 
Surely this is only common sense, but very often in the 
department common sense is not to be found.  Time after time in 
report after report we hear that INAC is not ensuring that the 
goals are attainable by all of the bands across the nation.  The 
department has been long on talking the talk but very short on 
walking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small bands with limited personnel, expertise and other 
resources cannot be expected to meet all the immediate needs and 
demands placed upon them if change is to occur.  Without extra 
assistance, it is not feasible to expect the necessary social 
programs will exist and be delivered to all band members 
efficiently and effectively to bring about the desired results 
for change.  Yet because of the current disclosure policy 
concerning accountability, all we can base our opinions on are 
our observations and the reports that come to us from many people 
across the country.  Unfortunately many of those reports are not 
very encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the plight of the Dene Tha first nation of northern 
Alberta.  Here is a band that in addition to its INAC funding has 
oil and gas reserves.  The people should be happy.  They are not. 
They have many concerns over the governance of their band. They 
are concerned about where their money has gone.  They are 
concerned that they cannot find answers.  They are concerned that 
their chief and council have let them down.  They are concerned 
that the minister of Indian affairs and the Prime Minister have 
let them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the words of Verna Soto of the Sturgeon Lake Cree 
nation, also of Alberta?  She wants to have better health and 
education opportunities.  The health of her children and others 
on the reserve is of serious concern to her, so serious that she 
is willing to step forward and publicly call for change.  These 
people have put their lives on the line for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have with us today in the gallery Leona Freed, who has formed 
the First Nations Accountability Coalition working on behalf of 
grassroots aboriginal people, and I salute her.  Leona is one of 
the many people across the nation who are calling for 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we present today is a small step forward to the 
public, transparent accountability of taxpayer money.  We urge 
all members of the House to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know it is sometimes more customary 
to move an amendment at the end of debate, but our party would 
like to move that the motion be amended to read that the 
government immediately stipulate that in all contribution 
agreements between the federal government and individual Indian 
bands, the use of any public funds be publicly reported and 
audited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would move immediately into the mode of the motion that we 
anticipate or hope to have passed at the time of the vote. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things to which I would like to draw 
attention to before I move through my main thesis.  What we mean 
by publicly reported and what we understand that to involve is 
being available to anyone through access to information, such as 
members of bands much more readily, sometimes they are 
stonewalled and put off from getting this information, and also 
to members of the general public because it involves tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the unanimous consent to a change by our House 
leader at the top of the hour, and why we allow it to be 
stipulated in all contribution agreements that they be publicly 
reported and audited, is because if we just used financial 
transfer agreements there are seven older methods which would 
escape untouched.  Because the government has dragged its feet 
for so long on moving to financial transfer agreements for all 
its dealings and all the mechanisms, we are quite glad to 
acknowledge this and consent to all contribution agreements being 
publicly reported and audited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus for the most part on the way in which the 
government has hindered the development of financial 
accountability over the years, how it has stopped that from 
happening, intentionally in some cases and in other cases maybe 
more by neglect, and how it has allowed some very poor handling 
of allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility to ensure that there is 
financial accountability among Indian bands.  One way this is 
done is by handling allegations of financial mismanagement and 
wrongdoing in a proper way.  Yet in this area, the government and 
past governments have done very poorly.  It has failed to address 
adequately allegations brought by band members in particular but 
others as well.  I would like to address this important aspect of 
the government's failure to promote financial accountability, and 
the key word is accountability, among Indian bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs reported that it 
received over 300 allegations relating to 108 Indian bands during 
the two year period preceding the auditor general's report in 
1999.  Those allegations related to matters like social 
assistance issues, mismanagement of funds and other concerns. 
Because the department's data is incomplete, as found by the 
auditor general, there could be many more allegations.  In fact I 
am of the strong view that there are many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had people come to my office with affidavits and documented 
supporting evidence in what seemed to me like very clear cases of 
allegations, but the cases went nowhere.  We will talk about that 
later.  There are probably many more allegations which have come 
to various members of parliament on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we need to address is this.  What has the 
government been doing to address these allegations?  If we ask 
the government, it would say that it is doing its job, maybe that 
it is doing a fine job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs published 
certain principles of accountability including principles of 
redress.  In its guidance to Indian bands and how to complete 
accountability and the management self-assessments, the 
department elaborated on redress as a key principle of 
accountability in the following words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Formalized review and appeal rules and procedures are in 
existence for operating programs and key governance functions 
that impact on the rights/entitlements of individuals and/or the 
community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general noted that the government's position, as 
reflected in the statement, was that mechanisms already existed 
for objective review and resolution of allegations.  However does 
this reflect reality?  Is the government really living up to its 
words when it comes to appeal and review processes?  The short 
answer is clearly it is not.  On the contrary, the government 
deserves a failing grade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention three things that lie behind the 
government's failure in this regard which enable the government 
to avoid enforcing accountability measures in dealing with Indian 
bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first way is that the government can pass off responsibility 
far too easily.  Essentially, it can pass the buck in this way. 
The department said that often the proper action for it to take 
would be to refer the allegation to other parties and that the 
ultimate responsibility for addressing an allegation may lie 
within an Indian band. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220
<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is bizarre.  It is nonsense.  To say people who have grave 
concerns and documentation in hand about misappropriation of 
moneys, wrong use of moneys and so on by band chief and council, 
and to be told that they have to go back to them to present that 
information and they will decide whether or not there is anything 
to pursue, is the height of ridiculousness.  It is ridiculous to 
think that could resolve something and get redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department skates around this stuff because it does not want 
to look silly or incompetent, and it is not doing its job. 
Therefore, it sloughs it off as well.  In some cases the 
department has said that they should go to another funding 
agency.  This other funding agency does not want to be shown up 
as being incompetent either.  Maybe it has not vetted or screened 
it properly, so it passes it off and pushes to the side. Perhaps, 
it has said for them to take it to a law enforcement or 
investigative authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many band members in their situations have gone with the 
evidence, as I see it not being a law enforcement person, which 
looks like pretty serious stuff.  The paper trail is there.  Yet 
these RCMP officers and so on will say that it is like nailing 
jello to a wall.  As long as there is a resolution on the band 
books saying that $50,000 can be spent on the trip to Las Vegas 
to maybe check out casinos, or economic development or attend a 
meeting, then there is nothing wrong and they can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be clearly inappropriate when we think there will be a 
shortfall of funds to health, education and other areas, and 
sometimes a very significant shortfall because of this 
inappropriate use of dollars.  However, it is not technically an 
illegality.  RCMP officers would say that we could not go to them 
because it was really difficult to nail this down.  It is like 
nailing jello to a wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, the end result is the government washes its 
hands of responsibility and nothing gets done.  The buck gets 
passed and allegations disappear off into thin air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an accident.  I believe the government has purposely 
left itself with a lot of wiggle room.  Maybe its lawyers have 
told it to leave it loose and very broad and to leave a big 
escape hatch there.  That is exactly what has happened.  The 
government left this big nebulous open no man's land escape hatch 
for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way in which the government avoids having to enforce 
accountability measures in its dealing with band members is by 
having no set guidelines on how to evaluate allegations.  That is 
laid out in detail in the auditor general's 1999 report.  I find 
this very shocking.  In February 1998 the department issued a 
national guideline to senior officials on how to deal with 
allegations.  The guideline defined and categorized the type of 
allegations, outlined the procedures to be followed, discussed 
the importance of departmental follow up and related matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general expected, he said in his report, to find in 
that guideline direction on the following topics, which I think 
are reasonable.  He said he expected to find something about how 
to evaluate the merit of an allegation, how to decide what 
additional information was needed, who should collect any 
additional information and how to decide whether the allegation 
should be resolved by the department or referred to other 
authorities or Indian bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general found little or no guidance on these topics. 
What he found instead was instructions on how to control the flow 
of documents and communications.  The department seemed more 
concerned with public relations than in taking allegations 
seriously and doing them justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's complete lack of substantive guidelines on how 
to address allegations shows that the government has 
intentionally, it would seem, left itself wiggle room to avoid 
addressing an allegation.  The government does not have to ignore 
its own guidelines because it has no guidelines.  There are none 
out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third way in which the government avoids having to enforce 
accountability measures in dealing with Indian bands is by not 
collecting information on allegations and referring it back so it 
can learn from specific cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find when we do not learn from history we are bound to repeat 
the mistakes of the past, so there is a problem there.  One 
office said it did not know how many allegations.  We have a 
major problem there.  That is why we need to take these steps. To 
sum it up, we have to take steps that move us in the right 
direction toward greater accountability and, therefore, 
improvements to the lives of average Indian band members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member for

he would propose an amendment.  Is it still his intention to do 
so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did it at the 
beginning of my speech.  The motion on the floor earlier was put 
by our House leader, and we want it to be immediately stipulated 
that we move to that end.  Therefore I move the following 
amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government immediately stipulate that in all 
Contribution Agreements between the Federal Government and 
individual Indian Bands, the use of any public funds be publicly 
reported and audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I declare the amendment 
in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the member of the opposition who has 
proposed replacement of his initial motion by the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that, in all contribution 
agreements between the Federal Government and individual Indian 
Bands, the use of any public funds be publicly reported and 
audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new wording, I am pleased to inform the House that the 
government intends to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must indicate, however, that another member proposed addition 
of the word “immediately”, which of course means that the 
practice would be implemented right away.  With the end of the 
fiscal year coming up in 12 days, needless to say we cannot 
support this amendment.  I fear the President of Treasury Board 
would be alarmed at a motion that would give her 12 days to put 
certain of these measures into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the initial motion is concerned, we fully intend to 
support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now put the discussion about first nations governance and 
accountability into context with a few basic facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members opposite will be familiar with the budget process. 
The Government of Canada tables the estimates in the House and 
then a budget.  I am sure that my colleagues realize that moneys 
spent by the Government of Canada are publicly disclosed and 
publicly audited by the auditor general.  Indeed, we saw how the 
management of the country's finances was key to the change in 
government in 1993 and in the re-election of the government in 
1997 and again in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are fully aware of the dividends 
that sound fiscal management and accountability pay to any 
organization, and indeed to a government. 
We have received 98% of the audits from first nations for the 
year 1999-2000.  The vast majority of these audits were accepted 
without any qualification whatsoever.  This means that an 
independent auditor found them to be entirely acceptable 
according to generally accepted accounting principles. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact I would like to put before the House is that only 
some 4% of reserves were placed under third party management last 
year.  They require our attention and of course they are 
receiving it, particularly under the very able leadership of the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to the motion today, I would also like to pay 
considerable attention to those first nations people who 
Canadians rarely hear about.  I want to talk about the vast 
majority whose success reflects the determination of first 
nations to manage their finances responsibly, to improve their 
accountability and increase their capacity to govern themselves 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any changes or new initiatives will have to be developed with 
first nations.  Notice that I said with and not for.  I am proud 
of the degree of consultation we have had with first nations. 
The Indian Act never contemplated first nations managing large, 
sophisticated programs to the benefit of their members or that 
they would be owners and operators of large, successful 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many first nations have large and successful businesses which 
they operate to give their members a share of the Canadian 
economy as equals with other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of success, not the least of which is 
the Meadow Lake Tribal Council, which is a powerful economic 
force in northern Saskatchewan.  There is the Fort McKay first 
nation, which is made up of important members of the Alberta tar 
sands development.  The Dogrib first nation up in the Northwest 
Territories are major partners in the diamond industry, supplying 
services and labour to this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three topics I would like to address in responding to 
the issue brought before the House by the hon. member who placed 
the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think it is important to look back and consider how 
first nations and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada have put in 
place funding agreements and other policies to support strong 
first nations governments and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to tell members of the House how Canada and first 
nations are working together to realize effective first nations 
government.  I also want to explain the safeguards that we are 
building together to ensure the responsible use of public funds. 
I also want to outline how this process is leading us toward our 
goal of first nations self-government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has looked for ways to permit 
more streamlined funding arrangements with greater local decision 
making and accountability.  Further, they stressed the 
accountability of first nations governments to their people, 
while recognizing a continuing accountability due to government. 
These actions were taken with the full understanding that 
Canadians should know how these funds were spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, including members of the House, who want to know more 
about how first nations funding arrangements are conducted in 
Canada have opportunities to learn more.  Allow me to address 
some of the fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is a critical issue.  First nations know that 
their long term interests are best served by taking firm control 
of their finances and continuing to improve their management and 
accountability practices.  This was related in the document 
entitled “Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding deficits, improvements in the quality and timeliness 
of first nations audits in recent years and a requirement for 
consolidated audits have shaped Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development Canada's ability to identify solutions where the 
debtload should cause concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deficits are not unique to first nations government. 
Anyone sitting in the House should remember the days, 
particularly under a previous government that I will not name, 
where deficits were rampant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other governments, first nations are required to prepare 
their audits in accordance with the public sector accounting and 
auditing standards of the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants.  The results of these audits are shared with members 
of the community and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's funding arrangements between first nations and the 
government range from a basic model known as a comprehensive 
funding arrangement to the first nations funding agreement.  In 
the latter, there is more flexibility for program and service 
delivery.  Capacity and willingness of first nations to accept 
additional responsibilities is included in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In either case, all agreements are prepared using a generic 
template that ensures the equitable treatment of all first 
nations.  The general trend in transferring funds has been toward 
negotiated global budgets that create an incentive for sound 
management.  The objective is to find the right mix of 
flexibility and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, agreements contain strong provisions to address 
the terms and conditions of funding agreements.  They include 
requirements to maintain accounts in accordance with accepted 
accounting principles as set out by the Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, the large majority of arrangements are working 
as they are intended.  The goal is to ensure that the band can 
develop the in-house capacity to manage its own finances.  The 
auditor general has identified a need to be more proactive in 
addressing allegations and complaints of wrongdoing.  Indeed, 
that is true, the auditor general is quite right in saying that 
the mandate of the minister's department poses a highly complex 
and sensitive challenge.  Despite the many challenges, our 
resolve remains to ensure that aboriginal people in Canada attain 
a quality of life similar to that of other Canadians.  That 
should be paramount for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne our government affirmed our 
commitment to strengthening our relationship with aboriginal 
people, supporting effective and accountable governance and 
taking action on the basic quality of life issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These objectives are clearly consistent with the auditor 
general's observations.  In our effort to continue to promote 
good governance for Canada's aboriginal people, we will support 
the new motion that was placed before the House today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, what does the member see the motion 
doing?  Does he see it doing something that the government 
presently is not doing or is it one and the same as what the 
government has been doing all along? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have just indicated, the 
government supports the motion.  Apart from the amendment the 
member himself proposed at the end of his speech, we are 
prepared to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated as well that we are aware of the comments made by 
the auditor general, and of the way they were presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, it is our intention to ensure an element of 
flexibility, naturally, in the government of native communities 
in Canada.  I have said that there are two categories, in a way, 
depending on the ability of the group to manage. 
There are two sorts of agreements and it depends as well on the 
general agreement between the Government of Canada and the 
native community in question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we want to ensure that there is a public audit 
report, as well.  The member opposite knows that the 
complication arises from the decision in Montana, which, need I 
remind all parliamentarians, requires that, if the government 
contributes to a project and a third party contributes to the 
same project, if I have properly understood the scope of this 
case, the government is bound and cannot release the audit, 
because it would involve making public figures belonging to a 
third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is to do is release audits in all cases in which 
the government contributes under similar agreements.  This is 
what the motion provides, and we support it.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the hon. member said in his 
response and we are glad to hear that the government will be 
supporting us on the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that from his perspective and the 
government's perspective they have indeed been good stewards of 
taxpayer money.  There is a huge amount of money that is spent on 
Indian affairs at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware that the statistics tell a different story? 
Unemployment rates in many bands across the country have soared 
to 85%.  The incidence of HIV and hepatitis C on reserves, as well as 
diseases, like tuberculosis, which is re-emerging among native 
people, has increased.  Diabetes has increased by four or five 
times the national average.  The suicide rate among native people 
on reserves is four or five times the national average. Substance 
abuse among the James Bay Cree and others is rampant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is all this money going toward supporting our native people 
not working?  Could the member please enlighten us?  Why are our 
native people still suffering? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a minister but not 
the minister of aboriginal affairs.  He would certainly respond 
to this far more eloquently than I, but for the hon. member 
across to pretend that the entire sociological phenomenon by 
which some of our aboriginal people are having difficulty has 
something to do with accounting practices is oversimplifying a 
problem that is far more complex than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across knows as well as I do that the 
destruction of the many ways of life that aboriginal people had 
without the replacement them with other meaningful ways of 
earning a livelihood and so on, has nothing to do with the issue 
that is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that many traditional livelihoods of aboriginal people 
have been so badly affected by a whole series of issues that have 
nothing to do with this is outside.  That is not an excuse for 
saying that we should tolerate bad accounting practices.  Of 
course not.  However it is not the same as saying that the issue 
of accounting practices, of disease, of unemployment and of 
everything else in aboriginal communities are somehow synonymous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise today to respond to the motion put forward by my 
colleague from the riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan.  For clarity, I am 
talking about the motion as it was first read and not as amended 
by the addition of the word “immediately”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to set the record straight on the 
accountability of first nations' governments across Canada.  I 
want to focus on the issue of first nations governments and their 
accountability, both to their communities and to the House.  We 
need to ensure that first nations citizens and all Canadians have 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Liberal government, or any other government for that 
matter, first nations chiefs and councils must be accountable to 
those they serve. 
They have primary accountability to their members for leadership 
decisions, sound management of council affairs and the efficient 
and effective delivery of programs and services.  They are also 
accountable to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada as well as 
other departments for the use of public funds provided to them.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide the House with examples of how first 
nations are taking hold of and driving the accountability agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discussion is one that is being played out across the 
country and it is being fuelled by a desire among first nations to 
break free of poverty and economic dependency.  As the grand 
chief of the Assembly of First Nations put it about a week ago, 
the chiefs had to lead and they had to lead by example and 
accountability.  The capacity to indicate to their people what 
they were doing was something else that he strongly advocated. He 
will lead the first nations in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes that paternalistic 
approaches in the past have done little to improve the standard 
of living for first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than a few years ago, fed up with the growing perception of 
the media, and in certain political circles that first nations 
were not financially accountable, the Alberta chiefs' summit 
launched a solemn undertaking.  Chiefs from treaties 6, 7 and 8 
in Alberta began work on the financial accountability initiative. 
The ultimate goal of this initiative was to address honestly the 
legitimate concerns of first nations people in Alberta about the 
issue of financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial accountability initiative demonstrated to the vast 
majority of first nations in Alberta that they already had strong 
financial accountability systems in place and that the summit 
chiefs were committed to further improvement.  This meant 
strengthening those systems to benefit both community members and 
to improve relations with government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the financial accountability initiative has produced 
two significant developments.  First, the proposed undertakings 
by the chief steering committee on financial accountability which 
describes undertakings designed to meet or exceed the Government 
of Canada's own standards for financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the establishment of working groups for financial 
officers and trial administrators from first nations across the 
province of Alberta.  The summit is equally committed to meeting 
or exceeding these standards while respecting the cultural 
diversity and unique needs, values and traditions of first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit produced a newsletter called <I>Council Fire</I> to 
explain and communicate to the members of their communities 
important news on financial accountability.  I would like to 
quote the editors of the inaugural edition of <I>Council Fire</I>. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As leaders, we—your Chiefs—must make greater efforts to 
communicate and demonstrate the financial accountability measures 
in place, and continue to work hard at improving and enhancing 
them.  As leaders, we must also actively listen to your concerns 
and the wisdom of the Elders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members about the Blood first nation.  It is the 
largest first nation in Canada.  Over a year ago it enacted the 
Blood financial administration act bylaw which outlines and 
formalizes the accountability traditions of many generations. 
The bylaw defines policies, procedures and structures for the 
prudent financial management of community funds.  It codifies 
procedures to implement the accountability principles of 
disclosure, transparency and redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bigstone Cree nation of Alberta has also implemented a 
policy by which any community member can examine the financial 
books at any time and request the services of a financial officer 
to explain the principles and details.  With more than 5,000 
members living in a number of communities on the reserve, 
effective financial management is especially challenging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community meetings are held monthly at Bigstone to explain to 
community members the various decisions of council and to provide 
a forum for the discussion of any concern of the members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, once a month council doors are wide open for any 
member to come in and meet on an ad hoc basis with any member of 
council.  Far from avoiding responsibility to be accountable to 
membership, this first nation would like more people to come to 
the community meetings to learn about financial concepts and the 
budget allocation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all in the interest of expanding and developing the 
capacity for self-government and for the self-management of first 
nations funds and of those moneys that the public pursue provides 
for the basic necessities that for many years have been provided 
to these reserves and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it is not always done this well but we must build 
upon the good things that are going forward.  We must enhance all 
bands' efforts and wishes to know what is going on and to involve 
their people in the expenditure of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the Alexander first nation in Alberta, with 
approximately 1,300 members, made great strides in the area of 
financial management.  In 1994 it entered into a global funding 
agreement with the Government of Canada, which included health 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual report has grown in that time from a letter to all 
members to a newspaper listing the salaries and expenses for 
chief, council and senior personnel, and it is hand delivered to 
each household.  The newspaper format was so well received that 
it was used successfully by the chief to educate and encourage 
strong participation in a vote on whether to ratify a treaty land 
entitlement settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Whitefish Lake first nation.  It passed 
a deficit bylaw calling for the removal of the chief and council 
for exceeding budgets approved at annual general meetings.  The 
chief and council can also be removed from office for other 
reasons, including committing an indictable offence, failing to 
remain a resident of the reserve while in office, or 
inappropriately or illegally using funds.  It has also appointed 
a senate of elders which is working well as an advisory 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to examples of accountability in action in any 
number of first nations across the country.  We should recognize 
that many first nations are making great strides to open 
accountability to their membership and to parliament.  More and 
more of them are being invited to support band council 
resolutions and to adopt the undertakings I spoke about moments 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the government is committed to a path 
of partnership framed by the principles of “Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”.  I would urge all 
members to support the flexibility and accountability that the 
department is hoping for by trying to involve and to deal with 
our Indian communities so that they have the in-house capacity to 
deal openly and carefully with their money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak on the matter of a specific 
type of financial accountability that I have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member may know, I practised law in northeast 
Saskatchewan for 24 years.  Over the years I ran into particular 
difficulties with trades people and suppliers who worked in good 
faith with band councils and so on.  However, when the job was 
completed and the contract fulfilled, they had problems 
collecting their money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not good for business.  It sends out a message 
that is not good either.  It is difficult to get people to 
participate in band related matters because of this problem. In 
most commercial transactions where one party defaults one can 
attempt to garnishee bank accounts, to enforce a sheriff's writ, 
seizing and selling the assets, or to register a builder's lien, 
but too often these folks have no remedy whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small plumbing operation in my constituency has finished a job 
and is basically out $20,000.  He provided all the materials and 
labour on the project and I cannot see a remedy available to this 
gentleman.  It seems to me that there is a defect in the system 
of accountability if this practice is still carrying on.  I could 
see that sort of thing happening 20 years ago but this is 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my learned colleague on the government side have any 
suggestions on how that sort of problem could be sorted out so 
that people dealing in good faith with bands will receive payment 
for the work performed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's question.  Even today there are cases similar to the 
ones he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recourse in many cases has been the courts.  I presume he 
may be suggesting that the department should stand behind the 
things first nations do, but that would completely destroy what 
we are trying to do.  It would destroy the responsibility of 
first nations to deal with such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to provide me with some details then I 
could get him a reasonable answer.  I know there are cases where 
this sort of thing has been dealt with through the courts and 
people have been recompensed.  In some cases, the case goes the 
other way and the courts find that the builder or contractor from 
outside the reserve has not fulfilled the requirements of the 
contract.  As I think the member would agree it could go either 
way.  We cannot always be sure the builder employed will do the 
job properly.

know, as he should know, whether the practice by Indian bands of 
issuing cheques, welfare cheques in particular, to natives who 
live off the reserve has stopped or whether it still continues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the auditor told the bands to stop issuing cheques to 
natives who live off Indian reserves.  Could he tell me whether 
that practice has stopped? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would love to be able to 
say that I am aware of this situation and that I know for a fact 
it has stopped, but I am afraid I have to tell my hon. friend I 
am not.  I will make myself aware of the surrounding facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year parliament approves more than $4 billion in funding 
for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
for a broad range of programs and services in aboriginal 
communities.  This money is intended for such things as capital 
investment, primary and secondary education, social services, 
housing, health services and economic development projects. 
These services and programs are, in most cases, administered 
directly by first nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his April 1999 report, the auditor general indicated 
that allegations of improper financial administration had been 
made to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  In fact many people are concerned about the 
effectiveness of the existing standards for first nations 
accountability vis-à-vis federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following allegations of financial mismanagement on certain 
reserves, some politicians urged the federal government to put 
in place more transparent financial agreements with first 
nations and to improve accountability mechanisms with respect to 
aboriginal communities' use of federal funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the controversy, the extent of the financial 
difficulties of first nations communities is not really known. 
In his 1999 report, the auditor general said that approximately 
one-third of the 630 first nations communities were experiencing 
some degree of financial difficulty.  The Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development indicated that the majority of 
aboriginal communities were managing their finances well and 
that only a few, 4%, were being managed by a third party because 
of serious financial problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politically, however, the requirement that first nations 
communities be financially accountable to their members seems to 
be generating increasing controversy.  Two general concerns are 
emerging:  first, to whom are first nations accountable, and, 
second, are the existing accountability standards good enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois recognizes that accountability is an 
essential component of sound management. All administrative 
bodies must ultimately be responsible and accountable to those 
whom they represent. In other words, they must be accountable 
for their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal peoples have a responsibility to their members to use 
all the funds allocated to them by the department of Indian 
affairs in the most effective and efficient manner. Similarly, 
the department must be able to show Canadians, through the 
minister and the Auditor General of Canada, that all the funds 
allocated to aboriginal communities are used properly while 
allowing them to achieve strategically targeted objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, specific programs defined by the federal government 
were funded for a relatively short period, often on an annual 
basis. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the annual levels of 
funding of these programs, it was difficult for aboriginals to 
establish long term community development programs and to 
gradually build their infrastructures. That uncertainty also had 
the effect of restricting the ability of aboriginal people to 
strategically pool their resources and concentrate them in 
important areas such as the creation of long term jobs because 
resources were strictly allocated to a series of patchwork and 
separate programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, financial transfer agreements have provided 
greater flexibility to aboriginal people, allowing them to 
manage their own affairs, including when it comes to setting 
their own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transfer of responsibilities to the aboriginal communities 
must not, however, mean that the government abdicates its 
responsibilities.  It is still the responsibility of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to ensure 
that the programs it finances produce the planned results, with 
commitment of the appropriate funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there is considerable risk of failure when 
complex programs are transferred to communities that have had 
decades of total dependency on the federal government.  That is 
why the federal government and the aboriginal people must share 
responsibility for the effective administration of transferred 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has stated in his report that the Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development had not put enough 
effort into helping native communities prepare to administer 
transferred programs. 
He said repeatedly that the department must be answerable to 
parliament and to the public, like all other federal 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of program transfer, the department still has a duty 
to account for the way federal funds are being used and to 
ensure that acceptable results are obtained.  Through its 
fiduciary obligations, the government must retain the ability to 
audit aboriginal financial statements and provide tools for 
correcting situations of mismanagement.  This control by the 
federal government is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In several of the auditor general's reports during the 1990s 
comments were made on the aboriginal peoples' obligation to be 
accountable for the public funds received.  The 1990 report 
indicated that the department's funding mechanisms did not 
include a satisfactory reporting method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had significant ramifications, in particular making it 
impossible to know with any certainty whether funds had been 
spent for the intended purpose, were likely to attain the 
expected results and had been spent as efficiently as possible. 
In his November 1996 report, the auditor general pointed out 
ongoing shortcomings relating to the implementation of funding 
agreements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this report, the auditor general pointed out that the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs had a number of 
options at its disposal to encourage first nations to meet the 
standards agreed on, including the inclusion of specific terms 
in modes of funding, periodic and official supervision of 
financial performance and program implementation, the use of 
critical threshold indicators and the implementation of remedial 
action plans as a consequence.  He added that these measures 
were useful but that it was not always apparent they had been 
successfully implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this report by the auditor general, the 
department of Indian affairs adopted three principles in 1996 
with respect to accountability.  They involved transparency, 
disclosure and corrective measures.  In addition, it decided it 
would strengthen the band councils' requirement to be 
accountable to their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That year, the department even wrote to the chiefs and band 
councils to have those receiving federal funds examine their 
accounting and management systems and develop a plan of action 
to correct discrepancies.  It also informed first nations that 
these systems would have to be evaluated in the future in the 
case of all funding agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his follow up report of 1999, the auditor general looked 
primarily at the way the Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs had implemented his 1996 recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report included the following points, among others.  The 
department of Indian affairs was to establish a better 
relationship between the level of flexibility of the modes of 
funding and the desire and ability of the first nations to 
assume responsibility for the billions of dollars the department 
paid out to them every year.  The Department of Indian and 
Northern Affairs failed to take the appropriate measures to 
ensure proper resolution of allegations of impropriety and 
complaints and disputes concerning the modes of funding. 
Corrective measures—resolution mechanisms—had to be improved as 
elements of reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the recommendations made by the auditor general 
in his 1999 report, departmental officials informed the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development that a 
national data-bank had been established to collect complaints of 
inappropriate conduct and examine any emerging tendency in that 
regard. In addition to this national register, each regional 
office of the department now has access to a co-ordinator 
responsible for allegations and complaints. Moreover, a national 
co-ordinator develops standards, policies and guidelines on 
appropriate corrective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 15, 2000, in response to requests by politicians and 
members of the public demanding the disclosure of more financial 
information, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development wrote to the first nations to require that audits 
include the salaries, fees and travelling expenses of elected 
officials and leaders. 
Any first nation not complying with these requirements would 
stop getting discretionary funds and funds earmarked for non-essential 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development was directly managing the delivery of these numerous 
programs in aboriginal communities. Later on, in order to break 
the cycle of dependence of aboriginal communities on the federal 
government, the latter began to sign financial agreements with 
the communities. These agreements were very specific and 
detailed as to what had to be done, how and what expenses were 
eligible for refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 the Special Committee on Indian 
Self-Government released its report, known as the Penner report. 
In that report, the committee severely criticized the financial 
agreements for leaving very little decision making power to the 
first nations to apply programs and funds according to their 
specific capabilities and needs. It was suggested that 
agreements be signed, which would have more to do with what had 
to be done than with how it should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, funding arrangements have evolved to take into 
account the relationship that exists between the Government of 
Canada and aboriginal peoples. One of the major features of that 
relationship is the government's official policy announced in 
1995 recognizing the inherent right to self-government, a right 
that had long been claimed by aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the 1996 report of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples, the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, in the document entitled “Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”, also undertook to 
implement a new financial relationship with aboriginal peoples 
and to develop stable funding mechanisms which would encourage 
the accountability and self-sufficiency of aboriginal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, contribution agreements are the primary mechanism through 
which first nations receive funding.  These agreements set out 
spending conditions, including standards of service to 
communities, and accountability and performance objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, first nations are managing 85% of the 
program budget of Department of Indian and Northern Affairs 
directly. 
The department is responsible for the nature, type and 
enforcement of funding mechanisms.  It is therefore responsible 
for demonstrating to parliamentarians and to the aboriginal 
peoples who receive the funding that the most appropriate 
funding mechanisms have been used.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois understands that self-government consists in 
giving aboriginal peoples authority for managing their own 
affairs, and making them accountable accordingly.  We have 
absolutely no interest in covering up aboriginal mismanagement, 
but first nations must be given the opportunity and the means to 
attain a reasonable level of effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also aware of the existing shortcomings in 
accountability. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the solution to these 
problems lies not in requiring separate accountability for 
aboriginal communities, as the Canadian Alliance called for at 
the very beginning of the debate, but in establishing a better 
link between the degree of flexibility necessary in funding 
mechanisms and the desire and ability of aboriginal peoples to 
assume responsibility for government funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing is that the federal government implement 
all the recommendations made by the Auditor General of Canada; 
that it improve the management and follow up of financial 
transfers, and that it develop guidelines for the management of 
these programs in consultation with aboriginal peoples. Finally, 
we suggest that the government and the various first nations in 
Canada to give serious thought to the creation of a position of 
auditor general for first nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to stand today and join the debate on this opposition day 
motion dealing with the transfer of funds and the fiscal 
relationship between the federal government and aboriginal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I cringe when the Canadian Alliance Party raises 
aboriginal affairs issues.  I am always kind of apprehensive and 
nervous as to what the real motivation is and why it would choose 
this particular issue for their opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My apprehension is well founded when we look at the history of 
some of the positions taken by that party on aboriginal affairs 
and aboriginal issues.  The first that comes to mind, of course, 
is the ratification of the historic Nisga'a treaty.  I should 
probably thank the Alliance for all the stubborn obstinacy that 
it showed during the ratification of the Nisga'a treaty because 
it gave me the satisfaction of one of the most gratifying moments 
that I have had in the House of Commons, and that was being able 
to stand up 473 times on behalf of aboriginal people, on behalf 
of self-government, and on behalf of the emancipation of 
aboriginal people.  I found that personally very gratifying .  I 
still have the T-shirt that says “Nisga'a 473:  Reform Party 
0”.  I also find it very satisfying when I wear that T-shirt to 
the gym. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My apprehension is well founded when we look at some of the 
comments of former aboriginal affairs critics in the Reform Party 
and Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think our NDP colleague is way off the mark here and he 
should get on the topic to help native people instead of this 
rant that he is into.  He is becoming like a member of the 
opposition in terms of his tactics at this point.  Could we get 
him back on topic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The point is well taken 
and we also anticipate that at some point the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre will tie up everything to the subject at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is certainly my 
intention.  I have a 20 minute speech and I would like to set the 
basis for the tone and content of my remarks by giving a bit of 
recent history as to why I am apprehensive about this particular 
motion and the motivation of the Canadian Alliance in introducing 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of record.  It is a matter of <I>Hansard</I>, when 
we look back at the remarks of previous aboriginal affairs 
critics in the Reform Party, like Mr. Herb Grubel, former adviser 
to fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet and currently a member of 
the board of directors of the Fraser Institute.  In his comments, 
Herb Grubel likened living on an aboriginal reserve to living on 
a south sea island and being supported by a rich uncle.  That 
indicates a real sensitivity to the issues facing the aboriginal 
people.  That is why, frankly, I would argue that the Alliance 
Party does not have any credibility when it speaks on aboriginal 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes further.  The person who sat on the cross country 
advisory committee on aboriginal issues when the Reform Party 
took a touring task force around the country was Mel Smith, the 
author of <I>Our Home or Native Land</I>, the famous book that is 
a sort of diatribe against any kind of self-government or land 
claim settlements.  In fact, it called for the reversal of land 
claim issues settled across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Flanagan, associated for a long time with the Reform Party 
as a senior advisor, wrote a well known piece called “Why Don't 
Indians Drive Taxis?”  His argument was that all other new 
Canadians who come here and start at the bottom of the economic 
totem pole start by driving taxies so why do Indians not drive 
taxis?  The basic premise of his argument was that they expect 
handouts.  He said that they would rather have handouts than 
drive taxis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really shows a sensitivity to the economic development issues 
that aboriginal people face when senior people in the Reform 
Party talk about aboriginal issues in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most compelling example I can give is Greg Hollingsworth, 
former Reform Party staffer here in Ottawa on the Hill.  I 
frankly do not think this was how it transpired, but they say 
that he quit his job to go and set up BC F.I.R.E. in British 
Columbia. BC F.I.R.E. is the anti-Indian movement in British 
Columbia.  It is called Foundation for Individual Rights and 
Equality.  It is a horrible, hateful group of people who are 
dedicated solely to keeping aboriginal issues and people down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that I do not believe frankly that Greg Hollingsworth 
quit his job, I think he was sent there by the Reform Party.  I 
will go further than that.  I think the Canadian Alliance— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think you have it within your power to ask the member 
to get to the point of his question.  Is he concerned about 
native people and the motion before us or does he want to go on 
to something irrelevant from past history?   Does he have a 
concern for native people?  I think he would want to circumscribe 
his speech today to that issue, to help native— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Your point is well 
taken.  The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre will certainly make a 
big effort to tie what he has just said to the motion we are 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker.  I would be 
happy to limit my remarks to the motion we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started out by saying that I believe, and I do not think it is 
an exaggeration to say, that the Canadian Alliance is the 
legislative wing, the political voice, of the anti-Indian 
movement in Canada.  That is why I question its motivation and 
its true intentions every time it raises aboriginal issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member may well castigate groups or political parties as 
a whole but when he attacks me personally, as he just did in 
terms of where we stand with respect to natives and helping first 
nations people, I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to bring the member 
to order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Your point has been 
heard.  I would ask the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre to ease 
up on the tone of his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I would be happy 
to do that.  In the interest of keeping an elevated standard of 
debate in the House, I will take those remarks to hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we have noted is that the Canadian Alliance approach 
to aboriginal issues, in recent months at least, has been to 
seize on isolated incidents of misuse of funds or mismanagement 
of funds.  The Alliance comments over and over again on isolated 
incidents across the country and then tries to thread them 
together into an overall theme that there is gross mismanagement 
of funds in virtually all aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message, whether deliberate or not, that is getting 
out to the public.  The Canadian Alliance says that aboriginal 
communities are corrupt, ergo they do not deserve self-government 
and we should not proceed any further with land claim 
settlements.  That is the theme that comes across to the Canadian 
people, whether real or perceived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the same thing could be said about my comments because I 
am threading together isolated incidents of Alliance Party 
members saying horrible, hateful things.  I have come to a broad 
conclusion that it is in fact party policy, not just isolated 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the member for Athabasca said that of course we 
defeated them, and that just because we did not kill them in 
Indian wars does not mean they are not a vanquished people. 
Otherwise, he asked, why would they accept being driven into 
those godforsaken little remote reserves?  That was the attitude 
of the member for Athabasca who is still sitting in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here longer than the hon. member for Provencher and 
I have heard some horrifying attitudes expressed toward 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance launched an out and out campaign to 
aggressively stop what I believe is the most historic treaty of 
our time, the Nisga'a land claim treaty, which was ratified in 
the House of Commons.  It was a very proud moment for all of us. 
The Alliance launched an out and out campaign to stop and to 
block that group of people from taking their first courageous 
steps toward independence and self-government.  It is opposed to 
aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is in favour of the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. 
The Canadian Alliance Party is not.  That is why I think I am 
justified in questioning the motivation of that group when it 
raises aboriginal affairs issues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to speak to the motion.  It is a lot more 
difficult to speak to the motion now that it is so watered down 
and innocuous.  If the Canadian Alliance is harbouring some sort 
of resentment about land claims and self-government, it should at 
least have the guts to put forward a motion that actually says 
that so we can have an honest debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a watered down motion that calls for the status quo. 
The reason the Alliance got the Liberal Party to agree to vote in 
favour of the motion is that it is easy for the Liberals.  They 
are already doing that.  The motion put forward originally by the 
Alliance insinuated that there was no auditing or accountability 
in aboriginal communities and that therefore we needed to impose 
a requirement for auditing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, the Indian Act and the Indian Bands Revenue 
Moneys Regulation already calls for that.  Articles 8.(1), 8.(2) 
and 8.(2)(a) state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8.(1) Every Band shall engage an auditor to audit its account and 
to render an annual report in respect thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) A copy of the annual auditor's report shall, within 7 days 
of its completion, 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) be posted in conspicuous places on the Band Reserve for the 
examination of all members of the Band; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not a requirement to have an independent audit and to 
publish the findings of the audit, I do not know what is. 
Frankly, all the Alliance is calling for is what we already 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to one thing in the remarks of the Canadian Alliance 
member in introducing the motion.  I will need to check the 
<I>Hansard</I> for the actual words, but he implied that the 
Alliance has the support of the grand chief of the Assembly of 
First Nations for the motion.  I found that very hard to believe, 
given the offensive stance toward aboriginal issues that the 
Canadian Alliance has demonstrated since it has been in 
parliament.  I doubt it very much that the grand chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations would endorse a motion put forward by 
that party because, frankly, that individual, more than anyone, 
would have serious reservations about the motivation of that 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I called the national grand chief of the Assembly of First 
Nations, Matthew Coon Come.  His executive assistant just got 
back to me five minutes ago.  Not only did the Assembly of First 
Nations never endorse the motion, it was never contacted about 
the motion.  It was never called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party has started this whole debate with 
dishonesty.  That also leads me to believe that there is more 
here than meets the eye.  The real motivation of the Alliance 
Party is to do everything it can to foster animosity toward the 
self-government process because it personally is opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no party in the country that has bastardized the word 
equal more than the Alliance Party.  I am very proud that just 
last week an aboriginal judge in the province of Manitoba, Murray 
Sinclair, moved up to the Court of Queen's Bench.  Murray 
Sinclair, in the aboriginal justice inquiry, deals with this very 
issue.  He says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the application of uniform standards, common rules and 
treatment of people who are not the same constitutes a form of 
discrimination.  It means that in treating unlike people alike, 
adverse consequences, hardships or injustice may result. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we cannot treat all people equally if in fact 
they are unequal at the beginning.  After we have met the basic 
needs of people and established a common denominator, then rules 
can be applied equally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very wise statement and I am proud to be able to raise 
it in the House of Commons today.  Equal rights for all is in 
fact unfair when dealing with people who are held back in a 
systemic way, as is the case with many aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Manitoba, where we have perhaps more firsthand and 
recent knowledge in trying to renew the relationship with 
aboriginal people than do many of the members here from other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not proud to say it, but my province was the home of J.J. 
Harper.  If that name has not been raised in the House of Commons 
before it certainly should have.  If it had been me walking home 
late one night instead of J.J. Harper, I might have been pulled 
over by the police and asked questions.  However I probably would 
not have died that night.  J.J. Harper did.  He was killed.  That 
was one of the incidents that spurred the aboriginal justice 
inquiry, which was probably the most comprehensive review of the 
hugely disproportionate representation of aboriginal people in 
Canada's criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My province was also home to Helen Betty Osborne, a 16 year old 
girl in The Pas, Manitoba who was killed.  I can assure hon. 
members that if it had been my 16 year old daughter walking home 
that night kid, she probably would not have been seen as a target 
by four redneck hillbillies who would sexually assault and murder 
her.  After the murder of Helen Betty Osborne, the whole town 
took part in a 16 year conspiracy of silence to shield the 
actions of those people.  We in Manitoba have firsthand knowledge 
and very real examples from which to draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that came up during the aboriginal justice 
inquiry was the hugely disproportionate representation of 
aboriginal people in our prisons, never mind the ones caught up 
in the criminal justice system.  It came to light that, at 
periods of time during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s in two women's 
prisons in Canada, the percentage of the population that was 
aboriginal was 100%.  That was all of them.  It was as if we were 
trying to lock up a generation of young aboriginal people as some 
supposed fix to the terrible situation they were in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is galling for me to watch a group of people who are not as 
far evolved in their thinking about the new relationship that is 
necessary with aboriginal people.  It is frustrating to see a 
group of people from provinces not far from mine who are so 
politically naive when it comes to the new relationship that is 
necessary with aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a poem spray-painted on a wall near my office in 
downtown Winnipeg for many years.  It has now been erased.  A 
street poet wrote it and one of the lines in it said “Racism is 
ignorance masturbating”.  It was the sort of thing that would 
catch one's attention.  However, when we think about it, racism 
is, by its very nature, born out of ignorance.  As soon as people 
learn more about other cultures they are no longer threatened by 
them and they are less racist.  We see that gradual maturing 
process happening in every neighbourhood and community across the 
country.  The more we know about other people, the more we 
realize that they love their children as much as we love ours and 
that we have more in common than we do that is separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Masturbating is, by its very nature, a solitary act.  It is not 
very gratifying and it certainly is not productive in any way, 
shape or form.  Neither is racism.  Racism feeds on itself and it 
does not benefit anyone.  That comes from the very solitary 
nature of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Alliance members do not consult and they do not learn 
from other people.  They do not phone the Assembly of First 
Nations when they say they do.  We know that much as evidenced 
today.  There is a terrible dishonesty in their approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already pointed out that the motion we are dealing with 
today is really the status quo, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to point out some of my reservations about 
following the Canadian Alliance's lead on anything to do with any 
aboriginal issue ever, because I know who its members are.  I 
have been here long enough to hear their spokespeople and to 
understand what really drives and motivates them.  I will say 
again, I believe the Canadian Alliance is the legislative arm of 
the anti-Indian movement in Canada.  I have never seen anything 
to dissuade me or move me off that opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member's comments.  I believe 
governance and accountability are apple pie issues.  We need 
transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we go under the surface, that is the root of what 
is not being said here today.  It is about self-government, about 
respecting cultures and about having existing aboriginal rights 
under section 35 of the Constitution Act.  That is something that 
this side of the House believes in dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the NDP also has similar values and goals for the 
aboriginal nations in Canada.  I would like to explore those 
values and goals with the member.  Does he believe that the 
members of the official opposition have the same goals of 
strengthening and renewing the partnerships with Canada's 
aboriginal peoples?  Do they want to help strengthen aboriginal 
governance?  Do they it want to develop newer fiscal 
relationships and build strong communities, peoples and 
economies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back to my time as chair of the aboriginal committee in 
the last parliament, I particularly remember the time when we 
dealt with the Nisga'a treaty.  During the final vote in 
committee there were no dissenting votes.  The bill was passed by 
all parties, including the opposition.  When the bill came back 
to the House, the official opposition put forward 467 or so 
amendments.  That is why I find this motion to be innocuous.  It 
is different from what is underlying that same position.  I would 
like the member's comments on this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the NDP caucus, I believe, 
is very much in favour of renewing the fiscal relationship with 
aboriginal communities.  The hon. member was alluding to 
legislation we anticipate coming down the pike fairly soon that 
will revisit the fiscal relationship between the federal 
government and aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that what really needs to be done, instead of just 
lobbing potshots at isolated incidents of mismanagement, is to 
develop the administrative capacity of first nations communities 
so that accountability can become as mainstream in their 
administration of offices as it is elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that 95% of all audits done on aboriginal 
communities come up squeaky clean.  I do not know if the current 
government can make a claim like that with all its programs. 
Certainly the business community is not held to that high a 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense, we are watching the Canadian Alliance take these 
isolated incidents and trying to thread them together into an 
overall case that all aboriginal communities are poorly run or 
mismanaged in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is heartening, which I learned about recently, is 
that the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada and 
the Assembly of First Nations have started a national round table 
and a mentoring program to give special national certification to 
aboriginal auditors so that within the communities there will be 
well trained aboriginal people to ensure that the books are kept 
to acceptable best practices of accounting.

a question and to make a comment on what he said.  He has 
impugned my integrity in the House by attributing comments to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he goes back and reads <I>Hansard</I> he will realize that his 
statement is completely inaccurate.  I never said that I had 
phoned Matthew Coon Come or that I ever had his support for the 
motion.  He is reading something into what I said. 
I think it is despicable of him to bring that kind of thing to 
the debate when there are such serious problems regarding 
aboriginal people across the country.  He is still engaged in the 
old line debate on partisan politics:  who is doing what and who 
is getting political points.  I have no interest in that.

clear that something was wrong. The member for Churchill asked 
that question but got an answer that was not very satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main thrust of her question was very different from 
the potshots thrown by members of the Canadian Alliance.  She 
asked if it was true that the money could have been used to 
benefit so many more people.  Rather than spending $36 million on 
one treatment centre, which is a lot of money, a general hospital 
could have been built.  The government could have helped a lot of 
people who are suffering the consequences of chronic long term 
poverty, one of which is substance abuse, which was what the 
Fontaine Centre was dedicated to addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member does not know, because I do not believe he 
is well briefed on aboriginal affairs issues, is that the 
Assembly of First Nations' fiscal relations secretariat is taking 
many of the steps that his party is advocating, and has been 
since 1996.  I do not think members opposite even read their own 
briefing notes.  All they are trying to do is whip up some kind 
of an anti-Indian hysteria in the country so that they can join 
the BC F.I.R.E. movement and the anti-Indian movement to stop 
land claims and stop treaty processes.

Lib.):</B>  I must say, Mr. Speaker, that I felt the speech by the 
member for Winnipeg Centre was one of the more ugly speeches that 
I have heard in my time here.  I did not enjoy the slinging of 
tar that went on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that I know many members of the 
Canadian Alliance, the former Reform Party, and while I may 
disagree very vehemently with them on some issues, including 
aboriginal issues, every one of them, as far as I know, have 
acted and argued with the best motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason I am standing is that the member for Winnipeg 
Centre attacked a member who is not in the House, Herb Grubel, 
who was a member of the Reform Party.  He was one of the finest 
MPs in the House, even though he sat in the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have to say is that if we throw tar in a small room, it 
is bound to splash back on ourselves.  I do not think the member 
for Winnipeg Centre will gain many points at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not feel the need to 
apologize for my remarks.  I found that some of the remarks made 
in <I>Hansard</I> by Herb Grubel, a former member of parliament 
whose name we can use because he no longer sits here, were 
offensive.  I could not believe people harboured those kinds of 
attitudes toward aboriginal people, especially a person 
representing a major Canadian political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not apologize for raising that in the House.  I think it 
helped to set the base tone of the debate.  All of us, even if we 
reluctantly hold our nose and vote in favour of the motion, being 
the innocuous thing that it is, are very suspect about the 
motivation of the Canadian Alliance every time it raises 
aboriginal issues.

period so I may take a little less than my 10 minutes for my 
questions and comments and then turn it over to the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that this file originally was held by a very 
capable colleague of mine from the South Shore.  It has been 
passed to me and I will speak to it with pleasure. 
I feel very strongly that this is an issue that must be a 
precedence of not only the government but certainly the 
opposition with respect to our first nations and the issues that 
face them today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting up between the member for Winnipeg Centre and the 
Alliance Party, I will act as a bit of a mediator, which is 
common for the Progressive Conservative Party.  In fact we are 
attempting to be the mediator of all opposition parties in 
concert against the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some harsh words have been said by the NDP to the 
Alliance.  It is no secret that hypocrisy sometimes sits on the 
Alliance benches.  Obviously the member for the NDP felt it was 
necessary to bring those issues forward.  However, I sincerely 
believe that it is best to speak to the motion and the issue put 
forward today and hopefully we can resolve some of the very 
serious problems that face our first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the representative for Brandon—Souris, I have the pleasure 
of having two reserves in my constituency and have had the 
opportunity to work with those bands in the past.  I will be 
making some comments with respect to both of them over the course 
of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I certainly take some exception to the comments made by 
the government House leader when he spoke to the motion.  I got 
the impression that everything was just hunky-dory, that there 
were no problems and no issues.  He said that 98% of the audits 
have been in place and put forward, and that only 4% of the 
reserves now in existence have third party management systems. 
Third party management is the last resort of any type of 
management within first nations.  Having 4% under third party 
management is quite excessive.  This issue has to be addressed by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that not everything is fine on first nations 
reserves.  There is a very large unemployment ratio compared to 
the rest of society.  We recognize that there is a housing 
crisis, that there are social ills and social problems and that 
there are problems with the infrastructure programs that have 
been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader would have us think that the issue today is not 
about accountability and audit, and that we should not be dealing 
with social issues.  That is not true. Quite frankly, financial 
administration and financial management, if properly put in place 
on first nations reserves, would allow the reserves to have less 
unemployment, more housing, better social services provided to 
them through the band offices and infrastructure programs put in 
place that would allow for water treatment and sewers to be put 
into place, along with recreation facilities.  It is all one ball 
of wax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. House leader cannot stand up and say that the motion is 
insignificant when dealing with those other social concerns 
because it is not.  They are all put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is quite simple.  It calls for accountability.  It 
wants the assurance that audits will be put forward so the bands 
will be responsible for the expenditures of capital, public 
funds, going into a reserve.  I could not agree more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre said that there were a few 
examples of this and that we should use those examples because 
the majority do not happen.  That is not true.  Those examples 
happen more and more often, but I will let my hon. colleague from 
Nova Scotia speak to a couple of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that in my own constituency there are 
substantially well managed reserves.  Sioux Valley is absolutely 
phenomenal.  The administration, the management, the chief and 
the council are there for the right reasons.  They are there for 
all members of the band.  The Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development just signed an historic treaty with that 
reserve which put forward the parameters for self-government. 
That is one positive example of what all first nations should be 
trying to attain. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other is a negative example.  As one member suggested, 
certain reserves do not have the financial wherewithal and 
viability to pay their bills.  That is the case with one of the 
reserves in my constituency where tradespeople have gone in to do 
work and have not been paid and will not do further work there. 
That affects the whole reserve, the whole population of that 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those examples are out there.  What the motion is simply saying 
is be accountable.  We must ensure the chief, the council and the 
administration of a reserve and band office are accountable to 
the people and to Canada.  If it is public money, I do not think 
anyone here would disagree that it should be transparent.  They 
should be accountable to the public purse from which they receive 
their funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say on behalf of the PC Party that we will be supporting the 
motion as it has been put forward.  We support the measures to 
improve accountability and transparency for first nations.  The 
measures should help improve the self-reliance and 
self-dependence of first nations if their financial management is 
controlled, regulated and available to band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that accountability to band members falls to the 
chief and to the elected band council.  Such accountability is 
extremely important in order to have good management in the band 
itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to participate in the debate.  I did not 
have a lot to do with aboriginals or native issues until I was 
elected a member of parliament and then I became very much 
involved with them.  It has been one of the more interesting and 
fruitful aspects of my political career since 1988, off and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question about the motion.  It talks about taxpayer 
dollars having to be accountable.  People who receive taxpayer 
dollars, whether natives or non-natives, owe it to taxpayers to 
provide information on where the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I was involved with a non-native organization that took 
over a wharf in a placed called Digby, Nova Scotia.  It got a 
cheque of over $3 million from the federal Department of 
Transport.  When we asked the organization where the taxpayer 
dollars went, the reply was that they were not taxpayer dollars 
once it got the cheque.  I certainly disagree with the philosophy 
and approach taken by Maritime Harbours Society in Digby.  That 
is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an open process.  We need transparency when it comes to 
taxpayer dollars.  After all, a lot of aboriginals and natives 
are taxpayers and they want accountability too.  A lot of the 
questions raised in this great debate have come from aboriginals 
who see from within what the problems are in a particular band or 
group.  They are perhaps in the best position to know when there 
is a problem and to blow the whistle.  In some cases they have 
done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris mentioned earlier that I 
might bring up an issue in Nova Scotia.  Recently the Eskasoni 
first nation was questioned when it was revealed that the chief 
collected more than $400,000 tax free and got in excess of 
$293,000 in honorariums, a great big Christmas bonus, $67,000 in 
travel expenses, $12,000 for automobile reimbursement and so on. 
Meanwhile people on the reserve go without housing and even food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natives in that case brought it to the attention of the 
government.  The government stepped in appropriately, demanded 
accountability and changed the rules at Eskasoni.  It is now 
trying to establish a new plan for the future, a new business 
plan for the operation of the whole reserve.  It will involve 
accountability for government dollars, as it should have done in 
the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, my first experience with native issues 
was with the Millbrook band in my riding.  One of the first 
things I did as a member of parliament in 1988 was visit with the 
chief.  He and I went from house to house all through the 
community.  People needed a great deal of help and were obviously 
not getting it.  The housing situation was the most obvious 
shortcoming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Lawrence Paul was the chief in 1988 and, I believe, is 
still the chief.  I believe he has been elected 11 times in a 
row.  He has taken great steps to improve the lifestyle and 
living standard of members of his band.  Perhaps the most 
important thing he did was make a deal with the province of Nova 
Scotia on gaming arrangements.  He was able to set up a small 
gaming facility on his reserve with access to the non-native 
community.  It has been very successful.  He has raised some 
money and has given the money back to his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Paul has been very aggressive in establishing a shopping 
centre.  The reserve is split by the Trans-Canada Highway, so he 
has great exposure to the Trans-Canada Highway between Truro and 
Halifax.  He has established a power centre.  Three or four first 
class businesses have been established to serve the native and 
non-native communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue he has been very aggressive in is the native 
fishery.  He has established the Millbrook fishery and is 
training his members to become fishermen.  He is helping them to 
establish facilities at wharves and to have the proper boats and 
equipment, and especially the proper training, to operate safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, it is a success story.  It is not all success, but 
very seldom is any operation perfect.  It probably is not 
perfect, but I have seen a great difference in the standard of 
living of the people of Millbrook Band, and I take my hat off to 
Lawrence Paul.  He ruffles feathers quite often.  He is very 
outspoken but has done a good job for his people.  I do not know 
what more one could ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of those efforts, the operations turn back cash to 
every member of the band every year.  Every band member receives 
a cash rebate from the resources of the successful businesses 
that have started up.  In addition, the band has established an 
education fund and a health care fund for every person in the 
band.  That has gone a long way to alleviate the problems of the 
band and it bodes well for the future.  It gets better and 
better, and Chief Paul is more successful and aggressive as he 
goes.  I think it will be a wonderful change for the members of 
the Millbrook Band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  We obviously and certainly support 
accountability for every cent of government money.  We think that 
when taxpayer dollars go into a project, they should be 
accountable and the benefits should go to all the people in a 
specific band, not just a small group. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend my hon. colleague who just spoke in favour of 
the motion.  There is a very real need on the part of government, 
Indian bands and all people in Canada to recognize that one of 
the most important things to develop in parliamentarians and in 
people governing at the municipal or band council levels is 
integrity, honesty, truth, openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member just illustrated exactly how that could work. 
He made reference to the Millbrook Band, and I commend him for 
doing so.  I wonder whether he could expand on his concerns about 
the lack of transparency and integrity on the part of certain 
people in not allowing their books to be opened.  There seems to 
be an assumption that if there are public funds as well as 
private funds then a band council is only responsible for the 
public funds.  It seems to me that a band council that manages 
private funds should be accountable for those as well, although 
perhaps in a different way.  I wonder if he would comment on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he raises a good point. 
Where there is a mixture of public funds and private funds, it is 
often hard to say which dollar comes from which source.  In that 
regard, I believe that if there is any linkage at all to federal 
or provincial government dollars they should be accountable. 
There is no question about that.  The whole purpose of this 
exercise is that government dollars be accounted for.  If there 
is any linkage at all to them, or any possibility that we are 
talking about federal dollars as opposed to money generated from 
the private sector, then they should be accountable.

Speaker, I likewise thank the member for supporting the motion 
that is on the floor today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member mind sharing a little with regard to some of 
the reserves in his own riding?  One point mentioned by the 
government was its concern about improving the quality of life of 
people on the reserves.  I want to believe that is something that 
will come out of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having travelled across the country, been into many reserves and 
seen the deplorable conditions that exist, I wonder how it ever 
got to be that way.  When we have responsible government, how 
could it possibly happen?  In 1999 Canada was named the number 
one country in which to live.  Of course there was an addendum 
stating that if the reserves were included Canada would be number 
38.  That is not a mark of which to be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In travelling in my riding and visiting different reserves in 
Alberta I see terrible, deplorable conditions and little effort. 
I also notice that in New Brunswick there is one nation, the Big 
Cove first nation, with 2,200 people who are $8 million in debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member mind talking about the conditions as he sees 
them when he tours his reserves?  Does he see what I see? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the member because 
he has always taken a very sincere interest in native issues.  He 
talks about quality of life.  In the case of the band I mentioned 
in Nova Scotia, I just added it up roughly, the chief in a very 
short period of time awarded himself $828,000 while there are 
people in the band without houses and without food on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier the Millbrook band which is a different 
story.  I started to visit the Millbrook band in 1988 and have 
seen a dramatic change in the lifestyle and self-esteem of 
natives in that band.  It is because the chief and council have 
generated businesses for them in which to work.  They now have 
self-satisfaction.  There is quite a change there.  All the 
problems are not resolved but they have gone a long way to 
resolving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former prime minister once said to us, in about 1990, that 
members could go home and spend the whole weekend trying to think 
of worse ways to treat natives and we could not come up with 
anything worse than what we have already done to them.  I have 
always agreed with him.  I have never forgotten his words, and I 
agree with those words.

Quebec, which appeared under the heading “A salary for mothers: 
why not?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of her letter to the Government of Quebec read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women's situation would be greatly improved by making it 
possible to have a choice between working outside the home and 
parenting one's children at home, at least for the first three 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have “evolved” from housewives, who had no choice about their 
situation, to working women, who also have no choice, even when 
their children are at the age when they most need  their 
mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A salary for stay-at-home parents?  Most emphatically yes, at 
least for the child's first three years of life.  Is the 
Department of the Family in favour of families, or is it not? 
Let it learn more about what is being done in Germany, and 
implement it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be beneficial to couples and to 
families, and real values would win out, at least to some 
extent, over materialism. 
</UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring the 
attention of the immigration minister the plight of one of my 
constituents.  Mr. Howard Hall came to Canada from England in 
1949 with his mother when he was three months old.  She married a 
Canadian in 1950, who in turn formally adopted Howard as his son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, Mr. Hall has lived in Canada his entire life, 51 
years.  He attended and graduated from school in Kamloops and has 
a SIN number and a pension booklet.  However, in 1989 an 
immigration inquiry ruled Mr. Hall was not a citizen and sent him 
back to England.  He won an appeal but was still given a 
departure order and told to leave Canada for a year. 
From England he filed for Canadian citizenship and was denied.

known, on a visitor's visa.  He stayed.  Mr. Hall is now facing 
his 10th immigration hearing in his epic struggle to stay in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This true story might make a great movie, but for Howard Hall it 
is his real life.  Will the minister do the honourable thing, 
look into this matter and give Howard Hall a happy ending to this 
horrible saga?

all human beings, the question of race discrimination is put to 
everyone.  We must all work together to make our society fairer

mutual help and solidarity with cultural communities.

United States.  This resulted in a loss of sales of over $50 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fighting to keep the access markets open to the 
United States, the federal government's response is only a measly 
$14 million in compensation, causing many producers to question 
whether or not they will plant this spring.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, on May 14, 1991, as Leader of the

<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

own words.  He has consistently called for a weak dollar.  In 
1978, when he was finance minister and the dollar started 
downward, he said that the dollar had to float downward.  In 1984 
he said that he could live personally with a weaker dollar.  In 
1990 he said that Canadians should accept a weaker dollar.  The 
Prime Minister did say those things.  He has what he wanted.  The 
dollar has fallen by 12 cents since he became Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister think that this weak 63 cent dollar is

prosperity and productivity as well as the cause of it.

hand waving and get the troops all rising and cheering, but will 
the Prime Minister admit that this 23 year pursuit of a low

millions of Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if we take a look at what is happening to other

gains taxes are lower than the United States.  Our corporate 
taxes are going to be lower than the United States.  We have just 
brought in the largest income tax cuts in Canadian history, 
substantially greater than the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about debt.  The fact is that over the 
course of the last four years we will have paid down $28 billion

ratio of any G-7 country.  Those are the facts.

has been pried open again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

decision of the chairman of the transport committee which I 
believe contravenes the rules of the House.  I am bringing this 
matter 
to the House instead of to the committee because, as Speaker 
Parent ruled on June 20, 1994, and again on November 7, 1996: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters 
of their own proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which 
go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees receive their authority from the House.  In cases 
where the standing orders do not specifically outline a rule for 
committees, committees are guided by the provision of Standing 
Order 116, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a standing, special or legislative committee, the Standing 
Orders shall apply so far as may be applicable— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule of the House that applies to the standing committees 
actually stems from section 49 of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
Section 49 provides that questions arising in the House of 
Commons shall be decided by the majority of votes.  This is the 
rule that was breached by the chairman of the standing committee 
for transport.  The majority instructed the chair to carry out 
its wishes and the chair ignored that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, February 27, 2001, the Standing Committee on 
Transport and Government Operations was convened to establish the 
future work agenda of the committee.  On a point of order I 
interjected that it was unclear who had scheduled a briefing on 
Bill S-2 for the following Thursday when the purpose of the 
meeting was to determine the future work of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair acknowledged that he alone had asked the clerk of the 
committee to put together an agenda based on the anticipated work 
of the committee for discussion by the members.  During the 
ensuing debate, numerous committee members indicated that they 
were new to the committee and were not prepared to discuss the 
future schedule until they had received briefings from each of 
the ministries.  There was unanimous agreement that the committee 
would adjourn and return to hear respective briefings only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair declared the meeting adjourned, at which time an 
interjection was made by the parliamentary secretary to the 
transport minister as to the status of Bill S-2.  The chair 
advised the parliamentary secretary that he understood that the 
government officials would provide whatever information he 
required and reiterated that the meeting was adjourned, whereupon 
the parliamentary secretary expressed his concern again that Bill 
S-2 might be forgotten in the request for briefings and the chair 
advised that the bill would be scheduled for March 20.  This was 
done without the agreement of the committee, and after two 
assertions that the committee was indeed adjourned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final briefing and return to the future work discussion was 
scheduled for March 15, 2001.  On March 14, we received notice 
that the last ministry, treasury board, could not appear and was 
rescheduled to appear March 22, and that the meeting scheduled 
for March 15 was cancelled unilaterally by the chairman based on 
his concern that there would not be enough members in attendance 
for a quorum.

the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the disregard for committee protocol as 
it relates to the rescheduling, cancellation, agenda and

</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport 
and Government Operations did not consult with members prior to 
cancelling the March 15 meeting and, likewise, did not have 
majority support to reschedule the March 20 meeting to hear

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was not aware that this question would be raised this 
afternoon, but I think the Chair should be aware that the 
numerous matters which the member has raised are on the agenda of 
the committee for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He began by speaking about the powers of committees and, in 
fact, their ability to manage their own affairs consistent with 
the standing orders, with the exception that in a standing 
committee the standing orders shall apply only so far as may be 
applicable, except the standing orders as to the election of a 
Speaker, seconding of motions, limiting the number of times of 
speaking and the length of speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure why this issue was brought before you 
today, because the hon. member has five motions before the 
committee to be dealt with tomorrow when the committee meets at 
its regular time of 11 o'clock, which deal with precisely the 
issues he has raised in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are two motions from the hon. member for 
Skeena having to do with the procedures and the way of conducting 
committee business, which again were put before the committee 
with proper notice and will be dealt with by the committee 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the Chair should consider that the 
committee be allowed to deal with these matters. which have been 
placed on its agenda and which are before it tomorrow, and that 
if the member is still dissatisfied, he might consider raising 
this issue again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River has clearly been reading Marleau and 
Montpetit, which is very commendable.  I know that he and the 
other members of the transport committee will want their copies 
handy tomorrow at the meeting to which the hon. chief government 
whip refers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a procedural matter of some import that has to 
be dealt with by the transport committee and, with great respect 
to the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River, I do not think 
it is one that the Chair should get involved in at this stage, 
and probably not ever.  Committees are masters of their own 
proceedings.  I know the hon. member has read that line in 
Marleau and Montpetit as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is very reluctant to involve itself in the affairs of 
committees unless something quite extraordinary happens.  I must 
say that on all the evidence I have heard here today—I call it 
evidence—there does not seem to be anything that is terribly out 
of the ordinary and I know that the hon. member will want to 
raise these issues in the committee tomorrow.  I encourage him to 
do so at the very next meeting and we will see what transpires 
there. However, at this point I think it would be premature for 
the Speaker to become involved in this matter and accordingly I 
decline to do so.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the question 
of privilege raised by the hon. member for Provencher on March 
14, 2001, regarding a briefing the Department of Justice held on 
a bill on notice that had not yet been introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has now received first reading as Bill C-15, an act to 
amend the criminal code and to amend other acts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. government House leader, the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville, and the hon. opposition House leader for their 
interventions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first summarize the events that led up to this question 
of privilege being raised.  From the interventions of members it 
appears that the Department of Justice sent out a media advisory 
notifying recipients that there would be a technical briefing 
given by justice officials at 11.45 a.m. on Wednesday, March 14, 
with regard to the omnibus bill, now Bill C-15, that was to be 
introduced in the House by the hon. Minister of Justice that 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member for Provencher, members of 
parliament and their staff were denied access to the briefing. 
The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville added that while his 
assistant was denied access to the briefing, the assistant of a 
government member was granted entry.  In any event, there is no 
disputing that the invitation to this so-called technical 
briefing went out as a media advisory and was designed for 
members of the media.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Provencher indicated that following the 
briefing media representatives began phoning his office and 
asking for his reaction to the bill, a situation he found 
embarrassing, not only for himself and other members of the 
opposition, but also for the House of Commons as a whole since 
they had not seen the bill and were not privy to its contents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. government House leader confirmed that opposition 
critics were given a courtesy copy of Bill C-15 about an hour and 
a quarter before the bill's introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister explained that during the briefing, the media had 
not received actual copies of the bill or any other 
documentation.  He went on to indicate that the briefing itself 
was under embargo until the bill was introduced, a fact 
confirmed by the copy of the original media advisory that the 
Chair has obtained. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Provencher, as well as the other opposition 
members who participated in the discussion, argued that by not 
providing information to members of parliament and by refusing to 
allow members to participate in a briefing where the media were 
present, the government, and in particular the Department of 
Justice, showed contempt for the House of Commons and its 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see it, there are two issues here: the matter of the 
embargoed briefing to the media and the issue of members' access 
to information required to fulfil their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the use of media embargoes, as well as the use 
of lock-ups, have long played a role in the way parliamentary 
business is conducted.  For example, it has been our practice to 
permit briefings in lock-ups prior to the tabling of reports by 
the auditor general.  Similarly, and perhaps more on point, is 
the lock-up held on the day of a budget presentation.  Two 
features of these lock-ups are that members are invited to be 
present and members of the media are detained until the event in 
question has occurred; that is the auditor general's report 
tabled or the budget speech begun.  These are the features one 
might argue that have made these lock-ups so successful and so 
useful to the conduct of parliamentary business. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must, however, be remembered that when the different 
arrangements have been made for early briefings, previous 
Speakers have consistently held that it is not a breach of 
privilege to exclude members from lock-ups.  I refer the House, 
for example, to the ruling of Speaker Jerome, in <I>Debates</I>, 
November 27, 1978, p. 1518-9, and the ruling of Speaker Sauvé, 
in <I>Debates</I>, February 25, 1981, p. 7670. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House recognizes that when complex or technical documents 
are to be presented in this Chamber, media briefings are highly 
useful.  They ensure that the public receives information that is 
both timely and accurate concerning business before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing legislation, the government may wish to hold 
extensive consultations and such consultations may be held 
entirely at the government's discretion.  However, with respect 
to material to be placed before parliament, the House must take 
precedence.  Once a bill has been placed on notice, whether it 
has been presented in a different form to a different session of 
parliament has no bearing and the bill is considered a new 
matter.  The convention of the confidentiality of bills on notice 
is necessary, not only so that members themselves may be well 
informed, but also because of the pre-eminent rule which the 
House plays and must play in the legislative affairs of the 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the issue of denying to members information that they need 
to do their work has been the key consideration for the Chair in 
reviewing this particular question of privilege.  To deny to 
members information concerning business that is about to come 
before the House, while at the same time providing such 
information to media that will likely be questioning members 
about that business, is a situation that the Chair cannot 
condone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if no documents were given out at the briefing, as the hon. 
government House leader has assured the House, it is undisputed 
that confidential information about the bill was provided.  While 
it may have been the intention to embargo that information as an 
essential safeguard of the rights of this House, the evidence 
would indicate that no effective embargo occurred.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it is clear that information concerning 
legislation, although denied to members, was given to members of 
the media without any effective measures to secure the rights of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concluded that this constitutes a prima facie contempt of 
the House and I invite the hon. member for Provencher to move a 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision certainly does not disappoint me.  You in fact are

want to say that the steps you took were important to stop this 
slide.  Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the matter of the question of privilege raised on March 14, 
2001, by the Member for Provencher regarding the Department of 
Justice briefing the media on Bill C-15, An Act to amend the 
Criminal Code and to amend other Acts, prior to it being tabled 
in the House of Commons and at the exclusion of members of 
parliament, be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I commend you, Mr. Speaker, on your fairness and your 
integrity with respect to your ruling.  I will make a few 
comments before concluding this matter in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years there has been a gradual slide in 
terms of the respect to which parliament is entitled.  This 
ruling by you today does much to ensure that the integrity of the 
House and the process here is continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Liberal majority in the House and on the 
committee to put aside its partisan issues, come to the aid of 
parliament and preserve its dignity, its authority and that of 
its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What you are doing today, Mr. Speaker, gives us an opportunity 
to take meaningful steps to deal with this very contentious and 
difficult issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a few other situations on the 
record which I think may form part of the discussions that we 
will have in committee concerning the prima facie contempt that 
you have found that has occurred in respect of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer, to the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board matter dated October 23 of last year.  A government news 
release announced that provincial and federal governments had 
constituted a nominating committee to nominate candidates for the 
new Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  The nominating 
committee was to have been set up under a clause that had not yet 
been adopted by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, on January 21, 1998, the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board met in Regina to discuss the rules for the 
election of the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board as 
proposed in Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act.  Substantial amendments to Bill C-4, tabled at report stage 
by opposition members, had not been debated, and while the House 
was still in the process of debating how many directors should be 
elected, the minister was in fact holding meetings as though the 
bill were already law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the Liberal government has a majority in the 
House and in committees but, for the integrity of the process, it 
is essential that members of the opposition, who were also 
elected by the people of Canada to represent their views, be 
given that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have witnessed a gradual slide in the respect that the 
government has shown to the institution of parliament, your 
ruling today, Mr. Speaker, will, if the Liberal members opposite 
co-operate, bring about rules that will perhaps govern this kind 
of situation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not simply a matter that I, as an opposition critic, 
have been embarrassed or that my colleagues, who received phone 
calls asking for their comments, have been embarrassed, it is for 
the integrity of the House and for the voters who sent us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those few brief words, Mr. Speaker, I again thank you.  We 
appreciate the fairness that you have demonstrated.  We look 
forward to working on a co-operative basis with all opposition 
members and Liberal members of the House whom I believe your 
ruling will also benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we follow the matter to its appropriate and proper 
conclusion, it will once again put parliament in the hands of the 
individual elected members.  It will remind the members of the 
executive that even though they are appointed by the Prime 
Minister they must serve each and every member of the House in 
the same manner that we as individual members serve the people of 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the wisdom and the fairness of the Chair 
in coming to this decision today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it does bear repeating how it is that we arrived at this 
point.  There has been a steady erosion of the respect, sadly, 
that Canadians feel for this institution.  This type of decision, 
as the hon. member for Provencher has stated, does go a long way 
in restoring some of the lost respect that exists for members of 
parliament.  It will perhaps buff away some of the tarnish that 
has come about under this government's administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament have the right to be informed first and 
foremost.  The Chamber should, in most, if not all cases, be the 
primary forum for disclosure on the part of the government when 
new legislation is being brought in. 
That has not been the case for a number of years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The icon of the Liberal Party, the late Pierre Trudeau, used to 
speak of members of parliament as being nobodies 50 feet off the 
Hill.  The Liberals are certainly reinforcing that sentiment with 
the behaviour that we have seen displayed over the past number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having members of the press gallery briefed and informed about 
important omnibus legislation, changes to the criminal code and 
new introductions of amendments to the criminal code, is an 
absolute insult to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was said in a Hollywood movie, “if you build it, they will 
come”, if we introduce legislation here, members of the media 
will come.  We do not need to hand feed members of the media.  If 
it becomes the practice of the government to introduce 
legislation here, to make important statements and pronouncements 
on public policy, if it had one, it can fully expect that members 
of the media will come.  The government should also expect that 
members of the opposition will respond and should be given that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very seldom have we seen in routine business members of the 
government get up under statements by ministers and inform the 
House as to what they intend to do or what legislation they might 
be bringing forward.  It is all done through press releases, 
through media spin doctoring and through attempts to put an 
opposition member very often in the uncomfortable position, as we 
saw in this case, of trying to respond to something on which he 
or she is not fully informed, and that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I again commend you for having taken some steps to 
safeguard the rights and privileges of members with your ruling 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The table scraps that we sometimes receive as information are 
also insults.  Sometimes a full briefing is provided to members 
of the media while we receive a fairly complex bill, by 
everyone's assessment, an hour before question period, where 
members are required to be here to try and concentrate—although 
we have seen examples of late where there was little 
concentration going on in the Chamber—and then be able to go out 
and face the onslaught of very precise, penetrating questions 
from the media.  It is simply unthinkable and unrealistic to 
expect that members of parliament will be able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend not only yourself but the member for 
Provencher for bringing this matter forward.  I fully hope and 
trust that the committee, in its good work, will have an 
opportunity to bring forward proposals that would prevent this 
type of thing from happening in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope, first and foremost, that the Minister of Justice 
and her cadre of lawyers will get the message and heed the words 
of the Chair and eventually the admonition and words of the 
committee when it has an opportunity to delve into this matter 
further.  I would also hope that at the very least there will be 
a shot across the bow, a message sent and received, that the 
department cannot behave in this way.  That, first and foremost, 
may set an example and raise the bar slightly for other 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace that the Department of Justice, above all 
ministries in the government, would partake in this type of 
underhanded tactic.  With the resources available to it and with 
the importance and emphasis on fairness, the very symbol of the 
Department of Justice, two scales, obviously was tipped in a very 
partisan and partial way toward the government in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope, Mr. Speaker, that situations like this can be avoided 
in the future, although you will have to excuse my skepticism. We 
know that the government has undertaken at least some steps to 
look at parliamentary reform.  This again may pave the way for 
some good intent and, we would hope, goodwill on the part of the 
government to follow through on those commitments, but time will 
tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, as all opposition members, will be there at 
the gate to watch this process unfold.  It is a very important 
process indeed as all members of the House and, equally 
important, the Canadian public, are watching to see if we can in 
some fashion bring about greater relevance and credibility to 
this Chamber that we call the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
a member of the government side I too want to express my thanks 
for your ruling.  It makes a great deal of sense to the House and 
that is exactly what the House was expecting from the Chair.  I 
am sure government members will support the motion that has been 
made by the member from the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the comments of the House leader of the 
Conservative Party, I found it interesting that he painted a 
picture of terrible things having happened here and a tremendous 
erosion of respect for the House.  I want to know from the member 
why it is acceptable to him, then, to simply receive a motion to 
refer this matter to the procedure and House affairs committee. 
It seems like a pretty wimpy motion to me if this was such a 
serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think that maybe there should be some more 
specificity to the motion?  Perhaps he would comment on whether 
the motion should be amended to provide some direction or some 
timeframe which might reflect the urgency the House should place 
on the matter if that is the member's view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent 
question.  It sounds to me that implicit in the question the 
member opposite is maybe referring to the fact that the minister 
might be asked to resign.  Or, perhaps we should have the 
minister come before the House and explain herself and her 
department in a more open and forthright fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to putting time limits on the matter, I certainly 
would not take any issue with that.  It would be an excellent 
suggestion to amend the motion so that there was a certain 
timeframe which the committee could be given to look at the issue 
and bring it back to the House.  Perhaps something could be 
included in the motion to have the minister come before the bar 
and explain what took place in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be a very deliberate act.  As far as my reference to 
this being something that contributes to the lack of respect for 
the Chamber, I would only reiterate that is very much the case 
when there are these transgressions on the part of departments 
that should know better.  Then we hear the government House 
leader adamantly defend the actions of his government when we 
know that if he were in opposition he would be doing backflips 
out of the gallery to condemn the government for the very thing 
he was trying to defend.  This has become very much a practice of 
cynicism and hypocrisy that we should be trying to avoid if we 
are to try to raise the standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the suggestion from the hon. member opposite.  If he 
has a specific amendment that he would like to put forward, I 
would certainly consider it and support it if it were within the 
spirit of his comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to hear whether the member from the Liberal 
Party has some suggested amendments which we should consider if 
he wants to toughen up the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my understanding of the motion that it was crafted in that 
way because that is the typical motion brought forward on these 
issues.  When the Speaker rules a prima facie case of contempt we 
deal with it in that form of a motion to get it into committee to 
examine all the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity to amend the motion, perhaps in this 
debate.  I do not suppose it will go on all afternoon, but it 
would be worthwhile in the next few minutes for someone to put 
forward a date when the matter should be reported back to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough what sort 
of things should be dealt with in committee.  Perhaps we should 
give some direction to the committee on whom it should hear from 
and give some of the suggestions he thinks should be brought 
forward on whether we should develop a protocol for all ministers 
on how they handle the presentation of bills to the House? 
Perhaps it could be a protocol on the lockup procedure for the 
media.  I also suggest that is perhaps something we should look 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may have some suggestions on who should bring forward 
testimony, besides the minister who is an obvious one.  If he has 
some ideas on what specifically we should deal with, I think the 
committee could use that direction at this time.  Those are my 
suggestions, but it would be interesting to hear his suggestions 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that perhaps it is 
an opportunity to look at some of the broader issues and how we 
should deal with ministries and departments when this type of 
action occurs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does not appear to be any specific disciplinary action 
available to the committee or the House for that matter.  I am 
sure the Speaker is certainly very learned in that particular 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would very much suggest that the importance in this instance 
is to have the minister appear before this particular committee, 
armed and surrounded by her cadre of departmental officials, to 
explain what exactly they were thinking.  This appears to be a 
very deliberate act.  This is not something that leaked out or 
that was put out under some pretence of it going anywhere else. 
It was directly an invitation for the media to come and be 
briefed prior to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very much in favour of having the minister come 
forward and speak to the specific behaviour of her department on 
this issue.  I would be very much in favour, granted the 
privilege to do so, to amend the motion that is currently before 
the House by adding after last line where it states “referred to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs” that 
there be a full reporting to the House within three months, and 
that a witness list be agreed upon by all parties, and would 
include the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough knows he cannot move motions on 
questions and comments.  I am afraid he is out of luck on this 
one, unless of course the House wishes to give its consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to pay my respects to the Speaker for his 
ruling on this.  I would like to put on the record how this 
affected me personally.  It was indeed my legislative assistant 
who along with one of his colleagues went over to the room and 
was denied access.  When I got back to my office after my own 
meetings, I ran into a hornets nest when my LA brought this up to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough tell us how 
he sees these kinds of shenanigans, shall we put it, affecting 
the staff?  I know the impact it had on my staff when he was sent 
packing, particularly when he was trying to do the job I pay him 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is fair to say that the 
minister in an instance like this probably was more or less 
putting her department on autopilot and probably did not have a 
direct hand in what occurred.  However, we know through 
parliamentary responsibility she is the head of that department. 
She should have been fully informed about a decision that was 
obviously, as I have stated many times, quite deliberate and 
meant to keep members of parliament out of the loop on an 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, this particular omnibus legislation 
contained much of the same content of a bill that we saw in the 
last parliament, but moved in a new direction on some very 
important factors, including the creation of new amendments to 
the criminal code pertaining to crimes on the Internet and other 
important amendments to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this occurred and how this came about is something that only 
the minister can answer.  That is why I would emphasize the 
importance that she be given the opportunity to fully answer 
before the committee when this matter is taken up by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking your direction, Mr. Speaker, on what just occurred with 
respect to moving an amendment to this motion, I would ask for 
unanimous consent that we add to the text of the motion in the 
last line “with a full reporting to the House by June 1, 2001 
and that a witness list include the Minister of Justice”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I find it most unfortunate that the government did not 
approve this amendment, which would have given us an extremely 
important deadline, that is June 2001. I realize that the 
government is not interested in clarifying these rules, 
considering how it has been operating since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be brief. First, I want to congratulate the hon. member 
for Provencher for his vigilance, since this is a very important 
issue and it is not the first time that the Department of 
Justice has operated in that fashion. 
As we have seen in the past, this did not work for either 
the minister or the system, since there were all sorts of 
erroneous interpretations circulating before a bill would even 
be introduced in the House. This is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I wish to salute your openness, Mr. Speaker, and to 
thank you for having entertained this question of privilege, 
since this is a very important part of our work as members of 
parliament. We must have all the tools and be on the same 
footing, so to speak, as all other parliamentarians. The way the 
minister operates, we could never be on the same footing as her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope all parliamentarians will give this issue the 
attention it deserves. 
I also hope the minister will testify and answer questions. 
I believe the whole issue has to do with the fact that the 
minister does not control her department. It may not be a major 
problem or a problem common to every department, but it exists 
in the Department of Justice because the minister does not see 
what is going on in her department. She does not know what is 
going on and she does not control anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope we will shed light on this issue and we can 
then have more specific rules, so all opposition members 
can have access to information at the same time as, and even 
before, the media, so as to be in a position to adequately 
answer questions and, more important, do their work properly 
as members of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would simply like to point out that the member who has just 
spoken is mistaken.  The government is interested in this issue 
and in the committee's taking time to broaden the issues 
concerning the Speaker's ruling.  Frankly, I think the committee 
must be given enough time to do a thorough job. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee, I believe, has done an excellent job in the past 
on issues of privilege referred to it.  I can assure the member 
that we take this issue seriously and that we would like to vote 
for the motion right now, get it before the committee and let the 
committee decide how it wishes to deal with it.  If the House is 
not satisfied with it, then the House can deal with that. 
However, please let us get it to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he would allow the debate to end so 
that we could all vote for the motion and get it to the 
committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member who has 
just spoken knows the rules of the House as well as I do.  She 
knows that, just because the government has set a cut off date to 
force parliamentarians to at least seriously study this whole 
question as quickly as possible, if on the day before or two 
days before the cut off date the report is not ready, the House 
can still allow more time to enable the House to prepare and 
submit the report effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was pointing out to the House is that the opposition 
wanted to set a date but the government refused.  I think 
the member said it clearly. In rising and trying to justify it, 
she is slightly wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set a date, for example the first of June, for the 
amendment.  Let us set that as the date.  Then, if the committee 
has not concluded its work, the government will give it more 
time.  At least there is a cut off date to oblige 
parliamentarians to work on it and especially to oblige the 
government to raise this whole issue, take a responsible 
approach in questioning witnesses and table its report as soon 
as possible.  However with no date set this would not be the first 
matter that got shelved and covered with dust before seeing the 
light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my earlier remarks were quite relevant. 
Once again the government is refusing to set a cut off date so 
that the work gets done quickly and parliamentarians have all 
the tools they need to do an effective job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, listening to my colleagues who spoke on the decision 
you have just brought down, for which I too congratulate you, 
and listening to the chief government whip, the following 
thought came to me: what we are dealing with here is a 
government that has made the heaviest use of gag orders to shut 
up the opposition in all Canadian parliamentary history.  For 
once, the opposition parties are the ones saying “Let us gag the 
government, for it has the majority in the committees and can 
do what it wants in them.  Let us give it until June 1 to try 
to find a way of giving us a decision by June 1”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm has made so clear, 
committees have come to us in the House on a number of occasions 
and have asked us for extensions and we have always agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether he shares my intuition. 
I find it cause for concern that the government is hesitant to 
set June 1 as the date.  That suggests to me that it will put it off 
for a month of Sundays, a treatment it often 
gives to things it does not care for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is extremely regrettable for the whip to have popped 
up so suddenly from behind the curtains, like a rabbit in hat, 
with her little no.  She was the only one to say it.  She had 
not even had the time to warn the others that they were supposed 
to be opposed.  Here we are without the June 1 date we want. 
I find that really disgusting. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member for Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis knows 
very well that I have been in the House paying attention to this 
debate throughout, and that she has erred in transgressing the 
rules of the House by commenting on the presence or absence of a 
member in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> It is certainly contrary to the rules to refer to 
the presence or absence and especially the absence of a 
member.  Everyone knows that, particularly the hon. member for 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, who is very familiar with the 
standing orders of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, who just spoke, is very 
perceptive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this is a government which is far more likely to gag 
the opposition than itself, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this is not a real gag but a deadline to force 
parliamentarians to submit a report.  Once again, if more time 
is needed the House has always given its agreement in the 
interests of a comprehensive report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there is a rule of law which says that there is a 
presumption of good faith, it looks like bad faith on the part 
of the government not to want to set a date that would force 
parliamentarians to work quickly and effectively on this report.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This report must be tabled in the House so that all 
parliamentarians, regardless of party, government or 
opposition, have all the tools they need to do their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will recall that when the Liberals 
were in opposition, they had much less to say in this regard. 
At the time, the present government House leader had some strong 
criticism for the Progressive Conservatives when they imposed 
time allocation or did not wish to introduce a particular bill 
or tale a particular report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest they take a look at what they were saying when they 
were in opposition and be consistent today. 
Although they form the government, they should ensure that 
members of the House have all the tools they need to do their 
work properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
very brief, but I want to put on the record my own support and 
that of my caucus for the decision announced earlier by the 
Chair.  I am not a lawyer, but I guess when the judge agrees one 
tends to say it was a very good decision.  However, I think it 
was in this case.  I think it restores some faith in this 
institution and, as other deputies have said, allows us to be on 
an equal footing and to bring legislation forward in this place 
as opposed to our learning about it after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point being debated on the floor is the notion that 
the Minister of Justice should be coming before the House as part 
of a witness list.  There too the New Democratic Party very much 
wants to be on record as associating itself in favour of that 
kind of action.  The chief government whip is saying no, that she 
is not in support of it, and I think that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a very good ruling this afternoon.  I recall that 
when this was first raised last week by the member for 
Provencher, the House leader for the New Democratic Party talked 
about an earlier time in parliament when it was automatic that 
legislation was brought here, debated here and announced here, 
and that the media got their news from here as opposed to it 
being the other way around.  The House leader also talked about 
the erosion we have seen in the House of Commons for members of 
parliament over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the ruling of the Speaker in today's judgment is a sound 
one and will help to restore parliamentary democracy in this 
place.  I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on that ruling and look 
forward to a continuing debate and more real and meaningful 
debate in the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to make a few comments.  First, I commend 
you, Sir, for the promise you made when you contested the office 
of Speaker.  You said at that time that you would introduce into 
this place a dimension of respect, a dimension of freshness and a 
new approach, and you have done that in your ruling here this 
afternoon.  I thank you for that and I recognize the contribution 
you are making to the operation of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appeal to all members in the House to recognize the good 
intention of the suggested amendment that we put a timeline on 
this matter.  If we really care about what is happening here, we 
will deal with this in a time that is appropriate and in a time 
that will help the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all members on that committee and have a lot of respect 
for them, as I do for you, Mr. Speaker.  I would simply like to 
suggest that we pass the motion, honour you for it, take it to 
committee, and then expect the committee to act within the 
intention and the spirit of the discussion here this afternoon so 
that it is dealt with expeditiously and comes forward in time for 
it to have a meaningful impact on the operation of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure 
that I rise in the House today to give my maiden speech.  What 
makes this such an important occasion for me is that my speech 
will centre around an issue that is of paramount importance to 
the people of my riding of Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is home to several native bands and, like the rest of 
British Columbia, is subject to many overlapping land claims 
which cover every city, town, village, ranch and ski hill in the 
area.  Since my appointment as deputy critic of Indian and 
northern affairs, I have been contacted by numerous native people 
and non-native people regarding accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Indian affairs policy is not working.  Forty per cent 
of natives on reserves receive social assistance.  Fifty per cent 
of native children live in poverty.  The infant mortality rate 
for native children is double that for other children. 
Alcoholism, suicide and crime rates are three times higher than 
for non-natives.  On average, on reserve native men can expect to 
live 12.5 years less than the average Canadian male. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, the federal government has spent more than $90 billion 
on native programs since 1969.  This year, spending works out to 
about $20,000 for every on reserve man, woman and child.  This 
money does not get to those who really need it.  The government 
simply transfers most of that money, approximately $7 billion 
this year, to band governments.  Misuse and waste of public funds 
are common and rampant in the government.  HRDC remains a blatant 
example of that and it is not alone.  There are constant 
indications that much of the money distributed by the Indian 
Affairs department is being misused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, DIAND officials conservatively estimated that 20% was 
wasted and spent without proper documentation. Dollar-wise that 
works out to roughly $100 million for non-compliance.  A 1996 
report by the auditor general confirms some of these findings. 
The report stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports do not generally include information on outcomes.  There 
is inadequate evidence of ongoing department verification. 
Information on accountability is incomplete.  There is evidence 
of substantial implementation failure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many band governments do carry out their financial affairs very 
well, but it is clear many do not.  There are about 630 bands in 
Canada.  One-quarter of them, 25%, are under remedial management. 
In layman's terms, 25% of the native bands in Canada cannot 
manage their financial affairs and the department has had to step 
in to make sure that the bills get paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this should come as news to the government.  Grassroots 
natives themselves have repeatedly complained about this legacy 
of waste and mismanagement.  We are never more than a few days 
away from newspaper stories documenting blatant examples of 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is the Millbrook Reserve in Nova Scotia. 
According to the <I>Chronicle Herald</I> of March 29, 1999, band 
councillors on the Millbrook Reserve gave themselves a $4,000 
increase in their honorariums in March 1999.  Their salaries 
totalled $39,000 per year.  Chief Lawrence Paul of the Millbrook 
band was paid $39,000 in honorariums on top of his salary.  His 
salary is unknown.  Chief Paul denied allegations that many 
residents on the reserve were living in meagre conditions in 
comparison to council members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Indian Brook Reserve in Nova Scotia, the <I>Chronicle 
Herald</I> of August 17, 1999, stated that $1.2 million was spent 
by the band over five years, yet no one knows what for, since 
audits reveal it is listed as “miscellaneous” or “other”. The 
audits also reveal that $122,796 was used from the social 
services budget to pay the rents of people not eligible for 
social assistance.  Meanwhile, council salaries have risen 135% 
over five years to $21,300.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social services department of the band also paid council 
members $54,307 on top of their salaries.  The chief is paid 
$47,300 plus expenses.  Administration salaries have jumped 68% 
in five years.  The debt on the reserve totals $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Post of December 2, 2000, said that in the 
Sheshatshiu First Nation, Labrador, a community infamous for gas 
sniffing problems among its children, leaders gave residents 
nearly $750,000 in gifts and loans in 1999.  The community of 
1,250 received more than $10 million in federal funding in 1999. 
Band council members were reported in an audit to have given 
themselves $100,000 more in honoraria than they were entitled to. 
Band employees owe the council $140,000.  As well, $400,000 of 
$500,000, or 80%, in loans was estimated in the audit to be 
unrecoverable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Post of March 15, 1999, said that in the Saulteaux 
Band, in Saskatchewan, former chief Gabe Gopher's honorarium and 
travel expenses totalled some $171,000.  In 1997 about $600,000 
was spent on travel by the chief and band councillors.  The band 
had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 million as of March 31, 1998. 
Most of the $1.65 million fund for treaty land entitlement 
purchases was found to have been spent on travel and meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Stoney Band in Alberta, 3 chiefs and 12 councillors 
received $1.4 million in salaries and benefits.  Those amounts 
ranged between $65,000 and $167,000 per year.  In 1997 the band 
had a deficit of $5.6 million.  Despite $50 million in oil and 
gas revenues in 2000, federal transfers total about $23 million 
per year.  A probe into abuse launched by Alberta judge John 
Reilly resulted in 43 criminal investigations.  Only two minor 
charges were laid in those 43 investigations.  The RCMP reported 
that the problem on the reserve was mismanagement rather than 
criminal activity.  However, Chief John Snow demanded a public 
apology from Judge Reilly.  The total band population was then 
3,300 people.  The unemployment rate is at 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Tla-o-qui-aht Band in B.C., Chief Francis Frank's salary 
and benefits totalled $109,003 in 1997.  He resigned in December 
of that year.  There were only 500 to 600 people on his reserve. 
An auditor called in to look at the band books was “unable to 
express an opinion on the financial statements due to inadequate 
record keeping with revenues and particularly with respect to 
expenditures and payroll”.  Most of the reserve population was 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Samson Band in Alberta is one of the more glaring examples 
of waste and outright corruption.  In 1998 the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> reported that the chief and 12 councillors earned almost 
$2 million in salaries and benefits in 1997.  Unemployment on 
this reserve hovers in the 85% range.  About 80% of the reserve 
residents are on welfare.  Although this band is oil rich, it is 
running a deficit in the $50 million range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a few of the all too many occurrences of waste 
and mismanagement on some of Canada's native reserves.  It would 
be a mistake to say that it is just about wasting money.  It is 
about people's lives.  The money being doled out by the 
government, which should be used to help improve the lives of 
native men, women and children, is instead being misused and is 
making their lives a living hell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are television stories and pictures of children sniffing 
gas out of garbage bags in Davis Inlet and teenagers are 
committing suicide by jumping off a CBC broadcast tower in 
Labrador.  The United Nations itself reports that many natives 
live in third world conditions, with a lack of clean water, 
deplorable housing and unimaginable unemployment.  Many chiefs 
and band councillors live in palaces, have huge, tax-free 
salaries and fly all over the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To call the government accountable in its handling of the 
affairs of our native people would be a perversion of logic in 
every sense.  The government has systematically abdicated its 
responsibility to native people time and time again. 
Almost 32 years have passed since the following statement was 
made in the white paper on Indian Policy: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian relations with other Canadian peoples began with special 
treatment by government and society.  And special treatment has 
been the rule since Europeans first settled in Canada.  Special 
treatment has made of the Indians a community disadvantaged and 
apart.  Obviously the course of history must be changed... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada believes that its policies must lead to 
the full, free and non-discriminatory participation of the Indian 
people in Canadian society.  Such a goal requires a break with 
the past.  It requires that the Indian people's role of 
dependence be replaced by a role of equal status, opportunity and 
responsibility, a role they can share with all other Canadians.

both native and non-native. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I 
heard was a litany of newspaper stories being added up.  A lot of 
that is the exception to the rule.  It is like talking about 
young offenders in society as if they are all young offenders if 
they are a certain age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is the 
most audited department in the government.  Every first nation 
partner must submit an audit to the department every year.  The 
government uses the audit to look at the financial health of a 
community.  First nations, like other governments, are required 
to prepare their audits in accordance with the public sector 
accounting and auditing standards of the Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of the audits are shared not only with the federal 
government but with the community.  The end result of the audit 
is a need to look at the community to see whether it needs a 
management plan to help with its own capacity and capacity 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations conduct standardized community accountability and 
management assessments in order to help identify for themselves 
where they require capacity building.  In January 2000, 93% of 
the community assessments were complete and work was proceeding 
in accordance with the management development themes that had 
been unearthed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A speech like the one we just heard lumps together reserves that 
are getting help, moving along and have a good governance 
mechanism and training with the assistance of the federal 
government, with those that are deficient and in the wrong.  It 
is not true and it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A perfect example of good governance was the Nisga'a nation last 
year.  They had great governance.  We worked on the Nisga'a last 
year in the House.  The Nisga'a is an upstanding community with 
great capacity.  Members still did not support the treaty and 
voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not consider the capacity building and 
proper accounting methods and methodologies of such bands? Would 
she not consider all the different organizations that have come 
to the assistance of first nations so that they can move toward 
better governance of their own resources?  Must we have this 
litany of the negative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe I made it very 
clear at the beginning of my statement that many bands in Canada 
are doing a fine job.  I pointed out some of the bands that are 
not doing a fine job.  It is the people of the bands for whom I 
am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not taking my information from newspapers.  At the 
beginning of my speech I made it very clear that when I was 
appointed deputy critic for Indian affairs I received a deluge of 
mail.  I received e-mails, telephone calls and letters.  Any way 
in which correspondence can be sent, I received it either in this 
office or in my Kamloops office.  I have pictures, photographs 
and documentation.  It does not make for good night time reading. 
What is happening with native people in some areas of the country 
is very frightening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Native people deserve the money that governments send to their 
bands.  It is not getting there right now, and that is the point 
we are trying to make.  Numerous native people have asked for 
accountability.  I support what I said, and I support the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take the opportunity to 
congratulate the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan for his 
foresight and motivation in introducing this motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that in all financial transfer 
arrangements between the Federal Government and individual Indian 
Bands...that the use of any public funds be publicly reported and 
accurately audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes to the heart of a serious problem of government 
policy, not only toward native groups but to the funding criteria 
for all departments throughout the government.  One could look at 
the funding of many programs and see glaring weaknesses in the 
accountability of money transferred from the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four times a year the auditor general releases his findings of 
the financial practices of government departments and reports his 
findings to parliament.  That is accountability and it is what we 
expect.  That is what it means to have public funds used in a 
transparent and reasonable fashion.  That is exactly what the 
motion addresses.  It goes to the heart of financial 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native bands receive millions of dollars from the government. It 
has been reported that it is something over $7 billion.  Far too 
often all we hear of is the negative, wasteful spending of 
Canadian tax dollars.  It is true that often money is wasted and 
misappropriated, but often large amounts of money are put in the 
hands of those who have no experience and no ability to 
administer it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who suffers because of this lack of accountability?  It is the 
most vulnerable, grassroots aboriginals who do not get the basic 
essentials to live dignified and fulfilling lives.  We take for 
granted clean running water.  We take for granted that people 
will have homes in which to live.  We expect an efficient sewage 
system to safeguard against disease and protect health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every remote cabin in British Columbia needs government approval 
for its sewage system but reserves do not.  Unfortunately, and 
far too often, such basic needs are not met on reserves because 
the money earmarked for those projects goes somewhere else, is 
not administered in a completely professional way or is given 
into the hands of those with no experience.  Tragically, far too 
often it is the weakest of the weak, the children, who suffer the 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the motion is so important and why we must restore 
financial accountability to grassroots native people.  That is 
why we must do everything we can as parliamentarians to help 
people on reserves, especially children, because those children 
are as much the future of our country as the children of 
parliamentarians like myself.  I have said many times that one of 
the main reasons I am here is for the future of my country and 
the future of my children.  However it is not only for my own 
children and grandchildren, it is for the children of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April last year, the auditor general reported his audit of 
the elementary and secondary education programs that are 
administered by the department of Indian affairs.  His findings 
are tragic.  I will take a moment to read to the House some of 
the findings of his audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Indian and northern affairs cannot demonstrate that it 
meets its stated objective: to assist first nation students 
living on reserves in achieving their educational needs and 
aspirations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the department does not have the necessary 
assurance that first nations students are receiving culturally 
appropriate education.  Moreover, progress in closing the 
education gap for Indian students living on reserves has been 
unacceptably slow.  At the current rate of progress it will take 
over 20 years for them to reach parity in academic achievement 
with other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present about 117,000 students enrolled in elementary and 
secondary schools live on reserves.  Current budget costs, not 
including school construction and maintenance, are about $1 
billion annually.  That is about 21% of the money that goes into 
Indian affairs.  Despite the huge budget, the department needs to 
radically speed up reform and accountability practices to meet 
increased demands placed on education as a result of an 
increasing population on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things I will briefly mention.  The Indian 
affairs department does not know whether special needs students 
are being appropriately identified and assisted.  That is 
according to the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has little involvement with first nations in the 
development of pedagogical principles and instruments, including 
curriculum design, instruction standard and teacher 
qualifications.  Those are not things that people who are elected 
to council can simply do because they were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the department does not generally review the mission 
statements, objectives and plans of the schools that it funds, so 
it has no idea what is going on.  Also, recent evaluations of on 
reserve schools disclosed a significant need to improve various 
aspects such as curricula, teacher training, equipment and 
homework policies.  However the department, according to the 
Auditor General of Canada, does not monitor the implementation of 
evaluation recommendations.  There is a great lack of 
responsibility on the part of the federal government that is not 
appropriately borne by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful that in our society young native children are 20 
years behind the academic achievements of Canadian children 
attending public schools.  It is a tragedy.  A whole generation 
of children will be left behind in the rapid technological 
transformations our society is experiencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not fail these children.  We must have accountability 
not only on the reserves, although certainly there, but in the 
department of Indian affairs as well.  We must make sure the 
resources and tools are there to give these children a well 
rounded education and that they are used as they are intended to 
be used.  Adequate amounts of moneys, properly priorized, are 
essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried in the past to educate native children.  During 
the 20th century the Government of Canada created the residential 
school system to teach young native children how to cope in 
modern society.  Unfortunately the residential school system had 
its share of failures, although teachers and government officials 
at the time, I believe, honestly thought they were doing their 
best to help the children.  However many judge them today as 
having instituted a system that robbed natives of their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real failure of the residential school system was the lack 
of accountability by the government of the time.  Some who taught 
in those schools did fail the children.  Some native children 
were abused and those who abused the children went unchecked. The 
government failed to hold accountable those who contracted out to 
teach those vulnerable children.  Right now the government is in 
the middle of a multibillion dollar lawsuit as a result of that 
lack of accountability and concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that situation never happens again.  Although 
circumstances are different, the results as we see them turn out 
to be the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are failing the children on our reserves because they are 
continuing to fall behind the world in education.  Why is that? 
It is because the government failed to adequately privatize 
aboriginal funding.  It failed to insist upon financial 
accountability of money sent to the reserves which was earmarked 
for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made this quite clear in his report to 
parliament.  He told the department of Indian affairs to demand 
better accountability of elementary and secondary education 
programs because the children were being left behind.  We must 
not let them continue to be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adopting the motion, the government is taking a very 
important step to assure better quality education for native 
children.  The motion makes financial accountability an 
obligation, not an option.  The motion presented by my hon. 
colleague will help better the lives of aboriginal children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before resuming debate, it is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Lethbridge, Trade; the hon. member 
for St. John's West, Coast Guard. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great honour to rise at this time to address the 
House but, most important, to address the people of Canada.  I 
would like to make some opening statements in my first language. 
As opposed to preparing a translatable speech, I will translate 
it following my statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very brief statement in Cree, what I have said is that in 
the journey of life on this land we have seen many peoples find a 
home here.  In searching for this home there have been agreements 
among our aboriginal nations and the nations around the world 
that found this place to raise our children together.   I 
understand that relationship, the relationship of how Canada was 
created by a treaty process.  The treaty was a nation to nation 
agreement, that the country we know as Canada was given birth 
when the crown of England struck treaties with the aboriginal 
nations of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In creating a country as beautiful as Canada is today, and we 
talk about the marginalization and the problems that our 
aboriginal people are facing now and into the future, I beg all 
members of the House and I beg all citizens of the country to 
look at restructuring and correcting the relationship that this 
sacred treaty was signed on for living together in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the restructuring, bringing more auditors to 
financially accountable programs will not correct the 
restructuring and the relationship of this country.  I would say, 
and I would challenge, and I have spoken of this before, that a 
third house in parliament should be seriously considered, a third 
house that brings in a unity among all people of the country. 
This House is acceptable as a parliamentary house of dialogue of 
the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the other House, the Senate, that conducts the 
affairs and the law making of the country.  The third house of 
which I speak could take in the parliamentary building that 
exists today, the parliamentary library.  I offer this today 
because it was built with a symbol of unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time of the signing of the treaties, if we look at the 
journey of the country and at the clerk's table as the signatory 
of the treaties, the crown came to that table to sign treaties. 
All the laws and administration of the affairs of the country 
have been taken by the crown.  The aboriginal people have not 
been given the opportunity to be partners, to be part of the 
decision making and law making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to say at the outset that I will be 
splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to members' attention a treaty that was originally signed 
and understood.  I should not say signed because it was an 
intention.  It was called a two row wampum.  I do not know if the 
ministers here are aware of the two row wampum.  The two row 
wampum treaty signified that in the journey of life the 
aboriginal people and the people who came from all shores could 
travel together in harmony and unity.  If one vessel 
overempowered another vessel in that journey, we would have lost 
our way and intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had hon. members today challenging the mismanagement 
of affairs by the chiefs and councils.  I have been a witness to 
the failure rates, to the high school dropouts, to the 
unemployment rates and to the fetal alcohol syndrome.  All these 
problems seem to be landing on a handful of chiefs who have been 
audited for mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the debate today.  The debate today is about the 
public reporting and auditing of public funds under the 
contribution agreements between the federal government and 
individual Indian bands.  That is only a symptom of the problems 
that we have today in the aboriginal communities and in the 
aboriginal nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at restructuring, at where we will go from here 
on in.  If we can have a third house in parliament, a council of 
aboriginal nations can sit in that house.  If we have fiscal and 
electoral problems in any of our communities, they would be 
accountable to that council, not to the minister nor to anyone 
else.  It is only right that they be accountable to their own 
nationhoods.  If we look at self-government, we are not creating 
a dialogue of the nationhoods that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone mentioned the truth.  Let us talk about the truth.  If 
we talk about the Cree nation, it extends from northern Quebec 
all the way to the Rocky Mountains.  By no means can I be fooled 
if someone were to say that the Cree nation is united.  It is 
diverse nation and has been dissected by existing provincial 
boundaries, Indian agents and Indian district offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a cohesive approach.  We must allow these 
nations to grow and be accountable to their members.  It is not 
band membership we are talking about, it is nation membership. 
Band members are citizens of their nations and they have to be 
accountable to their people.  We must allow them to be 
accountable to their people.  We will then see what the 
aboriginal people can contribute to the betterment of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give them the tools and the natural resources they 
need to improve the economic cycles in their communities, regions 
and territories and that will enhance our country's future.  They 
will be living partners in our urban centres.  Their knowledge 
and research in the future technology field, but also embedded in 
their traditional knowledge and oral history, will become 
examples for the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A united nationhood of aboriginal people working in concert with 
the treaty negotiations that took place and made this beautiful 
country we call Canada is the dream we have for our children, but 
we have to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only a handful of aboriginal people here in this House 
and we represent a huge geography, the huge tracts of lands that 
expand to the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today incited me to raise the issue one more time. 
The accountability issue, the plight and the problems that deal 
with the administration of funds that members of the opposition 
have raised and looked at for a number of years, will fade away 
but the issue of the restructuring will stay.  That is where I 
would like to see the debate go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been no solutions.  The motion does not address the 
plight of aboriginal people.  It only addresses the problem the 
minister has accounting to the treasury of the country.  It does 
not address the issues of the aboriginal people.  When the House 
is ready to debate that, I will rise again and make that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability can go both ways.  It is a double-edged sword. If 
the treaties and their spirit of intent were to share the land, 
in light of a handful of funds for housing, for medicine and for 
education, these funds are now being allocated because of the 
land that was transferred.  If aboriginal people want to look at 
the accountability of finances they can look at the 
accountability of the lands and the management of their 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our journey as Canadians.  It is our journey as residents 
of our many territories.  As an aboriginal person, I am proud 
that I am willing to offer a new structured relationship within 
this country to build a proud jewel in the globe where Canada can 
be a beautiful place for everyone to live. The accountability 
issue is just the start of a dialogue of restructuring ourselves. 
It could be a bold economic adventure.  Research and development 
that does not take place now could take place in our homelands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs are making decisions that are not based on sound, 
long term plans.  They do not have their own research development 
institutes.  That is what I beg to challenge the House on today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in the comments made by the member 
across the way and would like to ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member expressed certain concerns with respect to the lack 
of resources the chiefs have to do background research.  I was 
also very interested in his comments about the use of the 
parliamentary library.  These were very interesting proposals and 
the types of things we should be discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted in his comments that the Liberal government has not 
fulfilled a number of outstanding treating obligations.  I wonder 
if the member could elaborate on what treaty obligations this 
government has not yet fulfilled.  As we know, the treaties are 
based on the honour of the crown.  What obligations by the crown 
does the member feel that the Liberal government has not yet met? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the obligations that 
were agreed upon in treaty were signed with the British crown to 
create a country called Canada. 
Today these obligations have been subject to interpretation.  In 
the last general election we saw dialogue on and interpretation 
of these treaties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to parliament, as I went up to the 
parliamentary restaurant on the right-hand side I saw a big 
pyramid that said all the credit of Canada is heaped on top of 
the pyramid.  However, all of it would be nothing in my mind, if 
we took out the bottom part of the pyramid that is the 
territories and lands and of which our country is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the vessels of Britain and France had stayed out on the ocean 
there would be no country.  There would be no taxpayers and no 
credit.  It was the territories and lands that were signatory, 
created by treaty, that created this country.  From that 
relationship is where the obligations started fading.  It was a 
mistake when we left the treaty signatories, let the aboriginal 
people go back to their camps and the crown assumed the 
administration of the country.  Let us restructure and go back to 
that table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us bring back the aboriginal people as a part of 
administering the country, as a part of making laws, taking 
control of them and enforcing them.  They have to be part of the 
fabric of the country.  They cannot be self-governing and thrown 
aside to address their own affairs.  They have to be allowed to 
play a part in addressing the affairs of the country as well. 
They are a part of this country.  That was their inheritance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to make a comment and ask a question to the hon. 
member for Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Canada's aboriginal and Inuit communities currently 
have access to changing economic development programs which, 
more often than not, are managed from afar by people in 
government offices. These communities must adjust their projects 
based on criteria defined by outside authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, as a result of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples, a report entitled “People to People, Nation to Nation” 
was drafted. For our Cree and Inuit friends from James Bay, 
Nunavut, Nunavik and all of western Canada, is my colleague 
pleased with what was said in the report of the royal commission? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, since returning to the 
House I have taken great interest in the royal commission report. 
It is bound in a number of volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My original interest, because of my previous life in the 
educational field, was only the educational chapters.  However, 
the one thing that existed in the royal commission report, which 
I thought was a jewel, was the aboriginal house of 
representation.  It is hidden inside the royal commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody reads the royal commission report thoroughly he or 
she will find there are a lot of futuristic recommendations in 
it.  Some of them did not even materialize as recommendations. 
They are written in the body of the royal commission report. 
That is where this house of representation for aboriginal people 
was written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member who made her maiden speech, and is 
now an Acting Speaker, to read the whole royal commission report 
on aboriginal people.  It is a worthwhile document.  It sets a 
journey and a vision for our people into the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
speak about initiatives undertaken by the Government of Canada to 
strengthen accountability in first nations and Inuit health 
programs and services, one aspect that we have not heard about 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline the government's mandate in the area, detail the 
provisions contained in Health Canada's new accountability 
framework and identify the government's short and long term 
accountability goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently, as a government, provide over $1.2 billion for 
non-insured health benefits and community based health prevention 
and treatment for first nations and Inuit.  Over 600 facilities 
across Canada offer a full range of community based health 
programs and services which include nursing services, prenatal 
and children's programs, public health disease and environmental 
health services, prevention programs, the Indian and Inuit health 
careers program, the national native alcohol and drug abuse 
program and the first nations health information system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also provided a non-insured health benefits program 
which supplements the benefits covered by the insured programs 
offered by the provinces and the territories. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-insured health benefits program serves over 700,000 
clients.  It includes not only vision care but prescription 
drugs, medical supplies and equipment, dental care, medical 
transportation services and other care such as short term mental 
health crisis counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody in the House from any party would admit there is a long 
road ahead to fully meet all the needs.  However, the government 
is moving forward and we are trying to do it without criticizing 
the client that we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrently the Government of Canada has been working 
diligently with the stakeholders and across government 
departments to address issues of accountability.  In the Speech 
from the Throne, the Government of Canada pledged to improve the 
health of aboriginal people and aboriginal communities by 
championing community based health promotion and disease 
prevention programs.  We do this in partnership with the first 
nations.  We are working to address the health inequalities which 
have plagued first nation communities for far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Illness of almost every kind occurs more often among aboriginal 
people than among other Canadians.  Consider the statistics, then 
move away in our minds from statistics and say that they 
represent real aboriginal Canadian people in this country. 
Diabetes, for instance, is three times higher in first nation 
communities than the rest of Canada.  First nations and Inuit 
experience a higher rate of almost all chronic diseases, 
including heart disease to hypertension to tuberculosis.  The 
average life expectancy for aboriginal people is at least seven 
years less than for other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have introduced concrete measures designed to improve the 
health and well-being of aboriginal people throughout Canada. 
However, increasing also at the same time the transparency and 
accountability of the first nations, as they manage and they 
deliver these services, has to be part and parcel of what is 
needed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few months Health Canada will launch a series of 
new initiatives and processes, both internally and with its 
stakeholders, to enhance the financial and program accountability 
to strengthen the ability to monitor grants and contributions and 
to respond to accountability issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody wants to duck any problems that exist.  We want to 
identify and develop mechanisms that help people help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Government of Canada recognizes that it 
has to maintain the objective of assisting the first nations 
people and the Inuit to build their own capacities to allocate 
and use the much needed health resources within their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1999 the first nations and Inuit health branch of Health 
Canada has been working with the partners, the Assembly of First 
Nations and the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada to develop an 
accountability framework for improved management practices.  We 
have had assistance from many organizations.  In fact, there are 
over 100 pilot projects on accounting management and assistance 
in place at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability framework will clearly outline the roles and 
responsibilities of relevant parties.  It will also enable Health 
Canada to demonstrate results in investments, programs and 
services that are delivered.  As well, it will identify the gaps 
in the service, improve the capacity to deliver the service and 
measure performance and improve overall management practices. 
They have to go concurrently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An office of accountability implementation has been established 
to oversee the main components of this framework.  These 
components are designed to build a more transparent 
accountability process.  They include the programs, health plan 
program deliver and administrative capacity, in addition to the 
reporting, the evaluation and the audit elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An audit and accountability bureau was created which reports 
directly to the associate deputy minister of Health Canada.  In 
addition to the traditional audit functions, it also oversees 
Health Canada's responsibility with respect to ethics and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new quality assurance division will ensure that grants and 
contributions are well managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the first nations and Inuit health branch, regional 
directors are reviewing all the agreements in place to ensure 
that these agreements are processed, administered and maintained 
in accordance with Government of Canada policies and procedures. 
The ongoing implementation of the accountability framework will 
lead and has led to many improvements, not only in internal 
management control practices but in the standards, the policies 
and the controls for the negotiation signing and ongoing 
management of agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will, on this side of the House, support first nations and 
Inuit communities in building good governments, including more 
effective and transparent administrative practices. 
We are committed to continuing to work with first nations and 
Inuit organizations to help them improve their own accountability 
practices and to address any outstanding issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I have the utmost respect for my 
colleague and for what I believe she has done in her work on the 
Hill with aboriginal people.  I know that she knows something 
about my involvement with aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the vast majority of us in the House take very seriously 
the work that lies before us in terms of bringing aboriginal 
people into some sense of sustainability and economic 
development, giving them a sense of self-worth and bringing them 
into the Canadian family in every way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she has some concerns about our motion.  At the same 
time, I want to ask her this question.  We know the vast amounts 
of money that are involved.  They are billions of dollars. 
Ostensibly the money is set aside by Canadians, through the 
government, to help our native people achieve higher levels of 
success in every way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet while all this money is going to native people, we still 
have the appalling statistics.  We have statistics that tell us 
that unemployment is very high among native people on reserves. 
We have off reserve people in cities who are not able to find 
jobs.  We have huge problems on native reserves with HIV, 
hepatitis C, diabetes and all of those diseases that are also in 
the non-native population, but are disproportionately high in our 
native population.  We have terribly unacceptable suicide rates 
among our native young people.  I just get sick when I hear about 
it.  I see terrific amounts of substance abuse.  What went on 
with the James Bay Cree young people is probably just a drop in 
the bucket, and it became a very celebrated case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have to grapple with this question.  We have this 
money available and we have the resources to put at the disposal 
of native people.  If there is not an accountability problem, 
what is it that is not working to help our native people to 
achieve what we want them to achieve?  I would certainly 
appreciate the hon. member's elucidation on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is wider than what I 
addressed in this particular 10 minutes.  However, the root of it 
has to do with the culture and a respective people, their ways 
and their ability to govern themselves that historically has been 
taken away, maybe with all the best intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, we have done some wrong policy development.  We 
acknowledged that with apologies.  We have a situation where 
people of my age have been treated very poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my riding, when I discuss these issues with some of my 
constituents, they are ignorant of the facts.  They do not 
realize the intensity of the depravation.  They do not realize 
the lack of potential for the education of all the potential 
leaders in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes much more beyond the accounting concept of 
accountability.  It goes to a people who have in their own way 
been colonized and not willingly so.  I think we have great 
potential for leadership and change.  I do not think we will get 
there until everyone acknowledges that there were very wrong 
things done, maybe, as I said, with the best of intentions.

I think a lot of young native Canadians have to face—and we know 
that their population is growing very rapidly—it would be very 
difficult and maybe they would not meet all the expectations laid 
down before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the motivation behind today's motion is 
not really about the accountability of the pennies but the 
movement forward of the people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it does give me pleasure to speak to this motion we have 
before us today and to speak in regard to the situation for 
aboriginal grassroots people, who I really would like to focus 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker for the Liberals made the point that it is 
time to accentuate the positive and I certainly agree.  I would 
like to be able to do that more and more, because there are some 
positives out there.  I have seen them.  I have seen reserves 
where there is 100% employment and where there are excellent 
plans, excellent programs and a real honest, hard effort on the 
part of a number of chiefs and councils on a various number of 
reserves, and that is worth noting.  There is no doubt about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we take on a portfolio that leads us across the 
country to deal with grassroots natives all across Canada, we 
cannot help but notice some very serious situations and problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage all members of the House, whether they have 
native reserves in their ridings or not—they should go outside 
their ridings if they do not—to make a point of visiting some of 
these ridings.  Stay out of the elegant administration buildings, 
or go there for a little bit maybe, and maybe visit the chief and 
councils in some of their fine homes, but get further into the 
reserve and really talk to the grassroots people, the individuals 
who are living on each and every one, and pass out the bouquets 
when they are deserved.  When members see good things happening, 
they should bring it to the attention of the House.  Let us know. 
We should know more about them.  I agree with the hon. member 
that we need to accentuate the positive as much as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, where I have been and in what I have seen in the over 
300 reserves that I have visited, there have been both positives 
and negatives.  Unfortunately there is an awful lot of suffering 
going on across this land that needs to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that this particular motion is not going to answer all 
the problems.  A lot more has to follow this type of legislation 
in order to achieve much, but surely everybody can 
understand—and I appreciate the Liberal government supporting 
this motion—that in a lot of cases whatever we do will take 
dollars.  In order to provide the dollars that are necessary, we 
need to have some good accountable people making certain that the 
dollars are going to and achieving what it is we want to have 
happen across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to spend a lot of time talking about the examples 
I have seen, but I have been in their homes and sat on stumps 
that were used for chairs.  I have been treated to a great deal 
of hospitality by so many of these people, who have become very 
good friends.  We are in contact quite often, either by mail or 
phone from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the suffering, I just could not believe that I was in 
Canada when I went into a home where there were 12 to 14 members 
of a family living in that home, with the very minimum to eat, 
nothing to sleep on, no rooms within the shell that they called 
home, no running water and no electricity.  It was not a rare 
thing that I saw.  It was quite common and in some very 
unexpected territories, areas where one would not think it could 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at a number of the concerns brought forward by 
aboriginal people.  Alberta, one of the most fruitful provinces 
in the country, had the highest number of people on reserves 
asking for help.  In a three year period, there were 56. 
Manitoba was second with 17.  What they were asking for was some 
accountability and they did not know for sure what it would take 
to get that to happen.  They would simply contact their member of 
parliament.  The member of parliament would direct them to the 
department of Indian affairs, which would direct them to the 
chief and council.  That is where they went in the first place, 
without results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases threats were received.  They were told to stop 
complaining about the problem or not to bring it to the attention 
of the administration any more.  They were told that if there 
were any more words from them they would wish they had not asked 
for help.  Those were the kinds of threats that were made.  Homes 
were burned down on some reserves, with people allegedly saying 
that they were purposely burned out because they had spoken out 
against the administration of that particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious things.  Yet at the same time, a lot of public 
money was going into a number of reserves to build some real fine 
schools, although I will not tell members where they are, with as 
little as 10% of eligible students in attendance.  They had the 
finest equipment, the best that money could buy, provided by 
public funds, yet 90% were not attending those schools.  Where 
were they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I investigated further and became more familiar with the 
situation.  I will use a common name like Jones.  What was 
happening was that all of these great ideas and programs were 
being developed, and the chief would be Jones, and for some 
strange reason, the director of education would be Carolyn Jones, 
the director of natural resources would be Robert Jones, the 
director of public works would be Phil Jones, and the director of 
welfare would be Cathy Jones.  No one was qualified to even know 
what they were doing in terms of offering education and 
assistance for various types of programs.  The programs were 
there and the positions were filled, but no one was doing 
anything.  They were not solving any problems.  They were not 
getting young people into the schools.  They were not giving 
young people the assistance they needed for their addictions and 
their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Okanagan—Shuswap and I visited Winnipeg.  One 
cannot help but feel very sorrowful when one goes to a place like 
that and visits the streets.  We were accompanied by a person who 
lives there.  His name is Mike Calder and he really knows the 
situation and the problem.  He is an aboriginal himself.  He runs 
the St. Norbert centre there, trying to help bring in young 
people from the streets and assist them with their addictions and 
other problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was sorrowful to see the young people on the streets—and I 
mean kids—prostituting, delivering drugs, doing anything they 
could.  They get sucked off the reserves because of their 
situations and the mighty heroes of organized crime bring them in 
and exploit them all over the place.  We could see them.  All we 
had to do was get in the car and drive around late at night.  It 
is not a pleasant sight for Canadians to see, yet it is just one 
example of the many across the country now happening in our 
cities.  Young people are exploited day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we cry out loud and clear that we must do something serious 
about these adults who exploit kids, we do not get support.  We 
get bills like those that have been coming up recently, bills 
that say we will take away their tax status and that will show 
them.  What a very terrible situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my hon. colleague from across the way—I am sorry, but 
I do not remember from what riding—said loud and clear that this 
motion might be something that needs to happen, but that this has 
to go a lot longer and a lot further.  I consider this motion to 
be an excellent starting point.  If we can all agree that it is a 
good place to start, then we have to work toward solving the 
problems that these people are facing, not through their own 
fault in many cases.  It is not because of them that they are in 
the messes they are in.  A lot of times the leadership is not 
there and the accountability is not there.  The requests for 
leadership and accountability have not been supported by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How Mike Calder would love to have the federal government phone 
him and say that it is going to support his initiative in 
Winnipeg.  Right now his initiative is supported by the 
provincial government and the city.  There is nothing from the 
federal government.  What a shame that is when he goes around 
trying to get young people off the streets, trying to help them 
out of their desperate situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change our attitudes and this is a good place to 
start.  I thank the Liberal government for supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member talks about the plight or the affairs of those in 
off reserve urban situations.  A lot of the public accountability 
being called for by the motion is limited to on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is off reserve, if the plight of urban aboriginals is 
being brought in, should the accountability of provincial 
governments be brought to the House and investigated and audited 
for the results of the plight of urban people who are off 
reserve?  Does he understand the jurisdiction of on reserve and 
off reserve and accountability with the federal and provincial 
governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the questions.  Of course I understand the difference.  I 
also understand that because of things not happening for the 
benefit of young people in particular, and for others on the 
reserves, they are being drawn off the reserves by certain 
organizations and by people who live in the city, people who are 
pulling them off the reserves and telling them the people in the 
city are the heroes, that they are the people the young natives 
need to go to, that if they want answers to their difficulties, 
these people can help.  They are being drawn off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions toward the reserves come from many areas. 
There is absolutely no reason in the world why public funds of 
any nature that go into a reserve should not be accounted for. Of 
course they should be, whether they are provincial funds or city 
funds.  Some cities do that.  Calgary is constantly dealing with 
the Tsuu T'ina reserve within the city.  It happens all the time. 
This accountability is not strictly for the location of the 
reserve but within the jurisdiction of moneys received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I would be sharing my 
time.  I hope it is not too late. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to endorse what my colleague from Wild Rose 
has just said about the importance of changing the attitude.  I 
really would like to commend the Liberal government for 
supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in the debate, though, I wonder whether it might 
not be good for our listeners to know exactly what the motion is 
that we are debating.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that in all Contribution Agreements 
between the Federal Government and individual Indian Bands, the 
use of any public funds be publicly reported and audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the motion.  The intent of the motion, the exposition, 
if we like, is clearly what the money is being used for, how much 
money is being used and whether in fact the money is being 
applied in the manner that the original program intended.  That 
is the technical import of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to go well beyond the technical intent of the 
motion because the essence of the transparency that is being 
called for, the accountability that is being called for in the 
motion, really has more to do with an attitudinal change and the 
recognition that with receiving funds there is a responsibility. 
It is the emphasis on responsibility that I wish to attack.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a point when people are put in charge.  At the 
present time the government is making a big issue of the fact 
that our aboriginal people ought to be given the powers of 
self-government.  That is a wonderful thing to do.  We want to 
give our native people the right to determine their own affairs. 
Giving them the power and the right to do so has an implicit 
sense of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of that responsibility is to account for what we are trying 
to achieve.  Are we achieving those things?  Is the money we are 
applying to those purposes being used for those purposes?  We are 
not talking about peanuts.  We are talking about $4.2 billion or 
thereabouts this year.  That is an awful lot of money.  Where is 
the money going?  What results are being achieved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague said that a lot of positive things were 
happening.  Indeed there are.  However, are the bands who are 
achieving positive results not the same bands that can show that 
there is reward for responsibility, for exercising accountability 
and being responsible for decisions that are made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not those groups that go on tours.  These are not the 
ones that go on cruises.  These are not the ones that are paid 
exorbitant salaries.  They are not the ones who hide where the 
money is coming from and where it is being spent.  These are the 
ones who are telling their people the amount of money they got, 
where the money is going and what the results are.  They should 
be proud of that.  When they want to hide facts is when they get 
into trouble.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the time come when we as leaders in the House can 
demonstrate to the people that we are responsible?  Will the 
Prime Minister, for example, demonstrate clearly that he is 
prepared to open the books as to what happened with the HRDC 
grants, the Shawinigan affair, his relationship with the hotel 
owner and the golf course?  Will the Prime Minister tell the 
people of Canada what he did, or will he hide it?  The Prime 
Minister is responsible and it is the duty of the House to call 
him to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to do with the motion.  We are not 
trying to call to account those band leaders who are doing their 
job.  That is not what we are trying to do.  We are trying to 
call to account those who are not doing that.  We cannot do this 
unless there is a law that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite have referred over and over again today to 
the provision of the audit in the legislation and regulations 
that apply.  Let me read what the legal provisions are.  The 
Indian bands revenue moneys regulations state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8(1) Every band shall engage an auditor to audit its account and 
to render an annual report in respect thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>8(2) A copy of the auditor's annual report shall, within seven 
days of its completion, (a) be posted in conspicuous places on 
the Band Reserve for examination by members of the Band; and (b) 
be supplied to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obtaining a copy of the audit under Access to Information is 
blocked by the 1989 decision of the Federal Court in Montana Band 
of Indians v Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a court deciding that the people of Canada cannot know 
the result of these audits.  It is not working.  The intent of 
the legislation was not to prevent them from knowing how much 
money was being spent, where that money was being spent and what 
the results of spending that money were.  That was not the 
purpose of that legislation or regulation.  The purpose of the 
regulation was to open up and indicate clearly that a third party 
objective audit showed how much money was spent, what it was 
spent for and the results of the particular program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, on a technicality the court argued that because the 
leaders of particular bands decided to put together public funds 
and because those funds came from private ownership of Indian 
bands and were somehow put together in one book, we could no 
longer tell what the real position was.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a self-respecting accountant performing audit 
functions who cannot identify that kind of difference.  The only 
reason it can be muddled up is by people deliberately muddle the 
issue.  That is how it happens.  It does not happen when people 
are honest and truthful.  It does not happen when people show 
clearly that this is their money and this is money that came from 
the public purse.  It happens when somebody wants to make sure 
that we do not know the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for the Government of Canada to recognize that 
it is responsible, and part of that responsibility is to tell the 
truth, to recognize that it has made some mistakes, that there 
are some things it can fix and that it will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not done by hiding behind a technicality that says one 
source of funds is over here and the other is over there so we 
cannot tell the truth.  That is absolute nonsense.  That can be 
corrected.  The intent of the motion is to make sure that the 
kind of legislation presented to the House will enable this kind 
of money to be made public so that we can clearly tell what the 
facts are and where we can go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for going as far as it has in 
supporting the motion.  I also wish to clearly demonstrate that I 
am committed to the position of our native people, people who are 
declared as Indians under the Indian Act.  I want them to have 
the same self-respect that we have and to have the same kind of 
opportunity to pursue their interests as we have.  I want them to 
be performing in the House just as we are.  They are citizens of 
Canada.  They are Canadians first, just like we are.  That is 
what we would like in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kelowna alluded 
to the mix of public and private funds.  A bigger term is used, 
the term co-mingling.  At the end of the day we are hoping that 
is what the government has some understanding about with respect 
to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member expand on that in terms of indicating what 
he understands the motion to be doing and, if there is honourable 
intent on the government's side, what it intends by the motion as 
well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be very happy to 
expand on that.  A number of Indian bands have extensive holdings 
and generate substantial revenues from those holdings.  I commend 
them for the application of their expertise, their knowledge and 
understanding to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of it comes from natural resources, from the application of 
the enterprise in terms of business ventures, and from the 
ownership, development and administration of financial 
institutions.  All these are examples of where substantial 
revenues can be generated and are generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy for these groups to recognize the source of the 
revenue and the expenses associated with those kinds of 
enterprises.  That is not difficult.  Many of them are 
incorporated as separate and individual entities under the 
particular band council.  It is not difficult to keep them 
separate unless we want to mix it up.  It can be done very 
simply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion recognizes that the same kinds of regulations and 
laws which govern the corporations we run and are involved with 
ought to apply in this case as well. When the government 
contributes funds from taxpayers it is from all of us.  It is not 
limited to a particular group.  This money comes from the public 
purse and should be accounted for in the same way as other audits 
are accounted for.  The people who pay are the people who should 
know where the money goes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to a number of speeches today and I read the 
Canadian Alliance motion which concerns the financial transfer 
arrangements between the federal government and individual 
Indian bands. It should have said aboriginal bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Canadian Alliance members would have us believe in 
presenting this motion today is that they are truly concerned 
about the effectiveness of the mechanism the government has set 
up to ensure the follow up of funds transferred to aboriginal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to have us admit that they simply believe it is 
inappropriate for aboriginal peoples to be funded jointly by the 
private and public sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get right to the problem.  We should look instead at the 
ability of the majority of the first nations to provide an 
accounting, be they the James Bay Cree, the Nunavik Inuit and 
aboriginal peoples across Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut.  In 
fact, 98% of all audits done last year with aboriginal bands 
were submitted to an independent auditor, who accepted them 
without restriction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we look very closely, we can get to the real problem. 
Today, they are talking about a financial audit, but they have 
opposed the economic development of aboriginal peoples in Canada 
since the start. 
They are either against the economic development of the James 
Bay Cree, the Inuit of Nunavik or Nunavut, or against certain 
Indian bands in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they should do is move a motion telling the government what 
it could do for aboriginal housing in Canada.  The Canadian 
Alliance is calling for audits but does not want the private 
sector involved with aboriginals.  If we look at housing, 
just for the James Bay Cree and the James Bay agreement, there 
is currently a shortage of 2,000 houses.  Nothing is heard about 
this.  The Canadian Alliance members go to standing committees 
but say nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, Quebec's first nations, whether James Bay Cree or the 
Inuit of Nunavik, are taking charge of their own affairs.  They 
are doing good reports and managing their affairs well. 
Companies like Air Creebec, First Air and Air Inuit are 
examples showing that things are really going very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the economic development of Canada's first 
nations—this is what it is important to know, and this is what 
the Canadian Alliance is not saying—we are going to look after 
the health, housing and shipment of food to northern communities 
only accessible by airplane.  Canada's first nations are 
contributing to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, when an aboriginal person receives $1, 97 cents goes back 
south to buy a number of things. There is the example of the 
nine Cree communities of James Bay.  Everything comes from the 
south.  The Canadian Alliance never speaks about the 
transfer between aboriginals and non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their motion, they are calling for immediate audits. 
Aboriginals would say “by the next moon”.  Well, the next moon 
has come and gone.  We will have to wait until next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing the members of the Canadian Alliance ought to 
understand, and that is the necessity to be concerned about the 
economic development of the aboriginal peoples, the Cree or 
Inuit of Canada.  We know that at present the aboriginal 
communities have access to changing economic development 
programs that are for the most part administered at a distance. 
I must emphasize that they are administered at a distance from 
government offices, by public servants.  They have to make their 
development projects fit criteria that have been defined by 
outside authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs were closed 
down completely this very day and the public servants were sent 
out into each and every aboriginal and Inuit community, the 
change would be evident.  That is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of our departments need to be monitored, 
whether they are in Ottawa, Toronto or Quebec City. 
To give one example, in lower town Quebec City there are 118 
federal Indian and northern affairs employees who look after the 
aboriginal people of Quebec.  They are rarely seen.  There is 
the occasional meeting but half of these people ought to be out 
in the communities.  They ought to be in the aboriginal 
communities of Quebec, in the James Bay, Chibougamau or Nunavik, 
but they travel there just when the time is right for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be noted however is that the aboriginal people of 
Canada are good administrators.  The members of the Canadian 
Alliance ought to find a means of working with the government to 
improve the situation of our aboriginal and Inuit friends.  They 
could try to find more funding for housing for Canada's native 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mention of housing cannot help but lead to a discussion of 
social problems.  For example, a two bedroom house in Nunavut, 
Nunavik or in many of the James Bay Cree communities will be 
occupied by 18, 20, 21 or 22 persons, while the same sized 
accommodation in Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City or even Val-d'Or 
will be home to four persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is due to the fact that the government does not consider 
aboriginals like homeless people in their communities, since 
aboriginals have the decency to invite families that do not have 
a home. They invite them during the winter. In the summertime, 
they go fishing or hunting. Whether it is Inuit or Cree people, 
the story is the same. During the winter, our Inuit and Cree 
friends invite other families to live with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like Canadian Alliance members, we all agree that sound 
management is necessary. Some day I would like to hear them 
talk about the way to co-operate with our aboriginal friends, who 
buy all their staples and food in southern communities, whether 
it is in Chibougamau, Val-d'Or or Montreal. All governments 
should contribute to the transportation of food by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will support the motion but somewhat reluctantly. As my 
friend from the Bloc Quebecois says, I will support it but I 
will do no more than that. The Canadian Alliance did not choose 
the proper words today to help our aboriginal and Inuit friends. 
We must find solutions together because we know that social 
problems exist in these isolated communities where there are no 
roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to help our friends, we should look at the 
report of the Cree-Naskapi commission—which was published in three 
languages—where it says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A treaty implementation secretariat totally independent from the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development should be 
created to manage the fulfilment of the Government's obligations 
under treaties and agreements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether in the House of Commons or in committees, the report of 
the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples is not consulted 
often enough. This report proposes measures for our aboriginal 
and Inuit friends in Canada. If we truly want to co-operate with 
our friends, we should give them the possibility of directly 
managing mining, forest and fishing resources, since this would 
allow them to find ways to promote economic development and job 
creation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have in hand a letter addressed to 
the hon. member, dated June 1, 1998, when he served as chair of 
the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development.  The letter is from the assistant deputy minister 
and provides information requested by another member of the 
standing committee.  It refers to the Montana v Canada case 
wherein there was a reference to the co-mingling of funds, and 
therefore it was difficult to get full disclosure of information 
concerning the moneys transferred to different bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, as he recalls the letter, if the member was concerned 
about the nature of it in terms of issues of accountability, full 
disclosure and the divulging of how funds were used.  Does he 
feel the motion before us today addresses the issue and that we 
will be resolving the dilemma created by the Montana case?  Does 
he feel the motion before us is good in that respect and that it 
gets us past the blockage and obstruction of the Montana case? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, as we know, there will always be 
new approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in my remarks earlier is that you come with a motion 
to try to talk about all the bands— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, I should know, after 
a number of years in the House of Commons, that I have to 
address my comments to the Chair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member who has just raised a question, whether it is in 
the Montana case or in any other matter in Canada, with our 
aboriginal leaders, be it Matthew Coon Come, the chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations, Ted Moses, the grand chief of the 
James Bay Cree or Pita Aatami, of Nunavik, there will always be 
new approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Montana case, some things are not hard to understand. 
Some things are readily comprehensible, but what is important 
for us is to provide funding for aboriginal governments, to 
improve quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that I will steer well clear of this motion. 
What is important is to improve the quality of life of every 
aboriginal community in Canada.  Please make the effort.  Meet 
the leaders of these communities, and we will find solutions 
together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have another 
question for the member on a closely related matter.  Would he 
concur that with the motion before us members of bands and the 
general public, if obstructed from getting access to documents, 
would as taxpayers have access to the financial audits?  Does he 
think it would be good for taxpayers to be able, through access 
to information requests, to get an understanding of those audited 
financial statements? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, we know things are going very 
well in 95% of the aboriginal communities.  I will not however 
be voting for your motion.  I am opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would remind hon. members to kindly direct 
their comments to the Chair and not directly to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member was asking me if I was 
in agreement with the motion.  They have changed it twice today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They introduced one and then changed it with an amendment.  When 
I look at it I see there is no mention of the problems of 
our aboriginal friends in Canada.  There is no mention of the 
problems of our Inuit friends.  That is what I fault the 
Canadian Alliance for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could have gone a bit further. 
There is reference to public and private funds, to “the use of 
any  public funds” being “publicly reported”.  There will always 
be audits.  Hon. members are aware that the government always 
has access to the books, will always be on top of things and will 
always know exactly what is going on in the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be one or two examples to the contrary but at the 
present time things are going very well in the aboriginal 
communities in Quebec.  What needs to be addressed above all is 
the quality of life, improving housing and health in order to 
improve the present situation in the aboriginal communities.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the opposition motion regarding a 
financial reporting system for Canada's first nations.  I want to 
put the whole issue into the context of how the government is 
working with first nations to create good governance and stronger 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country individual community members and the Canadian 
public are looking closely at first nations as they manage and 
deliver their own programs and services.  They expect first 
nations governments to function in an accountable and effective 
way.  They expect their tax dollars to be spent responsibly.  The 
fact that most first nations manage their finances responsibly is 
a testament to both the determination of first nations to manage 
their resources well and the creation of a proper system of 
checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations management systems are becoming increasingly 
important.  Good governance brings certainty, stability and 
community well-being.  Stable and effective government creates an 
environment conducive to economic growth.  Sustainable governance 
structures and policies will ensure that first nations can manage 
economic change in an effective and responsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is working with aboriginal partners to 
create and support more stable, transparent fiscal models and 
strong accountability processes which will strengthen the 
operations of aboriginal governments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT80"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT80"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1740

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that economic development and self-sufficiency go hand 
in hand.  It is key that we agree on a vision for the country 
that includes aboriginal people as active partners in our economy 
and that we agree to build a comprehensive plan for inclusion in 
Canada's economy, from infrastructure to resources to investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A common vision and strategic plan would open up vast new 
opportunities for all of us to pursue.  One of the hallmarks of 
all of our government's policies is that economic and social 
success must be pursued together.  We cannot lead in innovation 
and ideas without ensuring that we have healthy and secure 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to good governance many first nations are leading 
by example.  They are building capacity and putting into place 
new policies and procedures, from conflict of interest guidelines 
to human resources management policies that support sustainable 
and stable governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working on a number of initiatives to develop with the 
first nations sustainable governance arrangements for aboriginal 
people that are built on legitimacy, authority and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with aboriginal people to explore financial 
issues at a national table on fiscal relations.  This initiative 
could see for the first time the creation of four first nations 
public institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the First Nations Finance Authority, FNFA, was created in 
1995 by the Westbank first nation.  Since then it has worked with 
an expanding circle of first nations to find ways and means by 
which first nations might use bonds, as do other governments, for 
access to longer term, more affordable financing.  The circle has 
benefited from its partnership with an expert in the field, the 
B.C. municipal finance authority, which can secure bond financing 
at rates lower than the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal would see the creation of a borrowing pool. 
Interested first nations may apply to be part of the borrowing 
pool and will need to demonstrate strong governance and financial 
management regimes to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation would be needed to give stability and legitimacy to 
the FNFA, and certainly to potential investors, that first 
nations have powers to borrow for these purposes.  Qualifying 
first nations could look to increase their return on debt by 33% 
to 50%, which is a strong incentive for sound financial 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the First Nations Tax Commission.  In 1988 the 
Indian Act was amended to allow interested first nations to enter 
the field of property taxation.  Since then, 83 first nations 
have put tax bylaws into place and $163 million has been 
generated for local youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change was realized through the significant efforts of 
former chief Manny Jules of the Kamloops first nation and members 
of the Indian Taxation Advisory Board, known as ITAB.  Kamloops 
first nation has borrowed against these new long term stable 
revenue streams to make its breakthrough in economic development 
for its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now being proposed that ITAB become a tax commission.  To 
do so, ITAB would assume powers held by the minister through a 
more transparent and streamlined management regime with greater 
taxpayer involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is the First Nations Financial Management Board. The 
FMB is a new organization and its initial task would be to 
provide independent management assessment services required by 
first nations seeking entry into the FNFA borrowing pool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its role, however, could grow over time as it interacts and 
consults with first nation governments and administrators, 
external experts and other governments.  It could evolve and 
build over time, much as ITAB's role has matured over past years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FMB would fulfil the need for a shared, sustained effort in 
setting standards and rethinking current accountability 
frameworks.  Its work would complement the Aboriginal Financial 
Officer Association of Canada's professional development and 
support role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there is the First Nations Statistical Institute.  As 
first nations operate more at arm's length with the Government of 
Canada, they need new statistical systems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are systems to support community decision making and 
accountability, and to relate to other levels of government. They 
are a prerequisite to developing new Canada-first nations 
transfer arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FNSI would be partnered with, but separate from, Statistics 
Canada.  This partnership would support an integrated national 
statistical system which would better meet the needs of first 
nations and Canada alike.  It would facilitate the transfer of 
knowledge, experience and tools to FNSI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are exciting and practical developments.  We expect to 
hear more about these in the months ahead as we seek the mandate 
to work toward legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also put emphasis on capacity building.  For example, 
almost all first nations communities completed accountability and 
management assessments last year, and the first ever designations 
were awarded for certified aboriginal financial managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AFOA has made great strides in fulfilling a critical need 
for well-trained financial staff supported by a strong code of 
ethics which are fundamental to good governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian and Northern Affairs Canada is also leading a major 
review of its transfer payment business process by offering 
government online.  This move would definitely improve the 
administration of transfer payments to first nations.  The new 
system would be capable of handling a wide variety of first 
nations funding arrangements.  Technology will play a major role 
in making this vision a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be full automation, full electronic access to the 
system, online reporting and electronic access to the data and 
information needed to make the system work.  The system will be 
driven by principles of transparency, disclosure and 
accountability.  All these initiatives depend on building a new 
relationship and strengthening our partnership with aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is through partnerships that we can most effectively pool our 
talents, our ideas and our resources.  It is through partnerships 
that we can make real and lasting progress.  We are addressing 
the issues and giving aboriginal people greater control over 
their own lives, and we have begun to see some positive results. 
The gap in living conditions between aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people has narrowed.  Education levels have 
improved.  Unemployment has dropped and housing conditions and 
basic infrastructure from roads to water have improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that as we try to design this new modern 
relationship with aboriginal people, we must balance the past 
with the future and meet new economic challenges.  We have our 
work cut out for us and it definitely will not happen overnight. 
However, we need to clear up some myths and misconceptions so 
that people understand that first nations people and the Inuit 
are contributing members of society and part of the broader 
Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to demonstrate that first nations government are good 
governments run on sound principles and accountable to the people 
they represent.  The measures we are developing to ensure greater 
accountability and good governance are a good start, and they are 
beginning to show real results.  They recognize that all 
Canadians have a role to play in tackling the challenges facing 
aboriginal communities.

constituents of Calgary East to speak on today's supply day 
motion sponsored by the Canadian Alliance.  I thank my colleague 
for Nanaimo—Cowichan for his excellent work in bringing this 
motion forward for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is worthwhile to restate the motion before I begin my 
comments.  The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that in all Contribution Agreements 
between the Federal Government and individual Indians Bands, the 
use of any public funds be publicly reported and audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians look at what happening on reserves and what is 
happening with our brothers and sisters from the aboriginal 
communities, there is a kind of sadness and puzzlement.  We have 
a huge amount of money being transferred to assist and to uplift 
the living standards of our brothers and sisters from the first 
nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what has gone on over the years, when we look at 
what is happening and when we look at the conditions on the 
reserves, we have to ask what is going on.  Something is not 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the speaker who just spoke before me.  She is from the 
first nations.  I commend the efforts made by the first nations 
in working to bring their communities on par with the rest of the 
Canadians.  I do not think anyone in the House would dispute what 
she said.  I would like to be on the record of saying that I 
agree with what she said today.  That is the essence of the 
debate is here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking that all the public moneys that are 
transferred to the first nation bands be accounted for and be 
publicly reported and audited.  The purpose is very simple. There 
has to be transparency and accountability.  Without that we know 
there is a tendency to misuse funds.  There is a tendency to 
maybe allocate funds to programs which may not be universally 
accessible to the communities or maybe even directed toward a 
smaller number.  These are things that happen when there is no 
accountability and no transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion in no way states that we, the Canadian Alliance 
members, do not have confidence in the first nations to run their 
affairs.  We are very positive they have the confidence to do so. 
We are positive they can take destiny in their own hands, address 
these issues, move ahead and become part and parcel of the 
multicultural mosaic.  We are rated the number one country in the 
world, yet when we look at what is happening on the reserves and 
with the first nations, we pause, we stand, we shake our heads 
and say that there is something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speakers have highlighted ways and means that we can address 
these issues.  It is time to address this issue.  We cannot let 
this injustice carry on, not in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the the problem?  The problem is not money, obviously. 
The total amount of money that is spent by the Indian affairs 
department on reserves is close to $20,000 for every individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The delivery of the programs and where the money has been spent 
is an issue.  I do not think we are going to stand up and start 
accusing people about where this money is going or that it has 
been misused.  The motion states that the funds should be 
publicly reported and audited.  We are asking for accountability 
and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders of the bands have a responsibility to be accountable 
and transparent.  They cannot hide behind the fact that because 
they are leaders they are accountable to no one and that if the 
funds come to them they can go ahead and do whatever with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations are people of Canada as well.  The funds are 
going to help them.  When we look at fellow Canadians living in 
conditions which are deplorable, then we absolutely have every 
right to ask why is this happening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the occasion to talk to many members of the first 
nations.  A lot have stated that many in their reserves are doing 
very well.  I commend those who are.  I met many individuals from 
first nations who are extremely wealthy.  They are are seizing 
the opportunities that are presented and are moving ahead.  This 
makes us happy because they are our citizens. That is what we 
want.  We want our brothers and sisters from first nations to 
share in the wealth, to share in the prosperity and to share in 
the future that I hope this nation collectively presents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the members across, who are from first nations, say that 
they are part and parcel of Canada.  They are Canadian citizens. 
We should ask ourselves why can our follow citizens not grab the 
opportunities?  Why are they not part and parcel of the same 
mosaic that everybody else is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we should start somewhere and this motion is a start. 
Asking for accountability does not mean that at the end of the 
day it will solve all the problems which are occurring.  However, 
it is a start and we need to carry on.  This is what we as 
parliamentarians are doing tonight.  We have a voice and a say 
because these are public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I neglected to say, Mr. Speaker, that I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague from Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am pleased to state that I am supporting this 
motion.  I know, at the end of the day, it will help my my fellow 
Canadians get out of the deplorable situation which some of them 
are in.  It will help them become equal partners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the business 
of supply proposed by my Canadian Alliance colleague, the member 
of parliament for Nanaimo—Cowichan, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government stipulate that in all Contribution Agreements 
between the Federal Government and individual Indian Bands, the 
use of any public funds be publicly reported and accurately 
audited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is important in that it asks the government to 
ensure that the amount and use of public funds by an Indian band 
are accurately accounted for and those details made available to 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem like a normal request but it is not.  Currently 
Indian band books are exempt from requests under the Access to 
Information Act.  Members of parliament or any other member of 
the public cannot request a band to account for the spending 
decisions they made with taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, if passed, would dramatically change the way Indian 
bands handle their public funding.  This would mean a positive 
change for the individual band members and an end to the 
potential for corruption which currently exists.  I am not saying 
that every band council in Canada is corrupt.  On the contrary, I 
am saying that the system is currently set up to allow for, and 
some would say foster, that kind of endeavour.  This motion 
ensures clear accounting and auditing of public funds used by 
Indian bands.  This should be the norm, but it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a bit about accountability, a word that in today's 
society is sometimes less valued than it should be.  To be held 
accountable for one's action should be the norm in society. 
Whether we are talking about a government, a corporation or a 
member of the general public, we must all be accountable for our 
actions.  When it comes to the public trust, and as such, public 
funds, accountability means much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to government spending, the public and members of 
parliament have access to the public accounts report generated 
each year on the spending of each federal government department. 
This report is generated to ensure spending accountability by 
each department. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the opposition I will say that we still do find 
fault with some parts of government spending, but at least we 
have the ability to review the spending and call the government 
to task on it.  In the case of Indian bands we do not and that is 
the crux of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, a standing committee of the House can call any 
minister to its meeting to be held accountable for spending 
within his or her department.  This is a process which begins 
very soon with part III of the estimates being tabled in the 
House in April.  We do not have this kind of access to the 
spending intentions of Indian bands.  Since public funds are 
being used, we should have that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite simple.  An open, accountable process to review and 
audit the spending of public funds by Indian bands ensures the 
reduction, if not elimination, of abuse.  That is an endeavour I 
strongly support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask why does the public need to make Indian bands 
accountable for their spending and to ensure that accurate 
auditing takes place.  Should we not just trust that funding as 
being put to good use and that the individual band members would 
ensure their band council which receives the federal funding 
spends this money wisely? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is basically what the federal government has been doing, 
and individual band members will tell members themselves the 
system does not work.  There are cases where band councils hold 
open meetings and ensure that band members are advised of and 
agree to their spending priorities.  Unfortunately it is those 
band councils that do not subscribe to such an open process that 
have abused the system.  That necessitates the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned for the members of those Indian bands when I say 
that the system does not work and needs to be changed.  Open and 
accurate accounting and auditing of federal funds would force 
band councils to spend their federal dollars on items deemed a 
priority to the entire band and its members, and not just those 
of the band council, its chief or other individual members.  Such 
openness would ensure that the department would be held 
accountable if it continued to fund Indian bands which have a 
history of misusing their funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation faced by Indian band members on reserves in many 
cases is deplorable.  Driving through some reserves we find 
absolutely terrible housing conditions tremendously below 
national standards.  It may surprise some to know that one-third 
of aboriginal people on reserves live in overcrowded conditions, 
that 50% of aboriginal children live in poverty, and that the 
infant mortality rate is twice as high for aboriginal children 
and three times as high for Inuit than for other Canadian 
children.  This is a nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, alcoholism, suicide, illness and crime rates are 
three times higher than for non-aboriginal people.  It is 
deplorable, and yet with all the funding the federal government 
sends to Indian bands on reserves to try to curb these problems, 
to address these concerns it still persists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is a fact that 25% of Canada's aboriginal bands are 
being run under remedial management plans, with a combined debt 
of just over $139 million.  A survey of 300 band councils done by 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development found 
that the most common problem was a lack of control on conflict of 
interest.  This is incredible.  Yet just over $18 billion was 
spent on aboriginal specific programming over the fiscal years 
1997 to 2000 from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and other departments to create a myriad of programs 
exclusively to remedy this situation, but to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must ask if the government really believes that sending more 
money without the needed accountability will solve this problem. 
I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the House may wonder why I am so passionate about 
this issue.  They probably think my only concern is the public 
purse.  To that I say that in my riding of Skeena there are some 
32 reserves, with a total population of just over 30,000 people. 
As their elected member of parliament I have a responsibility to 
ensure that their concerns and interests are met, along with 
those of the rest of the population of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end an ongoing overall level of accountability from 
elected on reserve representatives is paramount.  I am supporting 
the motion because I truly believe it will make a difference, not 
only to those 30,000 constituents of mine but to the many 
hundreds of thousands of band members living on reserves 
throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to the individual band members, the ones coming to us 
complaining about the system, wanting change, to do just that. We 
must institute positive and needed change, as well as 
accountability where there previously was none. 
This can make an enormous difference in the lives of everyday 
aboriginal people living on reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have a huge problem on some of our reserves.  Let us 
take this opportunity, in the House, with this motion to make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members, particularly Liberal members, to support the

only help.  I urge members to join the Canadian Alliance in 
supporting the motion that is truly in the best interest of band 
members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the hon. member to 
respond to a question that occurred to me based on some remarks 
that were made by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that one way in which the government avoids 
having to enforce accountability measures in its dealing with 
bands is by not collecting information on allegations and then 
referring back to it so it can learn from specific cases.  In 
other words, we need to learn from history or we will repeat the 
same mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said that the department does not have a 
national reporting system to help process the allegations.  It 
does not have an overall picture of the nature and the frequency 
of the allegations that show the ultimate disposition, the 
conditions leading to the allegations and the areas of high and 
low risk within and among different Indian bands and their impact 
on accountability and funding arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made a request for information on 
allegations to various regional offices around the country.  One 
of the regional offices responded that it did not know how many 
allegations it had received during the past two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for members of the House to say that there are really 
no problems, but if there is no reporting and regional offices 
say that they do not know how many allegations there are, it is 
easy to say there are no problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member feel it to be a good thing, as the auditor 
general infers, to have a listing and a proper process whereby we 
know the ultimate disposition of these cases, the conditions 
leading to the allegations, the areas of high and low risk and so 
on, and the impact on accountability and funding arrangements? 
Would he agree with the inferences of the auditor general that we 
need something like that so that we can catalogue and learn from 
history so we do not repeat these mistakes and Indian people 
would be better served all across Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously there are a 
number of flaws in the system and questions like that are not 
being properly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my riding the previous member received many letters 
from various concerned groups.  It happens right across Canada. 
Our party is aware of a lot of these problems.  Through proper 
accounting and proper auditing processes, many of these problems 
will definitely be highlighted and will possibly be dealt with in 
a better manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree that the government should institute some kind 
of official reporting process so that when these problems occur 
they can be documented and dealt with.  Possibly, when funding is 
being allocated to the various groups, these concerns would be 
taken into account and dealt with so that there would be proper 
accountability all the way down the line.  In this way, dollars 
would be properly spent and would go toward the programs for 
which they were earmarked. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have for some time had an 
interest in charities and the transparency and accountability of 
non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago, I did an examination of the T3010 tax returns of 
all kinds of charities to see how vigilant Revenue Canada was in 
examining these returns.  These returns require charities to 
identify the revenues, how much they are paying individuals, how 
much in donations and so forth.  They are quite elaborate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got returns from all kinds of charities:  ethnic groups, 
churches, service organizations and, I should say, aboriginal 
friendship societies.  In surveying these returns, I did find 
mistakes and errors.  I compared these returns with the financial 
reports of the charities themselves and found all kinds of 
inconsistencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the aboriginal friendship groups, what I found is that 
these T-3010 returns to Revenue Canada were completely blank. 
They were sent in and properly addressed to Revenue Canada, but 
there was not a single line filled out.  Obviously this had been 
going on for some time and I had to ask myself the question:  is 
the fact that these official returns to Revenue Canada, the fact 
that they are blank and not checked, is it because they are being 
sent in by aboriginals and are they blank because the aboriginals 
know when they send them in that they will not be checked? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises a very serious question about whether Revenue Canada, 
on the one side, and the aboriginals who are responsible for 
sending these returns in for these friendship societies, on the 
other, whether they had both decided that because we were dealing 
with aboriginals, a less high standard of accountability was 
expected of them.  In fact it was ludicrous because, as I say, 
these returns were completely blank so no accountability was 
required at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later I became a member of the aboriginal affairs committee and 
I spent several years as a committee member hearing of the 
problems on the various reserves around the country.  Then it 
became very apparent that in regard to many of the reserves that 
were in trouble, the trouble revolved around the fact that 
government money was going into these reserves and was not being 
spent on the programs.  It also became very clear that for years 
earlier, decades earlier, governments had not expected or 
required of aboriginal groups to meet the same standards of 
transparency and accountability in their financial management as 
they would require of just about any other group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a clear example in my mind of the kind of evil 
paternalism—and I really mean that—it is an evil paternalism 
that sets people aside by race and lowers the expectations of 
them.  I see no distinction between what has happened to our 
aboriginal communities because we as a parliament have required 
less of them than what has happened with the residential schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a motion which I believe is going to be 
matched by legislation from the Indian and northern affairs 
minister that is long, long overdue.  On all sides of the House 
we should support the legislation because at last we are saying 
to our aboriginal brothers, shall we say, “You are just like us. 
You are one of us”.  But, Mr. Speaker, what we have been doing 
for so long is we have been willing to give them self-government. 
We have been willing to give them the benefit of control over 
large tracts of land, but we have not given them the same 
responsibility that we expect of everyone else.  This has to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that this motion which simply requires of aboriginal 
communities to meet the same standards of financial transparency, 
to submit to audit, that we would expect of any municipality, 
that we would expect of any corporation, of any charity—what we 
certainly should expect of a charity—we should expect of 
aboriginal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do believe that this is one time in which we are very 
much all on the same wavelength in the House.  I do not know 
whether the motion will be supported unanimously, but, Mr. 
Speaker, you can be darn certain that I will be voting for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 6.15 p.m., it is my duty to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising today to speak to a question I asked on 
February 28 with regard to dealing with trade issues in the sugar 
industry.  As we all know, the upcoming summit of the Americas 
conference to be held in Quebec City will be important to many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament for Lethbridge, Alberta, agriculture 
is a vital industry to my constituents.  The sugar beet industry 
is a large part of that agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta sugar beet growers and the Canadian Sugar Institute 
are very concerned about the upcoming meetings, particularly with 
regard to agreements with Central American countries.  They are 
worried about the minor tariff that protects Canada's domestic 
refined sugar industry from outside takeover.  They are worried 
that this tariff may be lifted during bargaining and used as a 
lever in sealing a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned that any bilateral agreement with Central 
American countries would disadvantage our sugar industry.  They 
are concerned that an agreement would provide no meaningful 
export opportunity for them and would actually expose Canadian 
producers to trade distorting imports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exports of both raw and refined sugar from the C-4 countries 
totalled 1.7 million tonnes in 1999.  Those countries have a huge 
surplus waiting to pour into our already well served domestic 
sugar market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada already has the most open sugar market in the world.  It 
should not be pressured into making further concessions while 
other countries intervene in their own markets and transfer those 
distortions on to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada already imports nearly half the sugar shipped into North 
America annually.  The Canadian sugar industry is already 
competing with imports of refined sugar from Central America and 
the imports are growing at a rapid and alarming rate.  Any deal 
that would see the Canadian tariff lifted would worsen the 
current imbalance in sugar policies, intensifying the competition 
in the Canadian market while not providing a reciprocal market 
for Canada in Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any reduction or elimination of Canada's most favoured nation 
tariff on refined sugar threatens the viability of Canada's cane 
sugar refining and sugar beet industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian cane sugar refining and sugar beet processing 
industry has made recent capital investments in excess of $150 
million.  In the context of the current international trade 
environment, the way the trade system is now, if the most 
favoured nation tariff is removed it would threaten the viability 
of our industry's investments.  I need to stress that merely a 
fraction of current exports waiting to flood in from Central 
America would threaten the closure of Canadian refineries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While paying a visit to my constituency, the Prime Minister's 
task force on western Canada promised the Alberta Sugar Beet 
Growers Association that sugar would not be traded off again. 
Will the government live up to that promise and guarantee sugar 
beet farmers and all of Canada's sugar industry that their 
livelihoods will not be put in jeopardy at the upcoming summit?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada is aware of the 
concerns of the Canadian sugar industry with respect to the 
ongoing negotiations with Costa Rica and has consulted with the 
industry extensively.  We are committed to a process of full 
consultation and we will take into account these concerns as we 
seek to conclude negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is also aware of the obstacles facing 
the Canadian sugar industry in the global market, and in 
particular, the uneven playing field created by the existing 
trade distorting sugar policies.  Canada will continue to be 
vigilant in pursuing a stabilization of this market through the 
removal of trade distorting domestic support in the context of 
the ongoing World Trade Association negotiations on agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the status of negotiations with Costa Rica, the last 
round of negotiations took place from February 19 to 23 of this 
year.  The talks were productive and the discussions were 
especially helpful in terms of better understanding each 
country's particular sensitivities.  Minister Pettigrew also had 
the opportunity to review the status of the negotiations in a 
recent meeting with the Costa Rican trade minister.  Some key 
issues still have to be resolved, including the area of market 
access, and we will continue to seek an agreement that meets 
Canada's interests.  Negotiators will meet again shortly to 
revisit the outstanding issues and see how negotiations can move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's overall objective in the Canada-Costa Rica FTA 
negotiations is to eliminate tariffs on key Canadian exports and 
to secure preferential access for Canadian businesses to the 
Costa Rican market.  Last year we exported to Costa Rica $102.9 
million worth of goods and we imported $176.1 million worth of 
goods.  Costa Rica has one of the most dynamic economies in 
Central America and we see room for growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also striving to establish a comprehensive framework 
on the competition policy that will serve as a model for the 
region, as well as to make trade procedures more efficient in 
order to reduce delays and formalities for Canadian businesses. 
Side agreements to address labour and environmental issues are 
also being pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a broader perspective, a free trade agreement with Costa 
Rica would deepen Canada's bilateral relationship at all levels 
with this dynamic Central American country and signal Canada's 
continued commitment to the hemisphere, a commitment which 
includes the creation of a free trade area of the Americas by 
2005.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans concerning 
cutbacks to the coast guard services in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  The minister's department has 
announced that it is going to be scaling back coast guard 
services in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised the question with the minister, he basically said 
that it was all part of consolidation and consolidation was going 
to give us better service, so that instead of cutting back on the 
service to the province, the department was really enhancing 
coast guard services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a province with a coast line such as Newfoundland has, when 
we reduce an already diminished service by taking away a search 
and rescue vessel, by taking away one helicopter, I find it very 
hard to understand how we are going to improve service.  Some 
people may ask “What is one helicopter?”  However, by taking 
away one helicopter, the fleet has been reduced by 50%.  We had 
four.  One crashed a while ago.  Now they are taking away one 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also going to take away the manning of 11 
lighthouses so we will have another 11 automatic lighthouses in 
the province.  As well, it is going to back away from involvement 
in the freeing of whales that get caught up in cod traps in 
particular and in other fishing gear around the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And this is improved service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Yes, and this is improved service.  The 
minister tries to tell us that this is going to improve our 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that, a certain amount of the maintenance work was 
done in the yards in Stephenville, an area where work has been 
reduced significantly over the years.  Ever since the closing of 
the base, that area has been just hammered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments should try to help wherever they can and add to the 
employment potential in the area such as Stephenville.  They are 
taking away services that are badly needed, and of course other 
services being provided within St. John's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by people involved in the whale industry that there 
were services being provided to help free whales, but they 
depended upon the back up of the coast guard.  If this service is 
taken away, its services certainly are not going to be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To everybody's chagrin across the country, last week three young 
people fell off ice pans in the town of Pouch Cove in 
Newfoundland.  The coast guard was involved.  Along with the 
co-ordination of the RNC, the RCMP and the local people, the 
coast guard quickly found one of the bodies.  However, for two or 
three days the coast guard was searching for the others and the 
local people were asked to stay out of it.  Finally, the 
knowledge that local people know best took over and the fishermen 
put out their small boats, despite rough seas and stormy weather. 
They were the ones who found the two bodies that had not been 
recovered at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was great to know that the coast guard vessels were there for 
protection and enhancement.  Had one of those vessels been 
reduced, it might have meant a boat which was badly needed at 
that time would not have been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting to the period of the year when we go into the 
seal fishery.  All around the coast of Newfoundland, particularly 
the north-northeast coast, we have fisherman prosecuting the seal 
fishery in small boats.  Consequently, it is this time of year 
that the protection of the coast guard is used quite often and is 
badly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go on all night with examples.  However, I fail to see how 
a cutback in services like this enhances the protection of the 
people of Newfoundland. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the hon. member's interest in the management of marine safety, 
service and protection of the marine environment, particularly as 
it is carried out by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in 
the Newfoundland region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian coast guard Newfoundland region's renewal plan is 
an example of good management of public funds to produce 
essential services for Canadians in an effective and cost 
efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an overall resource reduction exercise.  This plan 
was developed over a number of months by the regional coast guard 
management team to identify inefficiencies and to redirect 
funding to higher and emerging priorities within the Newfoundland 
region.  These reallocations are made possible by the coast 
guard's continuing commitment to utilize modern technology and 
management in order to maintain and enhance service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as a result of this exploitation of new technology, 
the coast guard has added approximately 600 new navigational aids 
to the marine safety system in Newfoundland and Labrador.  It has 
also added lights to all of the remaining unlighted buoys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the essential search and rescue services provided 
to Canadians by the men and women of the coast guard, I am 
pleased to remind the hon. member that the government last year 
allocated an additional $115 million to marine search and rescue 
in Canada.  Part of this new money will find improvements in the 
search and rescue system in Newfoundland.  Two new, modern, high 
speed lifeboats will be added to the Newfoundland region and 
stationed on the west coast of the island.  This will enhance the 
coast guard's ability to provide search and rescue services in 
the area.  Established service levels will be maintained in other 
areas of the region by using other vessels in the regional coast 
guard fleet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coast guard is committed to the well-being of its employees 
and to ensuring that they have the necessary modern equipment, 
skills and training to maintain the high level of services they 
provide to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An integral part of the regional renewal strategy is the 
reinvestment of savings into staff training and development and 
equipment replacement and maintenance.  I am also pleased to 
report that these changes being made in the Newfoundland region 
will not result in the involuntary layoff of any indeterminate 
staff.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also anticipated that many temporary employees who lose 
their current employment may well have future employment 
opportunities with the coast guard as retirements and the normal 
turnover of existing staff take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Canadian Coast Guard's renewal plan in 
Newfoundland and Labrador is good news for Canadians in general 
and particularly for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.  The 
services of the coast guard are not only being maintained but in 
many cases are being enhanced.  Mariners can continue to rely on 
the women and men of the coast guard and the important services 
they deliver, and know that they will be there when needed to

part of our day there are still time restrictions.  I was very 
generous tonight with the two minute limit because only two 
questions were raised.  However I hope the message would be 
passed on to those able to effect changes so responses could be 
fully given without interruption from the Chair.
