    </p><a name="Para457607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill S-213, an act to amend the Criminal Code dealing with cruelty to animals is one of two bills before the House dealing with cruelty to animals. It is a Senate bill that was introduced in the House on December 11, 2006, following its approval in the Senate on December 7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator John Bryden prepared this legislation and has had the support of many of his colleagues. Today at second reading I am asking for the support of this assembly to refer Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> to the justice committee for review and recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has had a close relationship with animals, with nature and with the environment. Evidently all was not perfect and, as a result, Canadian legislators, more than 100 years ago, saw the need to develop sections of the Criminal Code to take particular individuals who would abuse, mismanage or neglect animals to court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we continue to hear reports of persons who cause undue harm to animals and of persons who are injured or killed by them. Today, there are press reports of a keeper at a zoo in the United States who was killed by a jaguar.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipalities, provinces and the federal government are called upon to legislate and regulate definite standards that we must follow with regard to our relationship with animals. In this debate, we must think in terms of both domestic and wild or natural animals, which are usually the responsibility of the provinces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic animals, whether household or farm related, have close ties with their owners. Owners are expected to provide food, shelter and protection. This is an expensive business and owners are usually prepared to spend a significant amount of income on their so-called pets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our urban areas, this ownership and related care is a fast growing industry, with food, grooming and veterinary costs, yet in cities and in urban areas we have problems with pets that often are large and sometimes do things in the environment that cause problems for our sewage and drainage systems. We see problems related to that activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rural Canada, animals offer similar enjoyment to their household owners, but most are managed to provide food and clothing or to do work for their owners. Also, our cities and rural areas have wild animals that live naturally without our help. Our heritage is reflected by the beaver, which helped explore our continent, and the polar bear, which symbolizes our present struggle with the environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, too, we must not forget the medical and scientific community, those researchers who use animals to study the health of mammals and our biological connections to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>, does not attempt to define standards by which owners or participants in relations with animals are judged. Rather, it is presented as an amendment to present legislation that will increase penalties on those considered by our society as abusing animals. It is a common sense approach to a standard of acceptable behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly there are those who want us to go further. However, it appears that there has been difficulty in reaching a consensus on developing explicit legislation. For example, there are concerns that certain pets are dangerous to the security of others; concerns with the killing of animals by hunters and especially aboriginal peoples in northern and remote communities; the assessing of farming operations; the confinement of animals at farms, in zoos or with the circus type of presentations; the monitoring of horse racing; the utilization of animals by university and scientific researchers; and above all, the elimination of pests in both urban and rural settings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on. It is within the context of this debate that I offer to present Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> to the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> is to update the penalty provisions dealing with animal cruelty within the Criminal Code. In summary, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> amends sections 444 to 447 of the Criminal Code by making all animal cruelty offences hybrid offences, meaning that prosecutors can choose, based on the determination of the seriousness of the offence, whether to pursue an indictment or summary conviction in a particular case. Previously, sections 445 to 447 were punishable only by summary conviction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> also increases the maximum penalties. For offences of cruelty, the maximum penalties under summary convictions are increased to be a sentence of 18 months in prison and/or a fine of up to $10,000. For offences of neglect, the maximums are changed to a six month prison term and a $5,000 fine. In comparison, depending on the seriousness of the charge, those guilty of an indictable offence can be charged with either a term of up to five years in prison for cruelty offences or a term of up to two years in prison for offences of neglect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> also makes two other changes to the Criminal Code. Under proposed subsection 447.1(1) it adds an order of prohibition and restitution. It allows the court to prohibit an offender from owning, having custody of, or residing with an animal for a period of time of any length or permanently, whereas the maximum now is only two years. As well, the accused may be ordered to pay any related costs for the care of an animal when it is under the care of another person or organization as a result of the commission of an offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have presented a brief description of this bill, I wish to address its place within the history of animal cruelty bills debated in this House. Amendments to the Criminal Code on cruelty to animals were introduced in December 1999 as part of an omnibus bill aimed to amend the Criminal Code. This was Bill C-17. After it died on the order paper, a similar bill, Bill C-15, was introduced in March 2001, but upon being referred to committee, this bill was split into two sections. Bill C-15B became an act to amend the Criminal Code (cruelty to animals) and the firearms act. However, it too died when Parliament was prorogued in October 2002.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-15B was later reintroduced as Bill C-10. Approved in this House, it reached the Senate committee for consideration and again the bill was split, this time to an act to amend the farms act, Bill C-10A, and an act to amend the Criminal Code (cruelty to animals), Bill C-10B. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10B was the birth of the first bill solely dedicated to animal cruelty amendments. This bill, however, also eventually died on the order paper, as did its successors, Bill C-22 and Bill C-50. It is clear to see that the animal cruelty bills of the past have been victims of serious reservations and timings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These attempts to amend animal cruelty legislation have been subject to considerable debate. Throughout this evolution, numerous stakeholders have been consistently critical of the proposed amendments pertaining to the substance of the bills and the nature of the offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that the only consensus that has been drawn around the animal cruelty provisions in the Criminal Code was in regard to the proposed changes to the punishment for offences. These recommendations have remained virtually consistent throughout the different reincarnations of the animal cruelty bills. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> is a replication of these penalty amendments. It attempts to change nothing in the Criminal Code. It does not attempt to redefine animal cruelty or to make new offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the opposition to the bills previously studied in the House of Commons and the Senate, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> attempts to simplify the issue and focuses animal cruelty legislation on penalties. It does this in order to amend legislation that was first enacted in 1892. These penalties were consented to in recently defeated legislation. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> therefore responds to the demands to update Canadian law in accordance with public opinion on the seriousness of crimes of animal cruelty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been several stated reasons for changing the animal cruelty provisions of the Criminal Code. First, the current penalties fail to reflect the seriousness of the crimes against animals. Second, the prohibition on offenders owning animals needs to be extended and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> enables the court to place a permanent ban on ownership. Third, the court will be granted the means of ordering an offender to pay for the care needed for an animal as a consequence of an offence. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, in response to this impetus for change, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> includes all of these in the amendments. This bill will update the Canadian Criminal Code in response to the desire to offer more protection to animals and to increase the power of prosecutors to advocate stronger punishments. It will ensure that crimes of animal cruelty will be taken more seriously, as they should be. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> recognizes that changes to the penalty provisions are needed at present.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny that there may be opposition to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>. Some critics contend that this bill does not afford animals enough rights, but what those critics may not so readily admit is that the reason many of the previous bills did not pass is that they potentially disrespected the rights of those dependent on animals for their livelihood. Farmers, university and scientific researchers, aboriginal peoples, and fishers and hunters have all had serious concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue at stake, therefore, is that legal implications of changes beyond those in the penalty provisions are uncertain. Previous attempts to redefine offences of cruelty against animals have been interpreted by various stakeholders to threaten the legalities of animal use. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indications are that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> has wide-ranging support. Public support for this bill has been expressed by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, the Canadian Federation of Biological Societies, wildlife federations and recreational associations from all 12 provinces. They have all indicated support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By not proposing amendments beyond the penalty provisions, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> ensures that what is legal today would remain legal tomorrow.

However, amidst the debate on the matter of animal cruelty, these issues have been clouded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently in this House and in the media the issue of animal cruelty has been getting more attention, but let us question what the issue really is. Our laws need to be improved. Penalties need to be increased. It is very important that the animals within our society receive proper care, proper protection and proper concern by our legislators.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that in the past few years there have been many heinous crimes committed against animals. I am thinking in particular of the growing interest in cockfights. I also understand that now there are scheduled arena events between pit bulls. There are puppy mills.

I would hope that as society progresses we will see the termination of such things as puppy mills. Cockfights certainly have been prohibited by Canadian legislation for a long period of time. I know there are concerns about certain dogs. I have not heard not much about the so-called dogfights, but I know that certain dogs certainly are a menace to some people in society. I know that certain municipalities are attempting to control the fact that some of these dogs may be at large.</div>

It does not create new offences or modify existing ones. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Criminal Code provides a number of distinct animal cruelty offences. Some offences prohibit very specific forms of conduct and others are more general in nature. They include: wilfully killing, maiming, wounding, injuring or endangering cattle; wilfully killing, maiming, wounding, injuring or endangering animals other than cattle which are kept for lawful purpose; wilfully causing unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal; causing unnecessary pain to an animal by failure to exercise reasonable care; abandoning an animal in distress; baiting an animal; injuring an animal during transport; releasing a bird from captivity for the purpose of shooting it immediately upon its release; neglecting to provide adequate food, water and shelter or care to an animal; and keeping a cock pit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two most frequently charged offences are those of wilfully causing unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal and causing pain, suffering or injury by neglect. These types of actions are in fact what most Canadians think of when they think about animal cruelty. Cruelty can be intentional, meaning the result of conduct that a person knows will or would likely cause harm, or it can be the result of gross negligence, severe inadvertence or just plain indifference to the potential suffering of an animal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to maximum available penalties, all offences, except those in respect of cattle, are summary conviction offences only. This means that the maximum sentence that an offender can get is six months in prison, a $2,000 fine or both. This maximum applies no matter how heinous the act of cruelty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, offences in respect of cattle are pure indictable offences and subject to a maximum of five years imprisonment. One question raised by the law and addressed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> is whether this distinction is still justified. I will return to this point shortly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code also contains what is called a prohibition order. This mechanism allows a judge to order a convicted offender to refrain from owning an animal for up to two years. Prohibition orders are not just meant to punish. They are mostly preventative. They actually work to keep animals away from animal abusers. In this way, they are aimed primarily at preventing future cruelty toward animals. Prohibition orders are actually imposed relatively often in animal cruelty cases. The courts clearly feel that the prohibition order is a valuable tool at their disposal in dealing with people who abuse animals.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> appears to propose three changes to the current animal cruelty regime, all in the nature of penalty enhancements. All the measures address concerns that have been identified with the existing law. Concerns with the law can be clearly and simply stated: the penalties are too weak to deter and punish animal abuse. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> responds to this concern. No reasonable person would disagree that a maximum sentence of six months for even the worst case is inadequate and trivializes animal cruelty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is strong agreement across all sectors that the low maximum penalties for cruelty are both inadequate to denounce animal cruelty as acceptable and to punish acts of cruelty when they do occur.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to this concern, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> would amend the sections of the Criminal Code that set out the various offences of animal cruelty and describe the maximum penalties for those offences. It accomplishes its objective in the following three ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> increases maximum terms of imprisonment. To do this, Bill S-213 makes all offences hybrid, meaning that the prosecution may choose to proceed by way of summary conviction or by way of indictment, depending on the seriousness of the case. Currently, all the offences, except those in relation to cattle, are straight summary conviction offences. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> would then separate offences into two categories: first, for injuring animals intentionally and, second, for injuring animals by criminal neglect. This is an important distinction. Some people commit cruelty on purpose and others commit cruelty not on purpose but rather by extreme neglect. Under traditional criminal principles, knowingly or intentionally doing something is more blameworthy than doing the same thing by gross inadvertence. Accordingly, the maximum available penalties are normally much higher for crimes that involve deliberate action than for crimes committed by negligence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current six month maximum applies to cruelty committed by neglect as well as cruelty committed intentionally. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> would address this by distinguishing between the two types of cruelty. Bill S-213 would assign different maximum penalties to each, according to the different degree of seriousness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the new category of offences that require intention or recklessness, the maximum term of imprisonment would be increased to 5 years on indictment and 18 months on summary conviction. The new 5 year penalty would also cover the offence of causing pain, suffering or injury by a failure to exercise reasonable care or supervision. For the other offences, such as abandoning an animal in distress or failing to provide suitable water, food or shelter, the maximum penalty on indictment would be raised from 6 months in prison to 2 years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The separation of offences according to their degree of fault and the assignment of different maximum penalties would be consistent with other types of criminal offences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the increase in the maximum terms of imprisonment would also better reflect the seriousness of animal cruelty and better accord with Canadians' views on this terrible crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second aspect of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> would remove the current two year maximum duration of an order prohibiting an offender from possessing or living with an animal. As I mentioned, the courts are fond of prohibition orders in animal cruelty cases and in some cases have found creative ways to extend a prohibition order past the maximum term of two years. The courts and the public clearly agree that some offenders should be denied the privilege of having animals in their homes for longer periods of time than just two years. This change would respond to those concerns and would enable courts to more adequately prevent future offences by prescribing whatever duration was appropriate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> would introduce a new power to allow the sentencing judge to order the offender to repay the cost of medical care and other forms of care that another person or organization spent caring for the animal that was victimized. Often, animal welfare agencies or humane societies take in animals that have been abused. If they take in an abused animal and the person who abused the animal is later convicted, this new power would be a means of holding the offender financially responsible for the cost of their crime. Making offenders reimburse those costs associated with the crime, like other kinds of restitution in the Criminal Code, would help to foster a sense of responsibility in the offender. It would also help animal welfare agencies recoup the cost of their work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the applicable provincial legislation, agencies can recoup the funds associated with caring for neglected animals from the people responsible for neglecting them. It is important to recognize some of those agencies, like the SPCA, that help with animals that have been abused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the three principal amendments in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>. Together they constitute a significant improvement to the current law and one with which all Canadians would agree. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government supports Bill S-213 and encourages all members to support it as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many members in the House are aware of past legislative efforts to improve the animal cruelty laws. As members are well aware, none of the bills introduced by the previous government over the course of about five years ever passed both chambers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it is well-known that there was some disagreement concerning controversy over those bills. Some animal industry groups feared that certain changes would open the door to their being prosecuted for their traditional activities. We do not need to get into the details about that long and drawn out history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have before us today is a private member's bill that has one simple objective: improving the law's ability to deter, denounce and punish animal cruelty and make offenders take greater responsibility for their crimes.

    </p><a name="Para457671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six bills have been brought before Parliament. The bill we are discussing this morning is the seventh. What is more, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78329,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78329&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ajax—Pickering</A> has introduced an eighth bill. All this has us thinking about the type of legislation we want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is certain: the status quo is not an option. It is unbelievable that, with one exception, the Criminal Code provisions on cruelty to animals have not been reviewed since 1892.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation can be summarized as follows: the punishment for people found guilty of wounding, neglecting, abusing, maiming or killing animals cannot exceed six months in prison or a $2,000 fine, except in cases where cattle are wilfully killed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, the bill we are discussing this morning has merits. But it can be improved. I want to be very clear, for those who are watching. The Bloc Québécois will support the Senate bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>.

    </p><a name="Para457675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us this morning has three main points in its favour. First, it corrects the outdated sanctions, which are far too mild. These sanctions pertain to people's relationship with animals in the 19th century, when the Criminal Code was conceived.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will make courts more likely to impose stricter sentences on those who commit offences against animals, that is, those who are convicted of misconduct against animals, such as mutilation, killing, negligence, abandonment or refusing to feed animals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum sentence, when prosecuted by indictment, will be five years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000. The Bloc is pleased with that provision of the bill. That provision can also be found in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2352234,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2352234&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-373</A>, introduced by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78329,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78329&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ajax—Pickering</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill also corrects the existing anomaly that a court—through a prohibition order, which courts may impose —can prohibit the owner of an animal from having an animal in his or her possession for a maximum of two years. The bill before us today gives the courts the power to impose such a prohibition order for the owner's entire lifetime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third benefit of this bill is that it allows for restitution mechanisms through which the courts can order an individual to pay the costs if an animal has been taken in by an animal welfare organization, for example. A court could therefore order restitution and individuals who committed offences of negligence or intentional cruelty could be forced to pay the organizations that have taken in mistreated animals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three benefits alone represent a considerable improvement to the state of the law and warrant our support of this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We take the issue of cruelty to animals very seriously. The current animal cruelty laws were enacted in 1892 and have not been substantially altered in 114 years of Parliament's rule over this land. The answer to dealing with these issues is not simply to cosmetically increase the sentences that are being meted out for offences that are not enforceable in the first place and have not been enforceable over many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many instances of animal cruelty where the RCMP has not bothered with charges because the punishment meted out was not worth pursuing the case and it was impossible to prove wilful neglect. We need more of a deterrent. We need something that speaks to the nature of animal cruelty in a modern context. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members who have spoken before me have talked about the history of dealing with this issue in Parliament over the last seven years. Parliamentarians and governments have tried to focus on this issue and have found that it is impossible to move modern legislation through the two Houses that deals with animal cruelty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former government's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1845039,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1845039&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-50</A> was not allowed to pass through the Senate. In 2003 it had support from animal protection groups, animal industry groups such as farmers, trappers and researchers, the vast majority of Canadians, and all parties in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a disconnect when dealing with this issue of animal cruelty. We are stuck. We are only dealing with this bill now, not another companion bill, that would achieve support in the House and in the Senate. On the one hand we can put this bill forward which will cosmetically increase the penalties for animal cruelty, but it will not deal with the fundamental issues of a modern animal cruelty bill. That is not adequate. It should not be adequate to parliamentarians. It was not adequate in 2003 and I fail to see how it has become adequate today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at animal cruelty and the opportunities for the misunderstanding that comes with harvesting of animals, with the use of animals in agriculture, those things cry out for a clear definition. They cry out for a modern bill that would set the terms and conditions by which human beings could deal with animals. Without that, the deterrents are meaningless.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents have spoken to me on this issue and have urged me not to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>. I see their logic. I am concerned. The hon. member for the Bloc said that if we set higher deterrents without understanding the nature of cruelty to animals and without outlining it carefully in the legislation, we may find that it will lead to difficulties in different industries in the future.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents still are part of the trapping industry. My constituents utilize animals in a modern fashion. When I look back through the history of trapping, humane traps were designed by trappers in response to their understanding of the nature of cruelty to animals. That is admirable. The industry looks at how it conducts business and regulates itself to a great degree. The understanding of the nature of that can lie with the industry very well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own home community of Fort Smith, the Conibear trap was originally developed by a trapper who worked for many years in the bush. He saw how leghold traps worked and how effective they were and how the tools they used worked with the animal population they were harvesting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those types of issues need understanding in a bill. It is not good enough simply to increase the sentences for the actions of society toward animals. We need to understand how to use the law to make society work better with animals. That requires more than simply raising the penalties in a law that was first enacted in 1892 and virtually has not changed since then.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this action today is correct. We need to look at the question in its entirety. Parliamentarians in the past have done that. We have not been able to come to a full consensus in both houses but we have a duty to Canadians to act correctly in this fashion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party's justice critic may have an opportunity to expand on this in further debate. I urge members to consider carefully what is being done here.</div>

Dominic LeBlanc (Beauséjour, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by thanking my fellow New Brunswicker, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Miramichi</A>, for introducing this important animal protection bill in this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members who spoke before me this morning have clearly described the legal reasons why we have now reached the point where we must take action to improve the protection of animals and prevent cruelty to animals. In fact, this Parliament has expressed that feeling on several occasions in recent years. It did so unsuccessfully, however; it was unable to receive royal assent for a bill that would modernize the rules regarding penalties and the concept of animal protection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of this bill in the other house is Senator Bryden, an eminent legal expert. As the parliamentary secretary said this morning, the senator has worked very hard to build consensus among a number of groups, around this bill and around the serious need to expand and strengthen the penalties available to judges when someone is convicted under the cruelty to animals provisions of the Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have supported other bills in the past, like those introduced by my government at the time, to modernize the animal protection provisions of the Criminal Code. As other members, including the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A>, have mentioned, those bills were not adopted or given royal assent before an election intervened or before the term of a Parliament ended. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our colleague in the other house, the author of this bill, rightly decided that there was one aspect of the subject on which there was significant consensus: the need to increase the punishment, to expand the tools available to judges and prosecutors for sentencing someone who breaks the law or dealing with someone who has been convicted of violating these provisions of the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, other bills may have been too ambitious. As my colleagues have said, that does not mean that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>, which is now before this House, should not pass just because we are waiting for some more comprehensive reform in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my opinion that if this House decides to support this bill today, that is a very good start. It is an acknowledgement, and a clear message to prosecutors, judges and the police, stating that this Parliament believes in animal protection and has sent a message against cruelty to animals in all its forms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we recognize the need for balance. I believe the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> talked about balance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rural regions like mine, there are hunters, commercial fishers, recreational fishers and farmers. There are also people belonging to first nations. It is my privilege to represent in this House a first nations community, the Mi'kmaq. They have a long-standing tradition of using animals for perfectly legitimate purposes. These ways of using animals do not constitute animal cruelty at all. Moreover, for many people, this is also a research-related issue. We have made major progress in medicine because researchers have used animals in their research. I think that balance is essential in this respect as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases do not constitute animal cruelty in the same sense as the examples my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78373,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78373&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wild Rose</A> brought up when he asked the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Miramichi</A> a question. Those were examples of abhorrent behaviour. I think there is consensus in this Parliament—at least I hope there is—that the sentencing regime in the Criminal Code must finally be modernized. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to hear the parliamentary secretary support this bill on behalf of the government. As all members are well aware, striving for perfection can sometimes prevent us from doing what is achievable. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning colleagues have described some of the very important technical reasons that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> merits adoption by this House. The other place has studied this question extensively. Senator Bryden from New Brunswick has done an outstanding job at building consensus around one element that received not much objection, which is the issue of modernizing the sentencing regime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> in a very compelling way sets up a system of hybrid offences. This is a long-standing tradition in criminal law where prosecutors can decide based on all the circumstances of the case if in fact the offence is one of deliberate cruelty to animals and would obviously require a more severe sanction than perhaps might one of neglect. By allowing prosecutors to proceed by way of indictment as a more serious criminal offence with much more serious prison sentences attached to a conviction under indictment, Parliament sends a very compelling message to those who might seek to abuse animals either by committing an act that the courts hold to have been an abuse or cruelty to animals or those who may neglect animals and fail to provide the essentials which, in turn, also are offences under the Criminal Code and appropriately should be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues should think carefully before seeking to achieve a more global reform of the legislation with respect to cruelty to animals and miss the opportunity before us today to modernize in a very important way the sentencing regime. This can be a very good first step toward perhaps finding at some future point another balance in terms of other bills that may come before the House. A great deal of work has gone into this.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions lasted a long time, especially in the other place. A consensus was reached and I urge my colleagues to review the list of organizations across the country that support this bill. These groups represent, among others, urban communities, hunters, researchers and veterinarians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my time is running out, so in closing, I would like to congratulate the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Miramichi</A>, who took the initiative to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A> in this House.

    </p><a name="Para457721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in response to my Liberal friend who just spoke, we have a history of owners of operations such as puppy mills who pay a $2,000 fine, relocate their operations and continue on with their mills. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things I like about the bill. First, it increases the penalty for those kinds of operations. The second is the prohibition. They are ordered never to engage in that activity again. The ownership of animals should not be any part of their privileges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has a lot of good things in it that need to be moved forward. Is there room for improvement? Possibly so, but in order to get the improvement, this needs to pass second reading and get to committee. We need to listen to the witnesses and testimonies before committee, and if it can be improved, that is the time to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP would simply reject the bill and say that the status quo is good enough. However, the status quo is not good enough for Canadian people, of whom I am aware. They want to see some serious changes. If we reject Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2582083,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2582083&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-213</A>, then the status quo will remain in effect for quite some time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bills that were previously mentioned would be forever getting to the House. We are operating under a minority government, never knowing when an election is going to be called and whether a bill is going to die. I would like to see this bill passed before any election occurs, and not have it die on the order paper. We have to show society that we are serious about doing something on these issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one major thing we missed in all the speeches is the fact that studies have shown that a high majority of individuals sitting in penitentiaries today because they have violently attacked human beings, young children in particular, have a background of animal abuse prior to their convictions for these kinds of other violent crimes. There seems to be a connection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we keep that in mind, maybe we can realize the importance of getting the bill through the House and getting it approved as quickly as possible so we can try our very best to break that connection with increased penalties, more severe punishment and prohibition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any individual who mistreats an animal, as in some of the cases of which I have most recently been made aware, should not be allowed to own another animal for the rest of his or her life. We do that for many other kinds of crimes. In particular, I think of guns. If people misuse guns, there is a very good chance they will never own another one. It should be the same thing for pets or other animals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a myth out there that this will not cover wildlife and stray animals. They are already fully protected in the Criminal Code. However, we need are courts, adjudicators and Crown prosecutors who are willing to push the envelope when these things, these individuals, get to court. We need them to say loudly and clearly that the activities they have engaged in are unacceptable in this society and that they will pay dearly for their crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Bloc member who talked about the SPCA taking possession of animals when there was misuse. We have to be very careful. Not too long ago, I reported on a case in my riding of a farmer who took a culled cow to the market. He was charged because the cow had cancer eye. He spent $17,000 of his own money to fight it in court. He could have paid a $1,000 fine and not go to court, but on principle, he took it to court and won the case. Those kinds of incidents have to stop.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get the bill to committee. We have to hear witnesses and have them testify as to what they would like to see in changes and amendments. Then we can move on with what I think is one of the most important issues of this year.</div>

I have only 10 minutes to speak to the Anti-terrorism Act, which was passed by the House. I do not think a single member of Parliament would disagree that at the time we were in a climate of considerable fear and apprehension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A>. He has provided astounding leadership around the issues with which we have been grappling ever since.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have been following the anti-terrorism debate in the House will know that my colleague from Windsor—Tecumseh has filed a minority report in relation to the two issues principally before us now, those sections of the Anti-terrorism Act that pertain to investigations and preventive arrests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will surprise no one that I am in absolute agreement with my colleague, the justice critic for the New Democratic party. In fact, all my colleagues stand together to oppose what we think remain provisions of the act that were clearly recognized at the time to be out of balance with what was necessary to achieve, weighing off security demands against civil liberties and human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the government is not prepared to allow the sunset clause to apply to these two provisions is a clear and an alarming signal that it has not learned the lessons, lessons well learned by a great many Canadians at a grave expense and a tremendous cost to those victims of the overzealousness of some of these provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has said this better than the NDP justice critic. Terrorism cannot be fought with legislation. It must be fought through the efforts of intelligent services, combined with appropriate police action. There is no act of terrorism that is not already a criminal offence, punishable by the most stringent penalties under the Criminal Code. This is obviously the case for premeditated, cold blooded murders. However, it is also true for the destruction of major infrastructures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very much the view of the NDP that if in any respect the Criminal Code is lacking, the legislation is insufficient to deal with the threat of terrorism, then this can be amended. If the police do not have the full legal means needed to deal with terrorism threats, then that legislation should be amended. No one has brought forward the amendments that would address this in the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the lessons of post 9/11 absolutely lead to the position we have taken today, and that is we have to learn those lessons and apply them. This means we should let those two overzealous measures expire as the sunset clause indicated.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we began the debate on the legislation, there was a truly superb coalition effort of Quebec Muslim and Arab organizations. They came to the Hill and sought the opportunity to meet with members in all caucuses. I am not sure if they succeeded in doing that. However, it was an excellent experience for the NDP caucus to hear the presentation of that coalition.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will briefly quote from what is an excellent brief. I want to ensure that it goes into the record. It was one of the most concise and intelligent analyses of the issues we face. The second point in the recommendations brought forward in their analysis of what happened post-9/11 reads:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone questions whether that is an accurate description of what has happened to a great many Canadian Muslims and Canadian Arabs post-9/11, simply look back on the disgraceful question period that took place last week. At the sheer mention of the anti-terrorism provisions subject to the sunset clause, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> stood in and by reference, by innuendo, spoke about a family member of a member of the House in terms of him being a candidate to come before the secret investigations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could more stringently underline why the sunset clause should apply to those investigations. Instead of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> creating such innuendoes, he should have been asking, if he has learned any lessons at all about RCMP leaks, why these leaks about someone who may or may not appear before a secret investigation were being given to the public? Why would the Prime Minister participate in referencing what had to be leaks coming from the RCMP? I hope members of the House will reflect on lessons that need to be learned.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to briefly quote from the final words of Maher Arar, which he shared with an audience of people across political party lines. However, it was a grave disappointment that only the leader of the Conservative Party, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, chose not to attend the event. The other party leaders were there. Also a large number of representatives from the other caucuses were there, except the government caucus. This again leads us to believe the government has not learned the lessons of the overzealousness post-9/11. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the words of Maher Arar on that evening of tribute to Monia Mazigh and Maher Arar for the work that they had done for Canadians around the issue of the appropriate balance between security and civil liberties: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there was a truly superb address given at the outset of that evening. It was a very fine, insightful, scholarly address by Dr. Tyseer Aboulnasr, who said in part:</div>

We know that security without liberty is simply imprisonment. Nothing is more secure than a maximum security prison. We deserve better. We cannot let Canada turn into a maximum security prison by imprisoning one Canadian without the presumption of innocence till proven guilty and without the full opportunity to defend themselves.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason I was genuinely shocked. The day after this superb speech was made in tribute to Maher Arar and Monia Mazigh, the former solicitor general, under the Liberal government, stood in the House in answer to a question I raised. He said that as far as he was concerned we had achieved exactly the right balance between security and civil liberties in the post-9/11 era. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully disagree with him and I urge members to see the wisdom of letting the sunset clause of these two overzealous measures take effect. They are covered in the Criminal Code and can deal with future threats of terrorism, which we all take very seriously.</div>

    </p><a name="Para457756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal opposition has thought long and hard on this issue. This party, while in government, introduced the Anti-terrorism Act and this House passed certain provisions subject to a five year sunset which we are considering in the House today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of my party is clear. These provisions providing for preventive arrest and investigative hearings should sunset and they should sunset because they are flawed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commons committee and the committee in another House that reviewed these provisions believed that while some of the provisions are worthwhile they were seriously flawed. The committees had made extensive recommendations on how to address these flaws, how to ensure they better contribute to our public safety and how to better safeguard against the potential abuse of human rights.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party is proud of its record on defence and public safety, and I want to stress that this record is in line with civil liberties.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that government has ignored the recommendations of the House and Senate committees. The government has failed to present to this House clear proposals to extend these provisions in a modified form which take into account the concerns of parliamentarians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the government has not formally engaged the opposition in any way. It has not submitted any proposals to us. We have known since last October that Canada's Anti-terrorism Act needed a complete review. The government has done nothing.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has presented the House and the country with an up or down choice. The government seeks to present all parties in Parliament with the following choice: vote to extend these provisions or risk being labelled as soft on terror.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. This party has never been soft on terror. As the leader of my party has repeatedly stated, if the government presented this House with clear proposals to redraft the anti-terrorist legislation to take into account the sensible suggestions made by the House and the Senate committees, the official opposition would act expeditiously and responsibly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To repeat, the party has never been soft on terror. The House knows and the government knows that after the attacks of 9/11 the Liberal government acted decisively and we will always do so.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government at the time also knew something else: measures that may be necessary in an emergency must always be reviewed once the danger has abated. That is why the original legislation included sunset clauses so that, once the immediate danger had passed, Parliament could calmly assess whether those measures should be renewed and, if so, how.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where we are today or where we ought to be if this country were led by a responsible government. If this country were led by a government that said, “We are in a minority position in this House. Let us reach out to the opposition. Let us listen to what the committees of the House and the committees in another chamber said. Let us come back with revisions to the legislation that better balance security and liberty”, we would have responded positively. Instead, in the government everything is political. Everything is an opportunity to jam the opposition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is fair enough. We are all politicians in the House, but there are some issues on which we should try to put politics aside and put the security of our country first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hon. John Baird: </A></B> I was reading a book of yours. It didn't say that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr. Michael Ignatieff: </B> Now, now. I do not believe the hon. member has read my words correctly, but I continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has alleged that it is the opposition that is playing politics and is endangering national security by voting to sunset these clauses. However, it well knows that these clauses have not been used once in the entire time they have been on the statute books. The case that we are endangering public safety by our actions is fanciful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we do come to material that I have considered in my previous work. Abridgments of civil liberties can be justified but only if public safety absolutely requires it and then only under strict conditions. If this is the test, the clauses should sunset because they have not proven absolutely necessary to the public safety. The government, in essence, has not proven its case, and, on these questions where our liberties are at stake, the government must prove the case of public necessity beyond a shadow of a doubt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset clauses are placed in legislation precisely to ensure that temporary and emergency provisions of the law enacted to cope with special circumstances do not anchor themselves permanently in our law and, by so doing, begin moving the equilibrium of the law away from where it should always be: balancing security and liberty, public order and individual freedom.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we renew these clauses as the government proposes, we risk moving that plumb line of the law. Temporary measures will become permanent and what becomes permanent will become unbalanced. The law will begin to privilege security at the expense of freedom, to the eventual detriment of us all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go further. If we consider the ruling of the Supreme Court last Friday on the security certificate provisions of the Immigration Act and if we further consider the reports of the parliamentary committees, both in this House and in another place, it is clear that the entire anti-terrorist architecture on the statute books needs comprehensive revision.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the main challenge that this government, which has been in power now for 13 months, has refused to face. The Conservatives may say that they need more time, but they have had plenty of time. The parliamentary committee in charge of reviewing the sunset clauses submitted its report last October, five months ago. Has the government been asleep since then?</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundations were well laid but the building needs revision, that is the point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government was slumbering, the parliamentary committee made recommendations on the investigative hearing provisions to give authorities the powers they need to protect us against forthcoming threats. The government has thus far failed to take into account the conclusions of that committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For preventive detention, the other sunset clause at issue in this debate, members of the parliamentary committee pointed out that section 495 of the Criminal Code already gives the police the authority to arrest without warrant a person who, on reasonable grounds, he believes is about to commit an indictable offence. This power is already in the criminal law of Canada and the additional powers sought in preventive detention are, in our judgment, strictly unnecessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such powers exist in the criminal law, the government will need to prove, and it has failed to do so, that the preventive arrest provisions of the ATA have the overriding necessity that it claims.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the issue here. A free society can contemplate limited abridgments of the civil liberties of citizens only if the government offers clear public justification in Parliament of its case. It has failed to do so. These clauses must sunset and then the government should come back with redrafted measures and a case to justify them to the House and to the people. Should the government bring back measures that meet the test of public necessity and demonstrate that it has listened to the considered opinions of the committee of the House and the Senate, the opposition will respond.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to do more than just repair these defective clauses. It needs to give serious consideration to the opinions expressed by the honourable members of the Senate in the recent report entitled “Fundamental Justice in Extraordinary Times”. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report makes my point. The entire architecture of Canada's anti-terrorism laws require substantial amendment. The foundations laid by the Liberal government are sound but there is room for substantial change if Canadians are to remain safe and have their liberties secure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report in the Senate, for example, recommends removal of the motive requirement from the Criminal Code definition of terrorist activity. It also recommends removing the reference to political, religious or ideological objectives from the definition of threats to security to Canada. All this, if done by a careful government, would provide greater protection for the free expression of opinion in Canada and prevent religious or racial profiling in Canada's anti-terrorist policy.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without committing itself in advance to any specific initiative in this area, the opposition urges the government to listen to these suggestions and come back to this House with legislative amendments that meet public safety objectives while providing greater protection for Canada's minorities against religious and racial profiling. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225">(1225)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para457785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this and other areas, the report of the other house makes a convincing case. It states that our laws and policies to prevent and combat terrorism should be reformed to better reflect the objective of ensuring the security of Canadians while protecting the civil liberties that are the basis of our democratic society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will the government not react positively to the sober second thought offered by the other chamber to Canada's anti-terrorism laws? Why will it not come to the House with proposals that reflect in detail these sensible recommendations? Why is it presenting members with a false, up or down, black or white choice to sunset or not to sunset? Sunset or not to sunset is not the question. Why has the government waited six months to take action to fix Canada's legislative framework on anti-terrorism? Why has the government, and it is a minority government after all, failed to reach out to the opposition and work with them to amend the laws we need to protect our citizens? Why has it decided that it is in its interest to jam the opposition rather than to serve the people?</div>
    </p><a name="Para457787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave it to the other side to answer those questions but I would suggest that the answers tell us much about the character of the government and the character of the hon. member who leads it. For the government, politics comes first and good public policy comes a very distant last. Canadians deserve better.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para457788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has had plenty of time to review and improve these clauses, but it has done nothing. As a result, the sunset clauses will expire, if that is the will of this House. Once that happens, the government, which could have avoided that situation at any point in the past six months, will have to repair the damage it will have done itself. If it comes back to this House with reasonable measures that meet the test of public necessity, that protect the public while protecting civil liberties, the official opposition will be ready to do its duty constructively.</div>

The sunset clause issue cannot be seen apart from the flaws in the anti-terrorist legislation in general. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remarks that I made to the House were that the parliamentary committee and the Senate committee have said that we can renew these provisions only if there are substantial revisions to the provisions themselves and if there are revisions to other aspects of the anti-terrorist legislation. It is that duty to introduce companion legislation where the government has failed, presenting the House with a false up or down choice on sunset which neglects the wider context of legislative change that simply has to be made if Canada is to be adequately protected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the House is presenting this as a choice between those who are soft on terror or tough on terror, which is an entirely false issue. This side of the House is prepared to work constructively with the other side of the House to put a comprehensive piece of legislation together that addresses the flaws that two parliamentary committees have now indicated very clearly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot in conscience vote to not sunset clauses. What would happen is that the entire architecture of the anti-terrorist legislation would lumber forward into the future encumbered with all these defects. Now is the time to act, and the government should act.</div>

    </p><a name="Para457803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will simply say that the Supreme Court ruled on these issues last week. In its decision, the court stated that it is possible to detain a person preventively, but that person's rights must be protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Supreme Court's decision, our system for protecting the rights of these individuals is obviously not good enough. We must make some changes. It pointed out the dangers. There are some individuals who have been held for six years in an irregular situation. The Supreme Court is trying to fix this situation, which is part of a larger problem. Our country's anti-terrorist architecture is flawed, and there are problems we must solve with new legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the member from the Bloc will support the other opposition parties in pressuring the government to take responsibility and fix these flaws.</div>

    </p><a name="Para457807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the Liberals brought this legislation forward.

    </p><a name="Para457808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about negotiations and about the opportunity for the Liberals to have their say to make changes to the legislation. There is no provision for that according to the bill that was brought forward by the previous Liberal government. The Liberals simply have a responsibility to either stand with Canadians and protect them or to tell Canadians that their security and their safety do not matter. The future Liberal leader should make it clear to Canadians whether or not he supports the security of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about the Liberals not wanting to politicize this. The Liberals had the opportunity to delay this from happening and negotiate some type of an agreement, but they failed to do that. They have decided to proceed with politics and put the security of Canadians on the line.</div>

I am struggling to winnow out the elements of his contribution that are irrelevant and focus solely on those that are relevant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply make the observation that the sunset clause issue has to be seen in the context of an anti-terrorist legislation whose foundations are solid because they were created by the previous Liberal government and commanded the assent of both sides of the House. As we have lived with these provisions over five years, it has become apparent both to the parliamentary committee and to members of my colleague's own party that there are substantial defects in this legislation that need to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has had six months, since October, since the parliamentary committee reported, to come back to the House with legislation. A responsible government would have come back to the House with legislation that would have addressed in a comprehensive form the defects this legislation faces. Then we would not be put in the false position of sunset or not to sunset. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point here is that even those who support the renewal of these clauses are troubled by some of their implications, troubled by their potential operation. A responsible government would deal with these problems and solve them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we have been put in a situation which seems to me not to serve the public interest. In my judgment, the public interest should be served by a comprehensive review of this legislation. As I have said already several times, and the leader of my party has said many times, we would be prepared to respond positively to that initiative.</div>

I ask all hon. members to listen with an open mind on what is unquestionably a matter of critical importance to our collective safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking about these powers, investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions, we must work by way of comparison to the anti-terrorism powers of other democratic states. They will clearly show that restraint is built into the scope of their application. Let me first discuss the investigative hearing procedure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has a grand jury system. The grand jury wields significant powers not shared by other investigative agencies. The federal grand jury may compel the cooperation of persons who may have information relevant to the matters it is investigating. Any person may be subpoenaed to appear and testify under oath before a grand jury. If individuals who are subpoenaed fail to appear or refuse to answer questions, they may be held in contempt absent a valid claim of privilege. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand jury may subpoena the owner of documents or other evidence to present them to the grand jury, on pain of contempt, absent a valid claim of privilege. If a witness or the custodian of a document asserts a valid privilege, he or she may be provided with use and derivative use immunity and then be required to comply with a subpoena to testify or produce evidence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Patriot Act represented a marked departure from past changes to grand jury secrecy rules. The act permits disclosure without court order to a list of federal agencies with duties unrelated to law enforcement. Although the material disclosed must relate to foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence, the Patriot Act defines those terms with considerable breadth. I would add that there are also equivalent investigative hearing provisions in Australia and South Africa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, in the United Kingdom the onus is on the person having relevant information relating to terrorism to disclose the information to the police. A person who fails to disclose to the police information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing an act of terrorism is guilty of an offence and liable to punishment of up to five years' imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the recognizance with conditions power. In Canada the use of the recognizance with conditions provision is dependent on reasonable grounds to believe that a specific terrorist activity will be committed in addition to a reasonable suspicion that the imposition of a recognizance is necessary. Arrest without warrant is limited in scope where, for example, there are exigent circumstances and if the person is detained, the period of detention is limited, generally up to a maximum of 72 hours before the hearing takes place. If the person refuses to enter into the recognizance with conditions, he or she may be jailed for a term not exceeding one year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare the scope of this provision to some of those found in the U.K. In the U.K. the police may arrest without warrant a person whom he or she reasonably suspects is a terrorist. This differs from normal arrest powers in that there is no need for there to be any specific offence in the mind of the arresting officer, thereby allowing for wider discretion in carrying out investigations. The maximum period of time that a person could be held in detention without charge under this power has been extended since 2000 from 7 days to 14 days, to the current 28 days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other powers as well given to the police in the U.K. For example, under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, a constable in uniform, having received an authorization from a police officer having at least the rank of assistant chief constable, may stop a vehicle in the place set out in the authorization and search the vehicle, driver or passenger. It also extends to a pedestrian or anything carried by him or her in the area. The senior official may issue the authorization if it is considered expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are required to inform the secretary of state of the authorization as soon as is reasonably practicable, and to continue, it must be confirmed within 48 hours. An authorization may be up to 28 days and can be renewed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the U.K. also put in place in 2005 a system of control orders which may be imposed on a person to prevent terrorist attacks. These orders can be imposed on citizens and non-citizens alike. There are two kinds of control orders that may be imposed: those which do not derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights, and those which do derogate from the convention. The latter would arguably apply in cases of house arrest. Some of these control orders have been challenged in the lower courts and their lawfulness will ultimately be decided by the House of Lords. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240">(1240)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, legislation has been enacted creating a system of control orders and preventative arrests of terrorist suspects. With regard to preventative detention, the Australian federal police may apply for an order for preventative detention of a terrorist suspect where there has been a terrorist act or where a terrorist act is imminent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the period of preventative detention is limited to 48 hours. In contrast, and in addition, many Australian states and territories have enacted legislation allowing preventative detention for up to 14 days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this comparison, I would suggest that far from being blunt instruments, these provisions in the Anti-terrorism Act designed to prevent terrorism are modest in scope and finely tuned to their purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I would like to turn to another major issue that has been raised by opposition parties in deciding, to date, to oppose the recognizance with conditions provision found in section 83.3 of the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> has argued that the recognizance with conditions power is not needed because paragraph 495(1)(a) of the Criminal Code has long provided a peace officer with the power to arrest without warrant a person whom he or she believes is about to commit an indictable offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been further argued that in such a case the person can be brought before a judge and released on recognizance with conditions. The hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> has also contended that the recognizance with conditions power under the ATA is very different in nature from the peace bond process found in section 810 of the Criminal Code and has very different consequences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has argued that in his experience section 810 is often used with regard to apprehended domestic violence or stalking rejected lovers. In contrast, in his view, the recognizance with conditions under the Anti-terrorism Act can catch innocent people who may not be aware of the reasons for which terrorists are soliciting their aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also states that under section 810 a person is subject to a summons to come before a judge and is not arrested, and that the judge cannot commit the person to a prison term unless the person refuses to sign the recognizance after listening to all the parties and being satisfied by the evidence educed that there are reasonable grounds for the fears.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to reply to these arguments in turn. There are a number of differences between section 495 of the Criminal Code and the provisions setting out the recognizance with conditions contained in the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 495(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, in part, sets out the power of a peace officer to arrest without warrant a person who is reasonably believed to be about to commit an indictable offence; that is, a serious crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognizance with conditions provision in the ATA requires, first, that a peace officer have reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorist activity will be committed and suspects on reasonable grounds that the imposition of a recognizance with conditions on a person is necessary to prevent a terrorist activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, under the recognizance with conditions provision in the ATA the timeframe allowed for preventive intervention is longer than that provided for in section 495. There is no requirement that the terrorist activity be imminent; namely, about to be committed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents a substantial difference that may, in practice, result in the prevention of terrorist activity and in saving lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant arrest without warrant power in section 495 is restricted to those persons who, it is reasonably believed, are about to commit an indictable offence. These individuals, in other words, must be on the verge of committing a serious crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognizance with conditions provision in section 83.3 of the Criminal Code is not as narrow as section 495. It can apply to anyone who fits the statutory criteria set out in section 83.3 of the Anti-terrorism Act. A peace officer requires reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorist activity will be committed and that the imposition of the recognizance with conditions is necessary to prevent a terrorist activity from being carried out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, while the police may suspect on reasonable grounds that particular individuals have contributed to or been associated with certain terrorist activities, they may not yet have the grounds to arrest these individuals and charge them with having committed a provable crime. In other words, they would not have grounds to arrest without warrant for being about to commit an indictable offence under section 495 of the Criminal Code. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> recognizes that the recognizance with conditions power is broader in scope than section 495 of the Criminal Code. However, he disapproves of this, expressing concern that a person placed under this kind of recognizance with condition can be branded a terrorist without ever being charged with a terrorism offence. He makes an analogy to a robbery about to take place, arguing that police can use section 495 to arrest the accused because he or she is about to commit a crime. The police, he says, can do the same with regard to a terrorist activity being planned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument ignores the fundamental difference between terrorism and other forms of serious crimes, including organized crime. In this regard, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> has chosen to disregard the advice given to him by Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of the U.K.'s anti-terrorism legislation, who was questioned by the House subcommittee in November 2005.</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>With organized crime, it is often possible for the police investigating that crime to leave arrest until very late. Indeed, for example, there was a huge robbery at London Heathrow Airport a couple of years ago—I was involved in the case for a time professionally—in which they allowed the robbery to take place, and they arrested the robbers whilst they were committing the robbery, with the result that in the end most of them pleaded guilty. You can't run that risk with terrorism. </small></td>

This means that a great deal of the evidence gathering has to take place after what is sometimes regarded as a premature arrest.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para457848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reality of the need to intervene at an early stage to disrupt and deter a potential terrorist activity in its nascent stages lies at the heart of the difference between the recognizance with conditions in the Criminal Code and section 495 which, while appropriate for regular crime, including organized crime, is not adequate in order to prevent acts of terrorism most effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us carefully examine the differences between section 810 of the Criminal Code from the recognizance with conditions power under the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, under the recognizance with conditions in the Anti-terrorism Act, as in section 810, a judge may issue a summons to a person to appear. The general rule is that a peace officer must lay information before a judge and have the judge compel the person to attend before him to determine if a recognizance with conditions should be imposed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest without warrant in section 83.3 is very limited in scope. It applies only where exigent circumstances make it impracticable to lay the information, or where a summons has been issued for the person to appear and the peace officer suspects unreasonable grounds that the detention of the person is necessary to prevent a terrorist activity from taking place. This is in sharp contrast with section 495, which is exclusively an arrest without warrant power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, under the recognizance with conditions power in the Anti-terrorism Act, as in section 810, if the person signs the recognizance and abides by the conditions, he or she remains at liberty and will not be sentenced or have a criminal record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the suggestion has been made that the section 810 peace bond process deals only with cases of domestic assault or stocking that do not really rise to the high level of harm or notoriety that terrorism does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted, however, that peace bonds in the Criminal Code can also apply in respect of other serious criminal conduct, such as the cases of fear on reasonable grounds that a person will commit a criminal organization offence. A person placed under a peace bond in these circumstances is also not guilty of any offence, and yet is placed under a severe stigma without necessarily being found guilty of any crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would point out an important difference between the peace bond set out in section 810 and the recognizance with conditions power in the Anti-terrorism Act. Unlike the section 810 peace bond, the recognizance with conditions under the Criminal Code cannot be used unless the relevant attorney general consents to information being laid by a peace officer before a judge, and this applies in all cases.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a key and important safeguard that is curiously not mentioned by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of all members of the House, let me summarize the major safeguards found in the recognizance with conditions provision found in the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the consent of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general or solicitor general of the province is required.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a peace officer has limited power to arrest a person without warrant in order to bring him or her before a judge, such as in exigent circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a peace officer who detains a person must either lay information with the consent of the relevant attorney general or release the person.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, in order to lay information, a person detained in custody must be brought before a provincial court judge without unreasonable delay, and in any event within 24 hours of arrest or as soon as possible thereafter if a judge is unavailable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, only if the judge is convinced that the necessary reasonable grounds exist, may the judge order that the person enter into a recognizance to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, and to comply with any other reasonable conditions for a period of 12 months. Only if the person refuses or fails to enter into the recognizance can the person be committed to prison.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person subject to a recognizance has the right to apply to vary the conditions under the recognizance order.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, federal and provincial attorneys general are required to report annually on most uses of this power. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A> and ministers responsible for policing in the provinces are required to report annually on the arrest without warrant power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these safeguards, it is apparent that this provision has numerous safeguards to prevent possible abuse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by imploring the members opposite to consider the words of Lord Carlile of Berriew. Yes, there is a difference between organized crime and terrorism. The threat of mass murder is different from the threat of individual violence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have the tools to prevent these attacks at their nascent stages, not just when the crime is about to be committed, for to wait is to endanger the lives of those we wish to protect. It is a time for foresight, and foresight demands that these provisions be extended.</div>

I would like to remind the hon. member who spoke before me that the offence of conspiracy also exists. Conspiracy is an agreement between two people to commit an indictable offence. I do not see how the police can believe they should arrest an individual if they do not have any information to indicate that that individual has demonstrated, in one way or another, their intention to commit a terrorist act. When an individual has discussed such an act with someone else, or when they have begun preparations, only then has a conspiracy offence been committed and the police can arrest a suspect, bring that individual before a judge and charge them with conspiracy. The judge can even refuse bail if they believe that the plans are advanced or are dangerous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Carlisle tells us that we should not allow terrorist acts to be committed. However, it also seems to me that, if we use the conspiracy charge to bring a suspect before a judge, we interrupt the terrorist activity the same as if we bring that individual before a judge to enter into a recognizance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the hon. member react if his son or one of his friends had met terrorists at school or university and had contact with them without knowing they were terrorists? How would he react if authorities concluded—as it was concluded in the Maher Arar case—that he was likely a terrorist and ordered to enter into a peace bond, because there was evidence and grounds to believe, given those meetings, that he may have been part of a terrorist plot? Does the hon. member think that his son could later travel to the United States or even keep his job?</div>

I would like to point out as well that the member's very question undermines the position of the Liberal Party, in that it shows that great restraint is used by peace officers in actually applying the provisions we are talking about under this Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the member asks about my son or daughter and how I would like it and so on. The provisions contained within the Anti-terrorism Act are constitutional. In 2004, in a reference related to the Air-India prosecution, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of these provisions. That is important to know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, these provisions are used only under the most dire of circumstances. At the end of my speech, I read out for members the conditions that must apply and pointed out the caution that is taken before applying these two provisions. If somebody meets the circumstances of those provisions, then yes, these provisions should be brought against them, and if not, then they would not be. I think we have seen that in the lack of use of these provisions over the last five years.</div>

    </p><a name="Para457877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the Anti-terrorism Act, it demands that an unamendable motion be laid before Parliament.

I must say that I feel rather ashamed. I was here in the House in 2001 when we had the debate. I remember very well all the questions raised by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78493,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78493&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</A>, who was the opposition leader at the time, as well as those of our justice critic, Michel Bellehumeur, the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were worried about a number of things. The first was the very definition of terrorism and a terrorist act. I do not want to return to all that because the Supreme Court did not rule on it. The other extremely important questions that we raised had to do with procedural fairness, the right to a full and complete defence, and how best to achieve a laudable objective. We need to remember the situation in 2001 and how concerned we were, especially in view of what had happened in the United States. We know how close the historical bonds have been between Canada and the United States, bonds that led a former Canadian Prime Minister to say of our relationship that geography made us neighbours but history made us friends. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could not remain unmoved by the collapse of the twin towers and all the information pouring forth about terrorist networks, real or potential. I would like to thank the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A>, by the way, for all the vigilance he has shown. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speeches we heard this morning are pretty amazing in some respects. I should say, first, that for me the Liberals and the Conservatives are the same. We need to remember what the Liberals were saying. The Bloc was very clear. Not that we were great seers or prophets, but we did anticipate a few things. Some provisions of the bill that was being introduced, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, were obviously incompatible with the basic principles on which our justice system is built. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember very well the questions and comments made by the justice minister at the time. They were even more unacceptable in that she was a former professor of constitutional law who had written articles on legal guarantees and procedural fairness, which I had had occasion to read. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Liberals and Conservatives were animated by a common desire to move as quickly as possible and respond to the emergency because the situation was indeed very worrisome. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the Supreme Court ruling from beginning to end. What the Supreme Court told us is that in a democracy, and in a system where the rule of law means something, the end never justifies the means. As parliamentarians, we must respect that. The Conservatives and the Liberals were of one mind; we realize, with hindsight, that their position does not stand up to our most basic principles of justice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is demagogy, to some extent, to rise this morning in this House and to make it seem as though there are those who are concerned about the safety of citizens and those who are not. All parliamentarians in this House are concerned about the safety of citizens. However, it may be that, in our work as parliamentarians, we have to propose measures that push the boundaries when it comes to how we perceive the evidence or how we see the process unfolding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in this House when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2329666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2329666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-95</A>, the first anti-gang bill, was adopted in 1997.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305">(1305)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a criminal organization then was: five individuals who, in the past five years, committed offences punishable by more than five years' imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there was also a sense of urgency. However, I would never have thought about rising in this House and voting for this bill, which was to be revised by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, if the principal condition of the law had been to deny the accused access to all the evidence. That is the problem with this bill. I am surprised that no government members have noted this fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have an opportunity to mention this: the Criminal Code does contain mechanisms for preventive detention. First, common law recognizes this principle and the Supreme Court has recognized it several times. We need not go very far. Section 495 of the Criminal Code—if my memory serves me correctly—allows a police officer to arrest, on reasonable grounds, a person he believes has committed or is about to commit an offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, of course, the individual will have a trial and can be represented. All legal guarantees will be offered and justice will be served the way it should be in an adversarial system, in other words, the public prosecution lays charges and provides evidence and the accused can defend himself or herself. Getting to the truth is what this confrontation should be all about. That is not what is being proposed in the antiterrorist provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against the fact that measures are needed. I am sure that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> never said anything of the sort. We acknowledge that some individuals may pose a threat to national security. It is true there are terrorist movements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember attending lectures given by researchers from the Raoul Dandurand Chair in strategic and diplomatic studies. We know that terrorist movements have been at work and that they will be in the years to come. We are even told that the largest terrorist movements, which constitute the worst threat to the security of modern states, are those with religious motivations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know all that. We are not questioning the fact that in legislation, whether in the Immigration Act or in other legislation, a minister may be asked to review situations where individuals will have to be deemed threats to national security. We recognize that and we agree that in all modern countries, particularly in vast countries and countries where borders are porous, it is acceptable for these provisions to exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there is something quite unbelievable in these provisions. The Supreme Court said that the way in which the antiterrorist provisions are set up, in their wording and the way the courts are called to interpret them, some procedural guarantees are being breached. I will come back to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to the following question. Can these terrorist movements be dismantled by using the provisions in sections 83.27, 83.28, 83.29, and 83.3? Why have these provisions not been invoked? Logically speaking, just because they have not been invoked yet does not mean they will not be in the future, but this is nonetheless a measure of their immediate relevance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Criminal Code—as we were reminded—an individual can be arrested without a warrant. It even sets out that in individual can be brought before a judge, compelled to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace and prohibited from contacting certain individuals. This is set out in section 810 of the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310">(1310)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 465 even includes a provision that allows for the arrest of individuals on the basis of conspiracy alone and because there is a risk they will commit acts at a later date. It is not as though we are completely without any other legislative recourse, or as though there is nothing in our existing legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is very troubling. While we may not agree on how our political system operates, we cannot deny that there is a recognized tradition of respect for human rights. This includes Diefenbaker's Canadian Bill of Rights, the Canadian Human Rights Act adopted in 1977 and, more recently, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the National Assembly, in 1982, at the time the Canadian Charter was debated, we did not agree on the management of linguistic rights. Nor did we agree on section 27 pertaining to the enhancement of multicultural heritage. We nevertheless recognize the charter as a tool for the protection of human rights, particularly for judicial guarantees, which, moreover, already exist and were already set out in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. We recognize that it serves as a tool for the promotion and enhancement of human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators, how could we have let ourselves become distracted? The Bloc Québécois cannot be blamed because, based on the recommendation of the leader of the Bloc and our justice critic, we voted unanimously against BIll <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we vote against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>? Because we did not believe that an individual could receive a fair trial without access to the evidence, especially the most important pieces of evidence, the ones supporting the charges or leading to a guilty verdict. The Supreme Court spoke of “sensitive information”. That was the main problem with the proposed law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote what the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said on page 54. A unanimous ruling is significant, after all. In a decision written by Madam Justice McLachlin, the court said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para457908"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I therefore conclude that the IRPA's procedure for determining whether a certificate is reasonable does not conform to the principles of fundamental justice as embodied in s. 7 of the Charter. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para457909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is serious. Legislators should be very concerned about this paragraph. I have difficulty understanding the government's obstinate refusal to recognize the proposed law. Of course, the Conservatives were not responsible for creating it; the Liberals were. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all Parliamentarians in this House will acknowledge that things have been taken too far, that due process is not happening and that even though we have a general duty to protect our fellow citizens, we must have safe communities. Specifically, we must protect our fellow citizens from possible terrorist attacks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court will explain what it means by the “principles of fundamental justice” embodied in section 7. This section is well known to us all. It concerns life, liberty and security of the person. The Supreme Court will say that those rights cannot be interfered with. First and foremost, we must ensure an impartial hearing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court considered the question of the evidence being introduced <i>ex parte</i>, that is, the judge reviews the evidence, but not in the presence of both parties, specifically, defence lawyers for the person named in the certificate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not troubling to know that a person who does not appear before the judge—a judge who has reviewed the evidence, including the sensitive information—cannot refute that information, cannot correct the facts, cannot explain them, cannot respond to the quality of the information provided and the credibility of the informants?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315">(1315)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did the Supreme Court say that it was a miscarriage or denial of justice, as must exist for section 7 of the Charter to apply, but it also said that judges hearing the evidence <i>ex parte</i> are placed in a position where they cannot be impartial. Is this not tantamount to asking them to be investigators?</div>
    </p><a name="Para457915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court said that not allowing a person detained under a certificate to receive all of the evidence and be able to refute, explain and correct it, and to question the source of the evidence infringes section 7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court did not say that security certificates are unnecessary. Over the next year, the court invites the legislator to review the way in which certificates are issued. It is interesting to remember that the court gave the United Kingdom as an example. In committee, this was even brought to the attention of parliamentarians. The court even gives Canadian examples where the members of a House of Commons subcommittee, who were hearing from employees of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, were able to respect the security and confidentiality requirements and still carry out their parliamentary work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court also has the following observation, and again I will cite Justice McLachlin. Furthermore, no parliamentarian or minister has provided an explanation for this. I hope they will during our exchanges later. Justice McLachlin said, “—Why the drafters of the legislation did not provide for special counsel to objectively review the material with a view to protecting the named person's interest—as was formerly done for the review of security certificates by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, and is presently done in the United Kingdom...has not been explained”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom has also passed antiterrorist provisions. The court wonders why we did not take the same route. The court proposes a compromise between complete denial of access to sensitive information about the person named in the security certificate and the possible confidential nature of certain information in thwarting terrorist attacks, in other words a procedural fairness requirement, a requirement for respecting basic justice. The court says that if we want to maintain these balances, these powers that have to be balanced between national security, confidentiality of certain information, but also the rights of those who may be charged—who are in fact charged in some cases—then we need access to information. I hope the government will take this into account during the review it has been given one year to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I cannot believe that people were detained for five or six years. I am running out of time. However, we have to remember that different rules apply depending on whether the person is a permanent resident or a foreign national when it comes to a review of detention. A permanent resident gets this review within 48 hours and every six months. A foreign national can be imprisoned for 120 days without ever having their detention reviewed. As the Supreme Court pointed out, this does not make any sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will stop here, but, once again, I believe there is no reason to be proud today of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>. In my opinion, this House would have been better advised to listen to the Bloc Québécois when it gave these warnings. Fortunately, the Supreme Court was able to take an informed look at this legislation that offends human dignity and the best we can do is to review it.</div>

I do not know whether I understood it, but I will try to answer as best I can.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I believe that the Supreme Court has clearly established that the charter provides the same guarantees, the same protection, whether or not someone is a Canadian citizen, and that that must be applied. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that <i>ex parte </i>hearings are incompatible with the charter under any circumstances? No. For example, for fingerprint orders, in some cases of judicial release and in other situations, it is possible to hold a hearing where only one party is present. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not what we are talking about with regard to anti-terrorism provisions. What we are talking about is the fact that the person named in the certificate never has the opportunity to see all the evidence, especially so-called “sensitive” information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual is not only denied the right to see this evidence, but is not represented. First, this places the judge in an unusual position, and second, the individual's rights are denied. The Supreme Court focussed its analysis on section 7 of the charter. Other provisions were mentioned, such as arbitrary detention and the right to equality under section 15, but the Supreme Court based 80% of its judgment on this point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is disturbing. I repeat, what concerns me is that for a legislator, for a democrat, the end never justifies the means. Canada also had and still does have Criminal Code provisions on conspiracy, preventive arrest—section 810—and arrest warrants. All that is possible. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there was a desire to act quickly and that the government and the official opposition at the time misjudged the situation. The best thing we could do for Canada's reputation with respect to human rights, which has already been marred by the Arar case, would be to correct these provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court itself has proposed solutions. The Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security has also proposed solutions, but I am afraid that this government is so dogmatic and hard-nosed that it is likely to ignore such recommendations. I know what this government thinks of judges, and it is not very reassuring.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the appointment of the Attorney General, my colleague for Hochelaga has heard him reply to various questions and participate in certain debates.

Some say that he is charming, conciliatory and that he is very committed to being an honourable parliamentarian. However, we must look at the entire relationship that he may have with police forces and the complete respect that he must have for certain procedural guarantees that we are entitled to expect in a state which abides by the rule of law. My colleague is right: I am somewhat concerned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling has been handed down. It has put the government on notice to correct certain abuses. The Supreme Court identified potential solutions but it has given the government a fair amount of leeway. I hope this government will come to its senses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be true to history, I must also say that the government is not solely responsible because, at the time, the government of the day acted just as precipitously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to my colleague's question, I would say that I am somewhat concerned because I am familiar with the Attorney General's view of the police and judges. I hope that the Conservatives will nevertheless set aside a somewhat unfortunate dogmatism and will put forward solutions that respect the guarantees provided by section 7.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78629,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78629&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1934640"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the motion to extend the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Code, which, if they are not extended by a vote of the House, will lapse and die. Arguably, if there is a need for these types of provisions, new legislation will need to be introduced, thereby creating a gap in our law, if it is the will of the House and the government to proceed in that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These particular sunset provisions were added to the Criminal Code by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> after extensive justice committee study and public debate. I was very involved in the work of the justice committee and I do have some personal knowledge of those events at that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset provisions were inserted at the insistence of a number of people, including members of the House, for two possible scenarios. The first was the possibility that the provisions, which were quite new to the Criminal Code, might be misused in some way. It turns out that the sections have not been used and therefore have not been misused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason was in the event that the sections were not needed. Over time it was felt that the perceived need for this type of procedure might not be there and if the conspiracy that gave rise to this legislation was to end, diminish or calm, it could be argued that these more robust procedural provisions might not be necessary and that our ordinary laws might prevail and be usable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, I do not think either of those circumstances have occurred. There has not been a misuse of the provisions and the conspiracy that gave rise to them has not ended or calmed. I will speak to that later in my remarks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could say that these provisions were certainly not enacted because they were not needed. If they were not needed, they would not have been enacted. In fact, the public servants and parliamentarians who generated the legislation could see the need at that time and that is why they were enacted. One could argue that circumstances have changed and that is part of the subject of debate here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were the sections needed five years ago? I think the reason relates to the fact that there was an acknowledged gap in our criminal law, our common law, that simply evolved through the passage of time. Prior to the last century, the subject of security of the state was in the hands of the king. In fact, it was listed among the king's prerogatives and the king actually did take care of that kind of business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all read history books and seen the movies. The king and his forces would actually detain and arrest people who were conspirators against the state. I suppose they did not make fine distinctions in those days whether it involved a conspiracy, a sedition, a subversion or a treason. These were all components of the common law in those days. The king simply would detain the person, perhaps arrest the person and make use of the dungeon and eventually liquidate the conspiracy.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we entered into the 20th century, with the growth of civil liberties and written constitutions, it became apparent that our citizens needed rule of law. Commonwealth jurisdictions then adopted what were then known as the war measures acts. When the state entered into a serious war conflict, it relied on special legislation called the war measures act. It was used during the first world war and the second world war. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, in the modern context, those pieces of legislation were seen to be a bit too draconian for peacetime and therefore were dropped. We no longer have a war measures act. As a result, the legislation we relied on through the Korean War and the two world wars up to about the 1960s is no longer there so that the state cannot rely on any special provisions. It must use the criminal law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then had the terrible events of 9/11. Roughly 300 or 400 miles from here as the crow flies, we witnessed the events in Washington, New York and Pennsylvania. Following that, other events occurred in Bali, Madrid, Philippines, London and an almost event in Los Angeles. These events have been ugly. They were terrorist attacks, killing and maiming many and creating the maximum in violence, disruption and disorder. That is the nature of the threat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, we do not have the provisions that used to be contained in the war measures act, and not only do we not have those, but in years gone by the state could rely on conspiracy laws. However, with the evolution of modern evidentiary rules, it becomes very difficult to convict for a conspiracy. As a result, because the sections have fallen into disuse, not many police or crown prosecutors are good at using them and the courts are not comfortable with them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also point out that we no longer have grand jury investigations. These were part of our criminal process. A grand jury would be invoked, put in place and would investigate allegations of a criminal act or a conspiracy before they actually occurred or just after they happened but before criminal charges were laid. Two or three decades ago our jurisdiction stopped using the grand jury procedure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, our laws have given up on the war measures act, the law of conspiracy and grand juries. My point is that there has been, by happenstance, a gap in our law. In peacetime, our laws work quite well. We are always reforming them but our laws generally are up to the test, but when the state gets into a conflict or it is at risk, it would be my view that the state needs to rely on a different set of provisions. These sunsetted provisions in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, the Anti-terrorism Act, were intended to fill the gap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth noting that all of our major allies had to do the same thing. This is not just a Canadian story. Our allies in the U.K., the United States of America and Australia all had to legislate to fill this gap in their laws as well. That is a notable thing and we in the House should take note of it. This is not a circumstances peculiar to Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to segregate things which are not politically, legally connected. I have read some of the debates and I have seen some of the media on this. We are not dealing with investigative warrants under the Security of Information Act. We are not dealing with investigative warrants taken out by CSIS to deal with threats to the security of Canada under the CSIS Act. We are not dealing with continued detention under the Immigration Act. We are not dealing with security certificates, which are removal procedures under the Immigration Act. All of those things are outside the envelope of what we are dealing with here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with two sections. The first one, the investigative hearings section, is both retrospective and prospective in its stance. It can look in the rear view mirror at threats and offences and terrorist activities that happened previously, or prospectively or pre-emptively into the future. The second one is the detention with recognizance section and that is pre-emptive in perspective. In other words, it does not look backward. It is there for the purpose of pre-empting an imminent terrorist attack.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried in my own layman's way to conjure up a scenario when these sections would be used. This is one thing that is actually missing from the debate and I am not sure why. I am curious why security professionals or government officials have not offered a scenario which would explain a bit more clearly how and why these sections would be used. I realize that security professionals do not want to alarm the public. They do not want to reveal existing procedures. They are under oath to keep their information inside a security loop. These are probably some of the reasons we have not had that element of this debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also notable that this country's security apparatus is populated by officials who do not have the power of arrest. This is a very important distinction here. Most people think that CSIS officials can run around and scoop people off the street. The fact is they cannot legally or otherwise. CSIS officials are not even armed. They do not arrest people. The only people who arrest in this country are peace officers, that is, police officers. All the security professionals on the job are not able to make an arrest, whether it is at CSIS or CSE or in transport. They must be peace officers before they can arrest anyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we develop our intelligence data, it is important to realize that if there is going to be any pre-emption of a terrorist attack by an arrest, it would be done by a policeman, not by our security apparatus. Most of the information we get involving security and intelligence comes from the broader security and intelligence apparatus. Some of it comes from police intelligence, but the bulk of it comes from our security and intelligence apparatus and our allies. That is a very important and indispensable function.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we do not have a scenario here, I am going to suggest the scenario of a border attack somewhere on the Canadian border. I do not think I am being right off the page here in suggesting there could be an attack. I do not have to go into any gory details; let me just say that an attack is possible and that the attack is imminent. Let me suggest that police and authorities may not have all the data needed to obtain a Criminal Code warrant for any of the existing provisions in the Criminal Code. They may have only one or two persons identified. They may have a possible target identified. They may have detected part of a cell and a likely target. They may not be able technically to connect all of the dots necessary to obtain a Criminal Code warrant. If they can, then they can take out a Criminal Code warrant and make an arrest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me suggest as well that this data has not come from their own sources, but has come from an intelligence agency or an allied intelligence agency. I will assume for the sake of my scenario that the information is credible and real.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para457961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the potential for massive violence and disorder, pre-emption becomes the order of the day. It becomes a priority. If people are not sure what massive violence and disorder is, they should think about what happened in London, Madrid or New York City, just to get the flavour of what this is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these sections a peace officer using credible data, probably packaged by an intelligence agency, either domestic or ally, would then present the information very quickly to the attorney general of a province. If some members think that is time consuming, some of our constituents have to wait sometimes to see an MP or to see a cabinet minister, but I can say that getting through to the attorney general of a province on a matter of priority happens very quickly. I have had the pleasure of dealing with an attorney general on a matter of that nature, and it was a very prompt and a very quick turnaround time. The information is then packaged for an attorney general, who must provide consent in writing. The information is then taken to a judge, who must also sign off and issue the warrants. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for the use of these sections is judicially supervised in the beginning. It is consented to by the attorney general representing the government. It is managed by a peace officer, police officer, subject to the Criminal Code. The entire process in both sections has been judicialized. It is totally judicially supervised. There is a warrant, a judge, an attorney general, and a totally judicialized procedure. It looks awfully charter compliant to me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been mentioned that our courts have agreed that these procedures are charter compliant. An argument that the charter is a reason that these sections should not be renewed, in my view, respectfully to all of those who feel that way, is not on; I do not accept that. There may be other issues involving civil liberties that concern them, but certainly not the charter, at least not in a way that I have heard in this House or in the courts up to now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some side notes worth noting. Both the committee of this House and the committee of the Senate have reviewed these provisions and have reported back confirming their support for the provisions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there exists, as I pointed out earlier, an arguable symmetry between the provisions that we have enacted here and the provisions enacted by our major allies. They operate on the assumption, and I know there was collaboration back at the time these sections were enacted, that our legislation bears some analogy to their own, that when we deal with our allies, they will have the ability to act quickly, and when they deal with us, we will have a similar ability to act quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these two sections are to lapse, it is arguable that our legislation will not be so symmetric, will not coincide with the legislation of our allies. Since the threat of conspiracy persists, and I am informed that it does, they may be curious as to why we would allow these two sections to lapse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would attribute the argument that the sections have not been used to good intelligence work and good luck. Both of those have contributed to that. Regarding the suggestion that the sections are not needed, one only has to look at weekend reports from the United Kingdom, where public reports are that the threat level there is as high as it has ever been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect to many in the House who are concerned about the civil liberties aspects of this, I hope the record will show that these sections are charter compliant and that they are there for the benefit of Canadians as a whole as a protection order. I hope colleagues will take all of that into consideration in the vote.</div>

I think the court has it right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everyone in this House would agree that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should not be used as a recipe book for a terrorist attack. The challenge is to have a balance where the state has the tools necessary to protect the broader public interest, including preventing an attack, but at the same time ensuring that all citizens are treated fairly in terms of their civil liberties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made some mistakes as a country. We could argue they were minor; for the individuals involved they were serious. Failure to observe the letter and spirit of the charter has gotten us into difficulty. Our country would be better if we could observe the charter throughout everything. Getting that balance just right is the goal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In creating these provisions, the two we are dealing with, I cannot recall provisions which were subjected to greater charter compliant scrutiny at the parliamentary level than these. The provisions are littered with charter compliance mechanisms and sidebars. Although the court has not had the ability to test these provisions in a real life scenario, I am very confident that the court would be supportive of Parliament in doing whatever it thinks best, provided we give due regard to the individual under the charter.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, these are the kinds of remarks we consider when we try to strike a balance between the effectiveness of the proposed measures and the potential for abuse they represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para457984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honourable member quite rightly said that he himself was obliged to invent a scenario to explain when these provisions would be used. How is it that even though committee members asked, nobody else was able to identify a dangerous situation to which these provisions could apply, when there are other provisions in the Criminal Code, especially those against conspiracy?</div>
    </p><a name="Para457985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him, charges of conspiracy are now uncommon. Yet in my practice, I have seen a great many. They are very easy to prove because most of the time, they are uncovered by electronic surveillance. Even in the example he gave, there was clearly a conspiracy and, therefore, the potential for charging someone and bringing them before a judge, who could deny bail on the basis of the evidence presented. </div>
    </p><a name="Para457986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, too, want to strike a balance with effective measures. That said, they never have been and it seems they never will be, yet they are still dangerous.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are out of order because they are beyond the scope and purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A> for two reasons. These amendments now seek to indirectly amend the application of section 87.4 of the Canada Labour Code, a section requiring the maintenance of services where interruption would cause immediate danger to health and safety, which is a provision that is not originally included as part of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>.

    </p><a name="Para458245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is this beyond the original content of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>, it is arguably contrary to its original purpose. These amendments do not relate to the purpose of section 94 of the Canada Labour Code, the original purpose of that section being to proscribe unfair practices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of subsection 2.1, the amendment to subsection 2.1 of section 94 of the code is out of order because it is beyond the scope and purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment attempts to make the bill “subject to section 87.4” of the Canada Labour Code, which is a section, as I said, dealing narrowly with imminent danger to life and health in the event of a strike. Because section 87.4 is not referred to elsewhere in this bill, this is clearly a provision that attempts to reach back to this section. I therefore submit that the amendment is out of order.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to subsection 2.3 of section 94 of the code is out of order because it is beyond the scope and purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>.

However, this decision was overruled by the committee, which then adopted the amendment. Let me take a moment to explain why this amendment is beyond the scope of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 94 of the Canada Labour Code prohibits employers and unions from using unfair labour practices. This section would be changed under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A> by prohibiting replacement workers during a strike or lockout, and adding powers for the minister to investigate compliance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee chair ruled that the amendment to subsection 2.3 was out of order because it adds the new concept of “essential” services to section 94 of the Canada Labour Code, which is not relevant to that section.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand the context of the committee's decision, it is important to note that on February 14 the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78983,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78983&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Davenport</A> proposed an amendment to section 87.4 of the Canada Labour Code which sought to ensure the continuation of essential services in a strike given the ban on replacement workers proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>. The chair ruled that amendment out of order because section 87.4 was not opened up in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A> as originally introduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 87.4 of the code addresses the obligations of employers, unions and employees to maintain certain activities during a strike or lockout. It does not use the word “essential” to describe these activities. Rather, it allows the Canada Industrial Relations Board to designate which activities, services and operations must be maintained in order to prevent an “immediate and serious danger to the safety or health of the public”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the committee chair ruled on February 14 that amending section 87.4 was out of order, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78983,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78983&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Davenport</A> moved an amendment on February 15 to add a new subsection 2.3 in section 94 of the Canada Labour Code to set out essential services which must be continued during a strike. However, section 94 of the code does not deal with the continuation of services in any way but simply lists unfair labour practices for employers and unions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding the new concept of essential services in section 94 of the Canada Labour Code could affect the operation of section 87.4 by the back door by altering the way the Canada Industrial Relations Board would interpret section 87.4.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this amendment also attempts to broaden the role of the board, this amendment both reaches back and broadens the scope of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>. It is therefore out of order on both counts. What is more, this new concept of essential services is not a defined term either in the previous statute or in the amendment. No definition is offered. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1505"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1505"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1500"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1505">(1505)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to subsection 2.4 of section 94 of the code is also beyond the scope and purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>. The committee chair also ruled on February 15 that the amendment to subsection 2.4 was out of order. However, again the committee overturned the chair's ruling and adopted this provision. This amendment to the Canada Labour Code would add new powers to the Canada Industrial Relations Board regarding essential services during a strike or lockout. However, as noted earlier, section 94 deals with unfair labour practices, not the powers of the board for essential services. Therefore, the amendment to the proposed new subsection 2.4 significantly alters the nature of section 94.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also note that because section 87.4 of the Canada Labour Code provides authority for the Canada Industrial Relations Board to maintain services during a strike or lockout, the new subsection 2.4 would affect section 87.4 of the Canada Labour Code in two ways. First, it would provide the board with new powers to amend any agreement and it would supercede any decisions the board may take under this section. Second, because it introduces the new concept of essential services, it would undoubtedly change the interpretation of the board's existing powers for carrying out its activities under section 87.4.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the committee chair's ruling was correct. Subsection 2.4 adds a new purpose to section 94 of the code and it is not relevant to section 94. It is not in the jurisdiction of the committee or the House to alter, by amendment, a private member's bill so an entirely new purpose is introduced. Therefore, the amendment is out of order and should be removed from Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Marleau and Montpetit specify, at page 654, that an amendment must relate to the original matter of the bill. It states:</div>

    </p><a name="Para458266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would bring further precision to the manner in which the prohibition against replacement workers would be implemented and administered.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment, which is introduced the phrase “Subject to section 87.4, for the duration of a strike or lockout”, is consistent with the existing provisions of the code, which establish that there must be satisfactory resolution of all issues under section 87.4 before a strike or lockout begins. In fact, the CIRB, on many occasions, has interpreted section 87.4 to mean essential services. Therefore, it is not beyond the scope of the bill, nor beyond the scope of this section.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 once again are consistent with the objectives of the bill and simply seek to clarify the intent of the bill in terms of avoided any unintended effects.

    </p><a name="Para458269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these amendments are within the principle and purpose of the bill. I would ask in your ruling, Mr. Speaker, that you clearly look at them.

    </p><a name="Para458271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have a great deal of respect for my honourable colleague, I will show that these amendments do the exact opposite. This is a law that prohibits the use of replacement workers during a labour dispute. That is the general framework for the legislation. The proposed amendments more or less state the following: with this legislation prohibiting the use of replacement workers during a strike, we must refrain from applying the law in the case of essential activities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand how we can say that a point such as this, which excludes certain applications of the law in certain circumstances, is beyond the scope of the bill. The amendments limit the application of the bill in certain cases, that is, when essential services must be maintained. The hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons </A> says that essential services do not exist in Canada; they are not mentioned in the Canada Labour Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every responsible government on the planet recognizes that some essential services cannot be jeopardized under any circumstances. I have had interesting discussions about this with the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Labour</A>, who once told this House that hiring replacement workers could not be prohibited in the case of some essential services. The Minister of Labour himself said that. I remember that he rose in this House and said that this anti-scab bill could not be adopted because some services had to be maintained. He said that adopting this bill would threaten the economy, security and all sorts of things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we listen to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Labour</A>, we decided that we would respect his concern and support the amendments that restrict the bill's application. In all my years as a parliamentarian, I have never seen someone claim that an amendment clarifying the scope of a bill and limiting its application would broaden the scope of the bill. The opposite is true. As for the concept of essential services, the Minister of Labour went on at length about them in this House, saying that he could not accept the bill because of essential services. What is more, some federal legislation refers specifically to them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are told that this concept does not exist, I have to sound the alarm to wake up the Conservatives: it is in one of the most important pieces of legislation they have to enforce.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of essential services exists. The concept of public services exists. It is defined in two important acts. Another definition is to be added in a third act, the replacement workers act.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr. Speaker, in making your ruling, you might take this opportunity to convey to the House and through the House to its committees that just because we have a minority government and just because opposition members on committees are numerically and mathematically capable of overruling a chair, it does not mean that by overruling the chairs the issue involving the scope of the bill does not remain and that if the issue is not fairly dealt with at the committee, it could end up on the floor of the House, as it has today. This practice could multiply and accumulate if perhaps Mr. Speaker does not convey the message that the scope of the bill rules still apply at committee. Just because we can overrule a chair for whatever reason, it does not mean the issue will not come up here and that the Speaker will not accurately deal with that issue here.</div>

The letter stated that some Canadians born outside Canada to Canadians could lose their citizenship if they did not reaffirm their citizenship by their twenty-eighth birthday. That affected a member of my family.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanting to get to the bottom of this, I immediately contacted the office of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A> asking for clarification. It took the office three days before I received an answer. I also have faxed the minister several recommendations to follow in order to deal with this urgent matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports were coming out that this situation could affect up to 50,000 Canadians, according to Statistics Canada. The minister, while testifying at committee last week, stated that only a few hundred Canadians are affected. The deputy minister also stated that the department has undertaken an aggressive advertising campaign to inform Canadians of this problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we had witnesses at committee, the so-called lost Canadians, who gave testimony showing facts opposite to those given by the minister. We were given testimony that the people born in Canada have lost their citizenship. These people are about to enter their retirement age, and we could find ourselves with hundreds of thousands more Canadians affected. As witness Barbara Porteous said this morning, this is only “the tip of the iceberg”. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians will be affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with individuals who were born in Canada and also with children born to members of our military forces while serving abroad. We are denying citizenship to children born in Canada and to children born to Canadians outside Canada, children born to men and women fighting for our freedom in the theatres of war. These men and women gave their lives for Canada and to refuse their children the right to be Canadians is a shame and a despicable act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When witnesses in committee were asked today if the House should hold an emergency debate, they unanimously answered yes. In view of the minister having failed to inform Canadians of this matter, the onus is upon us to advise Canadians that they have or may have lost their citizenship. On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of lost Canadians, and in memory of our men and women of the armed forces, we owe it to them to hold this emergency debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fascinating as that might be, we will have to wait to see if there is going to be an emergency debate and then all kinds of members can make their views known on the subject. But it will be done in the context of the emergency debate and not on the question of whether we have one or not. The two questions are a little different. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways that this matter could be resolved, not just by debate but by of course changes to the Statutes of Canada, changes to regulations under the statutes, discussions among the members of the committee, and recommendations from the committee to the House, but I do not believe it is a situation that has resulted in an emergency within the provisions of the Standing Orders of the House. Accordingly, at this time, I am going to say to the hon. member that I do not believe the subject warrants an emergency debate in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stress to him, as I have on previous occasions to other hon. members, that by agreement among House leaders there can be take note debates in the House, and the committee that is studying this issue may wish to recommend such a course of action to the House leaders and have this matter discussed there with a view of having a take note debate. But to ask the Speaker to order an emergency debate on this subject at this time, in my view, is not made out in the comments made by the hon. member or in his letter. And accordingly, I decline the request at this time.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by telling the House what the motion is not. It is not about security certificates. It is not about the detainees in Kingston. It is not about the war in Afghanistan. And it most certainly should not be about partisan politics. It is about continuing to provide two important tools to Canada's law enforcement authorities to assist in the investigation and the prevention of terrorist attacks, nothing more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention in medicine, as we know, is the most economic and efficient way to reduce and prevent disease. Also, in law enforcement, prevention of the crime is much more cost effective and much more effective in every sense of the word than investigating an actual crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a great deal of hyperbole in this House in the course of this debate. The word “draconian” has been thrown around and there have been claims that these powers are an assault on the civil liberties of Canadians. Nothing could be further from the truth. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognizance with conditions power is not new or unusual in Canadian law. Similar powers exist in the peace bond provisions of the Criminal Code that aim to prevent the commission of personal injury and sexual offences as well as criminal organization offences. Parliament has clearly found it appropriate to take the preventative approach to these types of crimes. To argue that we should not do so for terrorist activity would be illogical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the recognizance portion of the two apparently very worrisome parts of the Anti-terrorism Act, worrisome in that some members choose to make more of these two provisions than they really should. As I mentioned, recognizance with conditions is already in the Criminal Code. These two provisions were inspired by existing provisions such as the recognizance with conditions power under section 810, where personal injury or damage is feared. As well, section 495 of the Criminal Code permits a peace officer to arrest without warrant anyone he or she believes is about to commit an indictable offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to investigative hearings, that we compel witnesses to testify at the investigative stage is new to criminal law, but witnesses have always been compellable at trial. However, this has parallels in the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act as well as the Competition Act, in public inquiries and in coroners' inquests, so this is not new.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the investigative hearing power, it has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. The majority of the court held that it does not violate section 7 rights of the charter and does not infringe on the protections regarding self-incrimination. In doing so, the justices described the situation we face as follows:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a complicated task for sure. We strive to maintain the rights and liberties that make Canada great while addressing a threat that strikes at the very basis of our society, but our Supreme Court has determined that Parliament got it right. Parliament got it right in the first instance. That is why we are here today, attempting to maintain that “getting it right”, to make sure of that in trying to maintain the delicate balance of rights and the protection of human life and property when we have to bring in acts such as the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard recently the comments of other prominent members of the Liberal Party. Anne McLellan, for example, has been quoted in the media as saying, “The situation today is, if anything, more dangerous and more complex and the powers have never been abused”. Why would we take these tools away from law enforcement? Former deputy prime minister John Manley also took the unusual step of issuing a statement in support of these powers. He stated, “I believe that cabinet and Parliament got the balance right in 2001-02,” and “I do not believe that anything has changed to make that balance inappropriate today”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension we are proposing does not in any way threaten civil liberties. In fact, if the motion were defeated, Parliament would be putting at risk what the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78453,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78453&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mount Royal</A> acknowledged as the most fundamental right we enjoy: the right to life, liberty and security of the person. The right to be protected from terrorist attacks is what we are addressing with this motion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members should also carefully consider the statements that have been made by the victims of terrorism in support of these powers. The Air-India families and others have made it clear that the investigative tools of law enforcement must not be curtailed. Many have reacted with shock and dismay at the prospect of losing the investigative hearing power which may yet provide the answers to the questions surrounding the deaths of 329 innocent airline passengers in 1985; 329 innocent airlines passengers who died as a result of one of the most horrific terrorist acts that has been portrayed on Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia's solicitor general has also echoed these concerns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding my statement, I would like to clarify one other matter relating to reviews of the Anti-terrorism Act being undertaken by committees in both Houses. I do appreciate the fact that the House of Commons committee tabled an interim report last October on these powers. I appreciate its diligence and hard work. I am proud to say that in this House today there are two members of that committee. The government continues to await the final reports of both committees. I am proud to say that those reports are within weeks of coming to this hallowed institution.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540">(1540)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the committee's reports, I can tell the House that all told, the work totalled some 44 meetings over 83 hours and literally hundreds of hours of research. The committee's report will be thorough and it will be comprehensive. I can assure the House of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of delays in the parliamentary review of the Anti-terrorism Act, the committees have asked their respective houses for more time to report. The government also needs more time. We need more time to delicately fine tune a piece of legislation that is already providing the kind of protection that this country needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking for support to extend these provisions. The government is simply saying it does not want these important powers to expire while it is considering the House of Commons committee's recommendations and awaiting its final report. We also hope to soon receive the Senate's input. I believe we have recently done so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we are seeking only a three year extension, not five years, but a three year extension. It is a temporary extension that will allow for proper government analysis of the entire workings of the Anti-terrorism Act and the preparation of an appropriate government response and subsequent parliamentary debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be responding to the subcommittee's interim and final reports together. This has been our intention all along. But we must not allow timing issues to scuttle these important provisions. If the Anti-terrorism Act reviews had been completed by December 2005 as anticipated by the legislation and not interrupted by the last federal election or other delays, this would not be an issue today, but the parliamentary reviews were delayed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending the powers for three years will give effect to the original intent behind the sunsetting and parliamentary review clauses of the act; namely, the debate on the sunset clause would be fully informed by the final reports of both parliamentary review committees, as well as by the government response to their recommendations. The government's motion will ensure that these measures are not lost by default in the absence of this informed debate.</div>

I am going to inform the House and my hon. colleague on some of the issues surrounding investigative hearings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 83.28 and 83.29 of the Criminal Code allow the courts to compel a witness who may have information regarding a terrorism offence to justify and provide real evidence. The process is as follows and here are the protections in this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the prior consent of the attorney general, a peace officer investigating a terrorism offence that has been or will be committed may apply to a judge for an order requiring a witness who is believed to have information concerning the terrorism offence to appear before the judge to answer questions or produce an item of real evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the judge believes that there are reasonable grounds that the person has information concerning a past terrorism offence, the judge may make an order for the gathering of information. If the judge believes there are reasonable grounds that a terrorism offence will be committed in the future, that the person has direct and material information and that reasonable attempts have already been made to obtain the information, the judge may make an order for the gathering of that information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the safeguards with regard to these investigative hearings? Only a judge of a provincial court or of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction can hear a peace officer's application for investigative hearings. We see that there is a protection to society that says if a police officer has some information that he or she thinks is important, the police officer cannot willy-nilly make arrests. The police officer must first go to a judge to ensure that the rights of the person who has that information are protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that there is additional balance the prior consent of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general or solicitor general of a province is needed before a police officer can apply for an investigative hearing. We see the maintenance of balance and those protections are not only there but they continue. The law of this country makes sure that police officers go through the appropriate steps with the appropriate counterbalances to ensure the right thing is done. There must be reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorism offence has been committed and that the information concerning the offence, or that reveals the whereabouts of a person suspected by a police officer having committed the offence, is likely to be obtained by the hearing before an order is granted. Or there must be reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorism offence will be committed, reasonable grounds to believe that a person has direct or material information that relates to a terrorism offence and reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the information from the person.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that there are balances. We can see that the previous government kept in mind and that this government continues to keep in mind and to maintain those balances which are necessary to ensure that person's rights and freedoms are protected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I previously stated, the Supreme Court has upheld these two so-called controversial parts of the Anti-terrorism Act. That is the protection that Canadians need to know and do know are there.</div>

He and I had the opportunity to be members of the subcommittee appointed by the public safety committee to examine the Anti-terrorism Act. Indeed as he mentioned in his remarks, an interim report of that subcommittee was presented to the main committee, the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. The main committee adopted that subcommittee report and reported it to this House in October.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note since I was one of the authors of the report along with the hon. member, that the subcommittee made a number of recommendations to, in its view, improve the operation of the two sections in question. I wonder if he would like to comment on them.</div>

As he knows, I cannot get into certain specifics but I can tell the House that the hon. member provided the committee with what I would say was the major part of the revisions that were enacted. The reason we did so is a testament to his work ethic and desire to ensure the Anti-terrorism Act is fine-tuned in order to make it more relevant to today's needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the committee's deliberations, we discussed the powers the police or the state actually have and whether those power were radical. We decided they were not. At one point we were specifically referring to recognizance with conditions. Recognizance with conditions was inspired by the existing powers of the Criminal Code, such as recognizance with conditions under section 810 where personal injury or damage is feared. We know those provisions have been and continue to be used.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, we know that section 49 of the Criminal Code permits a police officer to arrest without warrant anyone he or she believes is about to commit an indictable offence. One of the great protections of the Anti-terrorism Act is that it permits police to apprehend individuals before the terrible thing happens, before an aircraft is blown out of the sky or flown into a building. This is one of the necessary components of the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to investigative hearings, witnesses can be compelled to testify at the investigative stage, which is new to the Criminal Code, but witnesses' testimony has always been compellable at trial. However, as I mentioned before, it parallels the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, the Competition Act, as well as in public inquiries and coroner's inquests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee deliberated and considered those provisions and I am confident that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A> will be introducing them as a result of the comprehensive work my friend has alluded to.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to give a very emotional speech as to what we must watch out for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my own background. I have experienced lack of freedom, living in a totalitarian society. I must say that I have a great deal of concern when I notice in Canada now that we have both the former commissioner of the RCMP and the present Chief of the Defence Staff becoming political. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan Delacourt, the Ottawa bureau chief of the <i>Toronto Star</i>, made a profound statement the other day when she said, “Men with guns getting political”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clauses on which we are sunsetting, preventive arrest and investigative hearings, have not been used. However, a person in this House has already been a victim of a drive-by smear as his name was linked to those investigative hearings that are supposed to be secret. Even though we never used the legislation, we saw the drive-by smear happen right in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really must ask my colleagues in the House a question. Let us think back to 9/11 and those terrible times. In spite of all the actions that we have taken: the American invasion of Iraq; us going into Afghanistan; the naming of the axis of evil by the President of the United States, Iraq, North Korea, Iran and Syria; the building of Guantanamo north; and the holding of people without charge, have they made our world a safer place?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600">(1600)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is a critical question to ask because we are heading down a path that threatens every civil liberty and human right that we have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what happened at the Maher Arar inquiry. We all know that officials involved in those hearings have undertaken a systematic campaign to smear Mr. Arar. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Mr. Arar? He is a Canadian citizen with the highest profile case of anyone who has fallen victim to the fight against terror. When we see what happened to him and how our security officials conspired with the American security folks to send him off to be tortured in Syria and when he came back and we knew he was innocent, those very same officials continued to smear his name. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Arar is still on the no fly list in the United States. I think that is relevant. This man was completely exonerated and the Government of Canada belatedly apologized to him but he is still on the no fly list in the United States of America. That speaks to the kind of impact Canada has with the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest things that bothers me about the investigative hearings is that on Friday we heard that the security certificate process is unconstitutional. The security certificate process is the biggest assault on anyone's civil liberties in this country. Canadians should not become too comfortable and believe that it does not apply to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at it. In 1977, the security certificate was put in for non-residents. Under a security certificate, people can be held without knowing the charge against them. They can be held, have trials where they cannot attend, have the decision made by one judge and the only person that person can listen to is the police and the prosecutor. Then we have places to lock them up indefinitely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1977 security certificate was only happening to those people with no status in the country. In 2001 we extended that to immigrants with status in the country. All of a sudden they fell under this draconian piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, an attempt was made, lest Canadians feel too comfortable that it did not apply to citizens, to put the security certificate into the proposed citizenship act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so incredibly dangerous? It is very simple. Any information that is given for a security certificate is never tested. All there needs to be is an investigative hearing, go on a fishing expedition and someone else from the security service takes it into a security certificate hearing and, bingo, untested evidence, a rumour, third source removed, can be responsible for locking people up indefinitely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying that if a security certificate is combined with the investigative hearing there is a real possibility of disaster, which is why the Supreme Court struck down the security certificate. Unfortunately, it will not strike down the security certificate for at least one year to give Parliament time to fix it, if it is fixable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate that our collective safety depends on no one community in our country being stigmatized. I think this is important. We know that racial profiling does not work. Every minority group in our country has some bad people and Canada is a country of minorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have legislation under the Criminal Code that can deal with it. What we must ensure is that we do not let our freedoms, rights and civil liberties become a victim of terror.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we can have a divergence of views on an issue like this. That is what the House is all about. I think it is very important that we have a divergence of views on the basis of fact and not on the basis of opinion or innuendo.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if the hon. member would reconsider his statement that the Supreme Court struck down security certificates as being inaccurate. It is my understanding and my reading of the decision that the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the method whereby security certificates are judged to be reasonable or unreasonable, and gave the government one year to come up with a more compliant methodology to ensure that the certificate is deemed reasonable or unreasonable with the accused having proper access to the appropriate evidence against them so that they can answer that evidence. I wonder if the hon. member would reconsider his words.</div>

One thing I do know is that it is still in effect for one year. I do know that if individuals miss a security certificate hearing where there is absolutely no representation for these people whose liberty is at stake, and who do not know about the charges against them, or who is giving evidence against them, that there is no testing of evidence whatsoever. Like I said, combine that with an investigative hearing and it is like a neutron bomb against civil liberties and human rights.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation with the sunset clauses that we are discussing today came into being right after 9/11. There was a need for reaction. We were getting pressure from all sides. The government of the United States was certainly pointing a finger at Canada and saying the terrorists had come from Canada. Later on it came out that this was not the case. Plane after plane of individuals flying to North America had come to seek warmth in Canada. Planes were landing on our tarmacs. I do not even remember the President of the United States, Mr. Bush, thanking Canada for what we did for our cousins to the south.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, times have changed. Yes, terrorism is here. Osama bin Laden is said to still be alive. Things are a mess in many parts of the world, be it in the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, Iraq or Afghanistan. However, the need to have investigative tactics and to take people's civil liberties away, especially from our citizens, is something that I personally never favoured and find very hard to support, and I will tell members why.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in a country where there were two extremes: the right and the left. People who were fighting for freedom against the Nazis during World War II, after the freedom fight was over, were branded as being communists and were labelled pretty close to being terrorists. Some of those individuals and part of that legacy remains with my family.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember hearing from my family members how they were incarcerated on islands. One of the techniques that was used to interrogate people was to put a man in a flour sack, put a cat in the same sack, and then dump the sack into the sea. The cat would panick and begin to scratch the individual. This would just demoralize the individual that was put into the water with the cat. Tactics such as those are still used in some countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what happened to Mr. Arar when we gave wrong information to the folks in the United States and he was sent to Syria, and certainly we apologized for it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still the situation today, although it is not as bad, of the three detainees, at what a lot of people and myself have called Guantanamo North. These are the three detainees that were detained under security certificates issued by the Liberal Party, and they certainly continue today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether those certificates are right or wrong or these people are tourists or not is not the question that I want to address. The question that I want to address is the way they are treated at Guantanamo North, Millhaven, or whatever we want to call it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals have had all their rights, their right to appeal, their right to speak, and their right to ask for privileges, taken away from them. They do not have a means of redress. If people come to a disagreement, they have an ombudsman they can go to. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Correctional Service Canada we have what is called the Correctional Investigator. Although this individual is part of Correctional Service Canada, with a memorandum of understanding with Citizenship and Immigration and with CBSA, we still do not know who is looking after the detainees. The Correctional Investigator has absolutely no way of dealing with what they need. They had 20 issues that they wanted to deal with and all 20 issues were struck down. The citizenship and immigration committee members went to see them. As a matter of fact I, myself, went to see them three times. These individuals are on a hunger strike in order to address their needs and their complaints.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a protocol in place, should we tomorrow have more detainees, on how we deal with them. Certainly, the current minister of CBSA is not willing to listen to this committee's requests, nor suggestions from members from both sides of the House. The Conservative Party wants to extend the clauses in the legislation that would be sunsetting.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when the minister was the leader of the opposition, when it was the Alliance. I remember him taking a brush and painting all the Tamils in Canada, and came close to calling them terrorists in relationship to the LTTE. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Hon. Jim Karygiannis: </B> For the members across who are making some noise, I had an exchange with the minister, and it certainly can be read in <i>Hansard</i>. I questioned him on how he was willing to use a paintbrush and call the whole Tamil community terrorists, how children were being affected who were going to school and being asked by their schoolmates if they were terrorists. It sort of went in one ear and out the other of the former leader of the opposition.</div>

It has done absolutely nothing to reassure Canadians who could have been under scrutiny, be it people from Lebanon who associate themselves with Hezbollah, or all kinds of people who are Canadians first and foremost. These organizations are the ones we are looking at and the government has done absolutely nothing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes indeed, this issue will be an election issue. Let us not fool anybody.

    </p><a name="Para458432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made up of the two founding people, the French and the English. It is made up of the aboriginals, and it is made up of another pillar that holds the whole table together. It holds the whole house together, and these are the immigrants, the people who have recently come to Canada in the last 30, 40 and 50 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every group that comes somehow gets paintbrushed and tainted. Do we forget the incarceration of the Ukrainians? Do we forget the incarceration of the Japanese and the Italians? Do we forget, recently, the incarceration and the way that we are dealing with the Arab community? Certainly not. However, the Conservative Party does not seem to understand, so let me leave them some words of wisdom.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four words that certainly the Conservative Party does not want to listen to and this is why I have been heckled by members opposite. Those four words are very simple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect one's neighbour as an equal. Respect the guy down the street as a Canadian. Accept individuals as part of this great country. Celebrate our diversities and embrace our common future, and when we put those four words together, respect, accept, celebrate and embrace, and take the first letters of those words, it spells race.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things that we on this side of the House never forgot is that we are all part of the human race, and this is why this legislation has to be sunsetted. Unfortunately, that side of the House, the Conservative Party, is supporting legislation that is very draconian. It comes down to the fundamental issue of wanting to support its reform agenda by pitting one Canadian against another Canadian.</div>

It is an absolute ridiculous statement to say that the Conservatives are not in favour of that protection. That is why we are here. That is why I am here. Where we come from has nothing to do with it. It is what we want to do in the future for our country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other comment the member made, which I thought was very interesting, was that a Canadian was a Canadian and what did we did to the Lebanese. He should check the website of his new member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79028,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79028&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halton</A>. The new member for Halton in the newspaper, on his website and in his blog talked about whether we should spend all our taxpayer money bringing back part time Canadians. It is a Liberal member who stated that, not our guy. He needs to have a little discussion with the new member of his party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not believe that terrorism is still as much of a problem today as it was on 9/11 and previous to that? With the changes in technology and in the world, is terrorism not as much an issue as it was ? Should we not do everything possible as a Canadian government to protect Canadian citizens from further terrorist acts?</div>

I will take this opportunity to explain, particularly for the benefit of the members of that subcommittee who have worked so hard on this issue, the government's intentions when tabling the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important to mention that the government fully endorses and has supported at every opportunity the reviews being undertaken by the House and the Senate committees. The subcommittee's report of last October on the sunset provisions, which was adopted by the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, was an important first step in the review process. However, allow me to clarify exactly what the majority recommended in that report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority made six technical recommendations regarding the drafting of the legislation, but there were three key recommendations: first, that the sunset provisions be extended to December 31, 2011; second, that there be further parliamentary review before any additional extensions beyond the first extension; and third, that the investigative hearing provision be amended to make it available only when a peace officer has reason to believe there is imminent peril that a terrorist offence will be committed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must be understood is that given the time constraints established by the Anti-terrorism Act, it has become necessary to proceed with the debate on the joint resolution on the sunset provisions before the parliamentary committees have concluded their reviews of the Anti-terrorism Act. To be sure, it is not the ideal situation, but the government has had to introduce the resolution without having received and without being able to respond to the final reports of the parliamentary committees currently reviewing the act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to advance the motion would allow the provisions to expire by default. This is why we are proposing a three year extension as opposed to the five years as recommended by the House of Commons committee. There is a compromise here. Three years is enough. It will give the government the necessary time to receive and review the final reports of both committees and to design an appropriate response.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not get me wrong. I do not fault the House or the Senate committee for the delays that have been encountered with respect to the review of the Anti-terrorism Act. The legislation provides that the review was to begin within three years after the act received royal assent. As royal assent came in December 2001, the review started in December 2004. That was in the 38th Parliament whereby both committees undertook extensive and thorough studies of the act and its operations together with reviewing other related issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate special committee held almost 50 meetings over the 2005 spring and fall sessions and heard from a variety of witnesses, including not only a number of ministers and government officials, but also from a wide variety of academics, non-governmental organizations, including many from different ethnocultural groups and civil liberties groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For its part, the House committee held almost 30 meetings over generally the same period of time and, as was the case with the Senate committee, heard from a variety of witnesses. The last witnesses heard were the former minister of justice and the former minister of public safety and emergency preparedness. At that point, in November 2005, both committees had retired to write their reports. Then the reviews were interrupted by the fall of the government in November 2005. Dissolution of Parliament meant the halt of the Anti-terrorism Act reviews.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the election of January 2006 and the installation of the new government, the reviews were recommenced. However, a lot of time was lost. The Senate committee was not re-established until May 2006 and the House of Commons subcommittee did not get going again until June. As a result of the summer break, the committee's work was almost immediately put on hold again, this time until late September 2006. At that time, the reports of both committees were anticipated to be tabled by December 2006. Both committees, however, recognized the difficulty with this. The House of Commons subcommittee has now moved its final deadline to the end of this month. The Senate committee has pushed its deadline to March 31.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anti-terrorism Act envisaged a certain timeline. The legislation would receive royal assent. Three years later, parliamentary reviews would be undertaken. The review in committees would report within a year and the government would then have a full year to respond to the committees before facing the sunsetting of the powers we are discussing today. For reasons beyond the control of the committees, this timeline has been abandoned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, the government is now in the position where it has no input from the Senate committee and only the recent recommendations from the House of Commons subcommittee pertaining to this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that the House of Commons subcommittee tabled an interim report in October 2006, understanding full well how tight the timeline was and I appreciate their diligence and hard work. However, the government continues to await the final reports of both committees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of delays in the parliamentary review of the Anti-terrorism Act, the committee had asked their respective Houses for more time to report. The government also needs more time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking members of the House to support the extension of these provisions, the government is simply saying that it does not want these powers to expire while it is considering the House of Commons subcommittee's recommendations and awaiting its final report, hopefully soon, and the Senate's suggestions and final report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting to extend the provisions is not a vote for the status quo. It is a temporary extension that will allow for the proper governmental analysis and the preparation of an appropriate government response and subsequent parliamentary debate. I want to make it abundantly clear that this motion is worded so as to comply with the statutory provision for renewing these provisions found in the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some in the chamber have been asking why the motion simply extends the current powers. Why does it not take into account recommendations that have already been made? The answer lies in the wording of section 83.32 of the Criminal Code. That statutory provision only allows for a resolution to extend the application of the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions clauses. It does not allow for a resolution to be passed that changes these provisions in any way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only flexibility allowed by section 83.32 of the Criminal Code is that the period of extension may not exceed five years. Thus the resolution may provide for a period of extension which is less than five years. This is the case today, for the period of extension that the government seeks is for three years only, not for the full five year maximum.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who argue that the government is somehow disrespecting the subcommittee's intentions by proposing a three year extension must realize our limited options at this late stage. They should also consider that the effect of voting against the extension is to strike down and completely countermand what the committee recommended. The subcommittee recommended that the provisions continue in their effect, but with alterations. Voting against the motion means that the powers will disappear completely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested that these powers were meant to expire all along. This is simply false. There is no best before date on this legislation. If that were true, then there would have been no procedure built into the act that would provide for the possible renewal of these provisions. We all know that the act did provide such a procedure.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that one would have expected, as indicated earlier, that the act contemplated that the parliamentary review would have been completed, and that the parliamentary debate surrounding a motion to extend the sunsetted provisions would have been fully informed by the parliamentary recommendations and the government's response to them. We have seen that things have not quite turned out as planned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the House of Commons subcommittee has issued an interim report, we have not heard from the Senate yet nor had the final report from the House committee, and the government has not had the opportunity to provide its response to a completed parliamentary review of the act. To approve the motion to extend these provisions another three years would allow the original intent of Parliament to be realized. To defeat this motion, however, would be to defeat Parliament's original intent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do know is that these powers have not been abused and that Canadians would be able to benefit from having these provisions in place by having these provisions renewed for another three years. I cannot, however, say that allowing them to sunset will not have serious consequences.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to pick his brains somewhat on what I consider to be the crux of the issue. When most of us were handling red hot copies of the decision on Friday around 9 or 10 o'clock we saw that there are provisions in other acts that deal with the war on terror Canadian style, which is much more deliberative cooperation between the judiciary, the investigative and the legislative branches. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growth in terror legislation and how it is being interpreted. We have talked a lot about the 2004 <i>Vancouver Sun</i> case on section 83.28 vis-à-vis investigative hearings. We are up in the air with respect to preventive arrests. We saw on Friday that legislation was attacked successfully in part. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell from my colleague's speech that this debate is very important to him. Does my colleague concede that we need, in addition to this debate, to take a holistic approach to anti-terrorism legislation in this country as the Senate report says?</div>

Some pretty hefty words have been bandied about here today, and I do not want to drag the conversation down in any way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to arming our border guards, the reality is that there is one party in the House that actually thinks our border officers have the capability to defend our borders. We are providing them with the capability to do their jobs even better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer his question indirectly, I would put it back to the member. With respect to a holistic approach, or an approach that encompasses not just the clauses in the Anti-terrorism Act that are about to expire, but all other aspects of government responsibility for providing security, whether it is through airport security, whether it is gathering intelligence by CSIS, or whatever the case might be, the important thing is that we have mechanisms in place to prevent terrorist acts. For example, law enforcement officers should have the ability to intervene through a court order in the presence of a judge and stop or prevent a terrorist act from occurring. Is that not really important? That is what is at stake.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no safer today than we were five years ago when the bill was originally drafted and presented to the House. It was a Liberal government then and it is a Conservative government now. Members from all parties recognized the serious threat of terrorism and its impact on society. It happened in the United States, but we have had acts of terrorism in the past. There is the Air-India inquiry. The allegation is that failing to let these clauses continue will actually jeopardize this inquiry and jeopardize finding out who was accountable and what problems occurred in protecting the security of our citizens. We can only learn information from that inquiry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member, if I remember correctly, is trained in the field of law. He knows this legislation has held up. These clauses that are about to sunset have held up to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. member to support the extension of the Anti-terrorism Act clauses and do the right thing for all Canadians when the opportunity presents itself.</div>

I listened very carefully to my hon. friend's chronology. I want to say that for the most part of his chronology I agree with it completely. I think he has set it out correctly. I think he has set out the conundrum that we have found ourselves in, where the clock has continued to run, notwithstanding the fact that there have been intervening events, such as a general election, which prevented the subcommittee from in fact concluding its work.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also sure the member knows that the subcommittee concluded its work on the main portion of the Anti-terrorism Act last week and referred its report to the main committee. The House gave an extension of time on Friday to the main committee requiring it to deliver its final verdict on the Anti-terrorism Act by March 27. The reason for that is, as the hon. member said, time just keeps on going and yet there is not enough time for us to deal with this given the nature of the time limits within the legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the chronology of what report was released when and what the subcommittee did or did not do, the reality is that even if I have 95% of it right, which I think the hon. member would agree, the recommendations have been that we extend the sunset clauses for up to five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's position is that we would like to extend them for three years.

    </p><a name="Para458492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to respond to what we have heard from some other hon. members during the course of this debate. For me, the most important point is that the threat of terrorism has not gone away since we last debated the Anti-terrorism Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 there was sufficient concern in the House about the potentially damaging effects of investigative hearings and recognizance powers that we would return to them after five years and see if they had been misused and if they were still justified.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider then where we are today. Have the powers been abused or caused any great harm to our system of tolerance, democracy and the rule of law? Quite the contrary, in the past five years recognizance powers have not been used at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the one case where an investigative agency sought to use an investigative hearing, the result was litigation all the way to the Supreme Court which held that the power to conduct hearings and the related legislative scheme not only meets charter requirements, it exceeds them in at least one aspect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court did not just uphold the provisions; it told us how best to use them in practice. Its judgment has provided very helpful direction on how cases should be conducted in the future to ensure conformity with the charter and the appropriate balance of security, investigation, human rights and transparency issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the record of the previous five years speaks for itself. What it says very clearly in my view is that the powers are not a threat to our human rights and civil liberties. The most, and worst, opponents of the powers can say is that they might be abused somehow, someday. That is precisely what they said in December 2001 and the result was the five year deferral we see today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should our decision today be any different? They are no more a threat now than they were in 2001. If anything, the record should reassure those who have concerns that they will be used, if at all, only when absolutely necessary and only then with restraint. If abuses ever were to occur, we have in place the same judicial and other safeguards in the future that we have had in the past, reinforced by developments since 2001. Those protections will become even stronger with the passage of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum impairment of human rights is one of the principles under which the charter is applied and by which any use of these powers has been and will be tested by the courts. We should be reassured by this. It is also a very practical requirement and one reason the powers are only used as a last resort.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to use these powers. Investigators will not use investigative hearings if lesser means will work, because they are difficult and complex to arrange and they make it impossible to use anything the subject says as evidence if that person later turns out to be involved as a terrorist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizance orders have always been limited to scenarios such as domestic violence where we know that a crime is likely and we believe it necessary as a society to intervene before the crime is committed to prevent harm to the victims. These are also scenarios where the conventional powers of the criminal law, especially deterrence and the threat of punishment have proven not to be effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law enforcement agencies use these powers when they must, but will always find it easier to investigate and prosecute past crimes rather than to predict and prevent future ones. Unfortunately, some crimes are sufficiently horrific that we have a moral obligation to Canadians and to anyone else who may be victimized to do everything in our power to prevent them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the threat posed to Canadians by the investigative and recognizance powers has not increased in the past five years, what of the threat of terrorism itself? In 2001 we adopted the powers with the sunset clause in the hope that in 2006, looking at terrorism with more experience and a greater perspective, we might conclude that they are not necessary because the threat of terrorism has gone away. Can anyone in the House make such a claim? I certainly cannot. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to review what we have learned since the act took effect at the end of 2001. There have been horrific attacks on innocent civilians in Colombia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Canada and Canadians have been publicly identified by leaders of al-Qaeda as targets of future terrorist attacks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our engagement in Afghanistan has cost the lives of 44 Canadian soldiers, including a very brave young man from my riding of Sarnia—Lambton, Private William Cushley, who fought alongside his comrades of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment. Their great work to free millions from the oppression of these terrorists has unquestionably brought us to the attention of international terrorists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more disturbing trend has been attacks on those involved in development and reconstruction. Peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, UN staff members and one of Canada's own diplomats have been murdered, people whose mission was nothing more than to improve the lives of the world's poor and marginalized and address the social conditions that breed hatred. This is work to which Canadians have always been committed and from which we cannot and will not be deterred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been a number of cases in which the vigilance of officials, using the legal powers provided to them by governments, have detected and foiled plots. These include plots that would unquestionably have killed and maimed Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot, in view of the evidence, suggest that the threat of terrorism has gone away. It clearly has not. If anything, we stand today at greater risk than we did when these powers were first enacted. We have stood by our principles abroad in the global fight against terrorism and we have much to be proud of but there are costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having fought terrorism abroad, we must also fight it at home, both for our own sake and because we made this commitment as a member of the international community. Our most fundamental principle in fighting terrorism is that we must do it in ways that respect the rule of law and which accord with our values as Canadians. We have not seen these values eroded in the past five years. We have seen them strengthened as our courts have upheld the legislation and as other states have used it as an example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to conduct investigative hearings and to obtain and impose recognizance conditions is an important part of Canada's anti-terrorism legislation. I wish I could say that they were not but I do not think that I or any member of the House can reasonably conclude that Canada is not exposed to the threat or risk of terrorism or that we will never need powers such as these if and when such a threat materializes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have said that they are not needed or justified because we have not been attacked or that we have rarely or never used these powers. My house has never yet caught fire and I hope it never will but I still expect the fire department to come if it does and to have the tools to put out the fire when they get there. Just as I expect my city to protect me from fire, Canadians expect the government to do all it can to protect them from terrorism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we in this country can say that we live in such fireproof houses that we can start selling off our fire trucks just yet. There is no doubt that these are strong measures. I do not see the fact that they are seldom used as evidence that they are not needed. I see it as evidence that our law enforcement officials are exercising restraint in not using them unless absolutely necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first commitment must be to the safety and security of Canadians but we also have other obligations. As an ally and as member state of the United Nations, we also have obligations to prevent and suppress international terrorism.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655">(1655)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such obligations. For example, in resolution 1373 of the UN Security Council, which was adopted in the wake of the September 2001 attacks against the United States, we are directed not only to refrain from supporting terrorism but “to take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts, including by provision of early warning to other states”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is binding on Canada as a party to the charter of the United Nations and we are regularly called upon to report to the Security Council's counter-terrorism committee on what we have done to implement the requirement. Can we truly say that we have done all we can to detect pending terrorist attacks and warn our friends, neighbours and allies if we allow these power to lapse?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also party to treaties against terrorism, including the 1997 and 1999 conventions for the suppression of terrorist bombing and terrorist financing. Both of those require us to criminalize specific terrorist activities, as we have done, but they also call on us to provide all other states or parties with the widest measures of legal assistance in relation to their own criminal investigation. They also oblige us to investigate offences in Canada and to alert other interested states.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treaties do not specifically require us to impose recognizance or conduct investigative hearings but we are obliged to have effective powers to prevent and suppress terrorism and to assist other states. There is no question that our capacity to meet these obligations will be weakened if these powers are allowed to lapse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in turn has other implications. Canada has taken a very strong position against international terrorism. We have supported strong and effective measures in international law and we have engaged all of our military development and reconstruction capacity in an effort to ameliorate and redress the conditions in Afghanistan, which spawned the worst acts of terrorism the world has ever seen, in the hope that they are also the worst the world will ever see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world allowed Afghanistan to become a failed state which paved the way for extremist groups like al-Qaeda to create a home base in which to launch their war of terror. Canada reacted by going to Afghanistan to meet the needs of this failed state. Canada also reacted at home for the need to strengthen our own laws. When there is need, Canada has responded. If we find ourselves in need, we expect our allies to respond in kind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will other states make of this weakening of resolve? How will they react if we allow these provisions to lapse? Canada has not just taken a strong position. We have also taken a balanced and nuanced one. We understand that, as a threat to human rights and the rule of law, terrorism must also and always be fought from within the frameworks of human rights and the rule of law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others may have succumbed to the temptation to take direct action, Canada has not and we should all be proud of this. Our own Supreme Court said as much when it upheld the power to conduct investigative hearings under the charter. It said:</div>

<td><small>--the challenge for a democratic state’s answer to terrorism calls for a balancing of what is required for an effective response to terrorism in a way that appropriately recognizes the fundamental values of the rule of law. In a democracy, not every response is available to meet the challenge of terrorism. At first blush, this may appear to be a disadvantage, but in reality, it is not. A response to terrorism within the rule of law preserves and enhances the cherished liberties that are essential to democracy.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court did not just find that the power in issue met this test but that it exceeded it, especially in the protection against self-incrimination that was embedded in the legislation. It also set out conditions for the use of the provisions and ground rules for media access and transparency that ensure continuing conformity with the charter and fundamental Canadian values and safeguard human rights while ensuring the effectiveness of anti-terrorism measures. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the justices who wrote that opinion saw first-hand what can occur when the rule of law breaks down. Not long before that judgment, Madam Justice Louise Arbour was prosecuting offenders before the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia. Not long after that, she was appointed to one of the most important positions in the United Nations, that of high commissioner for human rights. In that capacity, she has continued to strongly advocate the need to fight terrorism from within the framework of the rule of law and she has cited this legislation in a Supreme Court decision on it as an example of how this can be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, we have a duty to Canadians to be vigilant and that includes an obligation to protect and defend human rights. It also includes an obligation to protect and defend human security. We have pursued the goals of human security in the international community. Our obligation is to do no less at home here in Canada. Human security includes the security of Canadians. We have sought ways to protect ourselves and, in these measures, we have found a path that is effective and balanced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has said that it is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, and I agree. As long as the threat of international terrorism remains, so will our obligation to counter that threat and to protect Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enacted these provisions on that basis in 2001. No member of this House can say that the threat has gone away. The threat to our basic rights and values does not lie in these investigative and preventive powers. It lies with those who would kill and maim Canadians in an attempt to shake our faith in those values.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I will vote to extend these powers and why I urge all hon. members of this House to do the same.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have five years of experience under our collective belts and with one notable exception, the provisions have never been used. The Air-India inquiry is the notable exception, but at the committee, in caucus and on the floor of the House, I cannot recall any member, any minister or any official ever saying that this could have a retrospective application. Therefore, in some respects, the Air-India inquiry comes to me as a surprise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was sold to us on the basis that it would have only a prospective application; that is, the police, or the RCMP or CSIS would have reason to believe that something bad was about to happen. Then they would use the provisions, which we are talking about, to prevent that bad thing from happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the section for an inquiry like Air-India was certainly something that did not cross my mind and possibly did not cross the minds of many of those who voted in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No legislation is proposed in an isolated environment. Laws are proclaimed and laws are withdrawn on the basis of experience. What is our experience thus far?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the security side of the ledger, clearly we are much better prepared than ever. We have had arrests and incidents which have thus far been contained by good intelligence and good police work. On the funding side, we have built up the capability of our intelligence, police, security and military services over the past five years with very significant resources. I dare say that those budgets have possibly grown the most of any budget passed in the House in the last five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the human rights side of the equation, however, the record is somewhat less clear and not nearly as sterling. We just had a Supreme Court of Canada decision, which was a unanimous decision, that detention certificates were unconstitutional. Taking away the liberty of the citizen and others without trial, without access to the evidence and without counsel is an anathema in a free and democratic society. I thought the court's comments were balanced, reasoned, fair and respectful to Parliament and the government's foremost obligation to protect its citizens.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Arar could have used some of that protection. I cannot recall a case of any Canadian citizen in all of our history where the rights of a citizen have been so abused. Supplying dubious intelligence, cooperating in the extraordinary rendition by a foreign country, knowing that he would be tortured or having reasonable apprehension that he might be tortured is about as bad as it gets. The result is the resignation of the RCMP commissioner, an apology from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and compensation in excess of $10 million.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, Justice O'Connor's inquiry is even having effects in European nations, where European nations are reconsidering their willingness to allow airplanes for the CIA to land on European soil in order to complete these renditions to other countries. In those countries there has been a great deal of soul-searching going on as to what laws and what cooperation they will offer in the future.

    </p><a name="Para458550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective merits of whether to sunset or not sunset are irrelevant to the tactics narrative, tough on crime, tough on terrorism. The reality is that security, citizen's rights, reasoned debate and just plain common decency give way to the tactics narrative in pursuit of a majority. Destroy a live, who cares? Destroy a family, who cares? Destroy a nation, who cares? “I have got my majority”.</div>

He took a newspaper article and tied it to a member's family and the Liberal position on these clauses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, it was fundamental to ask questions like these, after all he is the senior political officer in our country. How did the newspapers secure a secret list of potential witnesses? If someone handed him an article just before question period, is that not a fundamental question? It seems fundamental to me. How did that newspaper receive that secret list? Would it not be perfectly ordinary for any prime minister to ask, who would leak such a thing? Why would they leak such a thing? What is the motive?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for no other reason but simply to protect his own government, would he not ask, “Could my government have been involved in such a leak?” Would he not ask that kind of a question? Is that not a straightforward question to ask before he would engage in a long term smear, knowing full well that these sections on sunsetting or not sunsetting were going to be implicated in some way?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is not worried about his own government and he wants to get in his tactical narratives, et cetera, surely to goodness he would have the victims of the Air-India inquiry in mind. These people have been seeking a form of justice for literally years now. Would this not be a fundamental question to ask? “Is my attack on the hon. member going to compromise the integrity of that inquiry?” Is that not a fundamental question?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not even know whether he does not care. I think he will do absolutely anything to get a majority and he really does not care how he gets there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are witness lists not to be held in the strictest confidence? What little association I have had with inquiries is that they are guarded like Fort Knox, so how does one get those kinds of witness lists?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are the victims of Air-India. As I say, these people have sought justice for years. Surely to goodness a scurrilous and baseless allegation such as this will only lead to the undermining of the quality of that inquiry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look back on my time here and my time on the justice committee, I feel some justification for my skepticism. I do not think that we can deal with terrorism lightly. I do not think we can just join hands, sing <i>Kumbaya</i> and hope that terrorism will somehow or another go away. Terrorism is real. There are indeed those who wish to do us harm. Some even live among us. And threat assessment is not an exact science. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as legislators we must only create laws that are proportionate to the reality of the threat. In my view, these provisions are an overreach, disproportionate to the threat, and cannot be justified in a free and democratic state. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now had five years with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>. The evidence of the need for these sections was sketchy at the time. The government of that day felt sufficient discomfort to build in an exit ramp. No evidence in these five years has come forward to justify the retention of these sections. This continues to be a significant intrusion into the rights of all Canadians. Therefore, it is my view that these provisions should sunset.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I put it to you that actually the government had been offered a couple of other alternatives.

I am somewhat disappointed not to see the government coming forward with legislation that reflects the hard work of that committee. I am also disappointed that the government has not come forward with legislation that reflects the work of the Senate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard arguments in the House that the election intervened and things of that nature. What I have read of the reports is that there are certain decisions that could be taken, that could have been presented by the government, and which would have addressed a number of the significant human rights concerns that have been raised over the course of this period of time, while still addressing the security concerns, those twin responsibilities of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that our leader has offered cooperation to the government in the event that the government could present comprehensive legislation such as this, but, for whatever reason, the government has chosen a straight up, straight down vote. Unfortunately, I therefore find myself in a position where my skepticism over this period of time has been justified, and my view is that these impugned sections should be allowed to sunset.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, he stated that the Supreme Court ruled that the security certificates are unconstitutional. I believe the hon. member knows full well that the Supreme Court ruled that some aspects of the application process are problematic, and the court provided some guidance, and a year, to Parliament to implement such provisions. So I wonder why the hon. member would make such a statement when he knows that in fact this is not the case. In fact, when the changes are made and the government does respond, I hope the member will support those changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I heard the member refer to a scurrilous attack on a member of this House. I presume he is referring to an attack that did not happen. We saw that members on the Liberal side were in a frenzy the other day when there was a reference to an article in a newspaper, but I did not hear any of these members taking exception to the journalist who wrote the article or to the newspaper which published the article that linked a member of this House to the matter before the House right now, and as far as the Air-India inquiry is concerned, and to the provisions we are discussing today. Now I hear the member alleging that somehow the government might be responsible for the newspaper article itself. I wonder where he gets that from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act that we are discussing today are necessary to sorting out and getting to the bottom of the Air-India inquiry. It was the worst terrorist incident in the history of this country, with 329 Canadians dead, and I think the question of a bungled investigation is part of what Canadians would like an answer to. I wonder why the member and his party are not supporting those provisions so that we can go ahead and get to bottom of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he stated just recently that these provisions are not justifiable in a free and democratic country. He knows full well that the Supreme Court itself ruled that the investigative hearings are justifiable. Is the member disagreeing with the Supreme Court?</div>

    </p><a name="Para458577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My comment pertains to something my hon. colleague mentioned. In looking at the act with respect to recognizance with conditions, section 83.3, otherwise known as preventative arrest, that section deals with “reasonable grounds” to believe “that a terrorist activity will be carried out” or “to prevent the carrying out of the terrorist activity”. So indeed, that is in fact forward looking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for investigative hearings the act states, “A judge to whom an application is made under subsection (2) may make an order for the gathering of information” if he or she believes “there are reasonable grounds to believe that...a terrorism offence has been committed”. That is the past. Then it goes on to also talk about future terrorist offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly within the purview of the investigative hearing that it can be used for the prospective, for the future, and this is one of the reasons that the subcommittee in its report, which it presented to the main committee and which the main committee adopted, recommended that the investigative hearing provision be amended so that it may deal only with the future. Because clearly it can deal with the past, and the committees were of the view that once an offence has been committed there are sufficient investigative tools in the arsenal of the police that they do not need investigative hearings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the hon. member pertains to his historical recollection. The hon. member and I are in neighbouring ridings. I recall very specifically his passionate concern about these two sections. In fact, I remember us having public hearings in Scarborough with affected communities, where we talked about these very issues and about the perception that certain communities were being targeted. In his speech, the hon. member said there was a lot of worry that these sections might be used in such a way as to abuse citizens' rights. I want to know if that is in fact the main reason he recalls that--</div>

    </p><a name="Para458583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly in the environment of the time we did not talk about retrospective application of investigative hearings. Possibly we should have, but we did not. I do not recollect any debate either in the House or in committee about that very point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with my colleague with respect to those communities that felt they might be affected and aggrieved by these particular sections. I have no concrete evidence that this in fact has happened. Nevertheless, it is a significant and worrisome intrusion on people's civil liberties and there is some justification in some communities to feel that they are targets of this particular legislation. I wish that were not so, but I am afraid it is.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brief 10 minutes that I have to speak on this very important topic, I want to say what my interest in the subject matter is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2004 I was appointed as one of three representatives of the Liberal Party to review the Anti-terrorism Act. We worked long and hard from December 2004 until approximately October 2005. When we were about to begin drafting our report, it became obvious that an election was looming and we were unable to complete that report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new Parliament, the subcommittee was reconstituted under the aegis of the public safety and national security committee. I was again appointed by my party as one of the Liberal representatives on the subcommittee, the other one being the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78509,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78509&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke North</A>. We worked from the time the subcommittee was constituted literally until last Tuesday to complete our final report which was then sent to the public safety and national security committee for its full review. That committee will review it and report no later than March 27. A tremendous amount of work has gone on in that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to people who might be watching what we are debating today. We are debating a statutory order and it is very specific. It is very specific because it is proscribed by the language of section 83.32 of the Criminal Code. There is no wiggle room. We either extend these sections or we do not. That is what the section says and that is what the statutory order has to follow. Unfortunately, that is a major problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Houses of Parliament have been studying this legislation and have heard from a tremendous number of witnesses as to what is or is not good or bad about it and what should or should not be tweaked. Unfortunately, the Senate only reported last Thursday and as I said, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security will not even be able to report until more or less the end of this month, long past the time these sections will sunset unless they are extended.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sections talk of two things. The first is investigative hearings. Under this provision, a peace officer, with the prior consent of the attorney general, can apply to a superior court or a provincial court judge for an order for the gathering of information. If it is granted, the order compels a person to attend a hearing before a judge, answer questions, and bring along anything in his or her possession.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second deals with recognizance with conditions which is otherwise known as preventive arrest. With the prior consent of the attorney general, a peace officer, believing that a terrorist act will be carried out and suspecting that the imposition of a recognizance with conditions or the arrest of a person is required to prevent it, may lay an information before a provincial court judge. That judge may order that person to appear before him or her. A peace officer may arrest, without warrant, the person who is the object of the information, if such apprehension is necessary to prevent the commission of a terrorist activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we are talking about. Both of these provisions are known to Canadian law. There are equivalents to investigative hearings which are investigatory and not intended to determine criminal liability within the context of the law related to public inquiries, competition, income tax, and mutual legal assistance in criminal law matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, there are provisions similar to recognizance with conditions that do not necessarily adversely affect rights and freedoms within the criminal law related to peace bonds issued to deal with anticipated violent offences, sexual offences, and criminal organization offences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both legislative measures are consistent with and grow out of provisions well known to Canadian law. Both provisions have sufficient protections to ensure that rights and freedoms are protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to both investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions, there has to be prior consent of the attorney general. Judicial authorization is required, and a judge presides over the proceedings themselves among other protections set out in the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere fact that a legislative measure has not been used, and these have not been used, does not mean that it is no longer required. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee which reported to this House believes they should be retained within the arsenal of tools that should continue to be available to counter terrorist activities. It also believes, however, that legislative amendments are required to this part of the code to restrict and clarify some elements of this part of the anti-terrorist law adopted by Parliament. The committee advised Parliament of six or seven specific amendments that it suggests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Liberal legislation. I voted for it. On March 22, 2005, Anne McLellan, the then minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, appeared before our subcommittee. On March 23, 2005 the then minister of justice appeared before our subcommittee. In both cases they indicated that there was nothing wrong with these provisions and they urged the committee to recommend that they be continued.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new Parliament on November 16, 2005, the then minister of justice and the then minister of public safety Anne McLellan, appeared and advised us again that we should extend these provisions. On June 21, 2006 the minister of justice and the minister of public safety of the current Conservative government appeared and said the same thing. In fact, one would have thought they were reading the same speech prepared by the same bureaucrats notwithstanding that they were different governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the evidence that we heard. Given that, we have four arguments, as I see it, not to extend. Some would argue that these provisions are contrary to the charter. I simply dismiss that argument. It is simply not a valid argument. The provisions have been found to be constitutional. In fact that is what the ministers of justice told us. We have been told that they are not used. If these are sunsetted, then they are gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recollection of history is that the sunsetting clauses were put in because there was great fear that these sections might be abused. Not only have they not been abused, they have not even been used, but that does not mean that they might not be used in the future. As one of my colleagues said in caucus last week, just because he has not had an accident and deployed his airbags does not mean that he is going to take the airbags out of his car. I could not agree with him more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would say that the provisions are not needed any more. I would ask on what basis does someone make that statement? All of the people who have access to top secret information in this country, law enforcement officers, the ministers of the Crown of both the Liberal and Conservative governments, top bureaucrats dealing with CSIS and CSE and all of those organizations, urged us not to sunset these clauses. They are the people with the knowledge that we do not have. They are the people who have top secret clearance and get to see things that we do not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask those who say that these provisions are no longer needed, what is the evidence upon which they base that argument, especially in the face of our committee specifically hearing time and again from people with the highest clearance possible that in order to protect this country, these clauses should not be allowed to sunset.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say they are perfect and that is why our committee issued an interim report urging the government to consider certain amendments. These sections are going to sunset. If they sunset, they cannot be fixed. Yes, we can bring back legislation later on; to try to bring them back in a fixed form is entirely possible, but it is very difficult for me to comprehend why we would be told by those who have information to which we can only possibly guess that these sections should not sunsetted. It is difficult for me to understand why we would allow them to sunset. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very difficult area. Someone else in my caucus said that this is an issue where reasonable people can reasonably disagree on an issue. I agree with that, but I have to look at the people who have the knowledge. They are the people who have top secret information and they have told us that these sections are required to protect our country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can I say in contributing to the debate other than those observations.</div>

He has worked exceptionally hard, which must be recognized. The other committee members also recognize his hard work. At long last, there was a committee that managed to work beyond party politics, and that tried to find the best possible balance between respecting rights and the effectiveness of measures taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is precisely one area on which we could not agree. I will nevertheless ask my hon. colleague the following.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not surprising that, not only were these measures not used, but that no one could give us an example of a case in which they could have been used? No one was able to explain to us how these measures could have prevented terrorist acts that have already been committed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, when new legislation is proposed, as this was in 2005, the burden of proof lies with those who are proposing new measures that go against the Charter, for example, or at least against current judicial rules. It is up to them to demonstrate that those measures can in fact be useful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, this legislation is so poorly written and so complicated that no one has the knowledge or the time to study it and pass judgment. In fact, the debate is precisely on a matter of trust, as the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78403,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78403&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough Southwest</A> pointed out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we trust those who are saying they need it or do we trust those who are defending individual rights, such as the university professors who have studied this and who are saying it is dangerous? Again, I believe the onus should be on those who are proposing to maintain an exceptional measure in our law.</div>

In my opinion, he has contributed invaluable work, not only for the positive suggestions that he has made but for asking questions just as he did. If we do not have questions like that, then we do not advance the debate, dig deeper or burrow down and find out the answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what he says, one of the examples that was given of the potential use of investigative hearings was in the context of the Air-India debate. I am not talking about what has transpired in the last couple of weeks. I am talking about long ago when the RCMP was still investigating. We were told that it was contemplated but that for a variety of reasons it was decided it would not be used. That would be a example of the kind of technique that would have been put in place at that time and a concrete example of what it could have been used for. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the answer we have been given is along the lines of what my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78463,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78463&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Guildwood</A> was talking about, and that is to try to prevent something from occurring as opposed to doing something about something that has occurred. The whole idea is to have a range of tools that the police can use in a situation where there are reasonable grounds to believe that something has happened but not enough perhaps to get a warrant or enough to pull someone off the street. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the arguments that was advanced by the previous Liberal minister of public safety was that just because it has not been used, who is to say that it has not been effective. Perhaps simply because it is on the books it has been effective. </div>

The then minister of justice and attorney general, Anne McLellan spoke in support of that legislation, including the two provisions that were not then but are now the subject of sunsetting clauses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rose in the House at the time and expressed the view that I had 10 civil libertarian areas of concern with the proposed legislation and which included the two provisions at issue, on which I elaborated subsequently in speeches and in an article thereafter in the <i>14 National Journal of Constitutional Law</i> entitled, “Terrorism, Security and Rights: the Dilemma of Democracy”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussions with the minister and government at the time, I made certain recommendations regarding these areas of concern. While I remain still concerned about certain provisions of the bill, such as the definition of terrorism itself, an aspect of which was recently invalidated by the courts, citing, as it happens, my article at the time, I ended up supporting the bill because the government amended the proposed legislation in many of these area of concern, though I still maintained certain reservations about it as set forth in the article.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the amendments I proposed and which the government accepted was that these two provisions at issue be sunsetted after three years, which has now stretched into five, and pending parliamentary review of these provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view today that these provisions do have provision for executive oversight, as in the requirement for consent of the attorney general, for parliamentary oversight, as in the requirement for annual reports from both the federal and provincial ministers concerned at Parliament and the provincial legislatures, and a judicial oversight to judicial review. The Supreme Court, as has been mentioned before in the House in the matter of investigative hearings, has held these provisions to be constitutional.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the sunset provisions may be said to comply with the charter and are not otherwise unknown in Canadian law. For example, preventive arrest is effectively the invocation of a peace bond process set forth in section 810 of the Criminal Code, which has been used to protect against criminal violence, such as domestic violence, sexual violence and organized crime, and extends it now to suspected terrorist activities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the investigative hearings are not unknown in Canadian law. We can find it under the Coroners Act, the Inquiries Act, in section 545 of the Criminal Code and I can go on. All that is also set forth at length in my article respecting those two provisions at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising then that five years later reasonable people can and do reasonably agree on the import and impact of these provisions. We can take the view to agree or disagree. We can take the view, as many in my party do, that since the provisions were not used, they are therefore not needed. Or, we can take the position, as I have, that since they have not been used this demonstrates that they have not been abused and that they in fact may be needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, while I initially proposed that these clauses be sunsetted subject to parliamentary review, following the experience of the last five years, as I have just summarized, and my own experience as minister of justice and attorney general, I now favour their extension. However, as I have said, this is a position on which reasonable people can and do reasonably disagree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret, therefore, that the government is proposing the extension without taking the views of these parliamentary committees into account in the House and the Senate. I regret that reference was made to a prospective investigative hearing impugning thereby the reputation of a member of the House and undermining thereby the integrity and the independence of that very inquiry itself, and seeking to link it to a debate on the sunsetting of these provisions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even if we support the extension of these provisions, as I do with certain safeguards and after parliamentary review, this prejudicial invocation was inappropriate, irrelevant to this debate and wrong. I regret the references made by ministers of the crown that our party is “soft on terrorism”. That is to politicize the debate, which should be addressed on the merits, and convert a debate on which reasonable people can and do reasonably disagree into one of bumper sticker slogans and smears.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, for those reasons I cannot support the government's motion. It has been proposed without the benefit of parliamentary review on appropriate safeguards and it has been advanced in a politicized and prejudicial fashion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would support the extension of these provisions with appropriate safeguards after parliamentary review at the appropriate time. My position for now and for those who will now follow is that of a principled abstention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the court's decisions regarding the definition of the Anti-terrorism Act need to be revisited; since the Security of Information Act has also had provisions quashed; since the Supreme Court of Canada has now unanimously invalidated the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that deny the named person on a security certificate the right to due process, the right to a fair hearing, the right to know the information against him or her and be able to answer and rebut the charges; since the Supreme Court has suspended the impugned provisions for a year; since the question of deportation to a country where there is a substantial risk of torture is otherwise before the court; since, elsewhere and during the period that I was minister of justice, the whole question of the security certificate regime puts us in a Hobson's choice of having to either deport to a country where there is a substantial risk of torture on the one hand, which I said as minister that I would never support, or prolong detention on the other, aspects of which have now been invalidated by the court; and since the security certificate regime scheme needs to be revisited because of this Hobson's choice; therefore, given the need for a comprehensive look at the entirety of our anti-terrorism law and policy, which includes not only Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',73328,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=73328&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> but the Security of Information Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the provisions in the Canada Evidence Act and a whole holistic approach to anti-terrorism law and policy review, I cannot support the government's motion at this time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I trust that we can have a principled discussion and debate with respect to the whole question of anti-terrorism law and policy that does not end up being a politicized and prejudicial debate, but one in which we can arrive at an all party agreement, both as a matter of principle and as a matter of policy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the relationship between protecting security and protecting human rights, I think the relationship must be based on the principle of protecting human security. There are two approaches to this. The first is to see terrorist attacks—particularly those committed by international terrorists—as attacks on the security of our democracy and on our individual and collective rights to life, security and protection of freedom. However, the application of the Anti-terrorism Act and of anti-terrorism policy must still work with the rule of law, with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and with the principles of human rights.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two provisions we are discussing are I think two of the most far-reaching provisions of that anti-terrorism legislation. They call for investigative hearings of material witnesses in terror cases, and also there is the question of preventive arrest without bail for 72 hours. These were two of the most controversial and perhaps most dangerous provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was because of this that parliamentarians of the day, often spurred by representatives of the New Democratic Party, added the sunset provision. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the MP for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78734,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78734&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Elmwood—Transcona</A>, who was key in that debate. Because of the concern about those provisions in particular and how they upset due process and challenged civil liberties in Canada, the provision for a sunset after five years was added. Now we are up against the timing of that sunsetting of these two provisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased that in this corner of the House we remain consistent on these issues. We opposed these provisions at the time they were debated in this House and included in the Anti-terrorism Act and we continue to oppose them today. We see them as fundamentally problematic and cannot support their continuation, even for a shorter period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I begin, I want to remind members of the House and those who might be watching of the atmosphere that surrounded legislatures in the west after the events of September 11 in New York City and in Washington, D.C. For me, one of the key interventions in that debate was that of representative Barbara Lee, the only American federal politician to vote against the emergency measures introduced in Congress after September 11.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it was a very brave stance that representative Lee took at that time. It was very brave to stand in a vote that was 420 to 1 in the House of Representatives. A similar vote in the Senate was 98 to 0. She put herself on the line to say there was another way, to say that draconian measures, and in the case of the United States military action, were not the appropriate response, that they were not the only response to the situation that had presented itself, to the tragedy and the terrible loss of life that happened in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her speech on the resolutions before Congress at the time, she quoted a member of the clergy. This has been attributed to her on many occasions, but I think she was actually quoting a clergyperson who said “as we act, let us not become the evil we deplore”. I think that characterizes the atmosphere and the difficulty that all legislators faced after those tragic events on September 11.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we keep in perspective the situation that presented itself there? How do we keep in perspective the fundamental values of our society when we are up against the evil of a terrorist act such as we witnessed on that day? I think we have to very careful that we do not let terrorism win by compromising our fundamental values. I fear that in the case of these two particular amendments that are sunsetting shortly, hopefully, that was in some sense what was happening even in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-terrorism legislation and these two particular clauses were I think very difficult in terms of protecting civil liberties in Canada, in terms of respecting the charter. I know that some of them have been tested in the courts, but I think I can still hold the opinion that they are a fundamental affront to civil liberties and the basic principles of fundamental justice in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in particular communities there has been particular concern about the effect of that legislation and of these clauses, and I want to quote what I believe is another important moment in the discussion around these kinds of measures. I will quote from an address by Dr. Tyseer Aboulnasr from the University of Ottawa, who spoke several weeks ago on here the Hill at an event to mark the contributions of Monia Mazigh and Maher Arar. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote what she said at that time. I think it is very important and apropos to the current discussion. She stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para458665"></a><p>
      <div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Friends, let us never forget that nations are not judged by the laws they write up and lock up in libraries, nations are judged by how they act at times when their dedication to these laws [is] truly tested. Every country that has chosen to sacrifice the liberties of its citizens and hold them in shackles has done that out of belief that this is necessary for its security. We, Canadians, know better. We know that security without liberty is simply imprisonment. Nothing is more secure than a maximum security prison. We deserve better. We cannot let Canada turn into a maximum security prison by imprisoning one Canadian without the presumption of innocence till proven guilty and without the full opportunity to defend themselves.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para458666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the end of the quote, but I think it is a very crucial addition to the discussion we are having today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have ultimate respect for the system we have put in place, for the fundamentals of that system, for the kind of justice that is meted out in Canada, or do we believe we need to suspend those rules in the face of those who would seek to terrorize Canada? I fundamentally believe that we do not need to go down that road and that we can have ultimate respect and faith in the system we have put in place without special measures like the two clauses we are discussing today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss these clauses. They were particularly problematic clauses of the anti-terrorism legislation. I am glad there was consent to include this sunset, but again, I think that shows how deeply parliamentarians were concerned about these two particular provisions and why there was agreement to have this sunset clause included in the anti-terrorism legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever we move to undo civil liberties and the key processes of our justice system, I think we must have, at minimum, that protection. Whereas I do not believe these clauses were necessary and certainly in this corner of the House we argued against them at the time, I am relieved that we have the opportunity to review them in this way today here in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a significant question about whether these kinds of clauses are even necessary. I believe they are already covered by the existing Criminal Code of Canada and the Criminal Code amendments made at the time of the Anti-terrorism Act. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A> points out very clearly that none of the offences related to terrorism are dealt with lightly by the existing criminal law in Canada. The Criminal Code would treat any matter related to terrorism very severely. There is no doubt about that in our Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anyone in this place can imagine that anyone in the justice system would look upon those kinds of crimes lightly or that anyone in drafting our Criminal Code would suggest that there would be any light penalty for those kinds of actions. That is already part of our Criminal Code. I do not think that we specifically need these particular provisions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para458676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear that when we make for exceptional circumstances, for the suspension of our basic process and basic civil liberties in Canada, we often get to the point where we use those kinds of laws. We may think that we are above doing that, but our own history has shown that we are not above using those kinds of measures at a time of panic and trouble. One of the best examples was the internment of Japanese during the second world war. Hundreds of thousands of people were removed from their homes and sent to the interior of Canada without probably good reason. In fact, we had to apologize appropriately for that and pay compensation for the internments. That was a very sad part of our history, a time when very draconian measures were taken, I believe without cause and inappropriately so, against Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worry that when this kind of measure is on the books in Canada, that despite our best intentions, our intentions of respecting civil liberties and due process, that at some point we may opt to exercise those and suspend those liberties inappropriately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also look to the experience of the War Measures Act in the early 1970s. Hundreds of people in Quebec were rounded up and detained, never to be charged. We know the extent of what happened at that time in Quebec was limited to a small group of people who could have been charged effectively under provisions of the existing Criminal Code. Yet hundreds of other people were caught up in a moment of panic and concern about what was happening in the country at the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of legislation was used that I am sure most Canadians never thought would have to be used. Most Canadians were concerned about the use of that kind of legislation. I am glad the CCF and New Democrats spoke strongly against the imposition of those kinds of measures at the time. Again, it seems that we have attempted to be consistent in our concerns about the suspension of civil liberties and the use of those kinds of draconian measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial to remember that we cannot say we will never use those kinds of measures, that we need them as fail-safe measures. Our own history has shown that too often we have been prepared to sacrifice civil liberties for no appropriately good cause in the end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is clear that the current Criminal Code has similar provisions to the two clauses we are talking about now. The clause regarding preventive arrest is dealt with in a number of places in our law, particularly in section 495 of the Criminal Code, which states that a peace officer may arrest without warrant a person who on reasonable grounds he believes is about to commit an indictable offence. The provision says that the arrested person must then be brought before a judge who may impose the same conditions as those that could be imposed under the Anti-terrorism Act. The judge may even refuse bail if he believes the person's release might jeopardize public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Criminal Code has this kind of provision around preventive arrest, but it does so without suspending civil liberties and due process and remains a part of the tested and honoured traditions of our justice system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause we are discussing is around investigative hearings. Some people say that section 810 of the Criminal Code also deals with this. This section states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para458684"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

    </p><a name="Para458685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person is then summoned, and not arrested, before a judge who can then order the person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for any period that does not exceed 12 months, and comply with such other reasonable conditions prescribed in their recognizance. The judge cannot commit that person to a prison term unless the person refuses to sign the recognizance. That is another provision.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our current Criminal Code such provisions already exist within the given circumstances of the existing law and process. On that basis, I really have even further trouble supporting the extension of these two clauses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the Supreme Court handed down an important decision that goes to some of the same issues. It was decision on the security certificates. In the unanimous decision the court made it clear that there was a serious problem with the security certificate provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in the way they suspended the accused's right to know the evidence against him or her and to test that evidence in court. The court suspended the provisions for a year to give Parliament the opportunity to take action to fix this serious problem. This drives home the problems that exist when these kinds of special measures to deal with perceived problems of terrorism or perhaps organized crime are introduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of secret evidence goes as a fundamental departure from due process in our justice system. I was pleased to hear that the court recognized this very clearly in its ruling. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fundamental problem with the security certificate intention is that deportation to face torture or death can also be contemplated. There is no excuse for ever deporting someone to face torture or death. Canada would be violating many of its international commitments if we ever took that kind of action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security certificate process is fundamentally flawed in many ways. This is driven home as well by the fact that three people are presently being held at the Kingston Immigration Holding Center on security certificates. They are participating in a hunger strike. This hunger strike has gone on for 83 days, a very serious length of time. It is about the conditions of detention at Kingston. It is about the lack of an appropriate grievance procedure. It is about the inability to do appropriate religious practice. It is about the inability to have private family visits. This hunger strike is about many important issues relating to the conditions of detention in that place. I am concerned for the condition of the men being held there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these men have existing health problems that make a hunger strike even more dangerous to their health. Hunger strikes that last over 49 days are considered a risk for permanent damage to one's health or even death. At 83 days, these hunger strikes have gone on well beyond that point. Still there has been no action by the government to find an end to the strikes, or to find a resolution to some of the issues that have been raised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and ultimately the House have put forward a reasonable solution to the government. We have been calling on the government to appoint the correctional investigator to act as the ombudsperson in this case and to find a solution in exactly the same way he does for anyone incarcerated in a federal penitentiary. Given the majority vote in the House and given the fact that it provides an appropriate way out of this terrible dilemma for the government, I urge it to move on this without any further delay. I fear someone will die on the government's watch if action is not taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indefinite detention without charge or conviction has no place in Canada. Some have suggested that the use of a special advocate would overcome that. It has been proven in the UK that special advocates cannot abide by the process because it is such a fundamental departure from due process and the principles of fundamental justice, and many of them have resigned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concerns about these clauses are very significant indeed. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that there are some times when civil rights, as we are talking about these days, kind of collide with the larger rights.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the balance in this debate has been skewed somewhat where the rights and freedoms of individuals, though they are to be protected and defended, are perhaps taken to the point where we put ourselves as a society and a country at risk for terrorism attacks.</div>

We know any activity related to terrorism or even plotting those kinds of activities is illegal and subject to severe punishment. There is no deficiency that would merit suspending basic civil rights, due process and interfering with the way our justice system operates to protect us from the possibility of terrorist activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to provide our police and intelligence agencies with the resources they need to do the job we require of them, to investigate issues around terrorism or organized crime for that matter. We need to ensure they have the resources they need to do those jobs appropriately and effectively. I do not think they need these extra provisions outside of what is already in the Criminal Code, outside of what is available in their usual process around investigation and toward laying charges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that our police and intelligence agencies are cooperating. We know in the most difficult example of terrorism to face Canada, the Air-India bombing, there was a real problem in the investigation of this terrible tragedy where so many Canadians and others died.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the RCMP and CSIS had difficulty working together. Because of that there were very serious problems with the investigation and ultimately with the case that was presented against people who were ultimately charged after a considerable period. We know too that our police and intelligence agencies did not have the ability to do the kind of investigations they needed to do. For instance, they did not have the language capacity to do the important work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of having all the new bells and whistles and the fancy technology of the intelligence system, the kind of James Bond and science fiction of intelligence work. It is a matter of having people on the ground, people who have very basic abilities such as language and to find the appropriate connections and basic investigative work to ensure the safety of Canadians in these circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been missing in the past. It has been so clearly proven to have been missing in the past in our approach to dealing with terrorism in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clauses we are debating today have never been used. That should say something about how crucial they have been in protecting Canadians from acts of terrorism. Even in the circumstances where people have been alleged to be participating in some kind of terrorist activity, the provisions were not used. The Criminal Code was used in those circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am not prepared to say that we should compromise civil liberties to protect ourselves from terrorism. I believe our criminal justice system already has the ability to do that and it should be engaged fully. We should ensure that our police and security intelligence agencies have the ability to do the job that needs to be done around these kinds of issues.</div>

Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, I would like to use the remaining three or four minutes to make some comments, rather than ask a question, since this member has already been asked several questions. I understand that I must leave time for my colleague to respond.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, the day after the terrorist attacks, I was in this House and I participated in the debate on the bill. At that time, some members showed an obvious desire to create sunset clauses. We decided then that it would be necessary to demonstrate a need to use them. We were going through a rather tough, difficult and unique time. Law enforcement officials and government agencies answered the government's call to put forth measures that could be helpful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the multitude of measures, some were problematic; however, as legislators, we were not sure. Both chambers agreed to provide for a five-year period to establish that these clauses were necessary. We can definitely say that they have not proven to be necessary; on the contrary, they were never used. At present, government supporters are saying that we have flip-flopped and changed our minds, but that is not at all the case. We are being consistent. We were the ones who saw the need to introduce sunset clauses. In no way do I accept this attempt to make tomorrow night's vote a partisan game.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also learned from our mistakes, because that is what we all must do, I would hope. In the past few years, we realized what had to be done. We also strengthened our rule of law and our police forces and we invested billions of dollars in security. These clauses do not really seem to be necessary. I would like to know if my colleague agrees with me, given that the need for these two sunset clauses being debated today has not been proven. To be consistent, we must vote against extending these clauses today or tomorrow.</div>

    </p><a name="Para458713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that this was not done lightly by Parliament after the events of September 11. I know that many members worked long and hard on this and listened carefully to many opinions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that at the time at the very minimum, parliamentarians chose to include the sunset of these two particular clauses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind all members of Parliament that one of those opinions in this place was that these measures went too far. Certainly the NDP put forward that position, that these kinds of measures were ultimately unnecessary. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our experience has proven that is true. They have never been used. There was one attempt but ultimately, it was not used. I think we now know that the Criminal Code of Canada deals with these kinds of situations effectively. I think that is the way we need to go. We need to make sure that the Criminal Code in that process is effective.</div>

When responding to my question on the wrongful imprisonment of Ms. Brenda Martin, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Foreign Affairs</A> said that his department “waived the embassy's standard fee that was normally applied in cases like this”. What was the minister talking about? I have absolutely no idea what the minister was referring to. Obviously he did not understand my question. It had nothing to do with fees being charged or waived. Quite frankly, I also do not think many Canadians in Ms. Martin's predicament would be impressed to hear the minister's largesse in waiving departmental service fees, especially if their lives were indeed at risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has access, as I demonstrated that day, to the affidavit. It is important that the government get it and that it be deposited with the Mexicans. It really is quite simple. It just needs a bit of leadership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mexican court appears to be playing Ms. Martin for a patsy. The Canadian government can protest to the Mexican government when justice is being denied. This is not interference. It is very much within the right of Canada to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is equally disturbing about her imprisonment is that the Mexican deputy police chief was released in less than a week last year, a person who had a role in the fraud scheme, while the chef to the mastermind who is cleared of any involvement by a death bed affidavit, still remains in a Mexican prison one year later.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brenda Martin's mother is also not very impressed with the lack of contact and information she received from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Foreign Affairs</A> and from officials. Quite to the contrary to the minister's reply that day to my question when he alluded to being in contact with members of the Martin family, Ms. Martin's mother appears to suggest that was not the case. So, is the mother wrong or is the minister?</div>
    </p><a name="Para458724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it too much to ask the minister to get the appropriate affidavit to the Mexican authorities and get Brenda Martin out of prison now, or does the minister want to get paid for something first? Brenda is down to 100 pounds. She is physically ill and is mentally distraught. Does the minister intend to help this woman before she ends up dead? </div>
    </p><a name="Para458725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other cases that we should be bringing to bear this evening. There are other Canadians this evening who are in dire need. Mr. el-Attar in Egypt has been accused of spying for Israel. He said he has been subjected to torture. There is the ongoing case of Mr. Celil. We now learn from reports from the Uygur community that the Canadian government suggested that if they want some help in the Celil case, get a lawyer, pay $12,000 and that will help the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the photo ops with the Mexican leadership, Canada's foreign affairs minister is no further along in bringing justice to those responsible for the murder of Nancy and Domenic Ianiero. Two women in Thunder Bay live in fear by Canada's inability to convince Mexicans that they were not the ones who killed the Ianieros.</div>

They could have easily raised the several issues with Mexico. There are obviously many to discuss. I want to point out these are not the only cases that could have been raised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An affidavit to the Mexican authorities last Thursday could have possibly seen the release of Ms. Martin here and now. It could have also gone a long way in dealing with some of the other issues. Mr. Peter Kimber has been detained in Mexico for over two years in a civil matter. The question is, is it a miscarriage of justice? There are questions now about an unknown minor who is in Texas. We should be looking at these cases as well.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Martin's case has been accorded the same high level of importance and professionalism that we give to all consular cases.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consular staff in Ottawa, Mexico and Guadalajara have been and continue to be very active on this case.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member also knows, when a Canadian is arrested outside of Canada, he or she is subject to the laws and regulations of the host country.

Rather he should deliver them to the consular affairs bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade so that they may be sent to Ms. Martin's legal counsel in Mexico, or perhaps he could even give them to me.

    </p><a name="Para458751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the Conservatives criticized the Liberals' partisan appointments. Now that they are in power, the Conservatives are proving to be Liberal clones, constantly appointing friends of the party to government positions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent appointment of Raminder Gill to the citizenship court is a good example. This Conservative candidate, who was defeated in 2006 in Mississauga-Streetsville, is leaving the way clear for the most recent Liberal defector to the Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 23, 2006, the Prime Minister said this, “Political appointments and cronyism had eroded staff morale and damaged the public’s perception of the institution, which many suspected had become corrupt and a haven for patronage...Our new public appointments commission will...ensure that qualified people are appointed based on a fair process—”</div>
    </p><a name="Para458754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet on February 12, 2007, we learned that 16 of the 33 judicial selection committee members appointed by the current government are affiliated in some way with the Conservative Party. For example, two of the appointees are Mark Bettens, a firefighter from Nova Scotia who is a twice-defeated Conservative candidate, and Johanne Desjardins, a graphic artist who used to work for a former Conservative minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been plenty more examples since April 2006. Jim Gouk, a former Conservative member, was appointed to the NAV Canada board of directors. Gwyn Morgan, a former Conservative backer, was appointed to the new Public Appointments Commission. Neil Leblanc, a former Nova Scotia Conservative minister, was named Consul General in Boston. Brian Richard Bell, a Conservative organizer in New Brunswick, was appointed to the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench. Kerry-Lynne Findlay, the Canadian Alliance candidate for Vancouver Quadra in 2000, was appointed to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. Jacques Léger, a former interim president of the Progressive Conservative Party, was given a judgeship in the Superior Court of Quebec. Hermel Vienneau, Bernard Lord's former chief of staff, was named vice-president of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. Barbara Hagerman, the wife of a Prince Edward Island Conservative backroom adviser, was named Lieutenant Governor. Alexander Sosna, a Conservative candidate in 1984, and Steven Glithero, a former Conservative Party president in Cambridge, were appointed to the Superior Court of Ontario. Howard Bruce, an Alliance candidate in 2000 and the Conservative candidate for Portneuf in 2004 and 2006, was appointed to the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada. Eugene Rossiter, the former president of the Progressive Conservative Island Fund, was appointed to the Tax Court of Canada. Tung Chan, a registered CPC agent in Richmond, was appointed to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. Loyola Sullivan, the Newfoundland co-president of the Prime Minister's leadership bid, was named Canada's ambassador for fisheries conservation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are Kirk Sisson, a former member of the Red Deer Conservative riding association, and John David Bruce McDonald, once the chief financial officer of the Alberta Reform Party, who were appointed to the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. </div>

    </p><a name="Para458759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process suggested for screening citizenship judges was originally created three years ago and intended to be a temporary one only until a new appointment process could be developed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a system where one person was responsible for the entire process, where one person screened the applications, and where one person graded all the tests. This one person himself was an appointee of the former Liberal government. The question is: Where is the accountability? Surely this is not an approach providing for openness and transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated, that process was established in 2004 as a temporary one. To reflect our new government's commitments under the Federal Accountability Act, we are reviewing the appointment process entirely for all boards and all tribunals in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This review, when completed, would create a more open and transparent system for appointments as there is currently no legislated policy in place for the appointment of citizenship judges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A> has made it clear that she is committed to establishing a new appointment process. She has asked the senior citizenship judge, Judge Michel Simard, to provide his input in the development of a new process that is more open and transparent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the process is taking place, interim appointments need to be made and need to continue to be made. It is quite clear that this government is committed to transparency and accountability, unlike the previous Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, it is interesting to see the members of the Bloc attempting to give advice on ethics and accountability in government. If they believe so strongly in government ethics and accountability, maybe they can tell us why they opposed our plan to create a public appointments commission and why they stonewalled and opposed the Federal Accountability Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question, and we find it interesting, that while the Liberals were in power they thought only Liberals were the most qualified for appointments. Now they are out of power and they continue to feel the only qualified people are Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the Liberal Party, we believe that government appointments should not be limited to members or supporters of a particular political party but, rather, should be made on the basis of their qualifications and abilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the qualifications of citizenship judge appointments that have been made, as was mentioned in the committee on citizenship and immigration, the Liberal member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78401,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78401&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Agincourt</A> said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked if our citizenship judge appointees were qualified to do this job, senior citizenship Judge Simard said, “Yes, they are. They have been trained, and they passed the training successfully”. We want to ensure that those who occupy the positions are not only qualified and competent but are great additions to the system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members from listening to the hearings at committee, all of the appointees have a significant contribution that they can make, they are well attached to what is happening in the immigration scene, and they are certainly welcome additions to the commission.</div>

After the lockout the company closed its doors, probably because it was seasonal work, and decided not to reopen. I feel the law is very clear: if a company closes its doors, there is no lockout.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers decided to go to the appeal board and the appeal board agreed with the 100 workers that were locked out before the company decided to close its doors. It is not as if the company reopened and said the workers were still locked out. It said it was not reopening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers won the case at the arbitration level and the government has decided to appeal that decision. I ask: How much blood does it want from the workers? The decision is very dangerous if any company in our country can say it is closing its doors after a lockout. Maybe that is what the Conservative government wants. If companies were to close their doors after a lockout, the workers would not get any money from the strike fund or employment insurance. Let us punish them twice. It is a very bad precedent that could be set.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal board said no, the company closed it doors. If it did not reopen it meant that there was no longer a lockout. It is like being on strike and the company going on record to say that it will not reopen, will be closing it doors and the strike is over. That is my interpretation of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a union representative for many years. In all the conflicts with employers, after they made a decision to close their doors, the strike was over because there was nothing left. That means that the workers now have to search for jobs and employment insurance is there to help them as they search. The company decided there was no conflict any more because it closed its doors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I put the question to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A>. He said that 83% of people get employment insurance when they lose their jobs and there is an independent process. The workers went through the independent process and the independent process agreed with the workers that if the company closed its doors, as it did, that was the fact. If the workers were still locked out, I would not be here raising the question. The company said it was not reopening. The minute it said that, it meant there were no further negotiations. The negotiation process stopped. That is the difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said that he could not get involved. The minister cannot ask the appeal board or the arbitrator to render a decision one way, but certainly the department or the minister could say the government would not appeal it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was my question. Would the minister agree to tell his department that it will not appeal the decision? That is not against the law. It is fully within the law. Everyday we tell the minister that the workers have won and ask him to give them the benefit of the doubt because the workers are responsible for their children and wives, and the families suffer. I would like to hear the parliamentary secretary's response.</div>

Listening to the member speak I must congratulate him for spelling out his concerns so rationally and so very easy to understand. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he will not like what I have to tell him. An independent, arm's length process is reviewing this matter and we cannot take it any further. I cannot express how disappointed I am for these people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the government, like the member, we are very concerned when workers face a disruption to their employment. We are also concerned about the status of the Clearwater employees from Glace Bay. We are also concerned about respecting the independence of the arm's length process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our respect for the administrative justice process is robust and we are sincere. We believe and Canadians believe it is important that processes like these continue without political interference. I am sure the member understands that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have political interference and we must share that belief. I assume that the member does as well. It therefore follows that we must allow this process to take its course and it would be inappropriate to comment on the particulars of this matter further.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can say though is that our government sympathizes with the workers who find themselves in these sorts of situations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian workers support the Conservative Party and they support us as the government. They know we share their priority on developing and maintaining a strong economy. They support us because they know we want to support them with a strong employment insurance program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe it is a tragedy when anyone loses their job. Far from letting Canadian workers down, the government has rewarded workers with a record number of jobs. Just last month we created 89,000 jobs. We have lowered the GST. We have encouraged apprenticeships. We have delivered support to families through the universal child care benefit for their children and tax relief and benefits for their parents. </div>
    </p><a name="Para458793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been working to support Canadian workers with a range of benefits that are available for those who qualify. We are succeeding. Eighty-three per cent of those who face job disruptions through closures are able to receive benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can also say is that the employment insurance legislation, which applies to all cases, currently stipulates that no benefits can be paid in situations where a claimant loses employment or is unable to resume employment because of a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are situations where there is a difference in interpretation on how to apply these provisions of the legislation. These differences of interpretation are not resolved at the minister's desk. These are not political disputes. These disputes on how to interpret the law are sent to an objective body, an arm's length panel of referees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process for dealing with these disputes also allows parties to appeal--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want it to be clear that I am not asking the minister to interfere in the decision. I am asking the minister not to re-appeal. He is dissenting. As a politician who represents the people, I have the right to say to the minister that a decision has now been taken and could he not re-appeal it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a difference in trying to influence the decision. She said that the appeal process was independent. The appeal process made a decision that the workers were right. There is no longer a dispute about whether it is a lock-out or a strike. The company has decided not to reopen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para458801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all fairness and from the bottom of my heart I ask the government, if it is serious about wanting to help the workers, which has nothing to do with economic development or anything like that, there are 100 people at Clearwater in Glace Bay working for a company that has said it is not reopening--</div>
