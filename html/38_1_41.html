I want to take this opportunity to state that Canada Economic Development had an important role to play in this excellent news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Economic Development has made innovation one of its top priorities.  The relative share of financial assistance granted by the agency to innovation projects has increased considerably over the past five years. In 1999-2000, it was 24% of total financial assistance, while in 2003-04, it reached 61%, for a total of $113.5 million that made it possible to conclude 585 new partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures clearly demonstrate the need for initiatives by Canada Economic Development  and confirm our commitment  to helping small and medium size businesses in Quebec to develop innovative projects in the coming years, including in the riding of Gatineau.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that he will honour his promise if he can reach an agreement that is good for Canada as well as being good for Newfoundland and Labrador. The real truth is  the Prime Minister made his election promise because he thought it would be good for the Liberal Party. There were no strings attached and no conditions in the election campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting the province keep 100% of its oil revenues will help us to stand on our own feet economically, and surely that is good for Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada. The Prime Minister said yes to Newfoundland and Labrador during the election campaign. How long does it take to negotiate “yes”?</p>

During the drive, more than 400 volunteers took to the streets of Orléans. It ended with a supper in the basement of St-Joseph Church. The volunteers collected a whopping $30,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, along with the collection of a great number of food items and clothing, is unprecedented. St. Vincent de Paul members in Orléans have reason to be proud today. Thanks to the generosity of all those volunteers and the people of Orléans, the society will be able to continue its help to more than 150 families in need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orléans St. Vincent de Paul is a community model for all Canadians and, on behalf of all those who have benefited from  its efforts in the past and all those who will benefit from them in the future, I want to congratulate  this organization for its work. Ottawa—Orléans is a great place to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank and congratulate Ronald Leduc for his ongoing dedication and leadership within the community.</p>

The synagogue has doubled in size over the last 30 years, and is currently one of the largest community based facilities in my riding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the anniversary gala dinner  last Sunday, two distinguished congregants, Keith Landy and Erma Bader, were recognized for their outstanding work over the last number of years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The congregation is renowned for bringing the community together and encouraging the family approach, one in which everyone is welcomed. The congregation's intent is to go from strength to strength, serving the community. This joyous event fits so well as the Jewish festival of Hanukkah approaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings me great pleasure to say bravo to the Shaar Shalom Synagogue, and happy Hanukkah.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, federal cost cutting led to Sable Island Preservation Trust taking over responsibility for operating the station. The trust has now given notice to terminate activities next April due to further federal funding reductions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost to run the station is about $1.2 million. This maintains five people on staff and they are important as the only human presence on this fragile island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the government set up a multi-departmental group to make recommendations about the federal future role on Sable Island. The working group has now recommended that the station remain open and the federal government once again assume full responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to adopt the recommendations of the working group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book entitled, <i>What Do Those Numbers Mean Anyway?</i>, written by Bill Steer, has recently been published by the Canadian Ecology Centre Foundation. The visual and written content explains the relationship between the map, the compass and the GPS unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ken Waller, a professor at Nipissing University in North Bay, there is a real need to have consumers and those working in rural situations properly trained to understand these  basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book will serve to educate paramedics, police and fire personnel, educational and outdoor leaders, as well as those working for utility companies, so the GPS technology can be used efficiency and enhance overall safety.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993 Mr. Cirone was recruited by CARE Canada to work for the United Nations Protection Force. Domenic was dispatched in May 1993 and was stationed in the territories formerly known as Yugoslavia, routinely travelling to wartorn areas of eastern and southern Croatia and northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina. During that time, Domenic exemplified the Canadian spirit while serving on behalf of our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II approved the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal in 1997. It recognizes the service of Canadians deployed outside our country with the agreement of the Canadian government in support of United Nations peacekeeping missions. I have the honour of awarding Domenic this prestigious award later this afternoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albertans have just elected the people they want to represent them in their upper house. Now the prime ditherer has a choice.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in either case he will be appointing people from a list, I would like him to explain how choosing from his personal list of people he wants to reward is more democratic than choosing from the people's list.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In   light of this, we must do a better job of recognizing the education and credentials that newcomers receive from other countries. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that on  December 6  I visited stakeholders in Calgary. I wanted to discuss the issues of foreign credential recognition and to hear about other barriers to employment that skilled newcomers face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that the Government of Canada is working diligently with its partners to address this important issue. Our partners include the provinces, the territories, regulatory bodies, sector councils, colleges, schools, unions and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work on foreign credential recognition is a critical component of the government's new workplace skills strategy, which seeks to ensure a highly skilled, adaptable and resilient workforce; a flexible and efficient labour market; and that  the needs of employers and workers are met.</p>

That regime represented a culture of death which began with a deliberate policy of euthanizing those deemed weak, infirm or imperfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sad irony, Holland has now chosen to embark on the same slippery slope toward desacralizing human life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago the Dutch parliament made it legal for doctors to kill adult patients deemed to be suffering. Now the Dutch medical association has proposed legalizing the killing of children under the age of 12, including infants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictably, this practice has already begun, with the revelation that sick babies are being killed in Dutch hospitals, babies that obviously cannot give their consent for their lives to be taken    by medical professionals in cold blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slippery slope has become a vertical cliff. Holland today has become a cautionary tale for those here in Canada who would legitimize the taking of an innocent human life. We hope that our friends in Holland will reconsider this slippery slope and embrace the values of those who  liberated them 60 years ago.</p>

In Quebec, across Canada and around  the world, Jews will be celebrating the victory of the Maccabees in the first national war of liberation, which is an integral part of the liturgy of Hanukkah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, the first candle of the chanukiyah is lit using the shamash candle. The chanukiyah  candelabrum has nine branches, including the shamash, unlike the traditional menorah, which has seven. An additional candle is lit every day for eight days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Jewish tradition, the light dissipates the darkness by  introducing clarity. It represents the triumph of enlightenment over obscurity and victory over oppression and assimilation. This light is the symbolic representation of a living Judaism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year when the days are darkest and the nights are longest, this festival of hope and light causes all of us, Jews and non-Jews alike, to remember a miracle that occurred more than 2,000 years ago when Judas Maccabee and the people of Israel drove the Seleucid invaders from Jerusalem, but found the temple in ruins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a single jar of pure oil could be found to light the huge menorah, but miraculously, this tiny supply of oil lasted for eight full days and thereby became a symbol of hope to all civilized people that neither barbarism nor tyranny can extinguish the light of true faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a festival of special joy in which the lighted menorah is placed in an open window or door so that all may share in this light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I wish you, all members of  the House, and every Canadian, a very happy Hanukkah.</p>

Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the BSE crisis has driven home to us the importance of being able to track cattle, sheep and all animals used for food.  Our primitive tagging system for beef cattle allowed us to track the single animal that triggered this crisis back to her home farm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International expectations are now such that much more sophisticated tracking will be required in the future.  I urge that we move directly from tags to DNA tracking, bypassing the computer chip implant system which some propose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a leading nation in genetics, including DNA research.  A simple, cheap test at birth, or on entry into the country, provides a unique identification for each animal.  Using this, the animal can be tracked throughout its life and meat from every animal can be identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP has a sophisticated national DNA database system.  It would be easy to extend it to produce a national DNA system for cattle, sheep and other ruminants.  Let us do this now and invest in our farmers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the system is in place, but we will be going further, for we intend to make greater use of biometrics to recognize our employees.

After falsely accusing   the Bloc Québécois, on November 29, the minister recognized in the House that Bombardier did not need the 11,000 acres of land requested in order to develop. After Bombardier, the minister hid behind ADM. “We are going to respect ADM's lease”, said the minister on the same day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that, yesterday, in committee, ADM's president    recognized that, lease or no lease, he would do as Ottawa decides, what is Ottawa waiting for to give the land back to the people of Mirabel?</p><A NAME="Int-1066585"></A><a HREF="#Int-1066587"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066582"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

To sell back the land at this time would be an error with serious consequences for both Aéroports de Montréal and the Mirabel area”. That is what Mr. Cherry said and, I believe him, until proven wrong.</p><A NAME="Int-1066587"></A><a HREF="#Int-1066590"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066585"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, he said clearly yesterday that it was up to Ottawa to decide. Let us take a  look at the  minister's analysis. With 6,000 acres for current and future activities, Mirabel has   twice the area of Dorval, and twice that of Heathrow in Great Britain, with its 63 million passengers, whereas Dorval has a mere  nine million,  and Mirabel fewer than one million. That does not make sense, especially  after ADM's president recognized that there were no plans. These are the same arguments we were given in the 1970s.

Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Social Development (Social Economy), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I would ask the Chair to clarify two issues for me. Having occupied the chair and knowing that often there is too much back and forth, there are two issues that I feel I have to bring to the attention of the Chair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is that certain hon. members on the opposition side, during a question in question period today, impugned motives.  I understand the Standing Orders to indicate that we cannot, neither in the question nor the answer, impugn motives before an answer is given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to bring to the attention of the Speaker is the fact that there were questions asked today which should have been addressed, in my opinion, to a political party rather than a member of the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like some clarification on the two issues that I have raised.</p><A NAME="Int-1066778"></A><a HREF="#Int-1066779"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066777"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>Perhaps the member could assist the Chair by telling the Chair to which questions she was referring.  I thought the questions that were asked today seemed to be about the responsibility of the government.  If she could be more specific, I would be glad to review the matter and come back to the House in due course.</p><A NAME="Int-1066779"></A><a HREF="#Int-1066780"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066778"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Eleni Bakopanos: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the question that was asked by the hon. member for Calgary--Nose Hill in particular, and also the questions that were asked by the hon. member for Simcoe--Grey.</p><A NAME="Int-1066780"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067269"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066779"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I will be more than happy to review the questions that were asked, but my recollection at the time was that they were asking about the number of ministerial permits, or visas or whatever documents were issued at a specific time and place. I will review the matter.  If that is not what they concerned, or if I misunderstood them, I will be more than happy to deal with the matter.  My recollection at the time was that they were all right.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the Speaker can make mistakes, painful as it may be to admit that, but it is a quick judgment call that is made at the last minute as these things transpire in the House.  The Speaker does always try to do his best to uphold the rules and practices of the House, and  I will continue to do that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member for her assistance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first petition is on behalf of 120 school bus drivers.  The petitioners say that  driving a school bus is a highly responsible profession contributing to the safety and education of our children, that in the past a Canadian school bus driver could qualify for employment insurance benefits after working approximately 20 weeks and that under current rules, eligibility for benefits is based on the number of hours worked.   They say that the federal government collects billions of dollars more in EI payments each year than it pays out in benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they call upon Parliament to enact legislation that would base eligibility for employment insurance premiums on the number of weeks rather than the number of hours worked.</p>

Tony Valeri (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) </b>moved that Bill C-30, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and the Salaries Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am   pleased to speak today to  Bill C-30, the parliamentarians' compensation bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is   the result of a commitment made by the Prime Minister to the Canadian people. On September 30 the Prime Minister said that the government would delink, or   break the link, between the salaries of MPs and those of  judges. He also said that the increase in  salaries and the increase in MPs salaries would reflect essentially the increases negotiated by Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing today, in debating this and having introduced this bill into the House, is taking action on that commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is pretty straightforward and uncomplicated and   follows the legislative process in the House of Commons. It is my hope that the legislation will go to committee for review and that it will come back to Parliament for a vote in the new year. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think  all MPs will want to deal with this question in the same straightforward manner. I know that at times issues like this are difficult issues to be debated on the floor of the House, but the government made a commitment to treat the compensation of parliamentarians separately and apart from that of judges.  Therefore it is logical that we would take this step and present a bill independent of the Judges Act, which  deals only with the compensation increases of parliamentarians, and deal with the question of compensation increases for judges in a subsequent bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the compensation increases for parliamentarians, the bill itself describes a measure that tracks private sector wage increases as the benchmark that we would follow. The HRSD, or Human Resources and Skills Development, annual average wage settlement index tracks the wage settlements of the Canadian private sector, and so linking parliamentary compensation increases to this index will  mean that parliamentarians will  fare neither better nor worse than the people whom parliamentarians represent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to illustrate for a moment how straightforward and uncomplicated the bill is.  The index used to measure the wage change is published every February. It documents the wage changes of the previous calendar year. Under Bill C-30, parliamentarians' compensation would receive   the Human Resources and Skills Development  index effective April 1, 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is support for making this move that the government is undertaking. I just want to flag a couple of editorials that reflected this. The following was stated in   the <i>Regina Leader-Post</i> back in September:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>MPs and cabinet ministers...work long, unsocial hours. However, workers in many other sectors can make the same argument, yet an average pay increase of 2.5 to 3.1 per cent is what most Canadians can expect to receive this year, according to government and private forecasters.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>National Post</i> on October 2 also praised the decision by the Prime Minister to delink compensation increases for judges and MPs by stating:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Prime Minister has also correctly recognized that there should be no correlation between remuneration for judges and politicians and is acting to correct the policy that arbitrarily weds the two to a single pay scale.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we end up with this particular index? We  looked at number of indices before settling on the HRSD one. It had a number of advantages. For one, it is the only major index of private sector wage settlements that is widely available and   easily accessible. When we look at the index itself and how it is made up, it is readily understood by everyone, and I believe, as I am sure many others will if they have the opportunity to look at this index, that it will be a fair and representative indicator of the general wage settlement trends in the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very important, and this again is an advantage of using this particular index, that we use an index that does not include wage increases negotiated by public servants  because Parliament, from time to time, may  need to legislate on public service compensation. Thus, using an index with a public sector component could in fact be perceived by some as putting Parliament in a conflict of interest.</p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have put forward the cost of living index, COLA, which is used by Statistics Canada as a possible measure for linking MP compensation.  However, what this  particular index does is  it tracks the prices as they rise and as they decline of the goods and services in the economy. It does not reflect the changes in wage increases received by Canadians across the country. The prices of commodities can rise and fall dramatically depending on trends in the economy. Therefore we believe that we should base salary changes for MPs on what is happening to Canadians in the economy, not on the supply and demand curves of goods and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons the government has chosen to use the private sector wage settlement index that is published by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development as it  is an authoritative index.  Both the government  and  industry use it.  It is a data source that many use in analyzing wage settlement trends in our economy. It is published monthly in the Wage Settlements Bulletin and quarterly in the Workplace Gazette. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there is a lot of accessibility and there is I believe an understanding of what this index actually does and what it means for the economy. It covers a broad economy: primary industries, construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, education and health services, finance and professional services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The index itself measures the average annual salary increase negotiated by collective bargaining for private sector units with 500 or more people. It is comprised of over 430 collective agreements in the private sector and these agreements apply across private sector units of 500 or more people. It means that the wage settlement data that we expect to use as an index are really reflective of what more than 8,000 people across the country are getting in terms of wage increases. It represents mostly a unionized workforce but it also has a very significant component of non-unionized employees as well, so there is that mix in this index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons that I have laid out before the House, we think  this index meets the test of linking the increases in compensation for parliamentarians to the increases obtained by Canadians. By  aligning future compensation increases with changes in the private sector wage settlements, parliamentarians can be assured and will be assured that their salary increases will be  the same as those of other Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way it would work is that we would    look at the average wage increase for the previous calendar year, which is published in February, and have   an assessment     We would then have   the change reflected in the compensation for members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to provide some background.  As members know, parliamentarians received a 1.3% increase on April 1, 2004 based on the industrial aggregate average, which is also an index that is used to calculate annual changes in the compensation for judges. The base salary for MPs in  2003 had been $139,200. With this increase under the industrial aggregate average, it moved up  to approximately $141,000, which  is an increase of about 1.3% or $1,800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the parliamentarians' compensation bill, Bill C-30,   parliamentarians would receive increases in line with the HRSD index for 2003 with an effective date of April 1, 2004. The HRSD index itself for 2003, which was published in February 2004, was 1.5%, not 1.3%. If we were to  apply Bill C-30,  that would mean  an increase of about $2,000 to MPs' salaries, or MPs' compensation, rather than the $1,800.   I wanted to make that clear because there has been some confusion on this.</p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new index  would provide for a slightly higher increase than is provided for under the current legislation but  that increase reflects the increases received in the private sector in Canada. In effect, it means that parliamentarians would be getting the same increase as  the people who they represent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go forward into the future, the  legislation would    establish a system for receiving salary increases in what I think will be a very uncomplicated and straightforward manner. This  is  a commitment the Prime Minister made to Canadians   and it is a commitment fulfilled.  It is an example of another commitment that we are following through on.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government   has a track record of following through on commitments.  We believe that  Canadians can benefit from strong communities, a strong economy and from a nation that is a strong player on the international stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about commitments we not only talk about that commitment, but we can also talk in the context of what the government has accomplished and what the government is intending to do.  We can look at the health care commitment of  $41.3 billion in an agreement with the provinces and territories.  It is a deal that will enhance health care for the next decade. It will also provide benchmarks for performance, which is something the Prime Minister talked about and committed to.  This will ultimately result in reduced patient wait times for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have the commitment with respect to this legislation on parliamentary salaries, the commitment in health care and the  commitment, which we are following through on, in the early childhood development and lifelong learning.  We are laying the groundwork, which has been laid in conjunction with the provinces and territories.  Dialogue is ongoing and ultimately we will end up with a program of early learning and child care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about commitments with respect to Bill C-30, commitments in health care, commitments in early learning, in the economy, when we think of the reduction in debt and the $100 billion tax cut, all of these are commitments that we have maintained.  What I am suggesting to the House   is that the government is committed to fulfilling and seeing this legislation become law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this particular act we have acted on our other commitments, whether  it is in  health care or on the  $100 million investment in the redevelopment of Ford Motor Company in Oakville, or the new deal for cities, we are  fulfilling the commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we talk about our domestic goals and fulfilling those domestic commitments, and this is certainly one of them,  it is also fair to say that we also strive as part of our overall objective to strengthen Canada's influence in the world.  We have  seen a lot of work to that end very recently  with the Prime Minister in different parts of the world  ensuring that Canada's voice is heard in building and rebuilding fractured states and ensuring that democracy is alive and well, whether it is Ukraine or whether in going to Iraq. We are  committed to meeting our goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-30 is   pretty straightforward.  There is an index.  It will reflect Canadian wage settlements.  It will essentially reflect the wage increases that Canadians receive.  We represent these Canadians.  I believe  parliamentarians work very hard and   are very dedicated, as are Canadians.  They also   work very hard and are very dedicated in whatever sector they work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken the opportunity to bring forward   legislation to  tie this index to the salaries of members of Parliament.  The legislation    makes sense.  It  is clear,   straightforward and  very transparent.    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that we are on the right track on this. That is reflected in a number of editorials. I am hopeful that when others get up to speak on this particular piece of legislation they  will look at the legislation for what it is and send it to committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will follow the regular process. This is not about bringing a bill into the House just to have it proceed very quickly because it is about MPs' compensation. It is about putting this on the floor of the House to put in place a very transparent and simple, straightforward way of dealing with this issue. I think that in fact this is what Bill C-30 does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this is a commitment that was made by the Prime Minister this September to delink increases in parliamentary salaries from those received by judges. It links them to those received by Canadians in the private sector. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have moved quickly on that commitment and have introduced this bill, Bill C-30. Members of the House will now have the opportunity to fulfill that commitment made to the Canadian people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should also be very clear and say  that this is up to Parliament. Parliamentarians will decide whether this legislation will proceed. I do believe that once the legislation is reviewed and once we hear from others in the House we will build some support and a consensus that this legislation go through. I believe it is the right thing to do and I certainly hope the members of the House on all sides will come together and help us do just that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-30, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and the Salaries Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1066989"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067084"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1068843"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, indeed I listened very carefully to the opening speech on Bill C-30, just made by the House leader for the government, and I have three quick questions I would like to put to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first would be pre-empted by a statement, perhaps, on the fact, if I heard him correctly, that he said the Prime Minister made this commitment to bring forward a bill to delink MPs' compensation, in other words, our salaries, from the judges' compensation.  It was his own government in a previous Parliament that had linked the two.  Now the government is delinking it. He said the Prime Minister made that commitment in September.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall it, the Prime Minister was under pressure from the Leader of the Opposition, my colleague from Calgary Southwest, who last spring made that commitment to the Canadian people in the lead-up to and during the election campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My leader, the member for Calgary Southwest, stated unequivocally that a Conservative government would not allow a pay package increase to go ahead that would have been 10%, which was what was leaked out of the commission that looks at judges' remuneration.  That leaked out last spring.  There was quite a debate about it in the media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those commitments, I believe, were made quite some time ago, not just in September. At any rate, we are here to debate Bill C-30.  The first question I would put to the House leader deals with the actual increase.  Certainly I think it makes eminent sense to attach our compensation to some form of cost of living index that other Canadians are faced with, at least when they begin to negotiate their salaries and any increase in their salaries.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the actual increase that we will be getting?  Is it half a per cent for this year or  is it  one and a half per cent? What is it? I ask so that people watching the program at home today will clearly understand what it is that we are talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second deals with the linkage to the judges. It was this government, as I already have said, that indeed initially linked it to judges' remuneration, so I would simply put this question: why is it that they are not bringing forward the judges' package at the same time instead of waiting until next spring to deal with it?  I understand that is about 11% over four years, a substantial increase, and  over and above their cost of living increase, I might add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is again for clarification. It is my understanding that once Bill C-30 passes and MPs' salaries are linked to the cost of living index there will not be a requirement in the future for the members of the House of Commons to debate and vote on our own remuneration.</p><A NAME="Int-1067084"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067144"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1066989"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Tony Valeri: </b>Mr. Speaker, if I counted right there were four questions, but I will try to deal with them as quickly and as directly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question with respect to the commitment or the comments made by the hon. member's leader, I guess I can take from that,  and judging by the comments made, that the leader of the official opposition would be very attracted to this type of legislation and probably would in fact support it, judging from the comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of introducing this legislation is in fact to delink, as I have said. Under the present arrangement there has been a 1.3% increase as a result of an index in the Judges Act, so members of Parliament have received a 1.3% increase, which takes us from about $139,000 to about $141,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Bill C-30, in fact, the difference would be about $200.    There would be a $200 difference, and the actual index averaged 1.5% for the previous year, which is published in February, and that would be the number for the year 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Judges Act itself, I think it is very clear that the intent here is to delink and that by doing so we have in fact brought forward an independent piece of legislation for the House to deal with specifically on members' salaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also remind the member that for the judges' salaries it is a bit more than 11%; actually about 16% over four years.  This piece of legislation would obviously serve to delink members' salaries from that particular proposal. I think it better reflects, frankly, what Canadians are looking for in MPs' salaries and certainly I think it better reflects the will of Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his government introduced here in the House of Commons the last bill linking the remuneration of judges and members of Parliament, one of the basic principles at issue at the time was that the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada should never exceed that of the Prime Minister. Everyone watching us knows that this is a basic, well established principle. The Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are paid, for all practical purposes, the same salary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government House leader justify the fact that, suddenly, through a  legislative provision like the one he has today, the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will be $26,000 a year higher than the salary of the Prime Minister, in the first year. That is my first question for the government House leader. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is as follows. If we find ourselves obliged again today to reconsider the remuneration of members of Parliament, is it not because the Prime Minister basically lacked courage when he saw the results of the report? Instead of asking the committee to do its work again, the Prime Minister decided first to say that he would not take his salary increase. Everyone burst out laughing. It is well known that he is a millionaire several times over and does not need this salary. After that, he managed to say: “It is far too much for Canadians.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is my question. If the Prime Minister is honest and sincere when he says that an 11% pay increase for members of Parliament is far too much for Canadians—and I am one of them—how is it this same government thinks, in deciding to introduce a bill like this one reducing the pay increase of members of Parliament to more normal levels, that 10.8% or 11% for judges is not too much? It is too much for Canadians who are paying the salary of members of Parliament, but it is not too much for Canadians who are paying the salary of judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to understand where this is fair. I would like to understand the government's logic, if this is not in fact just a bill based on cowardice.</p>

Tony Valeri: </b>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the member's  first question and the salary the Chief Justice would receive with respect to parliamentarians, what we all have to understand about this, and I think Canadians do understand, is that ultimately Parliament   will decide.  If in fact my hon. colleague believes that the Prime Minister can and should receive the same salary as the Chief Justice in this particular circumstance, with this Parliament being a minority Parliament then that could happen.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested in his second question that the Prime Minister brought this forward for some reason.  In fact, the reason the Prime Minister brought this forward is that he believes in and is proposing a salary increase that reflects what the average Canadian receives.  The average Canadian will look at this and say it makes sense.  Why should MPs not receive what average Canadians receive in terms of salary?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members have difficulty with this, they can certainly argue that this is not what we should be doing in the House.  They can stand in their places and argue that members of Parliament should receive a salary increase that is somewhat different.  I am prepared to listen to those arguments and I know that my hon. colleagues are prepared to listen to my arguments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to judges, the Judges Act will come to the House.  Parliament will deal with this piece of legislation like any other piece of legislation, and in a minority Parliament, if in fact changes are made, I am sure that parliamentarians on all sides of the floor will take responsibility for those changes.</p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1067286"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. House leader has some curious responses to some curious questions from the Bloc in defending the Prime Minister's salary.  This is a new day in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was initially filled with some amount of confidence in the House leader's description of this as a simple and very transparent piece of legislation until he made reference to the government's great track record on following through on its commitments.  Thoughts of the GST, reviewing NAFTA, the actual implementation of Kyoto and reducing student debt loads came to mind and I started to worry about this commitment.  For some strange reason, the House leader  then strayed to Iraq and mentioned the idea of going to Iraq.  I am not sure why he referenced that with respect to this piece of legislation.  I wonder if he could clarify that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an initial decision to tie our salaries to those of judges. The Prime Minister stepped away from that for some reason.  I wonder if he could clarify the reason the Prime Minister stepped away from what I assume was a very clear and logical position.</p><A NAME="Int-1067320"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067342"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067286"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Tony Valeri: </b>Mr. Speaker, I think my answer was clear.  The Prime Minister has proposed this piece of legislation  because he believes that the salaries and compensation that MPs receive should reflect what the average Canadian receives. My hon. colleague from the NDP has a problem with that.  He has a problem in fact that MPs' salary increases should not reflect what the average Canadian receives. He thinks that this index is the wrong index. As a matter of fact it is an index that reflects collective bargaining and that is made up of both union and non-union sectors and represents the broad economy. It is  a curious position  for my hon. colleague from the NDP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event,  the legislation is before the House and I certainly look forward to the positions that the other parties have on it. I  look forward to engaging in the debate and I welcome it. </p><A NAME="Int-1067342"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be in the House today to  listen to my colleague across the floor and also my friend in the Bloc. I think all three of us were here when the House debated not too many years ago the great solution we had to this problem of MPs' salaries. That great solution was that we were going to tie the prime minister's salary  to the chief justice's, and everybody thought that was pretty fair. We would live with the independence of the Supreme Court justices and what they were going to get in their salaries. Meanwhile we would all get nice cost of living increases every year, which has brought our salaries up a few thousand dollars a year since that time. Everything was running along pretty well until  a report came out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the government House leader will talk about editorials, saying they all support it and this is a good idea. Yes, I think the average Canadian would think it is a good idea to have our salaries tied into a cost of living that comes from an index of wage settlements of Canadians. It always sounds like a good idea, but it is interesting. I read editorials when we did this last time and all the editorials said that it was very good that parliamentarians were tying their salaries to the judges' and they would no longer decide themselves what the increases would be. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really have to wonder about some of these editorialists who thought it was a great idea until a 10% figure came along and then we were all terrible and we should knock it back to something different. Nevertheless the government has brought in this bill  and my party is going to support this legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader should know also that when they bring the judges' bill before the House,  we are still going to live by the same ideals that we had before. The judges are going to live with the same incomes that we have as members of Parliament. They are going to be put on an index just like we are. If it was a fair thought a few years ago that our salaries should be tied to judges' salaries,  then it is a fair thought now and that should never change. I am happy that  members on the Liberal side are applauding that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would expect that whatever the government puts in the legislation for judges, it better expect it to be amended so it will read exactly the same as for everybody in the House, from the prime minister to members of Parliament. I hate to tell them that at Christmastime in case they have gone out and spent the money already, but 16% would not be accepted by Canadians at any level right now, and they should look at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector wage settlement process is a very good one. I think Canadians can accept that. I hope we will never see it in the House again where we have to have another debate on jumping up the salaries. Let us just live with this issue, but give us that increase every year so we do not have to debate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not going to get into these issues in this speech, but I could not help it. I just wanted to talk about the issue but the House leader opposite talked about all the good things the government has done. I will give him credit, the government has done some good things and we voted for some of those good things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a question in the House today that was answered by the minister of immigration about doctors as immigrants to this country. There are literally hundreds of well qualified doctors in this country who cannot practise their profession because the government is dragging its feet. Also provincial associations, whether they be medical, dental or other professionals, are dragging their feet, but all of these associations only operate with either provincial or federal help and they should be told to speed up their act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a situation in my constituency where there is a surgeon who is operating every day and has been told by immigration that he will be given  his landed status once he gets his certificate that he can practise medicine. He has been practising with a temporary permit from his association for two years doing surgery in Powell River, yet he has not been finalized yet. Are they telling me that somewhere along the line this association has taken two years and might take another to finally say he is qualified? What if they say he is not? He has been doing surgery every day in Powell River. There are hundreds like him everywhere in this country. There are also hundreds of others who are doing nothing. They are driving taxi cabs, waiting tables in restaurants, or taking other jobs when they could be out practising medicine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the government, instead of debating this issue here today, why not solve that problem? Yes, it talked about putting $41 billion back into medicare but we all know it took out $25 billion, and that is what caused the crisis from 1993 to 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other issues. We are going to debate one of them tomorrow,  the Fraser River fishery problem and fisheries in general, both on the east coast and the west coat. There is a lack of  good scientific evidence. The fisheries have been dying off in a country that is famous for fisheries, not only commercial fisheries but sports fisheries. In my province it is costing people a lot of jobs. Why can the government not solve that problem? Why do we have to bring in a motion from the opposition to get it to debate that issue and get a judicial inquiry going that might solve that problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many thousands of students  around this country are having serious problems with their debt loads? Why are we not coming up with a program to make sure that every Canadian citizen can get post-secondary education, whether it is to become a plumber, an electrician, a doctor, or a nurse, to make sure they can do it, not just if their parents have enough money? That should be a guarantee for every Canadian citizen, an education. Why are we not seeing a program for that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the Prime Minister's travelling road show. We know why he is travelling. He does not want to be here in the House of Commons with us. He does not like those serious questions every day about the issues of the nation. As much as we like to see our Prime Minister in certain things he is doing, when the House is sitting, this is where he should be, answering questions every day.</p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

We can all go home for Christmas knowing that we have done a good job as members of Parliament, in keeping the government doing business in an honest way and in a way that is good for all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that we are not happy about how this whole process took place because we thought we had an agreement.

Given that the government is launching into a process guided mainly by  the Prime Minister's inability to properly take on his responsibilities, does the leader not find that it would have been better for parliamentarians to refuse any  increase in pay? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not seem to me that salary increases are a priority right now. We should have refused any increase in pay, sat down with the government and figured out what was wrong with the mechanism currently in place so that the appropriate corrections could have been made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why accept a salary increase now and rush to implement a new system without having the time to study all of its consequences, when there is absolutely no reason for rushing? We do not need an increase in pay. We should have carefully examined and reviewed the current legislation in serious terms and not from the standpoint of political opportunism. </p>

I am very pleased that this bill will be going to committee. It is going to give members an opportune chance to speak at this level and put their opinions forth. I certainly respect his opinion on this issue. I would rather be debating anything in this House, and I mentioned the issue of student loans and getting doctors through immigration.  There are a lot of things we should be doing in this House. We should not debating the amount of money for ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later, we have to solve this problem because the government has created another problem by not believing or listening to what it did in the last Parliament, which is not unusual for the government. The bill will have a chance to go to committee where we can discuss those issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we will get some unanimity in committee that we should receive zero as long as the judges receive zero. We made a commitment in this Parliament, at one point, that the chief justice of the Supreme Court would get the same salary as  our Prime Minister and the rest would be scaled down from there. I believe it is going to stay that way.</p>

There cannot be a government when the leader is not around while parliament is sitting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember, the Prime Minister said one day when he was a little angry at the Leader of the Opposition, “I'd rather be anywhere than in this place with you guys”. That sort of gets across. I do not doubt that for a minute when he had the member for Mississauga—Erindale who caused him nothing but grief until she had to resign, and he has a Minister of Citizenship and Immigration causing the same problems today, and who knows who will be next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Prime Minister, for his new year's resolution, should promise to be in the House of Commons every day next year so we can get down to real business and solve the problems that a number of us have talked about here today.</p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1067696"></A><a HREF="#Int-1067993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067677"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice (Calgary Centre-North, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of Bill C-30. In doing so, I support our House leader and the comments which he has just made. He has been good enough to share his time with me and I thank him. I also speak in support of the position of the leader of our party who has spoken adamantly against this 10% salary increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened very carefully to the government House leader, as he spoke in relation to Bill C-30.  It would seem to me that we are in agreement as to what needs to be done. I would add that it seems as though the government has been forced on this issue by the other parties in the House of Commons and by editorial comment in the media of this country to eventually adopt this position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new member of Parliament I struggled to understand this issue. I examined some of the previous commissions which have studied this issue in the context of our parliamentary history in the last 25 years.  I speak of the Hales commission of 1979, the Lapointe Commission of 1994, and the Blais commission of 1998.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These commissions all seem to eventually seize upon five principles by which the remuneration of MPs should be judged.  I would like to reference these in my opening comments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important, since Parliament is such a valuable institution in this country, that we elect and retain competent and qualified people, and that good pay is essential to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MPs should not be expected to cover the expenses which they incur as a result of their lives as an MP out of their own pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and this is very important, MPs should not become wealthy or profit excessively as a result of their public service, nor should they see pay increases when other Canadians are suffering from financial hardship or not experiencing similar pay increases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, MPs should not vote for their own pay increases since this constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regardless of any determination of what constitutes fair compensation for the value of the work that they do, MP remuneration must be consistent with public expectations. Public expectations may in fact require MPs to be paid less than an amount which is properly what they should receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public service is a choice. No one is forced to seek elected office and all of us in the House have done so willingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to the legislation and judge it against those principles.   Although the legislation is reasonably complicated, Canadians need to understand that this is essentially how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  clause 55.1 of the bill, the salary of members of the House of Commons is set at $141,200 plus an annual amount that will be added to that in each year thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians need to understand the way in which that will work is set forth in  clause 67.1 of the bill which defines an index. Essentially, parliamentarians will now receive the same salary which they have received in the previous year plus an increase which is calculated with respect to the cost of living. The actual formula is indexed to the bargaining units of 500 or more employees in the private sector.  MP salary increases will be commensurate with other Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether MPs are to receive a pay increase at this time or not, it is worth noting, as the government House leader has pointed out, that the effect of this formula applied today, parliamentarians will receive a salary increase of only $200 in the coming year. That is a very important point to make in this debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the principles of which I have spoken, that MPs should not become wealthy or profit excessively, it is the position of our party and has been the position of our party that the 10% salary increase which was to be proposed by the commission, and which I gather was leaked publicly, was outrageous and unnecessary.  It was excessive. Our party has not supported it.  Our leader has not supported it.  I do not support it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been opposed to the 10% salary increase from the very outset. I am proud to say that it is our leader who was the very first person to say so publicly. I would note in that respect that a salary of $141,000 effectively places members of Parliament in the top 2% of Canadians in terms of what they earn. That should be sufficient. We do not need salary increases beyond that.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognizing the public policy discussion that has led to this conclusion, not only did our party reach this conclusion but respected commentators such as the <i>Calgary Herald</i> in this country on March 3, 2004, spoke eloquently about this in an editorial. It pointed out that the approach which the government had been following, the commission approach, was not working and that any approach which would result in a 10% salary  increase was clearly flawed.  I recognize the leadership that many people in this country have taken, including the <i>Calgary Herald</i>, in speaking on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that I would add that the second principle of relevance in this is the delinkage from the salaries of judges. As has been said earlier today, I understand that the whole issue of the Judges Act and the salary increases to which judges are entitled will be brought before the House in a separate debate at a separate time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the our House leader has said, there will be very close scrutiny at that time of the proposed increases for judges because they are being paid very well in our society at this point in time.  Further increases along the lines of what has been indicated, 11% over 4 years plus cost of living increases on top of that in addition to the salaries they receive, are not warranted at this time. This is not good policy. It is our hope that the House will not proceed in that direction at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach which is contained in this legislation has in fact been applied with success elsewhere in Canada.  I speak in terms of my own province of Alberta.  In Alberta, since 1999, the annual pay raises for members of the legislative assembly have been tied to percentage increases, or for that matter decreases, in the average weekly earnings for Albertans in the prior year depending on Statistics Canada information. That pay hike amounted to a modest increase in 2002 of 2.81%; in 2003, 2.25%; and in 2004, 1.36%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has resulted in a system in Alberta where members of the legislative assembly  have been able to secure wage and salary increases  which are fair and commensurate with inflation and cost of living increases, but which are not excessive along the lines of the 10% which was being proposed by the commission in this Parliament at some time earlier this year. This is a system which can work.  It is a system which has worked elsewhere in this country, and it is a system which we support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the third principle of which I spoke, namely, conflict of interest and the process by which MP salaries are set.  MPs should not be voting for their own salary increases or decreases, for that matter. It is a demeaning process.  It is demeaning to the House and to the fine men and women who serve here with the best of intentions.  I do not believe anyone comes to the House of Commons for the money. To have MPs voting on their own compensation year after year is not a wise process and does not advance democracy in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the real benefits of what is being proposed in this legislation is the indexing.  We will take care of that and it will not be necessary to have this debate on an annual basis. For these reasons, I support Bill C-30. I am against the 10% pay increase which otherwise would have fallen.</p><A NAME="Int-1067993"></A><a HREF="#Int-1068069"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067696"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dominic LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member for Calgary Centre-North who obviously put together a coherent presentation.  He drew parallels which I thought were interesting and appropriate with provincial legislatures. I appreciate his stated intention to support this bill, at least to send it to committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I hope the member for Calgary Centre-North might enlighten us on is his comment that he had some significant hesitation with respect to the increases proposed for federally appointed judges.  I was hoping to ask the same question of his colleague, the opposition House leader  who had made similar comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the government House leader indicated, the government will introduce at some point legislation to put into effect the quadrennial commission report, which reviewed the issue of judicial remuneration.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Calgary Centre-North has significant experience in law.  I am concerned that if Parliament begins to refuse or change recommendations from the quadrennial commission with respect to judicial remuneration, we could get into a complicated constitutional problem in terms of the independence of the judiciary. We may find ourselves with judges going to court seeking to put into effect a quadrennial commission report with respect to their own remuneration against, and it is a hypothetical circumstance, what Parliament might want to do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How might square the issue of judicial independence from the possibility of Parliament refusing the quadrennial commission report which the government has supported?</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1068069"></A><a HREF="#Int-1068125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1067993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice: </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my learned friend for his compliment about the coherency of my presentation.  I appreciate that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which he asks is a difficult one.  The government House leader has spoken about this and about the government House leader's position with respect to judge's salaries.  I have followed suit with similar comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is correct, I did practise law in this country for some 22 years, and I hold the judiciary in our country in the highest of regard. I have also read the Prince Edward Island reference case, as it is called, which deals with this issue and the entire question of judicial independence in the setting of judicial salaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will depend very much on the legislation which the government brings forward on this matter.  Today, I agree that the de-linkage of judges' salaries and parliamentary salaries is a very good thing.  It is a step forward. Clearly, the government will have to be careful about the judicial authorities on point.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out, based on the judicial compensation and benefits commission work which has been done today, that judges are being paid extraordinarily well compared to members of the legal profession who are in private practice.  This is something upon which I think most members of the legal profession would agree.  We do not wish to trench  upon a constitutional issue in dealing with judges' salaries, but judges should be compensated fairly but not excessively.</p><A NAME="Int-1068125"></A><a HREF="#Int-1068133"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1068069"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. David Kilgour (Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, would the member for Calgary Centre-North perhaps recall that the provincial judges in Alberta went to court over this very issue?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only comment I would make on a lesson learned is, as my hon. friend has said, we have to be careful about the constitutional relationship of the distribution of powers and the balance of powers between this hon. House and the judiciary. The Supreme Court decision sets out the way in which to deal with that and the way to achieve an independent setting of the salaries of judges in the country.  However, it does not mandate or require that excessive salary increases be approved or that we adopt a system which results in increases which are a departure from what other Canadians are receiving.</p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In all parliaments, whether the federal Parliament here or the Parliament in Quebec City, where I was for a while, or other parliaments in other countries, setting the salaries of members of Parliament is always an extremely difficult and thankless task for one simple reason. Members of Parliament are generally well paid and even very well paid, and the citizens who pay our salaries will always find some reason for saying that salaries are too high—and sometimes they are right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a thankless job that we have, and this is why, in the last Parliament, after some long sessions, the Liberal government decided to suggest a method of setting members' salaries that was completely beyond the control of Parliament. The judges' category is a category that parliaments have used to give themselves independent methods of setting salaries. Judges' salaries are set on the basis of recommendations based on studies done by a committee of experts that studies the economic situation and labour markets in general and makes a proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of independence are all very well, but returning every year or two to Parliament to ask the members to determine whether they should have a 1%, 2%, 3% or 5% salary increase puts the onus on the very people who daily see people in their ridings facing terrible problems, losing their jobs, plants closing, and people victimized by the cuts to the employment insurance plan decreed by the government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an inhuman task. There has never been unanimity on this, except in the former Parliament when all the parties agreed that Parliament's independent mechanism for judges could also set our salaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were happy to work with the government, several of whose members are still on the benches opposite, and several members of the current cabinet were in cabinet at that time. They took the decision then and made some recommendations. They did the work that they had to do. They assumed their responsibilities. They got our support, and the system worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened that we find ourselves here now, in this House, forced to go through this debate again when we thought that we were forever finished with it? This is what happened. The committee that determines judges' salaries did its work. It made recommendations. These recommendations leaked out and in the newspaper the headline, which lost the focus on judges, read, “MPs give themselves 10% salary increase.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No MP in this House, certainly not on this side of the House, anyway, was informed of this percentage. No one had any idea that the committee had made such a wild recommendation. We were just as speechless, surprised and even indignant as the general public, to see such a high percentage. Still, we took the responsibility. We said to ourselves, “The committee did its work badly.” </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such circumstances, when one is responsible and reasonable, when one is not a demagogue and not trying to score political points with such difficult and delicate matters, one must simply say the committee did its work badly. If the percentage is too high, the government has the option and even the duty to receive the recommendation and determine whether it is correct or too high. It can make changes to  the recommendation.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the government do? What did the Prime Minister do? Expectations were that the Prime Minister would announce, like a reasonable man, “Look, the recommendation you have seen in the papers is clearly exaggerated. The government will shoulder its responsibilities. We will have a critical look at this percentage, reduce it, bring it into more reasonable proportion, or we may ask the committee members to use different parameters. If they have used the wrong parameters, perhaps they can work with the ones that Treasury Board could provide, which are used to determine salary figures for public servants based on private industry, increases in wealth, on  this and that, to finally arrive at some increase in salary.” </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, that is not what the Prime Minister did. The Prime Minister ran to the nearest microphone to say that he would not accept his salary increase. He meant it when he said it.  He dissociated himself from all the other partners in this House, and that is worse. He said that he, personally, would not accept his salary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone  started laughing. The Prime Minister has tens of millions of dollars. There are a few members in this House, unfortunately I am not one of them, who could fulfill their duties here on a voluntary basis and continue to give money here and there without any problem. Good for them. However, when one fulfills the duties of a prime minister, one does not have the right to use himself as a standard and try to look better than the others. He said he would not collect his salary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone started laughing, the Prime Minister came back to the microphone and said that this did not make sense, that he was going to change it and cut the members' salary increase. Everyone was in agreement with the Prime Minister. However, what we expected from a responsible Prime Minister was that he would tell us that the committee would have to go back to the drawing board and make an acceptable increase proposal to us, for the judges and for us members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he took the microphone and said that 10% would be much too costly to Canadians. We agree. We do not want a 10% or 11% salary increase, but we do not want either to undo a whole process, just because the Prime Minister does not have the courage to do his job and to do it correctly. But that is another story. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was one of those who helped devise that process.  During my career, I had many opportunities to work on the salary of parliamentarians, both in Quebec City and here in Ottawa. We defined some principles. Let me begin with the first one. We felt that the public could not possibly disagree with the following principle, namely that the Prime Minister of Canada should have a salary equivalent—$1 more,  I think—to that of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, whom he appoints. The latter has much greater job security than the Prime Minister of Canada does, particularly this one. Indeed, his job is constantly on the line. He might not last very long here. So we felt that the Prime Minister should earn the same salary as the chief justice of the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anyone here who thinks this does not make sense? Yet, today the government just betrayed that principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second principle. It is said that a minister does not work as hard as a Prime Minister, has fewer responsibilities and should earn three-quarters of the Prime Minister's salary. This only makes good sense and seems perfectly acceptable. No one would do a double take over this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister earns the same salary as the chief justice, ministers earn 75% of the Prime Minister's salary and members earn 50% of the Prime Minister's salary. Seems reasonable. I do not think anyone listening to us would be shocked by this. We have established defined amounts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister had the courage to respect this, we would not be here today. How do you judge a man who acts on political opportunism? He wants to look good to the public, he wants people to like him, he wants to give the impression that he is fair and modest, and that he cares about people. </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had numerous opportunities to show he cared about people, whether in the area of employment insurance, health care, the fiscal imbalance or seniors. The Prime Minister had many opportunities to demonstrate his humanity. But no, he has decided to take his turn at members' salaries, the one subject, unfortunately, that lends itself most readily to demagogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, we would follow the Prime Minister in this respect if the government said today that it had decided to clean house and implement a separate system for judges and parliamentarians. We would look at this, and maybe we could work with it. In fact, this is what we are proposing. We want to look at new mechanisms or a mechanism with new parameters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Prime Minister who said, when the results were released, that this was far too high for Canadians, changed his tune in cabinet and gave government approval—again requiring a bill—with respect to judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would like to know how Canadians, who do not have the means to give MPs 10% more, a fact that we corroborate, suddenly are able to do this when it is for judges.  I need an explanation of how a Prime Minister, who has looked into the situation of his fellow citizens, can reach the conclusion that they cannot afford to give 300 MPs a 10% raise, but they can do it for hundreds and hundreds of judges.  I just do not get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is irresponsible.  The public needs to know that their Prime Minister makes decisions on a day by day basis.  There is no other reason the Prime Minister could use to justify his government drafting a bill that, on the one hand, cuts the pay increase for MPs while, on the other, hand making the decision to give this kind of increase to judges, who are not exactly in dire straits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of such an approach are scandalous. Are people aware that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who up to now has earned as much as the Prime Minister of Canada, and furthermore is appointed by the Prime Minister, and has job security, will now earn $26,000 more per year than the Prime Minister? It is unbelievable. People listening who do not earn even $15,000 per year must understand that this government has decided to give a $26,000 annual increase to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The government is acting shamelessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Bloc Québécois is quite simple. We cannot agree to, nor do we want any salary increase for parliamentarians. Even the increase proposed by government seems, at this point, inappropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do want, however, the Prime Minister to deal with this matter in the following way. A parliamentary committee must be created that will set slightly more serious parameters for the  judges compensation review committee. There is no need to deal with compensation for members and judges separately. The only thing we need to do is ask the committee to reconsider the issue using new parameters. The ridiculous recommendations that are often announced year after year are creating a huge gap between   judges and the rest of Canadian society in terms of wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen it, the minister talked about 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.7% per year. Do members know that judges, in addition to the 11%, get a cost of living adjustment? In four years, this represents a 15% or 16% increase in salary. Who, in Canada, gets a 15% or 16% salary increase in a four-year period? Few people do. Almost no one gets that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government justify such a thing?</p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are disappointed and deeply offended by the attitude of the Prime Minister, who, for political expediency, and because of his inability to assume his responsibilities as Prime Minister, has attempted to wreck an entire system without even asking himself if that system was not the best one. The Prime Minister did not hesitate to trample, to destroy the arguments in respect of a system that the previous government, of which several ministers were members, had put in place and implemented to finally resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister does not respect anything, except perhaps this sort of paranoia  about the popularity he wishes he had. Moreover, he does not understand that he will not make headway with demagogic behaviour like this. If he wants to  be popular with the public, they  should set  aside the issue of salaries for MPs and tackle unemployment. We have to examine the employment insurance program before the recess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to deal with the million of children living in poverty in this country, who need help and whom the government should help. But no, we are not dealing with poor children, or the unemployed, or the elderly, to whom the government owes billions of dollars. Instead, we are dealing with the salaries of MPs. That is indecent. While this matter could easily have been dealt with in committee, had the government so decided,  the government, is increasing the salaries of judges and, to a lesser extent, that of MPs, but not dealing with anything else. If the Prime Minister wants to be popular, he is going to have to learn to set real priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like my colleagues in the opposition to ask themselves: if we agree today to an increase in MPs' salaries are we not  acting in complicity with the government?   Are we not agreeing to this  bad strategy of the Prime Minister by letting him have his way and saying, “You have more reasonable figures. Let us look no further. Let us change the system”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, all opposition members should stick together and tell the Prime Minister that we do not appreciate his way of doing things; that we refuse to destroy a system that can work and that is based on reasonable parameters, provided we give directions to those who work within it.  There is no need to rebuild the whole  system; we simply have to be reasonable and assume our responsibilities. However, whenever something comes up, the Prime Minister starts acting like a ship at sea that is going in all directions because of the wind. Back home, we refer to this as  a ship with a lot of sail, but no rudder. It is disturbing to have a Prime Minister who has a lot of sail, but no rudder. This is what we have before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am asking my fellow opposition members to say no to this bill. Let us force the government to put this issue back into the hands of hon. members through a parliamentary committee. Let us ask them to look at the process. Let us ask the committee to set adequate parameters to give reasonable salary increases to members, judges, public servants and all the citizens who deal with the government and whose salaries are paid by the government. This is what we should do. This is what we are asking, and this is why we will oppose this bill. We will oppose it and we urge the government to assume its responsibilities by adopting the system that we are proposing, because it is much more effective, logical, sensible, and respectful of the public, and  it is not based on   a demagogic approach.</p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to speak in English so my question is really clear.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member made a comment about the Prime Minister acting as ship without a rudder.  I would suggest that perhaps it is a ship that is not paying taxes.  It may be one of the reasons why he feels at this time that it was so opportune for him to be able to dismiss any pay increase, a notion that for many of the people in my riding of Skeena—Bulkley Valley would be absolutely obscene, but I suppose when one is a multi-millionaire several times over in the avoidance of taxes  one is able to make such suggestions and is able to hold to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have reopened this can of worms, as it were, and are now preparing to look at another way of compensating members of Parliament due to this lack of leadership, I am wondering if we could consider this.  The House is meant to represent and defend many of the issues the member raised in terms of poverty among children, student loans and student debt loads.  I am wondering if we would not consider tying our salaries to an index related to those issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Parliament is functioning and doing well on something like health care or child poverty, then we should be compensated equally as well if we are doing our job. Many in the private sector have looked to such a system in order to compensate their managers and upper managers; when the company does well, they too do well.  In this House, regardless of what poor legislation gets passed year after year, the salaries continue to rise, while for people in Canada the wage gap continues to grow and people become poorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would there not be another index available to us, one that ties the members in the House to the quality of life experienced by Canadians, particularly lower and middle income Canadians? We can measure our society by how we treat these people.  I am wondering if the House might eventually consider such original and diverse thinking as this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorts of suggestions were made. Some claimed,  I think quite rightly, that members' salaries should be tied to collective wealth. Others claimed that members should accept the lowest index based on a certain number of similar categories. Still others claimed that pay increases should be comparable to those given to government officials. Every possible suggestion was made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own personal values can guide us in choosing one method over another. As to the hon. member's concerns, one thing is certain. We were all taken by surprise to see a potential salary increase of 10%. We are not irresponsible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should members' salaries be based on? The mechanism proposed by the government leader is not a bad idea. To some degree, it could be considered fair in relation to society. I do not know. It is a difficult issue to resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the sensitive issue of the salary of parliamentarians should be taken out of  our hands. The process must be based on something else. It should not be up to us to decide how much we will pay ourselves, or what criteria will apply. In fact, this is why we had all agreed, that is the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, the Conservative Party of Canada and the Liberals on a process whereby a committee would make an independent review of the judges' salary. This is what was proposed to us by the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find most despicable is that while the government was proposing that approach, which we found to be fair, this whole thing came up with the Prime Minister and the leak in the media. The Deputy Prime Minister was going around, telling everyone not to compare the salaries of members with those of  judges, because the work was not the same. What do we compare an MP to? to a church warden? To a city councillor? To who? To an American senator? We cannot compare members of Parliament to other groups, because  they do a different and unique type of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the person who makes the legislation is, in a way, rather close to the person who interprets the legislation and the person who defends it. We are part of a legislative system. The Deputy Prime Minister told us that it was outrageous, that we had nothing in common with judges. Today, we are being asked to give ourselves a salary increase as if we were plumbers, plant workers, nurses or electricians. Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister finds the work done by these groups more closely related to the duties of a member of Parliament.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ridiculous. These arguments are only meant to serve the interests of those who use them. What we are saying is that there is no ideal indexation. There is no solution. It will always be a painful debate. It is a painful debate right now. This is why we are not asking for any raise of the members' salaries.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that this is far from being an urgent matter. We could very well  take a fresh second look at the issue, as regards both members of Parliament and judges. We could consider suggestions, such as the one made by the hon. member, or other ones that may be made here today. This would be much more responsible than the approach used by a government that is panicking and trying to save face for the Prime Minister and  justify the commitments that he made in an unacceptable fashion. This is what is happening here and this is what we object to.</p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1068982"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069014"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1068855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice (Calgary Centre-North, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, I have a question for my hon. friend, who is a very experienced member. He is a respected member and also a good speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was right when he spoke of the Prime Minister. What is the government's motivation for introducing this bill? What does he think it is?</p><A NAME="Int-1069014"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1068982"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Michel Gauthier: </b>Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked me what motivated the government. Its motivation was, in fact, very simple. I touched on it at   the end of my remarks. On the government side, there is a need to cover this excessive   reaction of the Prime Minister, which was not based on  rationality, was neither proper nor respectful of ongoing processes, showed no respect for the people and was solely designed to make him look good in the newspapers the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is going on. The government is covering the inappropriate, hasty and unjustified decisions of a Prime Minister who has not yet understood that the person who holds that position has to be able to weather the storm, think things over and, then,   propose appropriate solutions, not be all over the place in an attempt to please the public.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1069050"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069264"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069014"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, usually when I get up to speak in the House, I say that I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak.  Thinking about this particular bill, realistically and honestly, I do not feel like I am pleased to have this opportunity.  I am doing it because I am the House leader for the NDP and I am doing it to reflect the position of our caucus. Quite honestly, I am fed up with this issue as are many people.  Here we are again in 2004 debating compensation for members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to what the government House leader had to say.  At one point in his remarks he said it was very logical to take this step, that is, Bill C-30. I began to think about that in terms of the logic of what is taking place here today in debating Bill C-30. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose one could argue that it is logical from the government's point of view once the Prime Minister had made his political statements that he was going to undo what Parliament had previously done.  From the government's point of view, one could argue that it has some logic.  However, in the greater scale of things, it is unfortunate that we are yet again debating what seems to be a perennial issue on the compensation of members of Parliament.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues asked the government House leader why the government wants to have this particular index.  The government House leader said the index was based on average wage settlements in the private sector and was a reasonable thing.  Why is this index acceptable now, but in 2001 another measure was somehow acceptable?  This question was brought up by my colleagues in the Bloc, and is the question we need to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that yet again this issue has become politicized.  All members on all sides of the House would agree that we want, what we have been striving for, is a system of deliberation and implementation of  pay increases for members of Parliament that is independent, rational, defendable and realistic.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to believe, and I think most members of the House believe, that we get paid very well.  I, like other members, work very hard at what I do.  I consider it to be an enormous privilege to be a member of Parliament.  I consider it to be an enormous privilege to be one of 308 members of Parliament representing the diversity of our  ridings across this country.  We get paid well for that.  We all work hard.  All members share in that sort of commonality and solidarity about what this place is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to be here debating our pay increase yet again for politically motivated reasons.  Bill C-28, the former bill dealing with pay increases for members of Parliament, was passed in this place on June 7, 2001.  I looked at the record and in actual fact the member for LaSalle--Émard voted in favour of third reading of that bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House leaders have spoken of the process they went through at that time to establish a sense of independence and rationality when dealing with compensation.  I was not a part of that. Our former House leader, the member for Elmwood--Transcona, now the dean of the House, was very much a part of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has put forward the principles of establishing an independent process, and criteria and benchmarks for determining our compensation.  We believed that  happened in 2001. Presumably the member for LaSalle--Émard believed it also as did other government members because they voted for that bill.   All of that has been undone.  Here we are today with another version and another index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could argue, like other members have, that this index, which is  based on Human Resources Development Canada and the average wage index in the private sector, is a reasonable thing.  What really gets people's backs up and why we are reacting as we are to the bill today is because of the history that has brought us to this point. The question is still out there and it makes me feel unsettled.  How many more times will we have to go through this?</p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a new bill, Bill C-30. Now we have another index. Now we are to believe that it will be an independent thing and  never more will members of Parliament have to deal with this issue. What assurance and confidence is there that it will happen now that this has been undone again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  bothers me and I know it bothers other members  in our caucus.  I have to agree with members from the Bloc Québécois and our member who spoke previously.  There is a double standard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take all   this time debating   MP compensation   when what we really need to be doing is focusing our time, resources and priorities on why   the average wages of Canadians   have fallen so far behind. One reason  the index is  so low is that  people are not  getting the pay increases that they need and deserve. Most   people  are working longer hours and  more overtime but  they have less take home pay now than they did a decade ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite members to come to my community in east Vancouver to  see what it means for working families who are struggling to make ends meet and where both parents are working,  sometimes at several jobs, and  paying exorbitant child care costs.  They are paying 40% or 50% of their income for housing costs.  That is the debate  we should be grappling with in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are things  that stick  in one's craw when we are here again debating the salary of members of Parliament.  It becomes a big controversial issue in the public about how much money we make and  how it is decided, and we all get drawn into it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  me it was the height of cynical  and opportunistic politics in the way the Prime Minister dealt with this issue before we came back in the fall.  I think that  even members in the Liberal caucus were dismayed and rather shocked at how this was dealt with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader was correct when he  said that it will be the will of Parliament as to what we do.      We are a minority Parliament, and yes, theoretically the opposition parties could get together  and agree to vote down the bill, make a decision  to do whatever in terms of MP compensation and it would carry.  However that is not the point.  I think we have to stick to the principle, which is that there has to be an independent process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard a lot of discussion today on  what will happen to the Judges Act when it comes before us. As we know the previous increase that would have come forward was linked to the quadrennial report of a judge's increase. I think the  feeling now is that if it is not good enough for the MPs why should it be good enough for the judges.  Therefore there have been some remarks here today from the Conservative Party that it will not proceed in that manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that  the NDP debated this very carefully in our caucus.  As much as we do not want to, as much as we detest the politics that got us to this point today, we are prepared to deal with the bill on its merit in terms of  the index that is before us.  We will agree that it should go to committee. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However in terms of what takes place with another bill that comes forward on the Judges Act, we will deal with it on its merit.  We will look at it at that time.  We will decide,   in terms of implementing those recommendations that the government has accepted on the quadrennial report, as it applies to an increase for judges.  At this moment I think we  would be further escalating the cynicism that is taking place and the political nature of what takes place if we said that  we will just automatically   turn down that increase  at this point. We should wait until the bill comes forward and  look at it on its own merit and on its own standing. That is what we intend to do in the NDP.  That is how we will debate it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will likely go to committee very shortly and we will support that.   We will look at the index that is being proposed and we will probably support it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think  the way it has been handled   smacks of the kind of politics that we have come to expect from the    Prime Minister.  He does not have the  kind of backbone to stick with a decision that has been made. If we are talking about what is fair, then let us get to the essence of it.  </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about what is fair for Canadians,   particularly those who are struggling in our society because of   government  cutbacks, the cutbacks made by the Prime Minister when he was finance minister over the last decade. That should be the real politics of what is going on in this place, not MP compensation.</p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1069264"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069344"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Guy Lauzon (Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the  chance to speak to Bill C-30. The bill would implement the long-standing position of the Conservative Party, which is that members of Parliament should not be determining their own salaries. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last attempt to create an impartial mechanism for determining MPs' pay led it to be indexed to the salary of the chief justice of the Supreme Court whose salary is determined by the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.  However, when the commission recently recommended an 11% pay increase for the chief justice, the controversy was reopened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, it would be inappropriate for members of Parliament to accept an increase that is so far beyond what most Canadians receive, especially when we are already making a salary that most Canadians can only dream of. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many people would question whether judges need and deserve an 11% pay raise either. It would have been nice if this legislation could have been accompanied by measures to reform the way judges get paid as well. It is a different issue in some ways because the job description and hiring and firing process for judges is very different than for MPs. It also comes down to preventing people in positions of authority and trust from lining their own pockets at the expense of overburdened Canadian taxpayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An 11% pay raise for a backbench or opposition MP would mean a raise bigger than the total annual salary of some Canadians. In fact, Canadians whose entire annual salary is only two-thirds as much as the raise proposed for members of Parliament, would be paying taxes to fund those raises. That would be simply obscene. Of course partly that is because the Liberal government has refused to enact the  Conservative policy of increasing the amount  low income Canadians can make before they pay taxes. However an  11% raise is difficult to justify in any circumstances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament do not need exorbitant compensation. Those of us who work hard,   stay honest and do our level best on behalf of our constituents and all Canadians, are certainly not in it for the money. Some MPs have already had highly successful careers in the private sector. My hon. colleague from Newmarket—Aurora is a case in point. Although she has worked hard and performed admirably as international trade critic for the government in waiting, she has not accepted a dime from Canadian taxpayers. Instead, she has chosen to donate her salary to a charitable foundation. I applaud her for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, the hon. Danny Williams, is a formidable leader and advocate of his province and has worked extremely hard on issues that are vital to Atlantic Canada, yet he too has decided to forgo his entire salary. He has taken the fight of ordinary Newfoundlanders to heart. He knows they face incredible financial burdens as a result of the high taxes, oppressive business climate and patronage driven, market distorting, reallocation schemes of the federal government, and   has placed the interests of Newfoundlanders far above his own personal interests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not all of us are in the position to work free of charge, and I would not suggest that anyone should do so, but the examples set by our colleagues I have mentioned prove that the best legislators care more about their constituents than about their own compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are our bosses and I do not think they believe that we need or deserve double digit raises. In fact many Canadians probably feel that they were hoodwinked when they hired certain candidates to represent them in this place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government members were hired because they said they would enact democratic reform, make the equalization system more conducive to economic growth and make the federal government more fiscally responsible. I think most Canadians would say that we as a Parliament have not yet fulfilled these basis elements of our job and we should not expect a raise until we live up to our commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the bill because I am hopeful that it will create a reasonable and impartial mechanism for determining compensation for members of the  House so we can finally stop debating our own pay and start debating the things that matter to Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1069344"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069264"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker,  as we have heard a few times this afternoon, here we go again.  For those of us who have been here for more than one term, we have had this discussion before, and it has a ring of familiarity.  I guess I am reminded of the statement by J.K. Chesteron that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. That is what seems to have happened with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 the government brought in  Bill C-28.  It said that it would solve this situation once and for all.  We had a discussion on this issue.  The government came forward with legislation that would tie the salaries of MPs to those of the judges, as has been said this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the government did not plan at the time that the commission, which reviews the salaries of judges, would come back with a recommendation that those salaries be raised somewhere between 11% and 16%.  We heard the minister this afternoon say that it was closer to 16% than 11%. The government did not figured that into the equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciated what my Bloc colleague had to say earlier.  He said that when the Prime Minister heard the news that had been leaked to the media, he overreacted and said that he would separate himself from anything to do with it.   He was one of the people who brought forth   the legislation in the first place. We are back again today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill C-28 came out in 2001, the government was enthusiastic about it. The minister of state and leader of the government in the House at the time, the member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, issued a press release.  It stated, “This bill implements the recommendations made in the report of the independent Commission...The bill makes parliamentary compensation more transparent”, which is ironic given what we have run into over the last couple of months in trying to deal this issue, “and brings it more into line with compensation for comparable groups.”   He concluded by saying, “It is a fair and reasonable approach to parliamentary compensation and I invite all parliamentarians to support it”. It was supported, but it turned out that it was not a fair and reasonable package and approach to this situation. We are back dealing with it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House the member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--parliamentary compensation would be based from here on in on the compensation of the supreme court chief justice. This is not a new idea. Officers of parliament, such as the information commissioner and the chief electoral officer, already receive the same compensation as a federal court judge, so the precedent is there for officers of the House. What we are proposing here is to do the same for parliamentarians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on say that under Bill C-28 the prime minister would receive the same compensation as the chief justice of the Supreme Court, not $1 more. I do not see him here today to defend the previous bill, which he was once so enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my colleague a question.  We have now switched the system for indexing parliamentarians' wages from tying it to the Supreme Court chief justice to using a different system.  Rather than tie it to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, it will be tied to the  index of the average percentage increase in base rate wages for the calendar year resulting from major settlements negotiated with bargaining units of 500 or more employees in the private sector of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he feel the government is competent enough that we will not be back again dealing with the  issue  in light of the fact that those settlements may at some point in the future be too extreme for the government to deal with as well?  Is he comfortable with the government's approach now? Does he think this is a fair and reasonable way to do it?</p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1069440"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069495"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069344"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Guy Lauzon: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am not particularly comfortable with the way the current government is dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a case in point, I was elected to the House only five months ago.  When I came to this place, one of the first things that was discussed was   whether I should get a 10% raise.  I know of no other position that I could have aspired to where within months of getting the job I would automatically get a 10% raise. As I mentioned in my comments, some of the raises proposed in the legislation are obscene.  To propose a raise that is more than what some people earn in a year is obscene. I am not particularly comfortable that our wages should be tied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an average Canadian. I would like to think that the people who  elected me to the House feel that I am doing a good job and am working hard.  If I am satisfying their needs, I should get the same average increase as they would. A fair salary increase for all members would be what the average Canadian receives. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very well paid.  As I mentioned in my speech, some of our members do not  take a salary from the House. They do this because they believe in the cause.  I think most members elected to the House are here not for the money but because they feel they can contribute to Canadian society, and that is why I am here.</p><A NAME="Int-1069495"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069518"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Edmonton—Sherwood Park, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, the member made a statement a few seconds ago about the fact that members come here because they love the work.  I believe that is probably true, but it is also a bit of a dilemma if our salaries  do not represent a wage level that permits members of Parliament or people to run for Parliament who have normal expenses and who are not independently wealthy. I happen to be one of those. I was an instructor at a post-secondary institution for many years.  It was becoming increasingly difficult to pay all the bills living on a single salary with a family.  That is one reason why  I became a politician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came here, part of my motivation was to see what I could do to reduce government spending and reduce taxation. Compensation for members of Parliament ought to be very balanced. It should not be so little that only people who are independently wealthy can run.  Nor should it be so much that those who have been elected somehow feel they have won a lottery. It ought to be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the hon. member could expand a little on his comment because of the things  I have stated, namely that I do not believe we want only the elite, the rich, the independently wealthy to work as members of Parliament?</p><A NAME="Int-1069518"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069495"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Guy Lauzon: </b>Mr. Speaker, the term he used about our salaries being balanced is a term with which I am very comfortable.  What is most appropriate is that we have balanced compensation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. member that we should not be underpaid, but by the same token, we do not want to think that running for Parliament is the same as winning a lottery. Therefore, I am not suggesting that any of us should not be compensated. We should be fairly compensated. Our hours of work are extremely long and we should receive adequate compensation to reflect that. However, I do not think a 10% increase per year is appropriate in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should task the government with resolving this situation once and for all.    We should come up with some kind of a formula that is appropriate to all concerned. As the member mentioned, let us quit government waste and maybe we can all be fairly compensated as a result.</p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair has examined Bill C-278, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (improvement of the employment insurance system) to determine whether its provisions would require a royal recommendation and thus prevent the Chair from putting the question at third reading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvements to the employment insurance program envisioned by this bill include the required minimum number of hours worked in order to qualify, lengthening the   period that one can receive benefits, and, as well, increasing those benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that such changes to the employment insurance program would have the effect of authorizing increased expenditures of public revenue. Inasmuch as section 54 of the Constitution, 1867, and Standing Order 79 prohibit the adoption of any bill appropriating public revenues without a royal recommendation, the same must apply to bills authorizing increased spending of public revenues. Bills mandating new or additional public spending must be seen as the equivalent of bills effecting an appropriation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I must require that Bill C-278 be accompanied by a royal recommendation. Therefore, in its present form, I will not put the question on third reading unless a royal recommendation is received for this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the debate on the motion for second reading will continue as scheduled, and the motion shall be put to a vote at the close of this second reading debate.</p>

Employment insurance is particularly inequitable for young people and women; for young people who must accumulate 910 hours before being eligible for their initial application, as well as for women returning to the labour force after more than two years' absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see that, in the early 1990s, no less than 52% of the unemployed aged 25 or under were receiving EI benefits and that now, only 16% are, we cannot help but want to change EI. That is why, today,  I want to debate the bill I am introducing, the aim of which is to    amend the Employment Insurance Act (improvement of the employment insurance system).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment insurance is no longer an assistance program, but a hidden tax. The current Prime Minister, as finance minister, raided the EI fund to balance the budget. The Auditor General's latest report, tabled November 23, 2004, states that the government  continues to raid the EI fund, despite the efforts of parliamentarians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the powers of the Employment Insurance Commission,  which consists of individuals who are contributors, will apparently be suspended for yet another year. Even now, the Prime Minister is interfering in social affairs, by misappropriating the EI fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2001, the Bloc Québécois adopted a unanimous report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development andthe Status of Persons with Disabilities on employment insurance reform and we continue to call for its implementation. The Bloc Québécois is against the fund being wasted and proposes the creation of an independent employment insurance commission and fund, the reimbursement by the government over a 10-year period of misused money, the setting of premium rates by the Employment Insurance Commission and the improvement of the system for the most vulnerable workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois has proposed special employment insurance measures for workers affected by the softwood lumber crisis. Consider this: the current employment insurance fund surplus of $46 billion is roughly triple what the Chief Actuary at Human Resources Development Canada thought would be enough in 2001—some $15 billion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, an HRDC study showed that 35% of claimants reached their maximum weeks of benefit. The 2004 employee premium rate is $1.98 for every $100 of insurable employment. The equilibrium premium rate for 2004 is estimated by HRDC to be $1.81. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in January 2004 was 7.4% across Canada and 9.1% in  Quebec. The average regular benefits in dollars a week is $289.54.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in the summary of this bill to correct a few of the problems, we find several amendments made to the Employment Insurance Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it reduces the minimum qualifying period to 360 hours of work regardless of the regional rate of unemployment. It also increases the benefit period by five weeks. It increases the rate of weekly benefits from 55% to 60%, and It repeals the waiting period. It eliminates the distinctions between a new entrant and a re-entrant to the labour force. It also eliminates the presumption that persons related to each other do not deal with each other at arm’s length. In addition, It increases the maximum yearly insurable earnings from $39,000 to $41,500 and introduces an indexing formula. It requires the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to pay out, as workforce support measures, at least 0.8% of the insurable earnings—as estimated by the Commission—of all insured persons. Finally, it provides that, if a person has insurable earnings of not more than $3,000 a year the Minister of Human Resources Development must refund all deductions made  from those earnings.</p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking it point by point, first we have the reduction of the minimum qualifying period to 360 hours. We know that on May 3, 2004, the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development  held public hearings in connection with the updating of its 2001 report. The major unions presented a unanimous proposal  to modify the EI eligibility rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current  system provides that eligibility for EI benefits begins in a range of 420 to 910 hours of work, depending on the place of residence and whether the person is a new entrant or a re-entrant to the labour force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanimously, these same unions asked that eligibility for employment insurance begin at 360 hours of work, regardless of residence. This rule would provide more satisfactory coverage for workers in seasonal businesses and also for all workers in insecure jobs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand now, the threshold for eligibility for benefits varies between 420 and 700 hours.  It is 420 hours in regions with an unemployment rate over 13% and 700 hours in regions where the unemployment rate is 6% or less. The bill before us today would reduce  the minimum qualifying period to 360 hours of work for everyone, but the benefit period would vary with the region and  the regional rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison to the current figures, the new system would represent an average increase of five weeks in the benefit period and an increase in the maximum benefit period from 45 to 50 weeks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regions with high unemployment—13% or more—it would provide between 30 and 50 weeks of benefits depending on the hours worked and the unemployment rate. For Quebec's high unemployment regions, it would substantially reduce what we call the spring gap or black hole. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Gaspé, where the unemployment rate as of December 4, 2004, was 20%, a person who worked 360 hours would be eligible for 36 weeks of benefits. If that person worked 420 hours, he or she would be eligible for 37 weeks, which is 5 more than at present. On the North Shore, where the unemployment rate is 12%, the maximum benefit after 360 hours of work would be 26 weeks and after 420 hours, 27 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSN appeared before the Subcommittee on the Employment Insurance Funds on November 15, and stated that their main demands still concern the same things: to improve the eligibility rules by requiring only a minimum of 360 hours so that 70 to 80 percent of those who lose their jobs can receive employment insurance benefits. The main reason for this is that 39% of the work force only works 35 hours a week. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Labour Congress, through its representative, Hassan Yussef, said the following:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> We've submitted a full brief, and more recommendations for training and of course 360 hours for qualifying for unemployment insurance.  The CLC recommends scrapping the current patchwork of qualifying hours in favour of 360 hours for all EI entitlements, unemployment benefits, as well as pregnancy, parental leave, sickness, and compassionate leave benefits </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec is increasingly interested in the principle of reconciling work and family life, and therefore views this 35 hours yardstick as a significant obstacle to developing such a policy. It needs to be revised without delay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look now at extending the duration of benefits.  In this bill we are suggesting an increase of 5 weeks, from 45 to 50.   As you are aware, there are many workers in industries with seasonal fluctuations, including the fishery, agri-food, tourism, the hotel industry and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasonal employment is common in the regions, but it also affects the major centres, particularly  as far as tourism is concerned. Every year, many people are confronted with the seasonal gap, which can be as much as a dozen weeks long, between the time their EI benefits run out and their work starts back up.   According to federal statistics, close to 35% of EI recipients use up all their benefit period. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is calling upon the government to put an end to this seasonal gap by adding five weeks to the maximum benefit period, raising it from 45 weeks to 50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now read an excerpt from the 2001 report of the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development. </p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Committee recommends that the government consider readjusting Schedule I of the Employment Insurance Act so as to provide a maximum benefit entitlement of 50 weeks like that afforded combined maternity/parental benefits.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the existing schedule 1, consideration should be given to augmenting benefit entitlement beyond the minimum hourly qualification requirement, so as to provide an additional incentive to work for a longer period of time than the minimum number of hours required to qualify for benefits. The new schedule 1 should provide no more than a maximum increase of five additional weeks of benefits for any given combination of hours of insurable employment and regional unemployment rates. In addition, schedule 1 should be reconfigured, to the greatest extent possible, to ameliorate the “gapper” problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how, every year, seasonal workers  go through the gap. Resource regions are  particularly hard hit by that problem. It seems to us that action is urgently required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the third element, increasing the rate of weekly benefits to 60%, we are asking that benefits be increased from 55% to 60%. This can be illustrated by saying that, in Quebec, minimum wage is $7.45. For an employee working   35 hours a week, this means $260.75 gross, which would entitle this person to employment benefits of less than $287, before tax,  every two weeks, or $574 per month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, 192,000 Quebeckers were earning minimum wage, of which 66.6% were women. The  55% benefits rate affects in particular low-income workers, two-thirds of whom are women. Hon. members will understand that, as critic for the status of women, I am very sensitive to this problem facing poor women in Canada, who are raising children in poverty, in addition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 4, François Vaudreuil,  the president of the Centrale des syndicats démocratiques, told the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, “We also believe it is urgently necessary to increase to 60% the replacement rate of the benefits”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that same committee, many witnesses called for an increase in the rate of benefits. Some were suggesting it be set between 60% and 66%. It is nonetheless important, they reminded the committee, to find  a balance between meeting the needs of eligible unemployed workers and reinforcing the incentive to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee heard the testimony of the  the acting director general, labour market policy directorate, at Human Resources Development Canada. Her name is  Wilma Vreejwijk, and she told us:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>These are important questions in terms of ensuring that there is the income adequacy. Certainly, when looking at the issue of the benefit rate, we need to strike a balance between ensuring that there is sufficient support provided to those people that need it. At the same time as ensuring that we have the work incentives right. So that is why we have the family supplement, and the family supplement has, as you pointed out, gone up each and every year quite recently. This supplement has gone up because the families need it.</small></td>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change is to repeal the waiting period, which penalizes workers who have lost their jobs. There is also another change. There is the elimination of the distinction between a new entrant and a re-entrant to the labour force. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the elimination of the link between persons related to each other. This is a question of members of the same family  being entitled to employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Bloc Québécois bill wants to make a change and shift the burden to the commission to prove that there is a link of dependence between the employer and employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the Employment Insurance Commission would be required to pay out, as workforce support measures,  0.8% of the insurable earnings—as estimated by the Commission—of all insured persons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my time is running out I will just say that this is an important measure to ensure that it is no longer unemployment insurance we are talking about, but employment insurance and that we understand the need for training for all workers.</p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this bill to amend the Employment Insurance Act proposes eliminating some of the irritants and inequities in the employment insurance program. I hope that all the hon. members in this House will support it for the good of our society, which needs more of our attention.</p><A NAME="Int-1069948"></A><a HREF="#Int-1069981"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069711"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Crête (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for Trois-Rivières on her speech, which was very precise and clear, but most of all, respectful of the commitments that the Bloc Québécois made in the election campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same cannot be said of the Liberal Party of Canada, which forms the government. We had the best proof of that this week. It decided  to reduce the employment insurance premiums by 3¢. That means 3¢ per $100 of earnings. For people earning $500 a week, it would mean 15¢ more in their pockets as workers. At the end of a year in which they worked 40 weeks, it would mean $6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the member from Trois-Rivières is the following. Would it not have been more relevant and worthwhile, instead of reducing employment insurance premiums by 3¢, to evaluate the increased amount  and to redistribute it and broaden eligibility to the employment insurance plan? Would this not be comparable? Would this not have been preferable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I do not think that there is a single member of this House who went around during the election campaign telling people that, if his party were elected, it would reduce employment insurance premiums by 3¢,  saying that he was proposing a benefit. This is not what we understood. We understood the Liberal Party to say that there would be real reform. I was here when the report was adopted unanimously three years ago. I was our human resources critic at the time. Today, we are seeing the same behaviour of the Liberal majority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to know from my colleague whether it would not actually have been much better to reduce the eligibility requirements to 360 hours, as she proposes? In this way, we would have a much fairer system for people who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs and who need an income between jobs.</p><A NAME="Int-1069981"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070002"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069948"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Paule Brunelle: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. It is all the more interesting because yesterday we were able to obtain more information at the Subcommittee on the Employment Insurance Funds. Mr. Malcom Brown, assistant deputy minister of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, stated that reducing the qualifying period for the employment insurance program to 360 hours for everyone would cost only $390 million, the same cost as a reduction of 3¢ in premiums. It is a choice that should have been made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the workers in our constituencies coping with the gap, with the growing poverty that we see, we all know that this money would have been well used to meet essential needs if it had been put back into our regional economies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would have made it possible to reduce the required number of hours to 360. It would have opened access to employment insurance for another 90,000 people. It would have been wonderful for workers and it would have given a big boost to our economy. </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1070002"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070008"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1069981"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Lévesque (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on the bill that she has just introduced.

In just one region, Abitibi—Baie-James and Abitibi—Témiscamingue, the loss amounts to $66 million. That is a lot of money for the regional economy. We know that many remote areas of Quebec are in real difficulty. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my colleague if this measure would really allow low income workers and seasonal workers to achieve a more decent standard of living.</p><A NAME="Int-1070008"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070002"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Paule Brunelle: </b>Mr. Speaker, there is no question that increasing the benefit period by five weeks would help the regional economy and workers. For many of them, employment insurance is not a choice but a last resort. In this type of economy, most workers cannot wait for something else to come along. There is nothing else. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to know that the government does not put one cent into the employment insurance fund. It is insurance, plain and simple. People expect, when making a claim, to receive their fair share from what employees and employers have paid. This is only normal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I insure my home, and something bad happens, or there is a fire or what have you, I expect to be paid for the damages incurred. I would think that the same principle should apply to employment insurance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a particularly important debate, because EI plays a key role in providing temporary income support  for people coping with job loss and for employed people who cannot work for reasons of sickness, childbirth, parental responsibilities, or the need to care for a dying family member. Also, for those Canadians who have lost a job, EI provides skills development opportunities, that is, training so that they can return to work quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate the importance of EI, let me outline how it helped Canadians during the period 2002-03. During that time, Canadians filed 1.87 million new EI claims and $12.3 billion was paid out in benefits. In addition, 638,000 people participated in active re-employment measures, an investment of $2.1 billion in training and in the labour market success of the people concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly EI is there for people when they need it most, but this was not always the case. Before the introduction of EI in 1996, aspects of the old unemployment insurance system caused some to question the very sustainability of this vital program, a program which is vital for social reasons, for reasons of humanity and, by the way, for reasons of keeping our economy going. Those features included the encouragement of people to become dependent on program benefits, and it emphasized unemployment rather than employment, in some cases actually acting as a disincentive to work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this bill threatens to return us to the situation that confronted us in the past. Let us take, for instance, the bill's proposal to relax entrance requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four successive monitoring and assessment reports, the reports which review the program regularly, have stated that overall access to EI benefits is strong: 88% of employees would be potentially eligible for EI if they lost their jobs. Among those working full time, 96% would be potentially eligible for EI if they lost their jobs. Among part time employees, 57% of women and 41% of men would be potentially eligible for EI if they lost their jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-278 would also increase the benefit duration, which could have the effect of making unemployment more attractive than work. Such a suggestion contradicts successive EI monitoring and assessment reports which have said that the current duration of benefits is in fact appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on average, regular beneficiaries receive benefits for less than two-thirds of the weeks for which they are eligible, which means that the benefit duration is already more than enough for most clients. Even people living in areas of high unemployment typically do not use more than 70% of their entitlement. Add to this the fact that benefit exhaustion rates have steadily declined since EI's introduction, from approximately 37% in 1995-96 to about 31% in 2001-02. All of this suggests that the benefit duration is appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the bill's call for the government to raise the replacement rate and maximum insurable earnings? In my opinion, this also is unwise given that the current 55% replacement rate serves as a balance between income adequacy and ensuring that work incentives are maintained. In addition, individuals in low income families with children can get additional support through the family supplement, which allows these individuals to receive as much as 80% of their insured earnings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that at the time of EI reform concerns were raised about the fact that the level of maximum insurable earnings at that time was substantially higher than the average industrial wage and so was acting as a disincentive to work. To address this, the level was reduced to $39,000 a year with the understanding that it would be reviewed at some later date when the average industrial wage increased to the equivalent of that level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a review has not occurred because the maximum insurable earnings figure is still 10% higher than the average industrial wage. It is important to note that 70% of all paid employees have earnings below the $39,000 level, which means that the majority of claimants have their employment income fully insured by the EI program at its current level. This level seems to be set properly as well.</p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the proposal to increase the premium refund threshold from $2,000 to $3,000, while also lowering entrance requirements to 360 hours. This recommendation is also ill-advised since it would effectively result in some workers being in a position to qualify for and receive EI benefits without having paid premiums, something none of us would wish to see happen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the bill contains a number of serious flaws. That brings me to the heart of the matter, namely, that given the vital importance that EI plays in our social safety net, it is critically important that any changes we make to it be well thought out in advance to avoid unintended negative consequences that could damage the whole program and its ability to help workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not to say that EI is cast in stone, never to change. Some fine tuning is required from time to time, and when evidence indicates that such changes are necessary, the government has acted. For example, this happened when we removed the intensity rule, when we adjusted the clawback, and when we made the small weeks provision a permanent and national element of the program and subsequently increased the threshold. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also commenced a pilot project to test labour market impacts in areas of high unemployment by adding five weeks of entitlement to address the needs of those who go without income for a period of time prior to the resumption of their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rather than make rash, badly thought out changes as this bill would have us do, we instead need to pursue a balanced approach that takes into account larger issues such as the likely impact of changes on the labour market as a whole, on the financial sustainability of EI in the future and on the EI program as a whole. Because EI is such a complex program, involving employed as well as unemployed people, that impacts many aspects of our economy and  the lives of millions of workers and their families, we need to get it right for their sake and for the sake of future generations who will need to call on this program for assistance. It is for this reason that I cannot support the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I do want to commend the member for her commitment to helping workers cope with job losses and the difficult task of balancing workplace and family demands, a commitment which I share and which the government shares. I particularly share her concern about balancing work and family and particularly about the return of women to the workplace. Those are two areas in which I personally would be glad to work with her to maximize the benefits of this program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge her and other members to work with the government as it seeks to pursue a balanced and thoughtful approach to fine tuning the EI program so it can continue to help Canadian workers for generations to come. It is only by getting the full range of ideas and insights, such as some of those the member has put forward this evening, that we can make this important program even better than it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that I cannot support the bill.</p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1070265"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070304"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Van Loan (York—Simcoe, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, when we talk about unemployment and the employment insurance program, it is important to  remember that the most important priority has to be the creation of jobs so that people do not have to claim employment insurance and that  they do not have to stay on employment insurance for a long time. I am not sure that the bill in front of us addresses that; in fact, I believe it may have the opposite effect of hurting it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real problem in the employment insurance system for basically over a decade has been an overtaxation of the workers who are paying employment insurance premiums and an overtaxation of the employers who pay matching contributions, in fact a larger proportion of it. Over the past decade that has produced a surplus of some $46 billion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is $46 billion more that has been taken in by the system than has been paid out.  It is far in excess of anything that would be possibly required to sustain a system.  What it constitutes is a theft under the guise of employment insurance of tax dollars in order to help the government with its general revenue issues.  That is where the money has been diverted.  It is a theft from the workers and employers under the guise of employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst part about it is for the people for whom the impact is greatest, the people from whom it takes the most. It is unlike  income tax which is quite progressive, and unlike the  goods and services tax which is related to spending and has a progressive element.  This is the most regressive.  In fact, after a person's  income tops a certain level, the person  stops paying employment insurance premiums.  The overtaxation and the surplus hits most of all the people who earn the least. That is the real problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to stop adding to the $46 billion surplus. We have to return that money to the people who paid it.  If we look at that money, $46 billion in 10 years has been taken from employers and employees. That  money  could have been used to create more jobs. That  money,  had it been in businesses, might have kept many of them from going bankrupt.  In the hands of individuals, that $46 billion could have been used to pay mortgages, to buy skates for their kids and to live better lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the premiums have been too high for the past decade, far in excess of what was necessary to pay the system.  We need to change it to solve that.  I am not sure this bill does it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact there was an announcement recently by the minister about a drop in the rate.  Employees have been paying $1.98 on $100 of earnings.  That is going to drop  to $1.95.  Under those numbers, based on the performance we have seen in the past, the employment insurance system shall again generate a significant surplus.  That is demonstrated based on the performance year after year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making that decision, obviously the government has decided to continue this process of overtaxation of workers and employers.  Through that overtaxation it will continue to generate a surplus and turn it over to general revenues.  It will continue that process which is a very regressive and unfair taxation that hurts workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one other alternative if that is not the case.  The numbers show clearly in black and white, and we do not have to be sophisticated accountants to understand, that     it would have taken $1.88 or $1.82 in premiums, depending on to whom we listen, to be balanced in the past year.  Therefore, $1.95  is going to be too much and will continue to produce a surplus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the only other option?  It is that the government is expecting a massive economic downturn, that it is expecting job losses to grow significantly. If that is the policy position of the government, if that is the pronouncement, and I believe that is the projection of the minister in making that declaration, I think that is something that is very grim. I  hope the people of Canada will take note of the pessimistic view held by the government toward the future job environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real answer and the real priority is to stop the theft of those dollars from the system, to make employment insurance work as a real fund so it does not generate excessive surpluses that are turned over to general revenues.  The bill, however, does not represent a solution to that problem.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what we expect would happen with this bill would be a huge increase in the cost of the employment insurance program and as a result, a huge increase in the required premiums. That would mean huge tax increases for ordinary workers and employers who are trying to create jobs.  In the end, all that happens when we put taxes on job creation, and that is what employment insurance premiums are to some extent, and when we increase them, it becomes more punitive.  We would be limiting the job creation that occurs and taking money out of the pockets of workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant problems.  Let us take one example only from this particular proposal. That is the proposal to increase the maximum insurable earnings to $41,500 a year.  If we did that, the net impact under the current rate of employment insurance  would be  more money would be taken out of the pockets of employers and employees than would actually be returned to workers through the benefits that result from the increased allowable annual earnings.</p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the proposal from the Bloc would result in a grab of taxes from workers that would then produce a surplus that would be turned over to general revenues. That does not solve the problem. It makes the problem that we have right now even worse. It effectively is an increase in taxation on workers again. Why that is being proposed in this legislation I do not understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, when one looks at the problems in the system, the  private member's bill does not address in any balanced way the nature of the problem.  All it speaks to is one side of the equation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, employers have been very hard done by under the current operation of the employment insurance system. A principle has been established for some time that 58% of the premiums was paid for by employers and 42% by employees, a 1.4:1 ratio, whatever the rate is set at every year. The principle was that employers had some greater measure of control over whether an employee kept or lost a job. That was the justification for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that principle was established, the employment insurance system has been changed dramatically.  No longer is it simply straightforward insurance for those who lose their jobs, but there is  a significant  social component that has been added.  Compassionate care leave has been added, and extended maternity leave has been added, all funded through employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal case, there is very little that an employer has to do with an employee's decision on whether or not to have a child.  Effectively, that justification for the higher burden on the employers has altered significantly over time as the program has been expanded. Fairness would dictate that the burden should also be shifted to a more even balance, perhaps fifty-fifty sharing. That principle is not established here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have a problem with overpayments.  Many people who work multiple jobs or who go from one job to another and change jobs within a  year pay into employment insurance in one job and then in another and the employee  ends up having an overpayment.  When it comes time for those people to file their tax returns, because they have paid too much into the system, more than their insurable earnings allowed, they  get a rebate for an overpayment into the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions and millions of dollars are returned every year to employees, but the employers who made the matching contributions do not have the benefit of that return.  They do not get the same compensation.  That is unfair and it is an imbalance.  We do not see any element to address  that in this legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the bill before us is one which  is unfair to workers and to the taxpayers who are funding the system, the employees who are trying to make better lives for themselves.  It is a system that results in huge increases to them without, in many cases, any perceptible benefit.  It is going to kill job creation. It is going to have a drag on the economy. It is not a positive result. For that reason, I find it difficult to support the bill before us.</p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I am flattered because there are a number of similarities with the bill I introduced before the election. In computer lingo, this virtually called cut and paste. It could be said that the NDP and the Bloc Québécois have much in common  when it comes to the needs of workers in regions providing seasonal employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Liberals also agree with us that changes are needed. There have been past examples of this. I remember our colleague in the House of Commons, Georges Farrah, from Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. I think he lost the election just over employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the hardships that people can experience in certain regions. We just need to consider the hon. member for  Beauséjour, who is in favour of the EI reform. His experience representing people in the region of Cap-Pelé and Bouctouche, people working in the fish plants, has made him understand the importance of EI to seasonal workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I met with the people of Cap-Pelé. The mayor asked if anyone was coming to recruit people working in fish plants to take them to Moncton. He said that he was happy for Moncton. He congratulated the city of Moncton on its unemployment rate, which is 5% or 5.6%. But if everyone from his region goes to work in Moncton, it means that the Cap-Pelé  region might as well shut down. As the mayor of Cap-Pelé, he is not happy with the way things are going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to see my colleague from Peterborough shift and say that he cannot support such a bill. He was a member of the committee created after Bill C-2. The recommendations were along the lines of this bill. He has changed since he sat on that committee but, back then, he strongly supported the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember too that the people of the Cape Breton region strongly supported it. When there is an election, people want to be part of the government so they can ensure that changes are made to EI because it needs changing. People are starting  to   realize that there have been a number of elections in which they say they want to sit on the government benches in order to change EI but it does not change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I thought it shameful that the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development had the gall—excuse me for saying so—to lower the employment insurance premiums. I thought this was a bit rude of him, especially since the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development is currently considering changes to employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development is listening to the Conservatives. That is why I say there is no difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals. The only thing the Conservatives ever ask for is   lower employment insurance contributions, because they think the employers are being over taxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many times I have said, here in the House of Commons, that no employer has ever called me to say that he was going to lose his business  because he could not afford to pay the employment insurance premiums and that he needed them lowered. I hope my phone starts ringing tomorrow morning. I have not received those types of calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have seen people demonstrating in the street to say that the employment insurance system does not cover seasonal employment adequately. That is what I have heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to the Forestville area before the election, I was talking to people in the streets, including Forestville's young priest and the former priest, who is now retired. I remember what the priest told me. He said it was not a political story, but a human story. The cuts made to employment insurance by the Liberals in 1996 had a direct impact on families and children. That is where they are hitting.</p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 1.4 million children going hungry in Canada and it is the Liberals' fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign, I remember hearing varying opinions from the Conservatives. In 2000, the Conservative leader said, in the West, “We must not change employment insurance. We must make some cuts in it”. In the east, he said, “We are going to change employment insurance for you.” He did not know that the  <i>Globe and Mail </i> is sold all over Canada and that people read both messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shameful thing is that the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development listened to him and is reducing EI benefits to such a point that there will not be any money left in the EI fund to pay for what people need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a little comical, but as I have often said, you do not catch lobsters on St. Catherine Street in Montreal. The lobsters are in our waters, in Chaleur Bay and off Cape Breton. The lobsters are in the Bay of Fundy. People in Peterborough love our lobsters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have seasonal jobs in regions like ours, in the Gaspé and Chaleur Bay, where everything freezes up in the winter. In fact, you cannot catch lobster in the winter. And besides that, we have to work within the quotas set for us by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Cap Pelé—and not just them, because this happens all over Canada—have found it necessary to cheat  the system to accumulate hours, to do what some call “banking” their hours.  They are breaking the law. In Cap Pelé, where the member of Parliament is a Liberal, 1,500 people were caught banking hours. The government told them, “We will not do anything to you. We will make the employer pay $5 million.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in my riding, 11 people were also banking hours. They had to repay the government $10,000 and $11,000. It is shameful that in a national program the government treats people represented by a Liberal member on way and the people represented by a member from another political party another—in a democracy like ours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest theft the government has committed in Canada: it has stolen $46 billion from the pockets of the workers and employers who have paid premiums into the employment insurance fund, and they took it to balance the budget and get to that zero deficit. It was all done on the backs of the workers who have lost their jobs and the children who have nothing to eat. It is shameful. That is what the Liberal federal government has done. Today it boasts that it has lowered premiums every year, and it does that to please the Conservatives. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the people back home to know that the Conservatives are opposed to changing employment insurance.  They think that slashing EI will send people back to work.  I regret to say that my dear friends do not know their Canada.  They do not know that some Canadians are in seasonal jobs and need employment insurance to get by.  Punishing them and their families is not the way to help them get by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the member for Trois-Rivières on making recommendations, which I support 150%.  I am not likely to ever need EI, but I see the hardships the Liberals have caused in my area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doug Young lost his job here in Parliament, it was because he thrust the people of my area into abject poverty.  I have women calling my riding office and talking of taking their own lives, because there is nothing left in the house.  I have fathers calling and talking of suicide, because they are not able to support their families.  The Liberal government is responsible for their desperate situation, with the help of the Conservatives. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that I have said all this before.  That is because the problem is still the same. There are Liberals who agree with me on this.  I hope that this time they will be capable, in a minority government position, to do something about it.  The same goes for the member for Beauséjour who has finally said—and it made the papers—that he hoped that, with a minority government, Parliament would be able to bring about the changes required to restore to workers what they are entitled to, and what has been taken from them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communities would be delighted to hear that.  Workers are not the only ones hit by this.  The Liberals are punishing the communities too.  We are not all in Toronto, where there are jobs for the taking.  In our area the situation is different, our  workers are lured away to take employment elsewhere. Our regions are emptied.  It is a kind of legal deportation. That is what is happening. The government is sticking it to the people in need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this our Canada? Sometimes, we have to ask ourselves that question. We are not all as lucky as Alberta. If we had oil wells at home and if we no longer needed to fish, things would be different. I can assure the House that people back home are hard workers. When they move to Alberta, they are the first ones to get jobs, because they are hard workers. Contrary to what Doug Young once said in Hamilton, they are not lazy. That was written in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>.  </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope that hon. members will support this bill, that Liberals who are still not convinced will soon be and will do the right thing. It is not up to the Liberals to take that money and use it to reduce the debt and achieve a zero deficit. That money is there to help the needy, the families, the 800,000 people who do not qualify for employment insurance benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have had the opportunity to tell hon. members what I think and what seasonal workers in our region think.</p><A NAME="Int-1070320"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070324"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070304"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. France Bonsant (Compton—Stanstead, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for his colourful speech, which was a great motivation to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Bill C-278, before us today, is to make a number of efficient and necessary amendments to the Employment Insurance Act.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. members know, employment insurance is a reality for thousands of people on the labour market in Quebec. With any luck, you will never have to  collect benefits in your life. But that is not true for all workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill, introduced by my hon. colleague from Trois-Rivières, is geared toward those workers who currently need or will need employment insurance. These workers contribute to the plan and, as such, should be able to use it when necessary. This bill   contributes to that, by making it easier to    have access to employment insurance for those who really need it. I will explain in a moment why this bill  is good for all workers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this bill reduces the minimum qualifying period to 360 hours of work, regardless of the regional rate of unemployment. At present, the qualifying period for employment insurance benefits  varies between 420 and 910 hours of work, depending on the place of residence and whether the claimant is a new entrant or re-entrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking that this period be reduced to 360 hours, regardless of where the claimant lives. This rules, unanimously approved by the central labour bodies in Quebec, would provide more appropriate coverage for workers in seasonal businesses, and also for all workers in unstable jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the benefit period is determined based on the regional rate of unemployment. To qualify for employment insurance, a worker must have worked 420 hours in regions with an unemployment rate over 13%, and 700 hours in regions where the unemployment rate is 6% or less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand that such measures may not be appropriate for seasonal workers in a region where the unemployment rate is low. They are also not appropriate for workers in   marginal areas. The same is true for workers in cities where the rate of employment is different from the regional rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that, while this bill sets the eligibility threshold at 360 hours, regardless of where the workers live, the benefit period will continue to vary from region to region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the benefit period, the cut-off point is now set at 45 weeks.  In 2000, a study by Human Resources Development Canada showed that 35% of EI recipients use up their entire benefit period.  Many of them were victims of the infamous seasonal gap.  In other words, for a period of several weeks, sometimes up to 10 weeks, unemployed people had no income.  This gap would be compensated for by the proposal in this bill to raise the benefit period from 45 weeks to 50.  Adding those five weeks would, depending on the number of hours worked and the regional unemployment rate, entitle a contributor to receive between 30 and 50 weeks of benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change contained in this bill is the increase in the weekly contribution rate, from its present 55% to 60% of insurable income. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the minimum wage is $7.45.  So a person working a 35-hour week has a net weekly income of $260.75.  This entitles an unemployed worker to an EI cheque of $287 every two weeks, before taxes, or $574 a month. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about what it would cost to rent a small apartment in many cities in Quebec, what we call a “four-and-a-half” —oh, but I forget that  EI recipients also have to eat and clothe themselves.  Where will they get the money for that, if most of their cheque goes to keep a roof over their head?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that in Quebec low wage earners are the ones who make use of EI most often.  They are earning the minimum wage, as I have already mentioned.   In 2002, 66.6% of the 192,000 workers earning minimum wage in Quebec were women, and women also made up two-thirds of low wage earners.</p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of lowering premiums in a ridiculous way—such as the government's announcement this week that it would save every worker 3¢ a week—the Liberal government should instead look closely at what is in this bill. Increasing the rate of weekly EI benefits from 55% to 60% is a practical measure that would make it possible to give better support to people who really need it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go back now to the minimum qualifying period in hours making workers eligible for employment insurance benefits. This time, I would like to point out the ridiculous distinction between people who enter the labour force and those who re-enter it. Fortunately, the bill before us proposes to put an end to this distinction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a person who enters the work force, or comes back after two years of absence from the work force, must accumulate 910 hours of work to be eligible for EI benefits. For other workers, as I mentioned earlier, the number of hours ranges from 420 to 700. The primary victims of  this discrimination are, once again, women and younger workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to women, the distinction can be clearly seen when they leave the labour market to start a family. If they prefer to look after their own children, the EI system penalizes them when they return to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for young people, we are aware that first jobs are often  seasonal, short-term or part-time. But when that job is over, if the young worker does not have 910 hours, there is no income. This discrimination toward those who enter or re-enter the labour force must be eliminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address another point. This bill will—at last—require the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to pay out, as workforce support measures, at least 0.8% of the insurable earnings—as estimated by the Commission—of all insured persons. In concrete terms, that  amount  would be used to help the unemployed upgrade their skills, learn new ones, or become self-employed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the hon. members from all parties will support this bill and, finally, improve the employment insurance system for the people who are  its real stakeholders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think that the notion of “asymmetrical federalism”, which lately has been  used a great deal by federalists, seems instead a kind of asymmetrical interference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous examples, in fact, where the federal government interferes in areas of jurisdiction belonging to Quebec and the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially true with regard to health. The increase in federal transfer payments for health constitutes a victory of the first federal-provincial first ministers conference this fall, but it has been darkened by the resounding failure of the conference on equalization. This increase is accompanied by federal government oversight and control over these matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By establishing action plans, common, well-defined objectives, performance indicators or even so-called national standards, the federal government ensures that it can continue to invade areas of provincial responsibility. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to health, look at municipal affairs or even day care. In terms of intergovernmental affairs, the main strategy of this government is to offer Quebec and the provinces money while it simultaneously imposes its own conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrogance it is known for, this government has even created a federal department of regional development, whose investments will be used to duplicate programs already administered by Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional development is not a federal responsibility, since the Constitution confers upon Quebec and the provinces responsibility for most issues in this sector: natural resources, education and training, municipal affairs, and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the problem that is slowing down regional development is the same one that faces all the other sectors in which the federal government does its best  to interfere, the fiscal strangulation of Quebec and the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal imbalance, that only our Liberal colleagues refer to as financial pressure, is the key to understanding the intrinsic dynamic of this so-called asymmetrical federalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal imbalance financially weakens Quebec and the provinces and allows the federal government to free up huge budgetary surpluses, which it gladly uses to burst into provincial jurisdictions and to give itself the noble task of solving problems it created in the first place. In passing, it uses its “providential” intervention to dictate the conditions for funding, thereby ensuring it has the visibility it so desperately seeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can recognize this underhanded strategy called nation-building, then we will have a better understanding of why the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is celebrating the virtues of “asymmetrical federalism”, since, in doing so, she is also celebrating the federal government's desire for centralization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, the minister has tried to  explain that asymmetrical federalism was not written into the throne speech because that would have been entirely superfluous, and that this concept is the new way the federal government operates in its relations with Quebec and the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, it is pretty obvious. Even though this  concept enables the government to hide its hopelessly centralizing aims, asymmetrical federalism has been exposed as a formula that, even on the surface, is much too favourable to Quebec for all the Liberal dinosaurs with ideas from the Trudeau era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Speech from the Throne said not one word about this concept that has been introduced as the new method of intergovernmental cooperation. It only took one federal-provincial conference for this ghost ship to crash on the sharp reefs of equalization. Like a mirage that dissolves as we approach it, asymmetrical federalism will fizzle out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government will not be able to boast of practising real asymmetrical federalism until it allows Quebec and the provinces to intervene in its own exclusive jurisdictions.</p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be taking part in the discussion on the question raised by the hon. member for Verchères—Les Patriotes on October 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the exchange with the Minister of Intergovernmental affairs, this hon. member chose to deplore the fact that the Speech from the Throne was silent on the notion of asymmetrical federalism.  He complained that the speech could have stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--that this asymmetry should apply not only to Quebec's jurisdictions, but also and particularly to federal jurisdictions, so as to allow Quebec to pursue its own agenda in the areas of telecommunications and justice, for example, or so that it may speak for itself at international forums.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, the minister responded that the government has been promoting and practising this very type of federalism ever since it came to power.  The Speech from the Throne specifically highlights cooperation among the partners in the federation, namely, the provinces and territories. In fact, this seems so obvious that many of us are left wondering whether he actually read the Speech from the Throne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the throne speech centres on such principles as respect for diversity and a consensus driven approach for reaching national objectives.  This implies an asymmetrical approach that corresponds to a flexible federalism that respects differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the health agreement, which was raised just a few moments ago, Quebec premier Jean Charest stated on September 17, “Today we are marking a very important step in Canada's history.  We have blazed a new trail in Canadian federalism through the recognition of asymmetry by all partners of the federation”. The Prime Minister echoed these very sentiments in his response to the Speech from the Throne on October 6. He said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>When the Government of Canada brings together its 13 territorial and provincial partners, when it agrees with them on a 10 year plan that will mean shorter waiting times and improved access to health professionals, that is a testament to the strength of our federation...We see the importance of national will in the health deal.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the health agreement, with which all of Canada was delighted, but which the leader of the Bloc Québécois described as “the very least”, it will be possible to resolve other questions while fully respecting those differences. That flexibility will help us pursue common objectives for the well-being of all Canadians and this includes Quebeckers.  All will benefit from a consensus driven solution approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Speech from the Throne contains other key commitments of our government: the commitment to early learning and child care.  It states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Government will put the foundations in place with its provincial and territorial partners--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Within this national framework, the provinces and territories will have the flexibility to address their own particular needs and circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more can one ask for in terms of flexibility and asymmetrical federalism?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the hon. member's great interest in the formula, I invite him now to reread the speech delivered in the House by the intergovernmental affairs minister on this very topic on October 7.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1070333"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron: </b>Mr. Speaker, as I believe I have shown, the Liberal government is using asymmetrical federalism as a camouflage for constitutional interference. When you realize this, it becomes easier to understand the scope of the statement, made in October, by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and I quote: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words truly reveal her vision of things. This government wants to avoid talking about the constitution, since every day it is fully engaged in asymmetrical meddling. I ask you, why would it bother to restart constitutional talks? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disturbing to hear a minister of intergovernmental affairs, worse yet, one representing a riding in Quebec, allege that having a constitutional debate is no longer of interest to anyone. This attitude is all the more troubling given that Quebec did not sign the Constitution Act, 1982. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Quebec, asymmetrical federalism can lead only to a constitutional step backward, since it and federal interference are one and the same. The only way to put an end to federal interference for good is for Quebec to become a sovereign nation. </p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Gerry Byrne: </b>Mr. Speaker, there we have it. I have to admit that I find the Bloc Québécois attitude a little curious. It is a sovereignist party but of course it remains active on the federal scene. It sits in the Canadian Parliament, not, it says, to promote its sovereignist ambitions, but to promote Quebec's higher interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can it be so honestly enamoured of asymmetrical federalism when it does not believe in this very system to begin with, which it feels will bring insufficient gains to Quebec?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In election campaigns, it consistently hides its true intentions and presents itself to Quebeckers as an unwavering defender of their cause. What is that primary cause? The answer should be quite simple. After all, the majority of Quebeckers want their governments to work together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that even the Bloc Québécois has embodied in this debate by the hon. member for Verchères--Les Patriotes and he cannot ignore this. The Bloc will not fool anyone by its true intentions. While it claims to defend the notion of asymmetrical federalism, the political logic of the Bloc is just not on the straight and narrow and it is in fact rather disconcerting. This debate provides us with yet another excellent example of that very fact.</p>

There is quite a controversy between the fishermen in New Brunswick and P.E.I. in particular about the herring fishery between the two jurisdictions in the Northumberland Strait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, I asked if the minister would acknowledge that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans failed to correct a very obvious error in the description of a fishing zone off Prince Edward Island. The minister responded to me and he did acknowledge that it was a very hot issue between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. He said it was important that we act in a responsible way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say that the fact is the herring stocks are very healthy,  so healthy that according to the department's science the total allowable catch was increased to 10,000 tonnes. However, I was talking to some very knowledgeable fishermen today, people in the fishing industry in P.E.I., who tell me that there is a problem with the fisheries department  science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the scientists are saying it is the biggest biomass in a long time, there was hardly any spring herring fishery off P.E.I., the mid-season was very weak, the inshore did not catch their allowable catch, and the seiners did not catch their total allowable catch either. It hardly matters that they increased the total allowable catch if the fish are not there and they are not catching them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically what I was told today by this very knowledgeable person in the P.E.I. fishing industry is that the people in the fishing industry do not have confidence in this DFO science that is saying the herring fishery is the best it has been in decades.  They would like DFO to enlist the services of independent science and independent scientists to analyze this and give an independent assessment of the biomass for the herring. This was a concern of theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still do not have their answer as to why the correction was not made in the herring fishing zone off P.E.I. originally, but now the answer from the minister indicates that there is all of this herring there and the fishermen say they are not there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just between us, Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of faith in the opinion of the fishermen because they have turned out to be right every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the very distinguished parliamentary secretary who is going to answer the question why they have not corrected that obvious error they made when they changed the coordinates of the 25-fathom line off P.E.I. It was so obvious. There was one description in English and one description in French. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of having a rectangle off P.E.I. that was a protected area, it was a triangle.  It made absolutely no sense and anybody with any common sense would have known that it was not right. Even the parliamentary secretary would know it was not right if he looked at this, so I wonder if he could explain why it was not corrected, and then could he answer to the fishermen of P.E.I. about their request to have independent scientists rather than just DFO scientists?</p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1070342"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070347"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Robert Thibault (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,    I know this is a great day of jubilation and celebration in the member's riding of  Cumberland--Colchester  because   yesterday three calves were born to a single cow, which rarely  happens.   I read about it in the paper and I know the member will be celebrating that all week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in the House this evening to say a few words in this important debate about the herring fishery in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the question from the member about the proximity of the exclusion line to Prince Edward Island and the perceived damage that this causes the fishery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by saying that while I understand that the P.E.I. inshore fishers are concerned about the potential impact of the seiner fishery, current scientific information indicates that there are no major conservation issues with the seiner fishery and seine gear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the interest  of addressing their concerns, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced last month that a three year scientific fishery will be undertaken on the northeast coast of P.E.I., thereby answering one of the  member's questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fishery will be monitored independently and will allow detailed sampling to determine the size of the catch, by-catch and any bottom encounters with the gear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DFO will use these results to determine if further changes need to be made to the exclusion zone. I am pleased that both the herring seiners and the Prince Edward Island Fishermen's Association have agreed to accept the results of this additional scientific work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would   like to remind everyone that the state of the herring fishery in 1983, to which my hon. colleague referred, was very different from what it is today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, more than 80% of the total allowable catch was landed by the large herring seiners, with 20% being landed by the inshore fishers. In recent years, seiners have been allocated only about 20% of the total allowable catch. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two decades ago there were 65 seiners active in this fishery and now there are only 5 such vessels. That is why the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I strongly believe that it makes sense today to find a solution that works in the current situation, rather than returning to a closure line that existed in the past under very different circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DFO will continue to work with the herring industry to develop a more comprehensive approach to managing the herring fishery, including enhanced reporting, analysis and verification of total removals of herring by all fishing sectors.</p><A NAME="Int-1070347"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070342"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Casey: </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health for telling everybody about the  three calves born to a single cow. I suppose if one is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, one would follow these issues very closely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am pleased to hear that the three year scientific fishery will be done by an independent   organization. If the parliamentary secretary has that information, could he tell us what  independent organization   will be monitoring this fishery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the parliamentary secretary says that he does not want to go back, would he go back to the fisheries regulation or designation that was there before on the 25 fathom line and at least acknowledge that DFO did make a mistake and then did not fix it right, which is  what   caused this rift between P.E.I. and New Brunswick? I am not saying that is the entire issue now, but by not correcting that problem when it happened, it created   hard feelings and raised the level of antagonism between the fishermen of  P.E.I. and New Brunswick to a high level. Could he just address those two issues for me?</p><A NAME="Int-1070349"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1070347"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Robert Thibault: </b>Mr. Speaker, I regret that I do not have the name of the organization or the scientists who will be doing the independent analysis, but I can tell the hon. member that in   similar fisheries, like the Bay of  Fundy fisheries, the data  is collected by the industry and  given to an independent third party that  does the collation, puts it together and gives it to both the Department of Fisheries, as well as the fishers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the line, having known  the discussions that a former minister of fisheries would have had on such issues, I can say  that sometimes we have the same argument from both sides from the same group.    McLeod’s Ledge   had a similar line. It was an antiquated line but it  was put there for another reason. The   minister at the time was asked to remove it and asked to be permitted to fish outside that line. At the same  time they asked that former great  minister of fisheries that he re-add a line that had been removed, for whatever reason, but no longer had any purpose   to be re-established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I should tell the member, which very few people recognize, is that the then minister of fisheries, who is an honourable gentleman and great Canadian, in his discussions with the fishermen and the Governments of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, came to the line as it is now, as it was imposed last year, with the agreement of all and with congratulatory notes being sent by that organization. However  it then created political difficulties  in Prince Edward Island because it was such a contentious issue. The difficulty that these fleets had in catching their herring made it worse and  made the thing more political.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has done a great job, in   working with both organizations, on this independent analysis and a three year test fisheries program that should give the information needed by all to come to a friendly resolution of this matter.</p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1840)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1070350"></A><a HREF="#Int-1070349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): </b>The hon. member for Simcoe—Grey not being present to raise the matter for which adjournment notice had been given, the notice is deemed withdrawn.</p>
