<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HAZARDOUSPRODUCTSACT">HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-220, an 
act to amend the Hazardous Products Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with great hope that I rise today to 
lead off Private Members' Business on Bill C-220, an act to 
amend the Hazardous Products Act.
<P>
	I first introduced this bill in June 1993 and reintroduced it on 
March 7, 1994. The bill is in direct response to a tragic accident 
in my riding which claimed the life of the 6-year old son of 
constituents of mine, Robert and Maria Weese of Wallaceburg. I 
am pleased to say that they will be in the gallery this morning 
with their children, son Craig, daughters Paula and Kelly.
<P>
	On June 15, 1992 their son Mark was killed by a poorly 
designed, poorly maintained portable soccer net. The bill's sole 
intention is to prevent further tragedies, because the incident in 
my riding was only one of many. Bill C-220 would oblige users 
of soccer goals, handball goals and field hockey goals to fix 
them to the ground so that they do not easily tip over, causing 
injury or death.
<P>
	I acknowledge that the bill as specifically written needs 
additional measures to make it more effective. Today in private 
members' hour I believe that by raising awareness of this issue 
and this concern, the rationale and intent of the bill will be 
established and proven.
<P>
	I have met with staff and officials from the office of the hon. 
Minister of Health and I want to thank the minister for her 
guidance and assistance in this matter. We will all work together 
to increase the safety of our children. I look forward to pursuing 
this issue with the minister in the months ahead.
<P>
	As well, I want to take this opportunity to commend Robert 
and Maria Weese for their important and heartfelt efforts. They 
have sent over a thousand letters to soccer associations all 
across Canada and internationally outlining the dangers of 
portable nets. The Weeses have compiled some disturbing 
examples about accidents involving portable equipment.
<P>
	Since 1979 there have been 15 deaths and five serious injuries 
in the U.S., but unfortunately there are no Canadian figures, as 
no one group compiles them, not school boards, not recreation 
associations.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a hodge-podge, a patchwork of information across 
Canada. One of our main goals must be to increase the amount of 
information available to users of portable nets.
<P>
	Bill C-220 is based on recommendations of the coroner's jury 
inquest in October 1992 after a 14-year old boy was killed by a 
portable net. This needless death occurred fully four months 
before Mark Weese's. Why were the recommendations of the 
inquest not followed?
<P>
	I was just informed that there was another regrettable death in 
New Brunswick last month and on October 3 a 12-year old boy 
died in Detroit, Michigan as a result of a portable soccer goal 
falling on his chest. Three years ago there was an incident in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	I would like to read into the record the eight recommendations 
of the Wallaceburg inquest. Before I do I want to suggest that 
these statements are totally logical and apply common sense. 
They should have already been in practice before tragedy called 
attention to this issue.
<P>
	One, portable goals for indoor use should be made of 
lightweight materials and either counterweighted with sandbags 
or anchored with a flexible anchoring system which allows the 
goal to move in a lateral direction but not tip over.
<P>
	Two, portable goals for outdoor use should have an anchoring 
device to allow for stability during the game and which will 
allow the goal to be stored.
<P>
	Three, the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
should amend the Hazardous Products Act to include the 
equipment and to acquire a standards program from the 
Canadian Standards Association in order to ensure that 
manufacturers' products meet minimum safety standards.
<P>
	Four, suppliers should ensure that all of this equipment meets 
CSA standards before shipping to purchaser.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6750"> 6750 </A></B>
<P>
	Five, consumer and corporate affairs should be notified by 
coroners' offices, hospitals and police departments immediately 
of death or catastrophic injuries resulting from accidents 
involving sports equipment, and they in turn should use their 
computer system which can have the capacity to highlight 
incidents and advise the ministry of education, boards of 
education, the ministry of tourism and recreation, 
municipalities, associations, suppliers and distributors.
<P>
	Six, permanent manufacturers' labels should be clearly 
displayed indicating manufacturer, address and year of 
manufacture.
<P>
	Seven, any cautionary advice regarding equipment use and 
handling should be clearly displayed separately and in a 
contrasting colour. It should also appear prominently on all 
product documentation.
<P>
	Eight, qualified independent safety inspections should be 
conducted on an annual basis and following repairs or 
modifications inspection records should be kept on file by the 
user.
<P>
	Those are the eight recommendations from October 1992 and 
yet they are still to be fully implemented. I want to draw 
attention to this fact by bringing this bill to the House for 
discussion.
<P>
	Injury accidents are now the number one killer of children 
nationwide. In the U.S. they take about 7,200 lives a year. 
Another 50,000 children suffer permanent injury. The U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission warned in September 
1992 that movable soccer goals can tip over and kill children 
who climb on them or pull up on the cross bar. In some cases an 
unanchored goal gets blown down by a gust of wind.
<P>
	There was a meeting last week of the safety commission in 
Washington, D.C. It was attended by Canadian representatives 
who are working with our American colleagues to increase the 
level of information available and create policies to revamp 
needless tragedies in the future.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Currently the U.S. safety commission has published a 
handbook for public playground safety. In chapter 5, subsection 
1.1 it notes that secure anchoring is the key factor to stable 
installation. When properly installed, equipment should 
withstand the maximum anticipated forces generated by active 
youth which might cause it to overturn, tip, slide or move in any 
way.
<P>
	The Canadian Standards Association has issued guidelines for 
preventing playground accidents to ensure that equipment is 
safe. The CSA emphasizes that the base of equipment should be 
anchored firmly below the ground.
<P>
	It suggests that parents ask their local municipality or school 
board how often it inspects equipment. The CSA recommends a 
daily visual inspection, a more detailed monthly inspection and 
a comprehensive inspection handling.
<P>
	Distribution of safety information is the key to all of this but it 
must get to everyone. There was a fatal net accident in Toronto 
in 1992. A month later, the net manufacturer, Sports Equipment 
of Toronto Limited, a national supplier of institutional sporting 
goods and gymnasium equipment, issued a notice stating that 
soccers goals, handball goals and field hockey goals be 
anchored securely to the floor or playing field when in use and 
stored in such a manner that they will not fall over when not in 
use.
<P>
	I commend the company for the urgent notice but it was only 
sent to school boards in Ontario. It did not extend its warning to 
municipalities, parks or recreation departments.
<P>
	In the U.S. officials are coming up with a variety of methods 
to increase the safety of nets.
<P>
	According to an article in the Detroit <I>News</I> of April 18, 1993 
the Fairfax county, Virginia public school system has become a 
national leader in implementing the two safeguards that experts 
consider essential: anchors and warning labels.
<P>
	Every portable soccer goal in the district has warning labels, 
black, red and bright yellow. The labels warn that climbing on 
goals or failing to anchor goals can cause serious injury or death. 
The Virginia School Board even purchased a corkscrew type 
anchor about 12 inches long. It is easy to put in and hard to take 
out.
<P>
	The institute for the study of youth at the University of 
Michigan says that no games should be played on fields where 
goals have not been anchored. The institute wants a local bylaw 
passed to make the home team coach responsible for anchoring 
both soccer goals before the start of the scheduled match. If this 
is not complied with, the match is forfeited.
<P>
	It is worthwhile to point out that some manufacturers are 
forming a coalition for safe soccer goals and have begun making 
models that collapse when not in use. I hope that in Canada we 
are going in the same direction.
<P>
	Again, I commend the Weeses for their commitment and 
dedication and their dogged pursuit of safety during what must 
be trying times. They have formed a volunteer group in 
Wallaceburg called PARCS, Parents Assuming Responsibility 
for Children's Safety. As well, the town of Wallaceburg has 
undertaken a comprehensive review of park equipment. I 
applaud it for that but it is not universal. On a recent trip around 
southern Ontario the Weeses found potentially dangerous and 
unsafe equipment in Woodstock, St. Thomas and Goderich.
<P>
	They have written letters to the communities and want the 
posts fixed. This grassroots, local, neighbour to neighbour effort 
is to be encouraged, praised and honoured. We need the power of 
government to lend a helping hand. We must manufacture safer 
nets and then inform all users of the standards for safety. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6751"> 6751 </A></B>
<P>
cannot leave it up to the goodwill and good thoughts but to 
concrete action on the part of regulatory bodies and standards 
associations.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I welcome the comments of my colleagues on this bill, but 
more important is the issue symbolized by Bill C-220. If we can 
prevent one death or tragedy through our discussion this 
morning then it is all to the good.
<P>
	Second, it is the purpose of Private Members' Business to 
allow any member from any party to raise awareness on an issue. 
It is important to our ridings and to the country at large. In the 
short time we have this morning I believe we will succeed on 
both counts.
<P>
	I am honoured to speak on behalf of my constituents regarding 
Bill C-220 because it is due to their initiative that this member 
of Parliament gets the privilege to discuss the bill in the first 
place.
<P>
	On a personal note, two years ago I bought a gym set for our 
grandchildren. The little people are one step ahead of us all the 
time. It was two swings, a sway bar and a slide. The youngest is 
three and the other two are four. They found by swinging in 
unison, they could bring the tripods that held this playstand off 
the ground. I was in a state of shock.
<P>
	We have to watch the little people. I think they are more 
intelligent than we are. They were able to bring the stand two 
feet off the ground on either side as they were swinging. I made 
them stop. I was able to get bars that would latch on to the 
stands, which were 24 inches in depth. I drove them into the 
ground to support the stand.
<P>
	The company that built these stands should have included 
stakes to make them more safe. If 10 or 12-year old children had 
been on that swing they would have flipped it over quite easily. 
These little ones at the ages of three and four were certainly 
working their way up to flipping it over when I made them stop.
<P>
	We are not aware of the dangers unless we are there to see 
what can happen even in our own yards. We should support this 
bill. It lets people know exactly what is happening throughout 
the country. Children at schools and playgrounds are being 
killed when they can easily be saved for very few pennies.
<P>
	Once again, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me the time to 
speak on the bill this morning. I await hearing other speakers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak, on behalf of the Official 
Opposition, to Bill C-220, an Act to amend the Hazardous 
Products Act.
<P>
	It is always useful to read the explanatory note: ``The purpose 
of this bill is to make the <I>Hazardous Products Act</I> applicable to 
soccer goals, handball goals and field hockey goals as 
`restricted products`''.
<P>
	At this stage I would like to commend the hon. member for 
Kent on his perseverance, since the hon. member introduced this 
bill during the previous Parliament and had to go through the 
whole process again when the new Parliament convened. I also 
want to commend him on his sensitivity, in the light of the tragic 
experience in his riding of Robert and Maria Weese, who lost 
their son Mark at the age of six.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Personally, I am very sensitive to such matters because I have 
a son the same age, and I can imagine the intense grief suffered 
by these parents after such a tragic event.
<P>
	The bill would make it compulsory to equip soccer, handball 
and field hockey goals with an anchoring device that would 
prevent the goals from tipping over and falling on children 
playing nearby. I should explain that in most cases, these 
accidents did not happen during games but when children were 
playing with the goals on playgrounds and the goals tipped over, 
or when the goals were tipped over by a gust of wind and fell on a 
child, causing either serious injury or death.
<P>
	Finally, it is also the intent of this bill, in accordance with the 
coroner's recommendation we will look at later on, that nets and 
goals shall be portable and can be put away after games in order 
to prevent this kind of accident.
<P>
	The Mark Weese case is not unique. In fact, it is unfortunate 
there are so few statistics in Canada on the subject, and it seems 
neither hospitals nor schools have any obligation to provide 
information on such cases to any authorities whatsoever. 
Fortunately, this is not the case in the United States, where the 
U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission monitors this kind 
of thing. From 1979 to 1992, according to the Commission, 
many accidents occurred, five causing major injuries, in other 
words, very serious-you can imagine what that means-and 
fifteen causing the deaths of individuals, I cannot really say 
children, ranging in age from three to twenty-two. So that is an 
indication of the importance of this proposal.
<P>
	The bill was directly inspired by the coroner's report that was 
released at the time and to which the hon. member for Kent 
referred earlier. What struck me particularly was 
recommendation No. 2, which reads as follows in English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Portable goals for outdoor use should have an anchoring 
device to allow for stability during the game and which allows 
the goal to be stored away.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6752"> 6752 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We therefore support this amendment to the Hazardous 
Products Act. If the amendment saves only one life, it will have 
served its purpose.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to be able to support my colleague. 
Together with my colleague from the Bloc, I commend him for 
his tenacity in bringing to our attention again something that is 
very important.
<P>
	The Weese family took seriously an accident that happened to 
them and the suffering they went through. They made us all 
aware of a problem to which I personally was not paying very 
much attention. When I read the details of the story I was 
unaware that these goal posts were causing this much trouble, 
that people actually were being killed. I have now become aware 
of the problem. That is the negative part.
<P>
	Here is a family who suffered. A child died and some of us 
were still unaware of the cause. They took it upon themselves to 
write thousands of letters to people to make them aware, to make 
school boards aware, to make parks and recreation departments 
aware so that out of an accident something good came. I want to 
thank this family for that.
<P>
	I want to thank my colleague for drawing this tragedy into the 
public arena and into the highest court of the land, the 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	It is easy for us to blame manufacturers for not putting the 
right signs on equipment and not supplying enough information. 
It is important that they be charged with that responsibility. 
School boards and parks and recreation departments should be 
made aware of this fault so they can anchor the goal posts and 
make them more safe.
<P>
	However, I want to emphasize another aspect of this as well. It 
is the responsibility that we as parents and adults have in our 
respective communities.
<P>
	I was impressed to hear the member say that he and the Weese 
family had travelled around southern Ontario only to discover 
that there are still places where the safety features are not being 
observed. They are exercising a responsibility that goes well 
beyond that of parents by going into the community and 
extending their care to other people's children. It is a highly 
commendable action on their part.
<P>
	In particular, I want to recognize the establishment of the the 
PARCS, Parents Assuming Responsibility for Children's Safety. 
It is through their efforts that the hon. member brings this bill to 
the House to amend the Hazardous Products Act. Through their 
efforts school boards are now aware of a problem that they were 
not aware of before. Through their efforts I have become more 
sensitive to this problem.
<P>
	My two boys are now grown men. They do not have children 
but when they do I want them to be able to feel comfortable that 
their children are safe as far as playground equipment is 
concerned.
<P>
	Also I want us to recognize that regardless of whether the goal 
posts are fixed or movable, or movable ones that are anchored, 
there is still in the heat and activity of play the tendency to forget 
that one could be hurt rather badly on these goal posts. We have a 
responsibility to recognize that our children when they play can 
be in some danger.
<P>
	There is no better way to ensure that our children are safe than 
for us as parents to accept responsibility for our children. In the 
larger community we as adults should recognize that in a way we 
are parents to all children and to accept the responsibility that 
has been demonstrated by the Weeses to make others aware of 
the danger. We need to alert the Minister of Industry to bring 
forward legislation to amend the corporate act so that the 
purpose of the bill can be realized.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing this to the House. I am 
going to support the effort, the spirit and the intent of the bill. I 
hope that all of us will become more aware and accept 
responsibility to make our playgrounds safer both on school 
grounds as well as parks and other recreational facilities.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are no further 
speakers. I do not want to surprise the member for Kent. I want 
all colleagues in the House to understand that under the right of 
reply, if the member for Kent chooses to have a closing remark 
on the business that no one else can speak. In fact, he will close 
the debate at this time.
<P>
	Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank and 
congratulate members opposite who have spoken in support of 
the bill. It means a lot to me and it certainly means a lot to the 
Weese family, who were sitting above us, that people are 
becoming involved in the issue of the safety hazard of these goal 
posts.
<P>
	The hon. member stated he was not aware of it. I was not 
aware of it either until this came about. I related the situation 
with my grandchildren who were trying to upset the swings and 
unfortunately they would have had I not brought an end to it and 
stabilized the equipment.
<P>
	I live on the border of Michigan. In the United States soccer is 
becoming a great sport today. Because of baseball strikes and 
hockey strikes and one thing and another soccer has taken over. 
We have a gentleman in Wallaceburg who started soccer many 
years ago. This gentleman was to be in the Olympics for Italy. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6753"> 6753 </A></B>
<P>
Through his efforts Wallaceburg has some of the best soccer 
teams not only in Kent but in Ontario and Canada.
<P>
	In the United States it has become great. They are involved in 
the safety of these nets. We are so close we can see what they are 
doing across the border from us. We as Canadians should have 
been leading the way but again we will be following our 
American neighbours in more safety.
<P>
	Once again I thank the hon. members who spoke in support of 
this bill. We appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you 
very much for all the work you have done in trying to make 
everyone aware of the safety of field goal netting whether it is 
soccer, field hockey, or any other sport. I certainly commend 
you and wish you the very best.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item the time provided for the consideration of 
private members' business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the House

that time.

the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order, of which I believe you are aware, to draw to your 
attention a matter which has prevented an amendment to Bill 
C-49 from appearing on today's Order Paper as it should have.
<P>
	According to the rules of the House it was required that if an 
amendment to Bill C-49 was to have appeared on today's Order 
Paper, thus giving all members the appropriate advance 
knowledge of the amendment, the amendment was to have been 
delivered to the Journals branch no later than 2 p.m. on October 
7, the last sitting day of the House.
<P>
	On Thursday, October 13, my office was notified that the 
amendment I had submitted on time would not be appearing on 
the Order Paper for today due to the fact that it was not received 
by the Journals branch until Tuesday, October 11.
<P>
	Realizing an error had been made, my office contacted the 
messenger service to seek verification of the time the 
amendment was picked up and delivered to the Journals branch. 
According to the messenger service-and I can table that as 
evidence if you require it, Mr. Speaker-our amendment was 
picked up by messenger at 10.26 a.m. on Friday, October 7, and 
was in fact delivered at 10.55 a.m.
<P>
	I believe I complied as best I could with the conditions set out

<P>
	The hon. member raises a point of order in which he argues 
that he should not be penalized for an envelope leaving his office 
and not being received at the appropriate time at the other end, at 
the Journals branch.
<P>
	The Speaker has verified that the information just given by 
the member for Malpeque is accurate. However it still places the 
Chair in a very delicate and unusual situation. Having verified 
those facts, as related once again by the member for Malpeque, I 
will allow the member for Malpeque to move his motion.
<P>
	I would also take the opportunity to prevail on all hon. 
members to pay particular attention to the notice requirement 
for items to be placed on the notice paper. It is the responsibility 
of each individual member to ensure that items are not only sent 
but are actually received by the Journals branch by the deadline.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	When members find themselves in the precarious situation of 
submitting items very close to the deadline, they may wish 
either to forewarn the Journals branch or table the items with 
table officers in the House.
<P>
	Once again I thank the hon. member for Malpeque for his 
presentation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you will find unanimous 
consent in the House, at report stage of this bill, for me to

<P>
propose an amendment to clause 7 of Bill C-49, an act to amend 
the Department of Agriculture Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there have been some 
discussions between the parties. In light of the fact that there 
was some problem with respect to notice and this bill, we are 
prepared to give consent to the hon. member to move an 
amendment at report stage. I understand there will be two 
amendments before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I say to the member for 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre that unanimous consent has been 
given by the House. While we verify that the amendment is in 
order, I will begin with the amendment from the member for 
Malpeque and get back to his shortly thereafter.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could we get a

for Malpeque?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, I understand. This 
document will be distributed as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have moved this amendment to 
Bill C-49 because I believe there is a need for direct 
accountability by the line department to the House of Commons 
and MPs by legislation. I do not believe that guidelines 
established under another act, in this case the Financial 
Administration Act, are enough. There must be direct 
responsibility from the line department itself.
<P>
	There is involved here the principle of accountability and the 
principle that departments know they are directly, via 
legislation, responsible and accountable to MPs in the Chamber, 
not only in some roundabout way through the minister of a 
department, then to the minister of another department which 
may be Treasury Board, and then to the House. That is not a 
direct line of accountability.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	When questioned by myself before the standing committee on 
agriculture Mr. Loken, special adviser to the assistant deputy 
minister, policy branch, had the following to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The estimates are governed by specific Treasury Board guidelines, not 
legislation, that each department has to adhere to in deciding exactly what goes 
into the main estimates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I have indicated, I believe guidelines are not enough 
because guidelines can be changed easily. There has to be direct 
responsibility from the line department.
<P>
	Another problem with the procedure is that without 
presenting an annual report the focus is on the estimates. 
Estimates are an intent to spend. I have seen it happen this year 
before the standing committee in terms of the estimates, part III. 
The report of the past spending of the department is there, but as 
members we tend to focus on where the future expenditures are 
to be. As a result there has not been enough discussion on the 
actual expenditures as compared to previous estimates.
<P>
	As a former farm leader I have extensively used annual 
reports of departments and of agencies of departments. It is a 
good way for people in the community to find out what is going 
on, to see the structure of the department and basically to 
understand how things work. They were accessible.
<P>
	People in the community relate to annual reports more so than 
estimates. As a result of that experience they ask for and receive 
annual reports and therefore can get into discussions on 
recommended changes in terms of policy surrounding the 
department based on the annual report.
<P>
	There were one or two arguments put to the committee when it 
was dealing with the issue. The recommendation by the 
department to remove annual reports was based on the premise 
that they cost money and were irrelevant. If annual reports are 
irrelevant it is because we in the Chamber do not make them 
relevant. I believe we should make them so.
<P>
	The other point put forward was that the information was 
already contained in the estimates, part III. I agree with that 
point to an extent. The department has argued that if they are in 
part III the department will be saved money by not requiring 
annual reports.
<P>
	My amendment will not cost the department or the treasury of 
Canada any more money. My amendment ensures by legislation 
that the department through the minister is directly responsible 
to the House. The estimates now established in guidelines will 
be tabled before members of the House so that we can assume 
our responsibilities as good members of Parliament and ensure 
the departments we are in charge of administering in a 
roundabout way are accountable and responsible directly 
through us to the people of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6755"> 6755 </A></B>
<P>
	The purpose of my amendment to this clause is to ensure the 
line department is directly responsible to members of the House 
as a result. It should not cost any more money. It can be 
accomplished through the estimates in that way but it includes in 
this way the principle of direct accountability to the House.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> I remember 
clearly, Mr. Speaker, that, in committee, my colleague the hon. 
member for Lotbinière, here, behind me, had indeed suggested 
an amendment to Bill C-49 that went exactly along the lines of 
the one put forth by my hon. colleague from Malpeque. I can tell 
you that, if the government wants to show any degree of 
transparency, it must table an annual report in due course instead 
of hiding behind the pretext that it is going to increase costs by a 
few dollars. Producers are entitled to know where the money 
allocated to the Department of Agriculture is going.
<P>
	As my colleague from Lotbinière indicated at the time, any 
company, however small, has to file an annual report with its 
shareholders. Non-profit organizations are bound by their 
charters to convene all their members and submit an annual 
report. In my municipality, not only does the Caisse populaire 
table an annual report, but it also seeks the widest participation 
possible from its members, organizing a great buffet and even 
drawing a cash door prize that keeps growing and growing to 
promote attendance.
<P>
	I never understood why the Department of Agriculture keeps 
refusing so obstinately to officially table its annual report. This 
way, the entire Canadian agricultural community could see and 
check where the focus of the department is, where exactly the 
major part of its budget is going. Will one region be favoured at 
the expense of another? Will Quebec get-because in Quebec, 
agriculture is very diversified-its fair share in each of the areas 
that have been mentioned?
<P>
	Will farming activities be fairly and equitably represented 
within the budget? Will most of the department's research and 
development funds be spent exclusively on studies on wheat, 
barley or corn with hardly any going to the dairy industry or 
maple syrup?
<P>
	For all these reasons, I think that the department should listen, 
that the government should listen carefully to my hon. colleague 
from Malpeque and adopt this amendment to Bill C-49. I am 
convinced that studying this annual report will enable farm 
organization officials to identify future trends and could prove a 
most interesting forecasting tool for their members.
<P>
	Therefore, my hon. colleague, who chairs the agriculture joint 
committee with me, can count on the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois on his amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to give my full support to the amendment 
put forward by the hon. member for Malpeque. When I first saw 
Bill C-49, that clause was certainly one of my big concerns.
<P>
	Since we Reformers have come to Ottawa, we have talked a 
lot about accountability. Any move away from accountability 
would in my opinion be a mistake.
<P>
	If you look at the costs of annual reports, certainly there is 
some increased cost. However any time you have the 
opportunity to hold any department, minister or any government 
for that matter accountable, as members of the House we should 
take that opportunity. We have discussed this among ourselves 
at the committee level. It is an amendment that we are pleased to 
support at this time.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments on the amendment of the member for 
Malpeque.
<P>
	First, to be very clear, I do not feel that the amendment is 
necessary. We certainly accept and understand the concerns of 
the member. I understand the concerns of members opposite. 
There is no question that in part III of the main estimates all of 
this is done.
<P>
	The Financial Administration Act requires that Parliament 
authorize all payments out of the consolidated revenue fund. If 
Parliament is not satisfied with the information that is provided 
to support the spending estimates of departments, it can refuse 
to appropriate funds on request. This gives Parliament effective 
control over public spending and information used to justify that 
spending.
<P>
	As we know the standing committee has a major impact on the 
information provided in part III of the main estimates which for 
all departments has replaced annual reports.
<P>
	We must remember that the soonest annual reports come out 
after the completion of a fiscal year is eight to ten months. The 
legislation requires them and it is eight to ten months after the 
fact. By that time the estimates are also in progress. The 
estimates include everything that has always been in an annual 
report. I think the challenge for the committees, whether it be 
agriculture or other standing committees, is to do a better job 
and better understand the main estimates when they are 
discussed. After reading part III of the main estimates, we have 
a chance to talk about what has happened, what the estimates are 
for this year and what is the direction for years to come.
<P>
	The member for Frontenac said that organizations in the 
province of Quebec have an annual report. I do not question that 
they have an annual report. However, I  question whether they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6756"> 6756 </A></B>
<P>
have main estimates and the progression of a document like that 
available to us here.
<P>
	The question is whether it is necessary to retain a reference to 
the reporting requirement and when it would not be feasible. It 
would not be feasible to legislate under an annual report. If what 
is in an annual report is legislated, every time somebody wanted 
to change the types of things that were in an annual report there 
would have to be changes in legislation. That is certainly not 
feasible and not in the interests of time when we already have all 
of this available.
<P>
	I think we have an opportunity here to do an even better job 
than has been done in the past. We can do it and save money and 
avoid duplication.
<P>
	I recommend that we leave the bill as it is and suggest that the 
amendment of my hon. colleague is not necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a few comments on the difference of opinion 
between the parliamentary secretary and the hon. member for 
Malpeque. In this case I clearly support the hon. member for 
Malpeque. He is looking for more accountability from the 
government. I do not believe that anybody in the House should 
be opposed to that.
<P>
	In terms of what the parliamentary secretary said with regard 
to part III of the estimates providing all the information that is 
necessary to make the government accountable, I disagree fully 
with that. I challenge any member on the other side of the House 
to sit with me and answer my questions about part III of the 
estimates, especially when it comes to connecting part III of the 
estimates with part II. There is a big gap there. You cannot make 
the connection with the information that is given.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I challenge any of those members to answer the questions I 
put to them with regard to connecting part II and part III of the 
estimates. I believe that the parliamentary secretary and the 
party opposite should allow this amendment to go ahead. It will 
improve accountability. The argument of the parliamentary 
secretary that these reports are not available for eight to ten 
months, or have not been in the past, does not carry any weight 
with me.
<P>
	If they have not been done quickly enough in the past let us 
change the rules. Let us make the report available at the same 
time as the estimates, very quickly. I would hope the report 
would be much more complete than reports have been in the 
past. I would hope it would include enough information to make 
that connection between part II and part III of the estimates so 
that we in the House and people across the country can truly 
understand how the department is spending the money. Now it is 
certainly unclear no matter how much study you do in this area.
<P>
	I strongly support the hon. member for Malpeque in his 
amendment. I hope the government will not refuse the 
accountability we need in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to give my opinion on the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, in view of the amendment proposed by the hon. 
member for Malpeque.
<P>
	Just a moment ago, it was pointed out that organizations, too, 
prepare estimates, and that they also must give an annual 
accounting. I would point out that the vast machinery of 
government includes committees, such as the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, and that it is very important that this 
committee submit a report to members of Parliament once a year 
so that farm producers can see where the money has been spent.
<P>
	I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary is afraid of 
transparency. I say give us all the facts so that we may examine 
them and understand them. I agree that an annual report should 
be tabled here in Parliament, because this is where decisions 
originate, and as Members of Parliament we have the right to an 
annual report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is fair that the hon. member for Malpeque is 
putting this amendment before the House. He has sought to draw 
attention to a very significant problem that he perceives in the 
legislation.
<P>
	I want to say at the outset that the notion of accountability to 
Parliament is one that is central to everyone's thinking in this 
House and rightly so. It is a very important concept and a very 
important principle that ought to be upheld on all occasions.
<P>
	I want to draw on the following experience if the member 
opposite will not take it in an insulting way. I do not intend it 
that way. Since my election in 1988 there has been a change in 
the reporting requirements for various departments to 
Parliament.
<P>
	These changes were implemented by the last government. As 
the hon. member knows, I opposed most of its policies. In the 
case of the changes with respect to the annual reports I was 
supportive. The reason was because in my view they were a 
waste of the taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	Parliament was receiving in part III of the estimates not just 
spending plans but detailed reports on the way the department 
was spending the money that it had to account for during the past 
year.
<P>
	I cannot speak for the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food because I do not pretend to have read part III of the 
estimates for the department of agriculture. Most of the depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6757"> 6757 </A></B>
<P>
ments deliberately beefed up or improved their part IIIs. The 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food tells me that agriculture led the way. Great. I am 
unfamiliar with those  particular estimates. Most of them and 
the ones that I dealt with beefed up their part IIIs to make them 
better so there was full accounting given in part III of the 
estimates. Therefore the necessity for an annual report simply 
disappeared.
<P>
	Annual reports, interesting as they may be and impressive as 
they may look with lots of glossy pictures of the minister 
handing out money or congratulating some group, as many of 
them used to do, had their place but frankly they were expensive. 
It cost a great deal to produce and to print them. The previous 
government eliminated them by order in council for those 
departments that did not have a statutory requirement to produce 
an annual report to Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	In the case of the agriculture department, the requirement was 
in the statute. We are seeking in the amendments today, not the 
amendment moved by the hon. member but in the amendments 
to the act, to delete the requirement that the department provide 
an annual report to Parliament. Most other departments have 
eliminated that requirement. All we are doing is bringing 
agriculture in line with the other departments by this bill.
<P>
	Given that, it is reasonable to propose to Parliament that we 
are providing the information in part III so why reprint it in a 
different format and pay people to redraft it and reprint at public 
expense for no good reason. The information is in part III. 
Parliament gets the information when the estimates are tabled 
annually and we have to approve those estimates in committee 
and in the House.
<P>
	Therefore members get an opportunity to review the draft. 
They can see the part IIIs. There is a draft supply bill where they 
can move amendments and so on. I know hon. members may 
argue that perhaps our control over supply is not what it could 
be, but that is a separate argument for another day. The fact is the 
material is being provided to Parliament in the part IIIs. If there 
are specific inadequacies in those part IIIs the information can 
be elicited in committee. The agriculture committee has the 
power to call witnesses before it from the department at will, 
including the minister, and demand additional information.
<P>
	The intent of the amendment to uphold the integrity of the 
House and its primacy in terms of reporting requirements for 
departments is a good one. Frankly however I think it is 
unnecessary for the reasons given by the parliamentary 
secretary in his very able argument and because of what I 
believe to have been the experience members who have been 
here a little longer have had. That is we have not lost the 
accountability process or diminished it in any way by relying on 
part IIIs instead of on annual reports.
<P>
	I invite members to consider that as we come to a vote on this 
matter. I would ask when the question is put that it be negatived 
on division. I believe you will find there is agreement that that 
be so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I, too, would like to support the hon. member's motion calling 
for the annual report on agriculture to be submitted to 
Parliament. I think that this practice is totally appropriate and 
should be maintained.
<P>
	Of course, part III of the Estimates on agriculture may contain 
data which is repeated in the annual report, but the information 
in the annual report is more detailed and more accessible to the 
people concerned by agricultural issues. It is an additional tool 
available to those who wish to know more about economic 
agricultural issues.
<P>
	So I think it is quite appropriate to continue publishing the 
annual report, especially for this department with rather 
significant expenditures. This desire to stop issuing the annual 
report on agriculture reminds me of how reluctant this Liberal 
government is to show openness. An example of this can be 
found in the Department of Public Works where it is very 
difficult to access information. Of course, the minister will tell 
us that the information exists, that it is published somewhere, 
but it is very difficult to access it.
<P>
	I also fear that this desire to stop publishing the Department of 
Agriculture's annual report is somewhat consistent with this 
government's lack of openness. I think that all the actions taken 
by the government to make information more accessible to the 
general public and the stakeholders must not be seen as a waste 
of money.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that the government should continue 
publishing its annual report on the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the debate with some 
interest, particularly the hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader's rather lengthy argument against the 
need for more accountability in this House.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	He mentioned there were a number of new members in the 
House and perhaps their lack of experience was the reason they 
might support more accountability. I assure you that for those of 
us who are new to the House, we have found the review of the 
estimates to be a very frustrating process. Of course, very little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6758"> 6758 </A></B>
<P>
occurs out of the review of the estimates. Anyway, if changes do 
occur in committee it is all reverted when it comes back to the 
House and the government has its way.
<P>
	Another concern is that while the estimates are being 
reviewed by committee that issue is not open for debate in the 
Chamber itself. However, a report could actually be tabled much 
earlier and could give us more time to prepare for the estimates. 
If a report is tabled it certainly is open for debate and may hold 
the government more accountable for the actions of that 
department.
<P>
	I hope that in light of the communication members of the 
Liberal Party sent to Canadians through their red book that they 
wanted to open this place up, make it more accountable and 
rebuild the trust with Canadians that they will support any 
measure which will make us the elected representatives of the 
people more accountable to them. I support the amendment 
moved by the hon. member for Malpeque.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to speak in support of this amendment.
<P>
	The amendment by the hon. member for Malpeque speaks to 
something Canadians find increasingly frustrating in dealing 
with governments. It is this idea of a lack of accountability or 
the lack of the proper procedure. All members have a huge 
volume of estimate literature in their offices which, except 
perhaps for the people who wrote the documents, is hard to 
understand.
<P>
	The motion is straightforward. It is a very sound idea which 
has a good deal of common sense. It just asks that a report be 
filed from the department to address the very concerns people 
have about the estimates and the fact that they are so difficult to 
understand.
<P>
	At the Reform Party convention this past weekend we passed 
a motion that we would like the government also to follow up on 
this whole idea of a standardized accounting practice as 
recommended by the Auditor General. That would make this 
whole effort more understandable in its entirety. As a first step, 
this amendment is plausible, very realistic. It should receive 
support from all sides of the House.

<P>
	We will now proceed to the amendment by the member for 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre. The amendment has been ruled in 
order. I would ask the member to read his amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to place an amendment before the House 
regarding Bill C-49, an act to amend the Department of 
Agriculture Act and to amend or repeal certain other acts. I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 6 be amended by striking out line 17 on page 2 and substituting 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``any inspection powers, duties or functions''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment is necessary for a very simple but important 
reason. The bill must clearly indicate in layman's terms what the 
inspection powers of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
really are. Clause 6 now reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister may designate any person as an inspector for the purpose of 
providing the inspection services that the minister considers necessary for the 
enforcement of any act in respect of which the minister has any powers, duties 
or functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The problem I have with this particular wording is that there is 
a potential conflict between the intent and the interpretation of 
the clause. As it stands it could be interpreted to give the 
minister the power to appoint inspectors for the enforcement of 
any act for which he is responsible. The wording is not precise or 
exacting enough to limit the appointment of inspectors by the 
minister to those acts which already have inspection clauses in 
them. I know this is the intent of the clause and this has been 
explained to us by the minister's officials.
<P>
	However, the open ended and loose wording gives rise to 
another possible interpretation which follows. I believe there 
are some 35 acts under the minister's jurisdiction right now. 
Some have asked me if this clause gives the power to the 
minister to appoint inspectors at his whim and fancy for all of 
those acts. If so it is hard to visualize any support for this clause. 
We do not need or want the minister to have such powers. We 
already have officials in our society who are responsible to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6759"> 6759 </A></B>
<P>
enforce regulations, laws, standards and to provide inspection 
services.
<P>
	Therefore the intent and the interpretation of the clause could 
and should be harmonized, in my view, for the satisfaction of 
both legal minds and lay people. I suggest that my amendment 
would accomplish this.
<P>
	All I am asking is that we put the word inspection into the 
clause one more time. My amendment to clause 6 has been 
carefully stated in the House. This amended wording makes 
sense because it clarifies what the intent of the clause is and 
eliminates any possibility, in my mind at least, of potential 
expansion of the minister's powers to appoint inspectors to any 
act under his jurisdiction. Such appointments would be 
needless, redundant and dangerous.
<P>
	I therefore ask the House for its support of this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments on the hon. member's amendment to 
clause 6 of Bill C-49.
<P>
	The minister already has the power to designate inspectors 
under other legislation the minister administers. This change, 
taken in conjunction with clause 18 in Bill C-49, merely allows 
the minister to designate inspectors under the Food and Drugs 
Act. The Minister of Health can also appoint inspectors as well 
as the Minister of Industry with whom the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food shares the responsibility for the 
administration of the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	The authority to inspect comes from individual acts, not from 
the minister. That is what we need to point out here. The 
amendment gets very restrictive and does not state what it is 
possible to do under the act. The minister can appoint an 
inspector. The minister cannot be as specific and restrictive as 
this amendment states. The authority to inspect comes in the 
individual acts that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
administers, such as the Food and Drugs Act, the Meat 
Inspection Act, the Canadian Agriculture Products Act. The 
inspection powers that are given to the minister must be done in 
general terms in order to ensure that it applies to the inspection 
provisions of such acts as the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I must remind the members that if it is made this restrictive it 
can be costly, it can be absolutely too restrictive. An inspector's 
duties are outlined in other acts and we must remember that 
inspectors have many more duties than inspect because they 
might have to make recommendations and determinations on 
what further action goes on from there.
<P>
	We must be very careful that we do not tie the activities of 
inspectors or the activities of the minister. The bill allows the 
minister appointments through other acts which give the 
inspectors their jurisdictions and their activities from there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clause 6 of Bill C-49 has only six lines. If you allow me, I shall 
read them:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The minister may designate any person as an inspector for the purpose of 
providing the inspection services that the minister considers necessary for the 
enforcement of any act in respect of which the minister has any powers, duties or 
functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What my Reform Party colleague is asking the Joint 
Committee on Agriculture and, in fact, what he is suggesting is 
pretty much the same, except that instead of any powers, duties 
or functions, it specifies inspection powers, duties or functions. 
The Bloc Quebecois cannot oppose that because it specifies the 
role of inspectors and their powers and duties, as well as the 
amount of leeway they will have in the performance of their 
duties. In closing, the only thing I would wish is to avoid 
duplication, like sending two inspectors to check more or less 
the same thing, as we can see now in the Department of 
Agriculture or other similar departments.
<P>
	So I can assure my colleague in the Reform Party that for the 
good of agriculture, the Bloc Quebecois will support the Reform 
Party's amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in support of the amendment 
to the bill by my hon. colleague, the member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre. It only makes common sense that we clarify 
what is the role of the inspectors in relation to their being 
appointed and given a task by the minister of agriculture. That 
only makes sense.
<P>
	My argument was reinforced by the hon. parliamentary 
secretary for the minister of agriculture who indicated that in 
other pieces of legislation, other acts, these powers are already 
specified.
<P>
	Why should they not be specified in this act as well? It only 
makes sense. It is logical. It harmonizes with existing 
legislation that is already in place. The disconcerting part of it is 
that if we pass such a broadly worded clause in this act it may 
apply to future acts in which the minister has no business 
appointing any inspectors to deal and meddle around in the 
affairs of producers.
<P>
	I am really concerned about the open endedness of this act. I 
am also concerned that the department of agriculture is already 
rather large, perhaps one bureaucrat to every three to five 
producers who are out there working. It looks to me like perhaps 
this is a make work project for more inspectors where they are 
perhaps not needed, crossing from one act to another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6760"> 6760 </A></B>
<P>
	It only makes sense. I would appeal to the government to 
respect the wisdom that comes from this side of the House and 
let us not make a fuss, let us simply adopt a good common sense 
amendment to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a very brief comment in support of my colleague's 
amendment to this piece of legislation and I would really like to 
express a concern that I have with regard to the government's 
resistance to accountability and its resistance to clarification in 
this act.
<P>
	I am really upset that it is not willing to accept better 
accountability and in the case of this amendment clarification 
which is clearly justified and which the parliamentary secretary 
has said is there in other acts. I hope this amendment will be 
accepted by those on both sides of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank you as well as the hon. member. I have to say that I 
appreciate it when things are clear and precise, and I think that 
the amendment tabled by the Reform Party will help us have a 
better idea of what is involved and, consequently, help us review 
and manage more efficiently. Therefore, I think this is a very 
good amendment and I will support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again it is a pleasure to rise on debate and for a change it seems 
we have a real debate in the House. We have reasoned proposals, 
in this case from both sides of the House. We get to debate back 
and forth with a give and take that I had hoped would be more 
common in the House of Commons. It has been a good exercise 
and I hope the government is listening attentively.
<P>
	We should realize the intent of this amendment is to clarify 
and to specify the powers that the minister would have. It is not 
an effort to take away or make the minister ineffective. It is only 
an effort to clarify the powers that he would have.
<P>
	I would like to point out the necessity of this. We think back 
even just a few weeks ago of a case where a producer had his 
records seized. Someone came right into his home, seized his 
records and used what in essence was another department or 
another agency as an excuse to enter someone's home, 
confiscate their records on the chance there might be something 
in there and really indirectly get at a producer who is trying to 
get some work done, get some sales done.
<P>
	Whenever we have inspection services or other intrusive 
government policies, some of which we all admit are necessary, 
they need to be very specific because if they are not they can be 
used in a roundabout way to affect producers in a negative 
fashion.
<P>
	I would hope that the government and the members on the 
government side would realize that this amendment is not an 
effort to take away all the powers of the minister. It is merely an 
effort to specify those powers so that producers, people within 
the department of agriculture covered by these 35 acts that were 
spoken of earlier will all know what those powers are. I would 
support this motion. I think it is an excellent one and I have 
enjoyed the debate. I hope the government side has been 
listening closely.

	The House resumed from September 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of 
Industry and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; of the amendment; and 
of the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When Bill C-46 was last

Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine had 10 minutes remaining 
in the questions and comments period.

	Should anyone wish to direct comments or ask questions to 
the hon. parliamentary secretary, he is in the House. If not we 
will resume debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
discuss the amendment to the amendment tabled by the hon. 
member for Edmonton Northwest and say that I oppose it. This 
new amendment nullifies the amendment proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois member for Trois-Rivières to oppose second reading 
of this bill in order to emphasize the provinces' exclusive 
jurisdiction regarding regional development.
<P>
	As we have said many times, duplication and overlapping 
within the federal administration as well as between the two 
levels of government result in useless and costly spending for 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers. We seriously doubt that this 
bill will reduce this waste since the main principles underlying 
this legislation aim at maintaining the status quo between the 
respective mandates of the various departments, while 
regrouping them.
<P>
	If we go through the exercise of creating a new department, 
then why not ensure unity and harmony among the various 
measures taken by this new department, so as to make them 
more efficient and cost effective. We are under the impression 
that this exercise is only done for cosmetic reasons and that 
there is no will to make true changes.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberal government 
bragged about implementing a single-window concept to 
improve its services and to reduce waste in the public service. 
The government had a unique opportunity to restructure its 
various departments, make savings in the  process, and keep the 
largest possible number of civil servants to provide a better 
service to its clientele. Now, this government will have to 
demonstrate that such a structure does indeed result in savings.
<P>
	For example, in this context, an information centre for 
businesses has been set up in Montreal. This centre will of 
course improve customer services, but was there not already a 
provincial structure which could have agreed to give the 
business community in Quebec relevant information without 
any duplication? We are once again creating a parallel structure 
and we doubt whether this will generate any savings within the 
federal government machinery.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	If we want to rationalize government expenditures, we must 
review our structures within the context of all existing tools 
provided for by the provinces and target only areas of federal 
jurisdiction. In my opinion, the Auditor General of Canada 
would be the very person to make suggestions since, year after 
year, he has been highlighting changes that could be made in 
some of the departments in order that public funds be spent more 
efficiently.
<P>
	I believe we are entitled to require that any further 
restructuring of the federal machinery proposed by the Liberal 
government here in this House results in savings for Canadians 
and Quebecers.
<P>
	As Bill C-46 also extends the powers of the Minister to 
regional development areas, I would like to take this 
opportunity to touch on a point of crucial importance in my 
view. As Bloc Quebecois critic for regional development, 
Western Quebec, I object to Bill C-46 as it reads now because it 
contains no provision that would put an end to duplication and 
overlapping in regional development and allow Quebec and 
Ontario to take full and exclusive responsibility for their own 
regional economic development.
<P>
	First, why is Ontario and Quebec development not governed 
by a specific bill such as the one on the Department of Western 
Economic Diversification or the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency?
<P>
	If the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec 
were to be established pursuant to specific legislation, it would 
be easier to see the powers, duties and functions of the minister 
in charge and the related objectives.
<P>
	Regional development agencies were a way for the federal 
government to compensate for the effects of uneven economic 
growth in various areas of the country, while it looked at 
improving the most competitive sectors or strengthening the 
most efficient, in particular those focused on export markets. In 
many cases the program was solely a band-aid solution for areas 
with non-performing economies. In short, the regional 
development program was designed to limit damage in remote 
areas 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6762"> 6762 </A></B>
<P>
where investment was scarce or to try to generate new growth 
dynamics.
<P>
	Part II of the bill contains nice and sound objectives that the 
minister should achieve, as we can see on page 4:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) promote economic development in areas of Ontario and Quebec where low 
incomes and slow economic growth are prevalent or where opportunities for 
productive employment are inadequate;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) emphasize long-term economic development and sustainable 
employment and income creation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and the development and 
enhancement of entrepreneurial talent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that it would be an achievement if, over the next ten 
years, the Federal Office of Regional Development which, under 
this bill, is to come under the authority of the Minister of 
Industry were to reach and maintain these objectives in our 
regions. The truth is they were never really achieved efficiently 
and the effectiveness of the program has been declining in the 
last few years. For example, regions like mine are short of 
investment money, the main tool to influence the development 
in a given area. It is important to make available enough money 
to provide investors and business people with the necessary 
levers.
<P>
	With reduced budgets-which will be further reduced with 
the new reform-and a decision-making structure that does not 
permit the targetting of priorities defined by the regions, how 
can the FORD(Q) be taken seriously?
<P>
	Second, why is the minister not taking the opportunity to 
include in the bill the will to harmonize his regional 
development programs with those of the provinces? In Quebec, 
policies aimed at shifting decision-making powers to regional 
development councils, which were initiated under the Liberal 
government and pursued by the Quebec Premier, Mr. Parizeau, 
who recently announced the appointment of regional delegates 
whith a mandate to receive the regions' specific requests, are 
examples of how research, and awareness of grassroot concerns 
can lead to greater efficiency and better use of the money still 
available.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	People in the regions know full well that the federal and 
provincial governments have no money to waste. Therefore, the 
desire on the part of the minister to harmonize his programs with 
those of the provinces would be for him a step toward making 
every development dollar count and, eventually, to realize that 
numbers show that the best way would be to transfer these sums 
to the provinces, thus eliminating duplication and overlapping.
<P>
	Depending on where they live, Quebecers have a different 
vision of what regional development should be.
<P>
	Whenever decision-makers and entrepreneurs are able to 
channel their efforts in the same direction, they achieve great 
success. The Beauce area is often given as an example of this. 
This area has benefited from the presence of risk-taking 
entrepreneurs and from a lot of investments. Not all regions 
have access to the same amount of capital to allow developers to 
stimulate the economy. The situation in my riding illustrates 
perfectly how financial needs can vary.
<P>
	The main economic activities in the riding of Abitibi are 
forestry and mining. In the forestry area, while saw-mills, paper 
mills and finished products industries are keeping up with the 
new technology and are able to finance it, reforestation and 
tree-growing companies are having a hard time and would 
deserve to be helped.
<P>
	All these businesses are interconnected and must co-ordinate 
their activities if they are to develop harmoniously. There are 
the big companies which, tomorrow, will need the timber which 
the forestry industry has had to grow and develop at an 
increasingly quicker pace as the industry unfortunately has to 
cope with an extremely meager timber stock. Forest 
management, needless to say, was not always a priority in the 
past.
<P>
	I think this shows that regional development is not easy if 
priorities are not in line with the region's economy.
<P>
	Another example of regional development, which concerns 
my own riding and probably many ridings in Northern Ontario 
and this applies to my previous example as well-is developing 
the mining industry.
<P>
	Mining is, in fact, restricted to certain regions in Quebec and 
Ontario, so that regional development in this sector follows the 
same pattern. It is said, for instance, that mining and forestry are 
specific to the northern regions of Quebec and Ontario. These 
industries give a very good return on investment, but the 
problem is that exploration requires vast amounts of capital.
<P>
	My point is that regional development in my riding could 
focus on the mining industry, for instance, but to be successful, 
there would have to be a consensus among the parties concerned, 
to ensure that sufficient financial resources are available.
<P>
	Finally, to prove my point that action must be focussed and 
that the provinces should be responsible for regional 
development, I would like to read what former Quebec Premier 
Jean Lesage had to say here in Ottawa at the federal-provincial 
conference from July 19 to 22, 1965. That was quite a few years 
ago.
<P>
	Mr. Lesage said that to be effective, regional development 
policies had to meet three conditions: be adapted to the specific 
needs of the regions; be implemented by the government in the 
best position to do so; and reflect the general economic and 
social policy of the government of the province where the 
regions are located. Adapting such policies to Quebec's regional 
needs would seem difficult to achieve at the federal level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6763"> 6763 </A></B>
<P>
	This was 1965, and things may not have changed much since 
then.
<P>
	Mr. Lesage also said that the Government of Quebec was in 
the best position-I may recall this was said by a Liberal 
Premier-to implement a truly effective regional policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon 
(Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. 
member, who once again dismisses the achievements of the 
Government of Canada with respect to regional economic 
development. No amounts were given, no reference made to 
what has been done in his sector.
<P>
	When I hear the mining industry mentioned, I ask myself how 
many millions Noranda, to take an example, has received from 
the federal government in regional development incentives.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Forestry also comes to mind, companies like Tembeck, Stone 
Consolidated, Abitibi Price. We could also mention the famous 
33 per cent investment tax credit given to companies who invest 
in the regions. You invest $10 million and the government of 
Canada gives you a 33 per cent tax break. This is taxpayers' 
money being used to encourage regional economic development 
that the opposition unfortunately refuses to recognize.
<P>
	I can give you an example. I have just come from 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine, where there is a company called Les 
entreprises Léo A. Leblanc in which the Federal Office of 
Regional Development has invested $79,600. This is a grant, not 
a loan. It must be pointed out, however, that thanks to the 
intervention of the Canadian government, a new job-creation 
project has come to fruition, that will see this company's 
activities focus on the export market. Now, the company is even 
taking small vessels from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for 
repair in Îles-de-la-Madeleine. In fact, the company owner told 
me that, because of the investment by the government of Canada 
in this project, he has been able to expand.
<P>
	I could mention all sorts of projects. There is, of course, the 
off-set program for fishermen and factory workers, whereby the 
government of Canada is going to invest close to $5 million in 
new fishing technologies, including aquiculture.
<P>
	There is also the last report, the Eastern Quebec Forestry 
Development Program. Forgive me, I realize that I am not 
supposed to show documents as part of a debate. Nevertheless, 
the government aided forestry workers in 1983 and has 
continued to do so to this day, although the program is currently 
under review. But I dare the opposition to find one of the 6,000 
affected workers to speak out against the federal investment 
program for reforestation and providing support to forestry 
professionals in either construction start or silviculture. I would 
say that the government of Canada has taken its responsibilities.
<P>
	In fact, more and more of these forestry workers are asking 
that the federal government remain involved. Apparently, this 
would be the only program suited to forestry workers. No one 
has come out and said that the government of Canada should 
back out of its responsibilities. The federal government is here. 
We are there for these 6,000 workers.
<P>
	There is also the Federal Business Development Bank. On the 
subject of Quebec institutions, did you know that we have the 
Caisse populaire Desjardins in the Gaspé Peninsula, with a $500 
million reserve made up of the savings of the Gaspé people, but 
very little of this money is actually invested back in the 
community. So, it is thanks to loan guarantees given by the 
government of Canada that financial institutions like this one 
re-invest in the community.
<P>
	I think that, instead of telling stories of overlapping, the hon. 
member should review the matter thoroughly, looking at every 
investment we have made these past few years. Take my word 
for it, Mr. Speaker, we have the federal investments to thank, 
because this government listens to the community and decided 
to invest not only in these particular industries but also in the 
future of the regions.
<P>
	This government's objective-and my reason for 
representing the riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
here, as the only government member east of Trois-Rivières-is 
to maintain a federal presence because this presence is welcome 
and indeed desirable in terms of regional economic 
development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
making a few points I may have omitted, but I would like to 
point out that my remarks apply to the new Bill C-46, through 
which the Department of Industry will take over, so to speak, the 
Federal Office of Regional Development. I said in my little 
speech that I would have liked the bill to contain clauses 
underscoring the advantages of letting each province, Ontario 
and Quebec in particular in this case, choose where and how to 
invest federal government funds.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	It is true that in the past, the work done by the Federal Office 
of Regional Development was highly regarded in various 
regions including mine, but when the hon. member indicates 
that the forestry people were very happy with the federal 
government's role in reforestation efforts, I would like to say 
that my region benefited very little from this project.
<P>
	We hear that, with the upcoming cutbacks, the Federal Office 
will not inject any more money into private industries. The new 
policies do not provide any money for the tourism industry for 
one thing. I wonder how the amounts will be set to help a region 
like mine when it needs money precisely for forestry, while 
forest resources are already scarce. If we do not have enough 
money for tourist facilities-and we are told this is not a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6764"> 6764 </A></B>
<P>
government  priority- how can we help my region-and not the 
Lac-Saint-Jean region where they may not need as much money 
for tourism because they already have good facilities? How can 
we be address specific needs when the government sets 
priorities for us?
<P>
	The federal government's goal is to help the regions but this 
approach, instead of showing good will, simply hampers 
development. I do not know whether I should say something else 
on this subject for the hon. member's benefit, but I think that if 
this bill had let the provinces and especially the regions choose 
how to achieve their own development, I think we would have 
been much more likely to support this bill. However, given the 
bill's current wording, because it does not say anything about 
the need to adapt to specific regional needs, as Mr. Lesage used 
to say, I think that we cannot support it.
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I hear the member from the official opposition 
describe his riding, it sounds very similar to mine in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	In lieu of the previous speaker's comments regarding regional 
programs being run by the provinces and his stated view that that 
was the way to go, can the hon. member please explain why the 
Bloc amendment is specific to Quebec as opposed to being 
applicable to all of the provinces in Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer this 
question as well as I can. Instead of limiting my colleague's 
amendment to Quebec, it could be limited to Quebec and 
Ontario, since in Bill C-46, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development applies only to Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Also in your question, you said that your riding was like mine.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I just want 
to remind you to address your comments and statements to the 
Chair and not directly to each other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I would like to point 
out to the Chair that the hon. member asked me why the Bloc 
Quebecois's amendment was limited to Quebec when it could 
have applied to Ontario as well and even to all the provinces of 
Canada.
<P>
	Why? Because Bill C-46 is applied by the Federal Office of 
Regional Development only in Quebec and Ontario. Also, I 
would like to say to the hon. member, who lives in a region like 
mine, that they may be better served if they have a different 
development agency covered by a different law. The 
development projects in his riding may be better run; in my 
riding, the Federal Office of Regional Development has some 
good initiatives, of course, but through Bill C-46, we want the 
Department of Industry to decentralize and blend its ideas with 
those of the provincial agency, especially for  regional 
initiatives, to make better use of the money invested.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to contribute to second reading debate 
on Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry.
<P>
	The bill will establish in law the new Department of Industry 
that was created in June 1993 by the former administration. 
While always a powerful ministry historically run by a powerful 
minister, this new Department of Industry is an amalgamation of 
the former Department of Industry, Science and Technology 
Canada, the former Department of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs, the telecommunication side of the Department of 
Communications and Investment Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party has two major objections, beginning with 
clause 13(1), part I, of the bill. This clause gives the minister 
full rein over shaping industries to suit special needs of certain 
industrial or commercial establishments, organizations or 
persons who are members of a particular category of persons 
defined by order of the governor in council. I will develop our 
concerns regarding this issue a little later.
<P>
	Our second area of concern surrounds part II of the 
legislation, regional economic development in Ontario and 
Quebec. The bill places responsibility for Quebec and Ontario 
under the Minister of Industry. This should be interesting. 
Would I like to be at the cabinet table listening to deliberations?
<P>
	In any event before I focus more directly on these two major 
concerns with the legislation I would like to put this exercise of 
departmental chair shuffling into an historical framework. I 
think this is a worthwhile exercise in view of this latest attempt 
via Bill C-46 to bring some continuity and focus to the disparate 
nature of this department, in particular its responsibilities, focus 
and scope of activity.
<P>
	The industry responsibilities within the Canadian government 
really date back, for the sake of our examination, to the late C.D. 
Howe and the department of trade and commerce and its main 
operating division of the department of defence production. 
Those were the days of the dollar a year people, the C.D. Howe 
recruitments who kept Canada's materiel infrastructure running 
during World War II. C.D. was a powerful minister who ran a 
clearly powerful department with tentacles of influence, not 
only during World War II but up until the 1960s in many other 
departments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6765"> 6765 </A></B>
<P>
	The department of trade and commerce not only held sway in 
Ottawa but also controlled the regional development side. By 
the 1960s the industrial and commercial dynamics were 
changing in Canada and the beginning of constant change in the 
industry portfolio was taking hold.
<P>
	In the early 1960s the government created the Department of 
Industry. The then deputy minister, Simon Reisman, began 
recruiting advocates for industry from the business community. 
Some of these business people were competent, some were not 
as we hear. Terrible infighting ensued between these new young 
business types in the existing career civil service within the 
department. The department meandered around looking for 
stability, purpose and reason for approximately eight years.
<P>
	In 1968 because of this constant bickering over what the focus 
should be, either an advocate for business or a policy maker, the 
then administration created the Department of Industry, Trade 
and Commerce. The operative word and function in this new 
arrangement was obviously the inclusion of trade in this new 
dynamic. Now we have the career commerce people, the 
business advocates from industry and the traders. This is quite 
an arrangement of personalities, agendas and egos.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	In most of the disagreements that ensued over what the 
department was supposed to do, the industry advocates usually 
won. However, another merger was on the horizon. That was the 
advent of DREE. In the early seventies the department of 
regional economic expansion became a hotbed of politics, 
largesse, monument building and subsequent turf wars.
<P>
	This new department focused on regional development first in 
the Atlantic provinces, soon after in Quebec and slowly through 
Ontario and as far west as Saskatchewan. That is where the 
DREE gravy train stopped. Alberta and B.C. were considered 
too rich to participate in these economic expansion schemes. 
The politicians representing those two provinces had no clout in 
the Commons or at the cabinet table.
<P>
	Two interesting twists within DREE were two programs, 
ARDA and special ARDA. The former ARDA, agricultural and 
rural development agency, dealt with regional development 
opportunities and special ARDA was responsible for native 
economic development opportunities and employment 
initiatives.
<P>
	To many, DREE was more than a series of questionable 
funding projects, from Michelin Corp. in Nova Scotia to 
Bricklin Inc. cars and Mitel switching equipment, all funded by 
DREE. Again turf wars ensued but the money flowed like water 
to the project of the month.
<P>
	After the DREE period we had another merger. This new 
department known as DRIE, the department of regional 
industrial expansion, again had lots of money to throw around 
mostly through a program known as the  industrial research 
development program. At the same time the trade component 
was moved to external affairs to complicate it more. It was a 
time of good old style patronage with a tinge of legitimate 
cutting edge technological development.
<P>
	Some time in the mid to late 1980s, with the science envelope 
evoking worldwide opportunities, the department was renamed 
industry, science and technology. At this time the agriculture, 
fish and food component was transferred to Agriculture Canada.
<P>
	The department was becoming fragmented, faced with 
constant change and constantly eroding capabilities. Forces 
were scattered and the usual turf wars continued. In the wisdom 
of the former administration, another change was made and the 
government created the department of industry. That is why we 
are here today continuing the revolving door instability and 
constant quest for change in the hope of getting it right.
<P>
	We have come full circle and returned to the early paragraphs 
of my address.
<P>
	I would like to focus now on our objections to Bill C-46. Let 
me look first at the always troublesome regional development 
side. Bill C-46 clearly indicates that the minister will look after 
Ontario and Quebec. Currently no one is sure who looks after 
Ontario, but make no mistake about it. The Minister of Finance, 
not industry, looks after Quebec at this time.
<P>
	We have no problem with the Minister of Industry assuming 
responsibility for Quebec and Ontario, but what about the rest of 
Canada? This bill continues the balkanization of the rest of the 
country. The squeaking wheel continues to get the grease. I 
wonder which of the three ministers responsible for regional 
development really holds the grease: the Minister of Human 
Resources Development for the Western Diversification Office, 
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services for 
ACOA, the Allan MacEachen of the 1990s, or the Minister of 
Industry now responsible for Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	What a mess: a department for Ontario and Quebec, a 
department for the west in WDO, and a corporation acting like a 
department at ACOA. It may not be a department for the 
minister of public works at ACOA but I am told that the minister 
of public works will expunge the name Allan MacEachen from 
the lexicon of the east coast largesse dictionary. He is on a roll 
and this mishmash arrangement is sure to cause more regional 
strife.
<P>
	The position of the Reform Party on regional development is 
that it should be eliminated so that all areas of Canada are 
treated equally. We want to get rid of a system where conflicts 
rise between ministers who are supposed to choose in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6766"> 6766 </A></B>
<P>
interests of the country nationally but choose regionally due to 
their regional development responsibilities.
<P>
	The legislation ensures that bias and regionalism continues. 
In part IV of the bill powers are granted under subclause 13(1) to 
the Minister of Industry, which could be construed to mean that 
the minister and the department can engage in central planning 
of the economy, far beyond the more sensible approach of 
letting industry choose the equilibrium and letting experts run 
their own affairs. State run involvement, as subclause 13(1) 
seems to indicate, is anathema to good business management 
and we oppose it.
<P>
	The Reform Party values initiatives and enterprise. We do not 
see the government role as being responsible for fostering and 
protecting an environment in which initiative and enterprise can 
be exercised by individuals and groups.
<P>
	In most reorganizations and rationalizations in the private 
sector, which is the real world, business makes these changes to 
downsize, to save money and to improve profit margins. In the 
case of government and Bill C-46 we have amalgamated four 
departments. One could realistically expect staff reductions. 
From a total of 6,000 employees we will see a reduction of 230 
staff members, probably through attrition. What level of public 
servant are we talking about?
<P>
	Another dynamic of rationalization, as I have said, is cost 
saving. Out of a $3 billion budget it is estimated that department 
spending will be reduced by $26 million or less than 1 per cent. 
The bill lacks any coherent vision of industrial strategy. It 
fosters regional economic development initiatives against a 
backdrop of vague national strategies.
<P>
	The bill continues the saga of reorganization for the sake of 
reorganization in a constant quest to get it right. It confirms that 
the Minister of Industry and the government share a Tory vision 
of industrial strategy. After all, it is a Tory initiative.
<P>
	The bill continues the interventionist role of government, the 
flawed notion that government sets the course and business 
steers it. Free market principles and fairness for all should be the 
hallmark of our industrial strategy.
<P>
	I hear the infighting has already started at the new 
department. It has even spilled over to the Department of 
National Resources, whose employees are looking for 
something to do and are sticking their noses into the new 
department's business. It is business as usual at the C. D. Howe 
building. Too bad C. D. Howe is not around.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not help but notice that 
the Reform Party member could find nothing positive in this 
piece of legislation. He did not comment on the fact that it was a 
major effort in streamlining a department of government.
<P>
	The Reform Party is always talking about making sure we 
eliminate duplication and making sure we eliminate waste. The 
reorganization of the department of industry goes a long way 
toward meeting those objectives.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	There is absolutely no infighting going on. In fact most people 
in the department of industry are very excited about the ongoing 
reorganization. We are especially excited that through the 
department of industry we will be giving the Federal Business 
Development Bank added support over the next while, which is 
something most Reform members support. We have also given 
the tourism section of the department an added boost.
<P>
	The member is not being balanced in his remarks when he 
claims that the reorganization is not meeting any of the 
objectives. However I am sure in time the member will see that 
we are on the right path.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, my view of the bill is obviously 
very different from that of the member who just spoke. This is a 
cosmetic, housekeeping bill, and there is nothing substantial in 
it.
<P>
	I explained the minor savings associated with the bill. The 
only thing I can say about the excitement level in these 
departments is that it is obvious I am talking to different 
personnel than the member opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his earlier 
comments the hon. member spoke about the lack of an industrial 
strategy in the bill. I am curious. Does this mean the member 
believes we should have an industrial strategy for Canada?
<P>
	The hon. member talked about C. D. Howe and the war period 
and about how C. D. Howe kept the industrial structures in 
Canada working. Does he not recognize it was C. D. Howe in 
co-operation with the private sector, that is the state in 
co-operation with the private sector, that created the modern 
Canadian industrial structure which lasted to the 1960s. In fact 
the state played an important part in that period?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I explained in regard to an 
industrial strategy, the lead cannot be taken by government at 
this point because government has proven itself to be 
incompetent in terms of dealing with spending priorities and 
with fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	In terms of relating that point to the C. D. Howe era, we had a 
balanced budget then. Essentially we had a balanced budget up 
to 1972. I know there was a period after World War II when we 
were in a state of tremendous growth and we paid down a lot of 
debt, but those circumstances are completely alien to where we 
are now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6767"> 6767 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is carrying on unsustainable programs, 
institutions and projects at this time, and this is one of them. It is 
probably more discretionary to make radical change to this one 
than to many others which affect transfers to the individuals and 
so on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest once again to the contradictory remarks of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	In the first instance they are telling us that any federal 
government intervention in rural areas, which is where I am 
from, is contradictory to what the Government of Canada should 
be doing in helping rural areas. However I find it curious that 
they are trying to bring in a centralized model where all regions 
of Canada would be treated in the same way. In other words, we 
should say that the little town of Bonaventure and the little town 
of Old-Harry on the Madeleine Islands are the same as Bay 
Street, that they have the same economy as Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	They do not seem to recognize the other side. The opposition 
benches like to pride themselves as representing rural Canada 
and rural interests, but they want to take rural Canadians and put 
them in the same boat as urban Canadians. Many members 
opposite actually represent areas with only one industry: a 
mining town, a pulp and paper town or a government town. 
Whereas in other urban areas of Canada such as Vancouver, 
Toronto and Montreal there are various choices, various 
industries, a concentration of populations, a concentration of 
schools and a concentration of services.
<P>
	We do not have that in the regions. That is why in order to 
encourage regional economic development the Government of 
Canada has to make it easier for corporations and companies, 
which it always likes to defend, to invest more in our areas. It 
should make sure that there is equitable expenditure across 
Canada. It should also recognize that rural areas also have 
taxpayers; they have interests that are important to them. 
Members opposite should go back to their constituents and ask 
them if they think the Government of Canada should remove 
itself from regional economic development. I am sure they are 
not going to last past the next election.
<P>
	I go back to my constituency as a rural Quebecer, a rural 
Canadian, with examples of where the Government of Canada 
intervened. Thanks to that intervention we managed to create 
jobs. We managed to create income. We managed to develop the 
local economy for the benefit of all Canadians and for the 
benefit of regional areas such as those represented by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, indeed I am opposed to 
regional economic programs, as is our party. I live in and 
represent a rural riding. The government does not have the 
resources to keep DFO offices functioning for an important west 
coast resource in very remote areas where we need that 
presence.
<P>
	The government is taking essential services like light stations 
and threatening them. For you to be talking about us not 
supporting rural areas is blatant misrepresentation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know this is the place of 
vigorous debate and we even encourage it. However I remind all 
members to direct their interventions through the Chair and not 
directly to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I would like to make a 
couple of other references to the way these priorities have been 
placed in jeopardy.
<P>
	We have an infrastructure program that has been 
gerrymandered. We have an urban focus. We are building boccie 
courts in Toronto and swimming pools. At the same time some 
of our essential rural services are being defunded. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise in my place today to enter the debate on 
Bill C-46 respecting the establishment of the Department of 
Industry.
<P>
	I notice part of the bill deals with the abolition of Investment 
Canada. I would like to address that point to some extent. 
Investment Canada in the new establishment will be basically a 
directorate within the Department of Industry. Investment 
Canada goes back to the original FIRA or the Foreign 
Investment Review Agency.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately over our history Canadians have taken the fast 
track to economic prosperity. By this I mean we have borrowed 
capital from outside our borders. In fact, we have even allowed 
industry to come into our country and take over various sections 
of our economy. We have done that rather than develop our 
economy in our own sense. In other words, we have developed 
the aspect of letting others do it.
<P>
	The problems which existed with FIRA and go back to the 
1970s are really no different today. I question those who are in 
attendance today. The cars we drive, the televisions we watch 
and the household appliances we use are either purchased 
outside of our borders, manufactured outside of our borders or 
they are made by companies within our borders but which are 
not headquartered here.
<P>
	This higher standard of living we have tried to attract has 
come with a price for all Canadians. There is a greater and 
greater dependency on foreign capital, much like a drug user 
who cannot kick the habit. With respect to our governments, 25 
per cent of the financing of our federal debt is outside of our 
borders and 40 per cent of the financing of provincial 
government debts is outside of our borders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6768"> 6768 </A></B>
<P>
	This has created a dependency relationship. We are beholden 
to the people who own and control this money. We have a 
tendency to service the markets of our creditors. In fact we 
service the market of our major creditor, the United States, with 
raw materials and raw resources.
<P>
	Canada has a trade surplus which is very attractive when one 
looks at it initially. In reality Canada has a trade surplus with 
only one country in the world and a trade deficit with almost all 
other nations. Canada has a trade surplus with the United States 
and trade deficits, especially with southeast Asia for those 
television sets and appliances we use every day.
<P>
	This concept of letting others do it has caused a great 
retardation of our research and development. Why do I say that? 
Well why should we have laboratories in Canada? Why should 
we do research in Canada when there are laboratories south of 
the border in Seattle and North Carolina? In other words, there 
seems to be no real desire in Canada to do genuine research and 
development.
<P>
	I do not have to tell anyone that statistics on the Canadian 
economy indicate our research and development is one of the 
lowest in the world. This has had a tremendous impact on the 
creation of high paying, high skilled jobs in Canada. The partial 
result of some of this is that some of our best brains have had to 
go south in order to utilize their talents. Do we want to continue 
with this kind of process where our smarter people have to 
leave?
<P>
	I do not have to tell you that research and development has a 
tremendous importance on the new economy. The economy is 
changing before our very eyes. The world and global economies 
are changing before our very eyes. Another impact of foreign 
investment and foreign ownership and control in Canada has 
been job training.
<P>
	Canada has one of the poorest records on in house training in 
the world. I question why this should be. Why is this unique to 
Canada? I suspect we can trace it back to that original problem, 
foreign ownership and foreign control. Why train high echelon 
management type jobs when we already have a set up to do that 
south of the border? This has worked against the best interests of 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	The ultimate price of letting others do it has been that 
decisions are not made within our borders, decisions that affect 
our economy on a day to day basis, decisions that affect industry 
and industry formation. It continues to this day. Directions and 
suggestions of local managers are routinely overridden by 
corporate headquarters often located to the south but in other 
countries as well. This stifles innovation in our economy. It 
stifles the ability of people to progress in this society. It does not 
matter whether you are in Quebec or any other part of the 
country, the story is still the same.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	This brings us to where we are today. Today the economy is 
changing. Like the devastation that wrenched Japan in the 
second world war, or the industrial revolution that swept across 
Britain, things have changed. We have wiped the slate clear. A 
new economy is before us. We have changed the way we do 
business.
<P>
	The integrated multinational is no longer the productive 
engine of the economy. Smokestacks in industrial areas in the 
United States and other countries are slowly going dormant. A 
whole section of the northern United States is now referred to as 
the rust belt. These industries are no longer viable. These are 
industries which for whatever reason are not part of the new 
technology. States like New York face outward migration; 
people are actually leaving some of these huge engines of 
production.
<P>
	Now is the chance for Canada to regain its ability to make its 
own decisions. This is an opportunity to actually make a change 
to the new economy without forfeiting our standard of living. In 
other words, we have to start being smarter. We have to start 
doing our own research and development. We are all equals now 
in the world. Canada has an opportune chance to be part of a new 
and evolving economy.
<P>
	The concepts in previous years of why Canada could not be an 
effective industrial power-which, of course, it is to some 
extent, but not nearly as much as it could be-has been that we 
have a huge land mass and a small population base. I do not have 
to tell you that with the technology before us this is no longer 
important. All of Canada can be connected in one room through 
the information highway. In other words, it is possible to service 
our domestic markets and create industries that will be effective 
in competing with others throughout the world. We need to grab 
on to that technology.
<P>
	We need to service our own markets effectively and also 
attack those which exist around the world. To do this we need a 
new partnership with government, business and labour. These 
three sectors must rethink their traditional roles. Government 
must be the one which steers. By that I mean it must be an 
adjudicator of the marketplace. It ensures that competition 
continues. It keeps taxes low and fosters this new competition. It 
gives incentives to new training and job creation. It also must 
assist us in attacking those new and evolving markets, like 
southeast Asia.
<P>
	We need a national education standard. This is also part of the 
federal government's obligation. Business has been too slow in 
this country to adapt to the new technology. Some of our 
business practices are outmoded and parochial.
<P>
	We need to do more business networking. We need to create 
strategic alliances within our business sector so they will go out 
and attack those new markets. They must be unified to spike the 
market share. Labour must end its adversarial attitude toward 
business and government.  It must see itself as a true partner. It 
must realize that new jobs and the creation of new jobs will rely 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6769"> 6769 </A></B>
<P>
on those who do not feel alienated from the process, to those 
who will make a contribution to the process of industrialization. 
In other words, we need a new and genuine partnership of the 
three engines of the economy: government, business and labour.
<P>
	These are the challenges; to seize the opportunities before us 
to control our destiny and to march into the 21st century certain 
of our future.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to the member's speech and particularly in response to 
some of the comments which have been made by the Liberals, I 
wonder if they are aware that this morning their Minister of 
Finance made some public statements about the fact that they 
have a new economic philosophy.
<P>
	Their new economic philosophy seems to relate a little more 
to reality than the things we have been hearing in the House 
since we came here. It somewhat relates to some of the 
comments which have been coming from this corner of the 
House.
<P>
	Perhaps the member might like to comment on the fact that in 
quoting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, the finance minister this morning said that the 
OECD agrees. Let me quote from their recent job study: 
``Subsidies tend to operate in exactly the opposite way from 
what is needed. They slow rather than stimulate adjustments. 
They discourage rather than encourage innovation and they tend 
to become permanent''.
<P>
	Would the member care to comment on this new economic 
direction his finance minister has finally discovered?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not recall discussing 
subsidies in my dissertation. I talked about creating a new 
industrial climate in Canada. I did not talk about subsidizing 
industries that go out and compete in the international 
marketplace. It was just the reverse. I talked about government's 
role to steer, that it had to create an environment in which 
businesses would flourish. I did not talk about subsidies but I 
agree that in some instances subsidies do not work.
<P>
	In some ways, our government is realizing some of those and 
has realized that in the past. That is a new orientation for our 
governmental system. I was not talking about any of these things 
as a matter of fact. I was talking very simply that we must create 
a new independent wave of how we are going to deal with 
business in the future and how we are going to build a new 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it being almost 2 p.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recently the caucus task force on ethanol supported a resolution 
urging the Minister of the Environment to initiate a moratorium 
on the use of MMT as an octane enhancer in Canadian gasolines.
<P>
	MMT was banned in the United States in 1978 due to the 
widely recognized potential for negative health effects. Canada 
has continued to use MMT since it replaced lead as an 
anti-knock agent in 1977.
<P>
	The Association of International Automobile Manufacturers 
of Canada has stated its opposition to the use of MMT on the 
grounds that the chemical degrades the effectiveness of vehicle 
emission control devices.
<P>
	Ethanol represents an ideal alternative octane enhancer which 
is 100 per cent renewable. We strongly urge the minister to take 
swift action on eliminating the use of MMT and replace it with 
renewable, domestically produced fuel additives such as 
ethanol.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has 
finally returned home. October 15, 1994 will remain a historic 
day for Haiti and for us all and a great day for democracy. 
Haitians are finally proud of their country again. During the 
three long years of dictatorship, we shared the despair of the 
Haitian people and of all our fellow citizens of Haitian origin, 
but today, we are tremendously glad to celebrate with them the 
hope that a fresh start brings.
<P>
	In calling for national reconciliation, President Aristide is 
throwing open the door to economic development, social justice 
and lasting peace. Quebecers and Canadians want to continue 
giving their unfailing support to the Haitian people and their 
struggle to restore democracy.

constituents demanding that this government not tax dental 
benefits. Geraldine Auger, Dr. Arthur Filyk, Christina Fuller, 
Ken Gaudin and Brian Mullally are but a few of my constituents 
who have expressed concern  that this government will tax 
health care to gain control of Canada's horrible fiscal problems.
<P>
	I am asking this government not to make such band-aid 
decisions as taxing Canada's working class even more to reduce 
Canada's deficit and debt. We are taxed upon our birth. We are 
taxed upon our death. Now we are threatening with taxes on 
health care in between.
<P>
	Canadians are taxed to the limit. The solution is to cut 
government spending, not to increase taxes. Make real systemic 
changes that will not result in a bigger tax grab on the middle 
class Canadian worker.

Colleen and her partner Wendy Wiebe won their gold medal in 
the world rowing championships, lightweight double skulls

<P>
	I would like to point out that Colleen and Wendy also won a 
gold medal at last year's event in Czechoslovakia and another 
gold medal performance in the Commonwealth regatta in 
London, Ontario just a few weeks ago. One newspaper put it so 
well: ``On top of the world again''.

won their nominations due to their intelligence, vigour and their

	This morning I had the privilege of attending the International 
Development Week 1995 calendar festival award presentation 
hosted by the Canadian Teachers Federation to honour Ms. 
Jenna Bowring, nine years of age and a grade four student at 
Random Island Integrated School, daughter of Cynthia and 
David Bowring of Brittania, Newfoundland.
<P>
	Jenna's art work has been chosen out of 850 submissions from 
across Canada to provide the cover of Canada's International 
Development Week 1995 calendar. This young lady was chosen 
as a winner for her competence, her talent, energy and her

a historic event occurred in the town of Collingwood in my 
riding of Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe on August 27. 
On that day Canada and Ontario received a report which showed 
that the Collingwood harbour area of concern had met its 
restoration goals. That means that Collingwood harbour is on its 
way to becoming the first of 43 Great Lakes areas of concern in 
Canada and the United States to be delisted.
<P>
	Its water, shorelines and wetlands have been restored and 
rehabilitated for the benefit of the people, the fish and the 
wildlife. This represents an important first step toward meeting 
the targets of the Canada-Ontario agreement respecting the 
Great Lakes basin ecosystem.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has made a strong commitment to 
the environment. It also recognizes that the success depends on 
effective working partnerships. Collingwood, through its public

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
outraged after reading an article that appeared in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> written by a victim of violence.
<P>
	While we stand in this House asking the Minister of Justice 
day after day when he plans to get tough with criminals in this 
country, a convicted offender is freely wandering the streets of 
Ottawa just blocks from here stalking the man upon whom he 
launched not one but two unprovoked, vicious attacks.
<P>
	While Bill Glaister still suffers from pain and humiliation and 
fears for his safety, his assailant is free to attack again. Why? 
Because an Ottawa judge thought a stern lecture and five weeks 
in jail was a sufficient sentence for one count of assault, three 
counts of theft, one charge of fleeing a court commitment and 
one charge of misleading a police officer with false identity.
<P>
	This criminal did not even serve his lenient sentence of five 
weeks. Our bleeding heart justice system turned him loose in 
three and a half weeks. That same system has left Mr. Glaister 
living in fear of this man and it will be responsible for the next 
victim who falls prey to this criminal.

Association of Canada, two groups from my riding of Algoma 
were given national awards recognizing their tremendous 
efforts in the economic  development and diversification of our

Tourism Council won an award for its promotional video, 
``Shores to Discover''. It displays the wonders of the

active participation by more than 1,000 Liberal members,

<P>
	Residents of Edmonton East, no one else, chose the Liberal 
candidate and the residents of Edmonton East chose the Liberal 
plan as the best one for them.
<P>
	If the Reform Party is honest it will acknowledge the real 
reason why there are more women Liberal MPs. It is because 
Liberal policies are attractive to women because they respond to 
the reality of Canadian women. They will create more 
opportunities for women to participate fully in the life of our 
country. That is why the residents of Edmonton East chose-

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the discussion paper released this morning by the 
Minister of Finance has proved once again that the Liberals have 
very little to show for all the promises they made. The govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6773"> 6773 </A></B>
<P>
ment is full of good  intentions but has failed to provide any 
solutions that will reduce government spending and create jobs.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Would the 
minister agree that what we need is not a diagnosis but a cure, as 
far as reducing the deficit is concerned? How can he expect to be 
taken seriously when his paper contains no measures to reduce 
the level of federal operating expenditures or eliminate the 
many instances of duplication that exist? What is he waiting for?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the 
Leader of the Opposition should have been here this morning. 
Obviously, those who interpreted what was said this morning 
did not do a good job. We introduced a framework of new 
economic policies in order to increase significantly the 
productivity of our country, which, it must be said, has been 
dropping for quite some time.
<P>
	If we want to create jobs, we can do that only if we are able to 
increase productivity in this country. And as far as action is 
concerned, if the hon. member would look at the last budget, we 
introduced some very important fiscal measures. In fact, it was 
after this budget was brought down that Canada started creating 
jobs. I am proud to say today that last week, it was announced 
that since January, 327,000 jobs were created in this country. 
That is practically a record.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, words, words, words, but never any action or 
decisions from this government!
<P>
	Does this mean that since the Liberal government refuses to 
do anything now about government spending, wasteful 
duplication and tax inequities, it is going to go back to its old 
habit of spending its way out of this mess and depending on the 
impact of economic recovery to reduce the deficit? Is it the same 
old Liberal dogma?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the 
Opposition may think 327,000 jobs are just words, but that is not 
the case for the people who got these jobs as a result of our 
measures and who are no longer listed as unemployed. It is 
important to create jobs, and we have done it since we came to 
power: 327,000.
<P>
	Meanwhile, if you want to know what we have done, I suggest 
you listen to the IMF which said that this year, next year and the 
year after, Canada will have the best levels of growth and job 
creation of any G-7 country. We are proud of what we have 
done.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be a little more matter-of-fact, to make 
the minister less inclined to indulge in political rhetoric. The 
minister knows perfectly well that if we are to raise employment 
levels to what they were in 1990, before the recession, we will 
have to create 800,000 jobs in Canada. When he talks about  
327,000 jobs, he knows perfectly well he is well below that 
level.
<P>
	We read the paper that was released this morning. It includes a 
paragraph that implies that social security reform will stimulate 
job creation.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance expect social security 
reform to produce the spending cuts that will help him create 
jobs, since this reform merely turns the unemployed into 
scapegoats by putting them on the welfare rolls, so that fairness 
and any hope for the future no longer exist?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must correct the 
Leader of the Opposition. When we look at job creation, we have 
now outstripped the level of job creation we had before the 
recession. We did it. Second, when we take a careful look at the 
diagnosis, when we consider what the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is doing, we are in fact implementing 
the OECD's analysis. Is that wrong? Are France, Germany and 
the OECD countries wrong or is the Leader of the Opposition the 
only one who is right? I do not think so, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In a statement made this morning on the state of the economy 
and government finance, the minister discussed at length the 
need to make additional budget cuts in order to meet his 
1996-97 objective regarding the deficit.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance still deny that, in order to 
achieve his objective, he will make additional cuts of $7.5 
billion in social assistance and post-secondary education, on 
top of the $7.4 billion cuts already made in his last budget in the 
UI program and transfers to provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let me quote the 
Leader of the Opposition, who asked this question on June 20: 
Does the Minister of Finance intend to table a supplementary 
budget in the fall to reduce government spending by at least $3 
billion?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I find it very hard to understand why the Leader 
of the Opposition wants us to make cuts, while his finance critic 
refuses to accept the fact that we have to improve government 
finance.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we agree with making cuts, but these must be targeted 
at operating expenditures, inefficiencies and overlapping, not at 
the unemployed and the poor in our society.
<P>
	How can the public trust the minister and his government 
when in just one year, they have failed to protect the 
unemployed and welfare recipients, they have not abolished the 
GST and they are now talking about increasing taxes, in spite of 
all the promises made? What kind of trust does the minister 
think he will instill among Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> None.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
</B><B>Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am not the only 
one who gets excited.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is incredible to watch members of the opposition at work. 
They say we must cut, yet every time we talk about an area they 
say: ``You can't cut that''. They have never made one suggestion 
as to an area where we should cut. They have never brought 
forward anything constructive. They sit there and they make 
huge rhetorical speeches about the future of the world. Never 
once are they prepared to get down to work and make this 
country work. That is the problem with the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the finance minister repeated in graphic terms 
what Reformers have been saying for years. He said we are in 
hock up to our eyeballs and that the debt and the deficit are 
unsustainable.
<P>
	Just this weekend it was reported that the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Solicitor General, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Public Works are 
still reluctant to attack the deficit while the Ministers of 
Finance, Transport and International Trade want to attack the 
deficit more vigorously. The cabinet is divided.

represents the position of the government, that of the Deputy 
Prime Minister and her free-spending friends or the finance 
minister and his deficit reduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is music to my ears 
to hear the leader of the third party stating that reports in the 
media are automatically true. I am glad to see the vote of 
confidence that he and his party have given to the media.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, deficit reduction is intimately related to social reform. 
The hardheads in the cabinet are looking for $7 billion to $10 
billion of savings through social reform.  The softheads in the 
cabinet think the best they can get is $1 billion to $3 billion.
<P>
	Will the finance minister show some leadership right now by 
stating how much money he wants to save through these social 
reform programs?
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one thing for 
certain. The Prime Minister laid down a target of 3 per cent of 
GDP to be achieved by this government and this cabinet in the 
1996-97 fiscal year. We intend to deliver. Every single member

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, top heads got the chance to answer the question.
<P>
	The finance minister also knows that given the current 
economic situation, any suspicion at all of federal tax increases 
will further damage private sector expansion and job creation.
<P>
	Will the finance minister show some leadership today by 
giving an unequivocal guarantee right now that tax increases are 
not the option for solving the deficit problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the 
absolute hypocrisy of the Reform Party that on the one hand tells 
Canadians that it wants to take $15 billion out of the pockets of 
senior citizens as well as health care, education and other 
programs and on the other hand wants to tie the hands of the 
Minister of Finance in advance of a budget that is going to have a 
number of difficult choices.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and this side of the House want a full 
public discussion on all aspects of a federal budget and we want 
the debate to begin.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. Last Friday, in Toronto, 
during the Federal-Provincial Conference of Finance Ministers, 
he proposed a national sales tax of 12 per cent on goods and 
services, to replace the GST that his party had promised to 
abolish. That proposal was rejected by Ontario, Quebec, B.C. 
and Alberta.
<P>
	Given the opposition of several provinces to such a national 
sales tax of 12 per cent, does the Minister of Finance not 
recognize that his proposal is doomed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must say that our 
discussions on Friday in Toronto were quite fruitful. Several 
provinces supported our proposal. I could add that two other 
proposals are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6775"> 6775 </A></B>
<P>
on the table, one from Ontario and one from Manitoba. Quebec 
has been very constructive.
<P>
	Indeed, far from rejecting our proposal offhand, Quebec said 
there were some problems, but that something could perhaps be 
worked out based on our proposal. Everything went very well. It 
might be that the headquarters in Quebec City are more 
constructive than the branch plant here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to remind the Minister of Finance that the position taken by 
the Government of Quebec is the same as the position of the 
Bloc Quebecois in the Finance Committee report.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Finance tell us what other scenario he 
intends to propose to the provinces in order to fulfil his 
commitment to abolish the GST before January 1996?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our commitment 
during the campaign, which was stated in the red book and that 
the hon. member should read again, is very clear. We said that 
the GST would have to be replaced with a taxation system which 
would be fairer for consumers, harmonized with the provinces 
and set up in the shortest possible timeframe. However it is far 
more important to do it well than to do it before a set deadline.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's lilac book today committed the 
government to the previously announced and easily achievable 
deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in two years. However he did 
not provide a time frame for the total elimination of the deficit 
by saying simply: ``Our ultimate goal is the elimination of the 
budget deficit''.
<P>
	This is not enough. The world financial community is 
anxious. Will the minister commit the government to a definite 
time frame for the complete elimination of the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if 
lilac is the right colour; perhaps the opposition critic is looking 
at it through rose coloured glasses. That actually came from the 
Deputy Prime Minister, not bad.
<P>
	The position I took in committee this morning is entirely 
consistent and in fact finds its birthplace within the red book. In 
the red book we said unequivocally that we were going to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and that our ultimate 
goal was to balance the books, to eliminate the deficit. That is 
the position we took in the red book. That is the position I took 
this morning in the purple book.
<P>
	Our goal is to set milestones so that Canadians can judge what 
the government is doing. We are not going to set targets out 
there. We are going to hit our 3 per cent target. Canadians better 
understand that and the Leader of the Opposition better 
understand that as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people of Canada have heard these vague promises 
about some time in the future they will balance the budget, just 
rely on them, for too long.
<P>
	Financial experts agree the deficit cannot be eliminated 
without reform and cuts to the social program. The lilac book 
does not make that point and the financial community is 
anxious, especially if Deputy Prime Minister is answering the 
question.
<P>
	Will the minister stop tiptoeing through the lilacs and promise 
major cuts in social program spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is precisely 
because the previous government kept setting targets too far 
down the way of no great significance and then kept missing 
them that we as a government decided that we would set up very 
clear milestones-that is what Canadians asked us to do in the 
consultations last year-within a relatively short time period so 
that we would keep everybody's focus on that and then we would 
hit our targets.
<P>
	It is very important for the credibility of government that we 
do not set out a multitude of targets but that the government 
focuses on one issue and that it does what it says, and that is 
what we are going to do.

when we rolled out the new tactical helicopter on Friday at 
Mirabel there was a press conference where obviously my 
comments were somewhat misconstrued. We have not changed 
our position.
<P>
	We cancelled the HE-101 not because of the fact that it was 
not a good helicopter but that it was too expensive and too rich 
for our needs. We now have a defence review under way and the 
government is absolutely adamant that there will be no decision 
taken. Cabinet will not be seized of the issue until the defence 
review takes place. The hon. member is a member of that 
defence committee. No decision will take place until we know 
the priorities the defence review will set down.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	In dealing with our helicopter needs, we have a search and

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,

penalized Quebec, can the defence minister promise right now 
that Quebec will benefit from the same level of spin-offs as with 
the previous contract?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

Speaker, last week I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development when we could expect to see legislation. Now we 
read that the minister has reassured Atlantic premiers that 
proposed changes to unemployment insurance would not be 
implemented for five to seven years.
<P>
	Why did the minister not clearly tell Canadians that with his 
no action plan changes would take five to seven years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the hon. 
member is still reasonably new to the House, but he should 
understand that the timetable we have set would be for 
legislation in the spring of 1995 or perhaps in the fall, depending 
on how consultations with the provinces go. We would have new 
legislation in 1995.
<P>
	That would mean, therefore, that any new implementation of 
the unemployment insurance system would take until January 1, 
1996 to take effect. If there was a frequency test, as proposed in 
the green paper, it would take three years for that test to work its 
way through the system. That is what I was referring to.
<P>
	I understand it may not be understood by the hon. member 
because he has not been through how government works before, 
and thank goodness he never will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the minister should have put his proposals in a 
yellow book. If he is talking about targets, everybody knows that 
if he does not have anything to aim at he is not going to miss.
<P>
	Canadians have been waiting for six months for this no action 
plan and now everybody knows what it is full of: limited 
options, no price tags, no time lines, and no hope.
<P>
	Are there any other major surprises coming on social program 
reform, or should Canadians just throw the discussion paper 
away and keep an eye on the newspapers to hear about his plans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

in every part of the country in terms of having a major debate,

<P>
	Canadians are being heard. They are being listened to. They

<P>
	The National Forum on Health will open on Thursday in 
Ottawa. The federal government and the provinces are still 
deadlocked as, according to a spokesperson for the Minister of 
Health, not one of the provinces has accepted her invitation to 
participate in the Forum under the terms set by the government, 
that is to say only in an advisory capacity.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Health not recognize that, without the 
provinces, which where invited by Ottawa only out of courtesy, 
her National Forum on Health will be nothing more than a 
masquerade to justify interfering further in an area of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> As you 
know, Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the health forum on Thursday 
is to advise and help the federal government to examine 
long-term issues regarding the health of all Canadians. This 
being said, I have always worked very well with my provincial 
counterparts and I intend to continue to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
another question for the minister and I hope to get a clear answer 
this time. Does the Minister of Health not realize that, if the 
provinces refuse to participate in her forum, it is because they 
will not be able to participate fully and because they have 
uncovered the true intentions of the federal government, namely 
to cut provincial transfer payments for health care?

workers in my riding who were formerly employed by 
Koehring-Waterous Timberjack are now in desperate need of 
support under the program for older workers adjustment.
<P>
	Since the closing of their plant in the fall of 1992, most of 
these older workers have been unable to find alternate 
employment and many face losing their homes in order to make 
ends meet.
<P>
	Could the minister comment on why we are experiencing 
these frustrating delays on the approval of this 
federal-provincial program and tell us what he could do to 
mitigate the problems?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the 
program for older workers is a joint program, federal and 
provincial. It depends on joint administration and decisions on 
designations.
<P>
	Last March I wrote a letter to all the provinces indicating a 
willingness to sign a new agreement. Unfortunately the province 
of Ontario came back with a counter offer for a new benefit 
arrangement. Therefore it has yet to sign the new program for 
older workers adjustment. We cannot go ahead with 
designations until the Government of Ontario approves.
<P>
	I understand it is soon to go to its cabinet and as soon as it 
approves the new agreement on older workers we can go ahead 
with designations. I urge the hon. member and others to put 
whatever kindly persuasion on the Ontario government they can 
to go ahead with these designations.

<P>
	My supplementary question concerns an article written 
recently by the member for Vancouver Quadra. The hon.

constitutional options to allow or not to allow a referendum

question, to control the actual timing of any vote and to launch 
its own pre-emptive nationwide referendum legally superseding

Although the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
just launched a wide-ranging consultation on the possible 
reform of social programs, a reform which, among other things, 
would emphasize community resources to help unemployed 
youth, he has just ended the subsidy for Carrefour-Jeunesse 
Emploi de l'Outaouais, which has effectively helped young 
unemployed people in that region for ten years.
<P>

decision to end financial assistance for Carrefour-Jeunesse 
Emploi with his discussion paper, which intends to put more 
emphasis on community organizations? How can he reconcile 
the contradiction between deeds and words?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out before, one 
of the basic elements of decentralizing federal programming is 
to allow decision making to take place at the local level and to 
allow that level to set priorities and determine where the best 
allocation would go.
<P>
	If the hon. member would look at this case in point she would 
recognize that the recommendation as to where the funding 
should go for that particular program in that area was made in 
the local community.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For his part, how can the Minister of Intergovernmental

Carrefour-Jeunesse Emploi, when at the same time he paid 
$130,000 to set up an employment centre in Hull, but for 
immigrants this time?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

member that she should look carefully at what investments on 
human resources the federal government is making in the 
Outaouais area. This year alone we are putting about $17 million 
into that region. Of that, $3.5 million directly relates to youth 
employment and training services.
<P>
	By the decision that was made in that area for the particular 
program we will be able to handle several hundred additional 
people through the new centre. That is the reason for the 
reorganization that was recommended in that area.
<P>
	As to trying to make a case that we should spend on one group 
and not the other, the government tries to provide services for a

setting one group against the other which the hon. member is 
obviously trying to do.

employee of the Canadian embassy in Japan, Patricia 
Bader-Johnson, denigrated Hydro-Québec by saying that the

Natives and other Quebecers. Without checking things out, this

that originated in fact from an oil heating company.

such as Hydro-Québec?
<P>

Solicitor General has rambled on with his rhetoric about his task 
force, his studies, his reviews, all those wonderful things he is 
going to do to make this country safe and those hon. members 
laugh. They should laugh in the faces of the victims and see if 
they think it is funny. It is time to take some action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6780"> 6780 </A></B>
<P>
	While the minister rambles, hundreds and hundreds of 
victims have felt the sting of these guys who have been released 
when they ought to have been left in jail. Would the minister be 
willing to show the intestinal fortitude and political will to 
announce a moratorium that no more dangerous violent 
offenders will be released until this is settled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the hon. member's concerns about these 
kinds of situations. I share his concerns but I have to apply the 
law adopted by this Parliament. This Parliament has not given 
me the authority to suspend the law on my own volition. We 
want to move forward on changes in the law. In view of the hon. 
member's rhetoric I look forward to having his support of our 
measures when we bring them forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I for 
one would be more than pleased to support something that would 
save the lives of future victims.
<P>
	Are fellows by the names of Thom, Sparklingeyes, Jerabek, 
Toner or Foulston familiar to the minister? Will the minister be 
responsible for any offences these violent offenders who are 
now being sought by the RCMP-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Perhaps the member could rephrase his 
question.
<P>
	I see that the members in the gallery are speaking again.
<P>
	Would the hon. member like to rephrase his memory, rephrase 
his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, my memory is hopeless.
<P>
	Five dangerous violent offenders are strolling the streets, 
having escaped custody. These people were on parole or day 
passes. They have been named by the RCMP to be highly 
dangerous and are on the most wanted list.
<P>
	Is the Solicitor General prepared to accept responsibility for 
what these five people do within the next few days before they 
are caught?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the police authorities are actively seeking these people 
to bring them back into custody. I hope the hon. member and all 
Canadians will support the police in these efforts.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister of human resources stated in Montreal last week 
that his proposals are part of a larger package the Minister of 
Finance is due to release to the finance committee. Yet today 
with the release of the paper ``The New Framework for 
Economic Policy'' we still  have no specific costing on the 
proposals outlined in the social security review paper.
<P>
	Will the minister come clean with Canadians and say exactly 
how much the Minister of Finance sees cutting from social 
programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning we 
set out a basic framework as to how we feel the Canadian 
economy can deal with what is its single greatest problem which 
is the failure to create jobs in sufficient numbers to substantially 
reduce the unemployment rate.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	We basically said that the focus must be on productivity and 
we set out the key elements of how we would generate that 
productivity. We also stated in there that as far as we are 
concerned-I am now repeating the words of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development-the best social policy is a 
good job.
<P>
	I must say that complementing certainly that framework are 
the tremendous efforts by the minister to basically make it 
possible for Canadians to develop the skills and the talents they 
need to face up to a very different world. It is very clear that the 
government has its act together and Canadians are going to 
benefit from it.

Intergovernmental Affairs. One was on the constitutional 
position of the government on the legality of cessation. The 
other was on the question of whether the Government of Canada 
had the competence to allow or disallow a referendum on 
secession. Neither was hypothetical.

questions may be asked but should not be of a hypothetical 
nature. Members will note at that time the Chair did not 
intervene and did not rule on whether it was a hypothetical 
question.
<P>
	We all accept in this House that ministers have the right to 
answer a question or not to answer a question and take whatever 
form when they do answer a question to do so. In this case, if a 
question is posed it is up to a minister or a member of the 
government to answer as he or she sees fit.

	If I judge a question to be hypothetical, as your Speaker I will 
intervene. I cannot control the response and for the most part I 
cannot control the question.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, I would like to draw to the attention of hon. members 
the activities organized to commemorate World Food Day, 
today, in Canada and around the world.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The World Food Day reminds us that we have not yet found a 
sustainable solution to the problem of hunger in the world. 
Today, the Canadian Association for the World Food Day is 
organizing various activities and, in particular, workshops in all 
provinces and both territories, and the theme this year is: Water, 
source of life.
<P>
	Canada, richly endowed in this regard, has contributed 
through its expertise in agriculture and irrigation to the 
improvement of water supplies for families in rural areas around 
the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On October 16, 1945 the food and agriculture organization of 
the United Nations, the FAO, was founded in Quebec City. I 
think it is only fitting that the House be reminded of the historic 
role of a great Canadian, the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson, 
chairman and one of the principal architects of the founding 
conference of the FAO.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Next year, Canada, Quebec and Quebec City, will be hosting 
events to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the creation 
of the FAO.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the last 50 years we have experienced dramatic increases in 
agricultural production. At the same time the world is faced with 
daunting population growth. If we are to succeed into the next 
millennium our efforts will have to be based on truly sustainable 
agriculture. This will be one of the challenges that ministers of 
agriculture of the 170 member countries of the FAO, their 
officials, industry representatives and non-government 
organizations from Canada and abroad will address when they 
meet in Quebec City next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I have the pleasure of joining 
our voice to that of the hon. member for Beauséjour, the 
Secretary of State for Agriculture and Agri-Food, Fisheries and 
Oceans. Water is the source of life. Everyday, on our blue planet, 
a third of the population goes hungry and every day, four out of 
ten people go thirsty or do not have access to proper drinking 
water.
<P>
	It is said that human beings can go without food for around 40 
days as long they can drink. But without food or water, they die 
within four days. We cannot live without water and if we 
compare the Earth to a grapefruit, a pinhead would represent our 
water supply, 98 per cent of which is made up of salt water, 
which leaves us with only two per cent considered freshwater. 
We are not taking very good care of this two per cent found in 
lakes, rivers, streams, clouds, glaciers, and underground 
springs.
<P>
	No later than yesterday I saw someone putting out a cigarette 
butt by throwing it in a toilet bowl and flushing it out. What a 
shameful waste of water! Here in Quebec and Canada, 
groundwater, the water table, is getting deeper and deeper and is 
often of questionable quality. One must keep in mind that one 
litre of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6782"> 6782 </A></B>
<P>
gasoline, diesel fuel or oil is enough to pollute one million litres 
of groundwater.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I am very happy to see that Quebec City will be host to the 170 
FAO member countries for a convention, next October.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to stress the 
importance of the work carried out by the many organizations 
involved in finding lasting solutions to world hunger. Despite 
our collective wealth, hunger is a problem we know at home in 
Montreal and other major Canadian cities.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the World Food Day Association of 
Canada which, through its numerous activities, helps raise the 
awareness of Canadians and Quebecers regarding world hunger.
<P>
	I would also like to encourage farmers to share their 
experience by participating in joint projects with other 
countries. The Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec has 
set up projects of this kind, showing a sense of solidarity which I 
believe augurs very well.
<P>
	Finally, 18 months or two years ago, I was shocked by a piece 
of news coming out of the home province of the secretary of 
state, which is the potato capital of the country. As he will no 
doubt remember, there was an overabundance of potatoes and to 
keep prices up, both governments had found an ingenious trick. I 
must specify that it was the previous government. Anyway, they 
decided to buy the potatoes and bury them in a dump. I wonder if 
the member recalls this incident. It did not happen on the other 
side of our planet, but in New Brunswick, 18 months or two 
years ago.
<P>
	I cannot forget the photosynthesis formula I was taught in 
grade school; you too will remember that we were told that on 
Earth there are three life-giving elements: water, air and earth. I 
will remind you that without water for three to four days, it is the 
end of this world for us.
<P>
	Therefore, it with pleasure that the Bloc Quebecois joins the 
hon. member for Beauséjour in saluting the World Food Day 
Association of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
October 16 marks the 14th celebration of World Food Day. 
Governments got together and said they were in favour of food. 
This is ridiculous. What do governments have to do with food? 
Farmers produce food, other business people process and 
market food.
<P>
	In Canada every day is food day. In this country for the most 
part at least, with a few notable exceptions, markets operate as 
they should. Prices tell farmers what customers want. Prices tell 
farmers what should be grown. Prices tell stores what to sell and 
customers what to buy.
<P>
	I am not saying things are perfect here in Canada. There is still 
far too much government involvement in our industry, there is 
no doubt about that. Governments have too much say in 
marketing boards. There are too many interprovincial trade 
barriers and too many bureaucratic hoops for farmers to jump 
through in order to make a decent living.
<P>
	Here where people are free food is abundant. Throughout the 
world there is a large discrepancy between what is being 
produced and what is needed. Unfair trade practices, for 
example the export enhancement program in the United States 
and the common agriculture policies in the European Union, 
prevent free markets from operating as they should.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Why are the countries of the former Soviet Union suffering 
from hunger? It is because they are still suffering from the 
effects of a centrally planned economy.
<P>
	When governments stay out of the way, people co-operate to 
produce plenty. When governments get involved things go 
wrong; supply is short, prices are too high and markets are 
skewed. Would you let the post office feed you? World Food Day 
is not a recognition of what governments have done. It 
recognizes what governments have failed to do. Government 
involvement in agriculture should be reduced to a minimum. 
This is essential to the growth of the future of the agriculture 
industry in Canada and indeed around the world.
<P>
	If governments would get out of the way we would be well on 
the way toward minimizing world hunger.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFINDUSTRYACT">DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry and to 
amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment; and of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to support Bill C-46. I want to talk about 
some positive aspects of the government's policy direction 
because economic indicators in Canada are indeed positive.
<P>
	It is not a complete coincidence that the Canadian government 
has introduced new restructuring such as the Department of 
Industry. At the same time, to be frank and forthright, there are 
still unsatisfactory economic conditions which need to be 
addressed. It is my hope that logical steps, including the new 
Industry Canada format, will lead to sustainable economic 
recovery in Canada.
<P>
	The approach of fiscal responsibility with sensible spending 
reductions while maintaining integral support for business and 
industry is a reasonable policy for today's economic climate. 
The reorganization and creation of the new Department of 
Industry is probably most often associated with business 
operations in cities such as high tech and sophisticated science 
based companies. However, I would like to comment on the new 
Industry Canada from a different perspective, that of a rural 
setting. Canada's rural regions also depend on industrial 
development.
<P>
	My riding of Kenora-Rainy River is in northern Ontario 
where most people automatically think of resource industries 
like mining and forestry. While that is true, we do depend on the 
resource sector to provide us with an economic foundation but 
the realities of a new market order dictate that economies across 
Canada diversify.
<P>
	Industry Canada is tailored to accommodate diversity in all 
regions of the country. In northern Ontario diversification has 
been ongoing for many years, out of necessity I might add. 
Changing market conditions and economic downturns in the 
major resource sectors have forced regional economies to 
develop new markets and new strategies.
<P>
	Diversified industrial sectors play a vital role in northern 
Ontario's economy. The focus of tourism has expanded to 
include non-traditional and  non-consumptive vacation 
packages which complement the more common products of 
fishing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6785"> 6785 </A></B>
<P>
and hunting lodges. This new brand of ecotourism is not 
replacing the traditional tourism market but rather diversifying 
a strong sector.
<P>
	In the past our resource sector consisted of pulp and paper 
mills and gold mines only. These mills and mines are still the 
backbone of the northern Ontario economy but now we realize 
there must be a concerted effort to diversify.
<P>
	Companies are now concentrating on secondary industry by 
manufacturing wood and mineral products instead of exporting 
raw materials. The production of wood furniture and mineral 
products such as granite headstones is indicative of a diversified 
economy taking shape in northern Ontario.
<P>
	Secondary manufacturing such as printing products and 
packaging and, yes, leading edge technology in a vast array of 
fields from computers to agriculture and telecommunications is 
the new wave of economics in northern Ontario and rural 
regions across the country. This is why Industry Canada 
profoundly affects rural Canada as well as urban Canada. This is 
why northern Ontario is keenly interested in the structures 
within a new department of Industry Canada.
<P>
	Although I have just cited fairly large resource sectors, there 
is another area important to my riding and the rest of the country 
which Industry Canada must service efficiently to promote 
economic growth and that is a topic that I have raised many 
times in the House, the area of small and medium sized 
businesses.
<P>
	The initiatives and new mandate of Industry Canada are 
essential tools for small business growth. In order to become 
more efficient and gain access to large markets, small business 
across the country must be provided with a network of services 
and information so that skills can be acquired to start new 
innovative operations as well as expanding traditional 
businesses.
<P>
	Federal developments important to the success of the small 
business sector include the Canadian Technology Network, 
Canada Investment Fund, engineers and scientists programs and 
the much talked about information highway.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Networking and sharing of market information are absolutely 
crucial to building competitive companies in the global 
marketplace. Organizations such as economic development 
offices, centres of excellence, and the new local training boards 
must develop networks so that business can access the tools they 
need to remain competitive. Industry Canada is actively 
promoting such a network with its new initiatives.
<P>
	New changes to the Small Businesses Loans Act, the Federal 
Business Development Bank and the formation of a new 
relationship between financial institutions and small business 
are also areas important to business and  industrial progress. I 
took part in a task force hearing in Ontario with my colleagues 
examining a new code of conduct for banks and small business. 
Granted, changes will not take place overnight. It is this type of 
initiative that small business will need to survive in the new 
marketplace.
<P>
	Gaining reasonable access to capital dollars has been a 
distinct problem for small and medium sized businesses 
attempting to expand or establish new ventures. We need these 
companies to create new jobs and fire the economic engine.
<P>
	Industry Canada is one of the federal departments working to 
enhance financial conditions for Canadian companies. Industry 
Canada will also work toward other objectives to strengthen our 
potential for economic growth. Eliminating duplication of 
business services and regulations between federal and 
provincial governments is an important step in making it easier 
for our industrial sectors to flourish.
<P>
	Industry Canada is vigorously pursuing new and practical 
partnerships with different levels of government. Combine this 
action with programs that are developed in co-operation with 
the private sector and we hope to have a new industrial structure 
in Canada that promotes growth and prosperity. I acknowledge 
that the private business community will lead Canada's 
economic recovery, but we in government on this side of the 
House strongly feel there is a constructive role to play for 
departments like the Department of Industry.
<P>
	Specifically I do not blame the industrial sector in northern 
Ontario if it feels the previous government left it out in the cold 
during tough economic times. Unfortunately it was the attitude 
of the federal government to feed struggling companies to the 
dogs. Liberals, I might add, do not think that is the way we 
should go. We do not want to throw good money after bad 
money, but far too often companies needing only a small amount 
of support to get over the hump were ignored and died a very 
quiet death.
<P>
	In the past I have suffered alongside business people in my 
riding who were unable to access appropriate government 
services and funding programs. Business proposals with 
excellent promise were often ignored because of patronage 
attitudes, a lack of vision within the federal government and 
plain old bungling. I hope we can eliminate that in the future.
<P>
	Programs and services being developed by Industry Canada 
are designed to identify struggling companies with a potential 
worth saving. That is the Liberal way of building a strong 
economy.
<P>
	In conclusion, I return to the resource sector in northern 
Ontario and the rest of Canada. Primary resource industries not 
only provide revenues, jobs and valuable exports, but they also 
spark secondary industry. This economic process is vital to my 
riding and all of northern Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6786"> 6786 </A></B>
<P>
	Secondary industries, or clusters as they are known in the 
current terminology of new age economics, spin off from a 
strong resource sector and form all sorts of companies providing 
jobs and stability. It is of the utmost urgency that Industry 
Canada follow through with the promising initiatives created by 
this new federal department. The new and revitalized role of 
Industry Canada truly has the potential to forge a solid economic 
framework in the country. The new mandate of federal 
departments like Industry Canada is to nurture co-operative 
partnerships on which we can build an effective national 
economy.
<P>
	I am confident that regions such as northern Ontario will now 
at least have a fighting chance to take advantage of a healthy 
business environment, due in large part to the development of 
practical effective federal programs.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
constituency happens to be virtually a mirror reflection of the 
hon. member's constituency. I understand the whole business of 
resource base and the business of having to diversify.
<P>
	I was very encouraged this morning when the finance minister 
said: ``Equally we believe that regional economic assistance 
should focus on genuine opportunities that have the potential to 
be self-sustaining. We intend to concentrate, for example, more 
on tourism and on the creation of a positive environment for 
small and medium sized businesses, the multinationals of 
tomorrow. At the individual level, as our social security reform 
proposals make clear, we also believe there is a need to change 
unemployment insurance, building on reforms begun in last 
February's budget''.
<P>
	Using exactly the same context in the very next paragraph that 
follows he said: ``The current system is outdated social policy. 
While it has worked well for a lot of people, for too many others 
the UI system does little or nothing for their self-esteem or 
success. But the current UI system is outdated economic policy 
too. It encourages chronic use and repeat use of the program by 
businesses and individuals. It is a barrier that prevents people 
from adapting to changes that are unavoidable and opportunities 
that are present. Therefore we intend to take measures that will 
bring UI back closer to what the term says, insurance''.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member two questions. First, 
during the course of the last election I am sure the hon. member 
will have run into a Reform candidate somewhere along the line. 
I would rather suspect that Reform candidate said exactly what 
the Minister of Finance said this morning, that unemployment 
insurance should be returned to its original purpose, insurance.
<P>
	I would be curious. What did the hon. member say in those 
particular situations? I would suspect that his constituents might 
be interested to see if what he is saying today, reflecting on what 
the minister who is a  leader in his party is saying, is actually 
parallel to what he was saying during the course of the 
campaign.
<P>
	Was he like other Liberal members attacking Reform Party 
people who were saying unemployment insurance should be 
returned to its original purpose, insurance, or was he agreeing 
with the minister? Is there a consistency in his position?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, yes, I did run into Reform 
candidates in the last election, which I found to be quite 
interesting. The member should know two things. I very much 
followed the platform of the Reform Party, simply because if I 
was going to run against somebody I should know what my 
opposition was saying.
<P>
	Reform Party members did not say that they were just in 
favour of bringing UI back to its original intent of insurance. 
They were saying they wanted the government to get out of UI 
completely, to privatize UI and put it in the hands of the 
employers and the employees or, more important, in the hands of 
the business sector and let it run the whole show.
<P>
	The member has to be a little more frank and open when he 
says that what the minister said today in his paper is identical to 
what the Reform Party said. There is a very significant 
difference between what was said in the paper today and what 
the Reform Party said during the last election campaign.
<P>
	During the campaign I said-and we have said it continually 
in the House and I will say it again-that the UI system as it is 
presently working is ineffective for people in regions like mine 
because it puts them on a treadmill. Because of the problem 
created by the regulations as they now exist, businesses use UI 
as a means of augmenting their business and their existing 
revenues within the company structure.
<P>
	I am a railroader. I have three railway terminals in my riding. 
At the height of the transportation of grains and other 
commodities at a certain time of the year there are hundreds 
more employees working in the railway industry than in winter 
months. As soon as they get enough weeks the railway lays them 
off. The industry is compensated by having individuals who are 
technically sound come back into the business when business 
picks up. Who pays for that?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They get a subsidy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Obviously, it is a subsidy. I have questioned that 
for a number of years and it is only one example. Those are 
things the minister and the government are trying to change so 
that people will be able to improve their lot without being on a 
treadmill.
<P>
	In conclusion, this morning the minister referred to 
diversifying northern Ontario and having regional development 
programs that do two things. They access dollars for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6787"> 6787 </A></B>
<P>
diversification of regions like mine. We continue to say that. We 
still say that and the minister has said that.
<P>
	We have also said that we want to focus on a business 
relationship more than subsidies, wherein we will give loans and 
encourage businesses to succeed by having a fair regional 
development program. That is very consistent with what we all 
have said in the past.
<P>
	By taking the criticisms of the finance minister out of context 
the member is suggesting that somehow we have changed. In 
fact we have not; we are still saying what we said all along.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are now in a period 
when all speakers can speak for 10 minutes and there are no 
questions or answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am not sure if I am hearing a drum roll over there or something 
more serious is happening; it is a bit disconcerting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> A drum roll for your speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Yes, that is what it is.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-46. 
The bill clearly demonstrates the government's vision of how 
business should be carried out in Canada, with a ball and chain 
tied to one leg.
<P>
	As far as business is concerned the bill is taking industry in 
exactly the wrong direction. Business is not crying out for 
regional development grants. In most cases, when such money is 
withdrawn the enterprise that was initially helped by 
government money fails.
<P>
	Business is not crying out for more programs and more 
bureaucrats to administer them. In fact the opposite is the case. 
It should be government's role to provide an environment where 
business can operate freely and do what it does best: creating 
competitive goods, creating services on one hand and 
sustainable employment on the other.
<P>
	Instead Bill C-46 gives the minister wide-ranging powers to 
create an environment in which government is the central tool of 
economic development and where government establishes 
policies and programs for specific groups and industries. Surely 
we must learn from the lesson of the former east bloc countries: 
government intervention does not work.
<P>
	If taxpayers had all the details of how their hard earned money 
was spent in the past in the so-called national interest, they 
would be outside picketing right now. The cabinet should have 
no right to alter significantly any industry or company in favour 
of another. Companies and industries must be able to enter and 
exit the market on the basis of their financial viability. All 
industries and organizations must face a level playing field and 
evenhanded policies that facilitate and improve on trade and 
commerce within Canada.
<P>
	Governments must learn to let industry stand on its own and 
die on its own. In the west we have seen the national energy 
policy and we have seen Petro-Canada. We know the results of 
government interference and excess of ministerial direction.
<P>
	It is time to rein in an overbearing government and let 
Canadian businesses push the country forward. Instead the 
government insists on having its nose in the workings of the 
Canadian economy through micromanagement of industry. It is 
an unacceptable intrusion in all sectors of the economy. The 
government must devise national policies and stay out of 
influencing Canadian industry, organizations, regions and 
provinces in a piecemeal manner.
<P>
	The Hibernias, Novotels and Lloydminster upgraders of the 
country should be things of the past. Unfortunately they 
continue to place a heavy burden on Canadian taxpayers and 
distort allocation of Canadian human and physical resources. 
Successive governments, including this one, have still not 
learned that these projects do not work.
<P>
	The bill gives a blank cheque to the Minister of Industry to 
fund projects at will. Canadians remember the individual 
projects awarded to Shawinigan and Baie Comeau. That was 
done by the past government, but we seem to be following the 
same road here. They remember the millions of dollars 
funnelled into projects of no economic benefit, starting with 
changes to the mandate of the Department of Industry and 
responsible to the minister. Reform believes these kinds of 
projects should be eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	No less out of date is part II of this bill which relates to 
regional economic development. At one time regional economic 
development was perceived as a means of reducing regional 
disparities. Regional economic policy has been in existence for 
a long time and is widely condemned by economists as a means 
of creating economic dependence, not economic development. 
Since its inception regional development policy has been about 
pork barrelling and perpetuating dying industries. In their heart 
of hearts I am sure everyone in this Chamber knows or at least 
suspects this.
<P>
	The government should admit that regional development 
starts and ends in the regions themselves. The purpose of the 
government in the Department of Industry should be to develop 
national policies and facilitate trade and commerce within 
Canada, not to provide goods or services that the private sector 
should and could provide for itself and not to try to manage 
Canadian industry.
<P>
	Let me mention some of the things businesses are asking of 
the government. I take these items directly from the task force 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6788"> 6788 </A></B>
<P>
paper released in September 1994 and prepared for the Business 
Council on National Issues.
<P>
	Industry wants balanced government budgets with low levels 
of public indebtedness. Industry wants competitive levels of 
taxation that encourage savings and investment, things that 
other countries such as China has. Industry wants international 
economic policies that promote aggressive trade development 
and diversification. Industry wants a federation characterized 
by free trade internally and smaller and more efficient 
governments working more closely together.
<P>
	The Department of Industry cannot give businesses balanced 
budgets, competitive taxation levels and internal free trade by 
distributing grants or delivering programs. I cannot help but 
wonder if the government is at odds with itself in the design of 
this bill.
<P>
	Today, in this very Chamber we heard the member for 
Kootenay East refer to the Minister of Finance and his press 
release, explicitly stating and I quote: ``That the private sector is 
the core of the economy and that government's role requires a 
fundamental redesign''. I quote the Minister of Finance as well: 
``If Canada is to become more productive, government must 
become more productive too. We must shift from trying to fix 
every problem ourselves. And if government activities still do 
not serve a significant public purpose they should not be 
continued. I say let us go to it and eliminate grant giving and 
regional development programs altogether''. The Minister of 
Finance has more to say on the subject: ``Restoring the fiscal 
health is essential. If we do not do that job we will fail at 
everything else''. He is absolutely right.
<P>
	Here is an opportunity to create enormous savings. One 
department is being created out of four: the department of 
industry, science and technology; the broadcasting side of the 
department of communications; Investment Canada; and the 
department of consumer and corporate affairs. These changes 
were put in place under the previous short-lived government 
before it became apparent how Canada's fiscal situation really 
was.
<P>
	Could not more have been done to bring fiscal sanity to bear 
here? Out of 6,000 positions within these four departments only 
230 are being eliminated. That is less than 4 per cent. Out of a 
budget of $3 billion only $26 million is being eliminated. That is 
less than 1 per cent. I suggest that the proponents of this bill get 
hold of the press release of the Minister of Finance and study it.
<P>
	The government does require a fundamental redesign, as the 
finance minister puts it. In the area of industry a whole new 
model is required. The federal government's goal in the industry 
department should be to establish and maintain a culture that 
rewards entrepreneurship, innovation and research, and which 
ensures a level, competitive and honest marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Hand in hand with this approach should be government 
policies that encourage free markets, enhance competition and 
treat all individuals and groups equally. Such policies will see 
too that business can trade fairly within Canada and that tax 
rates allow business to be competitive.
<P>
	These are the kinds of changes industry requires for the 21st 
century. I hope the government is listening and will make the 
required changes so Canadian industry can compete and be 
healthy in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity this 
afternoon to discuss Bill C-46, a reorganization of the industry 
department. It is an important piece of legislation. A large 
number of activities which are going to affect the business 
community are being brought together into one department: 
small business support; tourism; economic development; 
telecommunications; trade and commerce; science; and 
consumer affairs.
<P>
	The thrust of the legislation in what it is trying to accomplish 
is very positive. We are trying to make the department more 
efficient. We are going to give the small business sector and the 
business community in general one stop, the Department of 
Industry, in which to interface with government rather than 
having to go through a paper chase every time.
<P>
	It is going to be a more efficient process. We are going to have 
a number of consolidations. The member opposite mentioned 
some of the savings that are beginning. Those will be 
accelerated as time goes on. We are going to have a more 
productive department. We are going to have centralized 
planning and direction for our government's industry policy. 
This consolidated department will give us the opportunity to do 
that.
<P>
	There are three specific areas I would like to talk about: small 
business support; tourism; and regional economic development.
<P>
	Small business support by the Department of Industry is 
absolutely critical to the Canadian economy. It is the fastest 
growing component of our economy. In the first three years of 
this decade during one of the worst recessions we have ever 
experienced, 73,000 new small businesses were created. Eight 
of ten new jobs in the country come from the small business 
sector. It employs 4.2 million Canadians and accounts for 37 per 
cent of the country's employment. This new Department of 
Industry is undertaking a number of important initiatives to help 
this sector grow, to help it expand, to help it employ more 
Canadians.
<P>
	One of the most important initiatives which I have had some 
direct input on and one which my colleague for Kenora-Rainy 
River mentioned was access to capital. It is absolutely essential 
that the small business sector be able to access both debt and 
equity capital if it is going to have an opportunity to expand or 
an opportunity to  establish new businesses. The department has 
already moved in this area. A private sector committee estab-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6789"> 6789 </A></B>
<P>
lished last winter has been studying this issue. It is about to 
make a report with some very specific recommendations on how 
an environment can be created within which small business can 
access capital.
<P>
	The department is working with the chartered banks, with this 
committee and others on a code of conduct. It will establish the 
relationship that will exist between the small business sector 
and the banking community to help ensure there is better access 
to capital.
<P>
	There is an ongoing review of the Federal Business 
Development Bank to make it more effective and more 
responsive to the needs of the small business sector. An all party 
committee of this House, the industry committee, will table 
within a couple of days its report with some very thorough and 
sound recommendations on how this process can be taken even 
further.
<P>
	I had an opportunity earlier this year to chair an access to 
capital task force. It toured the province of Ontario and 
discussed with the small business sector some of the things that 
can be done to help them access capital.
<P>
	Beyond that the department is doing other things. It is helping 
formulate business networks to help individual small businesses 
combine their strengths so they can compete globally. They are 
working on establishing a Canada investment fund to help 
innovative firms access venture capital, to operate not as a 
replacement for capital from the private sector but as a stimulus 
for entry into those markets.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	There should be better access to government programming 
through business service centres. This is an important initiative. 
Small business people do not have the time to go through reams 
and reams of paper trying to access information. They need it to 
be given concisely and in one location. This is an important 
initiative that is being undertaken co-operatively with the 
provinces.
<P>
	There is a private sector committee working under the 
auspices of the industry department looking at the business 
environment, including the regulatory and paper burden that 
small businesses have to operate under today. We have to relieve 
the small business people from spending more time on 
paperwork than doing their jobs and more time on trying to 
adhere to regulations than trying to earn profits and employing 
people.
<P>
	The second area is tourism, a critical industry in Canada and a 
critical industry in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka. 
Representing 10 per cent of the Canadian labour force, 1.2 
million jobs depend on this sector. In Canada 60,000 businesses 
are directly employed in the tourism industry. It generates $12.9 
billion in tax revenue which can be used for the betterment of all 
Canadians. Locally in my riding 52 per cent of all employed 
individuals are directly affected by the tourism industry. For 
each million dollars that we are able to  increase tourism in my 
riding we can create 39 person-years of employment.
<P>
	Industry Canada through Tourism Canada is working hard on 
making that a bigger and better industry in this country. It is 
helping to formulate partnerships with the private sector so that 
we can market ourselves internationally as a country and attract 
more visitors to Canada. They are concentrating on the 
development of new products such as a winter experience 
product including snowmobiling and cross-country skiing, 
areas of vital concern in my riding where people are able to earn 
their livings.
<P>
	This is not going to be the end. It is the beginning. As the 
Minister of Finance said today in his statement, the area of 
tourism is one the government will concentrate on in the months 
ahead. As well, the Prime Minister appointed his special advisor 
to recommend further action. Tourism will be looked at by this 
government. It will be pursued and will become an even more 
important industrial tool in Canada.
<P>
	The last area I would like to touch on very briefly is the area of 
economic development. Something that is often forgotten in all 
of the plans is that in northern Ontario we are a resource based 
economy which has experienced great financial difficulties over 
the years.
<P>
	The economic development agency FEDNOR operates in 
northern Ontario. I agree with the Minister of Finance and 
several other comments in the House that we cannot subsidize a 
losing proposition and expect it is going to have any meaningful 
impact. However, economic development agencies can invest in 
the future winners. It can help lever investment from the private 
sector. In fact FEDNOR has committed $53 million directly but 
by doing so it has been able to lever $186 million in additional 
funds. That is what economic development agencies are all 
about. That is what they do.
<P>
	FEDNOR has participated in 843 projects since its inception 
and it has helped create or maintain over 3,600 jobs. FEDNOR is 
an important initiative for northern Ontario. It is one under the 
auspices of the Minister of Industry and I am pleased to see it 
will continue under the reorganized department.
<P>
	In summary, this bill is committed to creating a department 
which will create an environment in which business can prosper. 
The reorganization of the department will help this happen. It 
will make it more efficient, more effective and more productive. 
I would like to congratulate the minister, his assistants and the 
people of his department on a job well done in formulating this 
piece of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6790"> 6790 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on Bill C-46, the Department of Industry 
Act.
<P>
	Our nation faces many challenges. Canada can no longer rely 
solely on its natural resources. The demands of the future cannot 
be met by supplies of the past. We must develop in ourselves and 
in our industries the skills needed to challenge the conventional 
ways of competing at home and abroad.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	The competition we face abroad requires us to create new 
skills among our workforce and a new vision in our industry. A 
country that solves its own problems and competes successfully 
with others stays strong and independent. We must begin 
competing as a team against our international competitors.
<P>
	This bill will allow the formation of a framework with which 
we can begin to build Canada's industrial strategy.
<P>
	The newly created Department of Industry will work with all 
sectors of the economy to facilitate partnerships between 
government, business, research centres and labour. An 
industrial strategy will enable us to better compete in the global 
marketplace.
<P>
	We must also foster a climate to encourage Canadians to 
develop an entrepreneurial spirit that harnesses their skills and 
creativity. As we know, small and medium sized businesses are 
the engine of our economy and that is why they must be an 
integral part of a national industrial strategy.
<P>
	The small and medium sized businesses of today with the 
right climate can become tomorrow's multinationals. In order 
for us to achieve economic growth we must use our limited 
resources more effectively to encourage entrepreneurs to create 
the wealth by becoming innovative and helping to expand our 
export economy.
<P>
	Canada's exports account for about 40 per cent of the total 
output of the private sector. One in five Canadian jobs is directly 
dependent on exports. One billion dollars of exports translates 
into 15,000 new jobs. That is why the government is 
aggressively pursuing international trade opportunities.
<P>
	The creation of this department will help set the framework of 
achieving the government's objectives, the creation of jobs and 
economic growth by encouraging businesses, labour and 
institutions to work together in setting goals and striving to 
achieve them.
<P>
	This will enable us to achieve a stronger economy and a better 
standard of living for all Canadians. Canada already is home to 
companies that are at the leading edge in their field such as 
telecommunications, biotechnology, environment and health 
care, et cetera.
<P>
	What we must do is facilitate the greater success of these 
industries in an ever competitive international climate by 
ensuring that the environment here at home is conducive to the 
continued achievement of excellence.
<P>
	Through business networks our government has initiated the 
sharing of information among diverse sectors of the economy, 
enabling them to compete internationally, such as the business 
corporation network which enables Canadian firms to access 
thousands of partnering opportunities in 36 countries.
<P>
	Another example is the advisory council made up of diverse 
business interests working together on the development of the 
information superhighway, not only for internal use but also for 
the export market.
<P>
	We must also improve the efficiency of our industries by 
allowing them to compete more effectively within our borders. 
Canada is hampered by many internal trade barriers. The cost of 
these barriers to Canadians is as high as $6 billion annually.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry, working in co-operation with his 
provincial counterparts, has already begun and continues to 
reduce these barriers to assist the free mobility of goods and 
services.
<P>
	Without the innovations of basic research industry will 
stagnate. Countries such as Japan, Germany and the U.S. spend a 
far greater proportion of their GDP on research and development 
than does Canada. To compete internationally we must use our 
limited resources by working smarter in partnership with 
existing institutions in the private sector to find new 
technologies that can be applied and marketed both internally 
and abroad.
<P>
	With this bill we will fulfil our responsibility as co-ordinators 
of the vital relationship between research and industry and 
promote the fullest use of science and technology from the 
conception of an idea to its fruition in the international 
marketplace.
<P>
	In order for the government to continue to strengthen its 
support of basic research and its industrial applications we must 
be able to obtain royalties from research that succeed in being 
used in the industrial applications in order that these moneys can 
be reinvested in future research.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Small and medium sized enterprises must be in a position to 
obtain and capitalize on the innovations of Canadians as they 
develop these new technologies. Our government will continue 
to streamline programs to assist the small and medium sized 
enterprises to foster these new technologies.
<P>
	In order for these small and medium sized enterprises to 
succeed access to capital is vital. Along with the reduction of red 
tape and the burden of the GST our government has already 
begun the process of streamlining programs and eliminating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6791"> 6791 </A></B>
<P>
some of these obstacles that impede the growth of small and 
medium sized enterprises.
<P>
	We must encourage competition among financial institutions 
to ensure that we give our SMEs as much access to capital as 
possible. Along with these initiatives our government has 
increased funding to and the role of the FBDB which will play a 
more active role in aiding our small and medium sizes 
enterprises.
<P>
	As a member of the industry committee I studied the issue 
most critical to the SMEs which is their inability to access 
capital. We will putting forward our recommendations 
tomorrow. Along with those recommendations that will be 
tabled tomorrow I will be making an additional recommendation 
to my caucus and colleagues which is to encourage the chartered 
banks to achieve a target of lending to small and medium sized 
enterprises of 33 per cent of the total corporate loans, a ratio of 
one to two; that is, for every two dollars lent to large businesses 
one dollar should be lent to small and medium sized enterprises.
<P>
	If the banks comply with this recommendation the capital 
available to the small and medium sized enterprises will 
increase from $30 billion to $45 billion, an increase of 50 per 
cent. Two banks are already achieving this target on their own.
<P>
	The industry act will help our business become more 
innovative, efficient and be armed with enough capital to 
compete internationally. We must take advantage also of our 
well established international reputation to take Canadian 
business to the world and also to bring the world to Canada.
<P>
	Our tourist industry already accounts for more than 500,000 
full time jobs and more than 60,000 enterprises. Last year 
visitors to Canada contributed $9 billion in foreign exchange to 
our economy and Canadians added a further $18 billion while 
travelling within the country.
<P>
	A national tourism strategy will be undertaken with the public 
and private sectors to restructure and improve Canada's 
tourism. A comprehensive marketing program both 
domestically and abroad will help reduce the $8.2 billion travel 
account deficit as well as improve industry competitiveness.
<P>
	My constituents of Trinity-Spadina are looking forward to 
this revitalization of tourism. We must market Canada to the 
people of the world with pride and invite them here so that they 
can share with us the beauty our country has to offer. I believe 
this bill will enhance the streamlining required to make 
Canada's industries competitive in the global marketplace.
<P>
	The framework is set to establish a comprehensive industrial 
strategy which will allow our governments to be the catalysts in 
achieving our common goals. By helping to co-ordinate these 
partnerships we will stimulate economic growth and at the same 
time reduce the deficit and increase the standard of living for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke-Pearson 
International Airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to address my remarks with regard to Bill C-46 
starting with the explanation of why the Reform Party had a 
subamendment which my colleague presented to the House to 
include that not only should Quebec be recognized but that 
rather all the provinces should be recognized. We put this into 
the framework of the Reform's vision for the department.
<P>
	I would like to now recognize some of the remarks that have 
been made by my colleagues opposite. If all of those things that 
they are talking about, the industrial development that is going 
to take place, the research and development, the integration of 
research with industrial development, take place it will take 
place not because of this bill but in spite of the bill.
<P>
	We believe the department needs, like all governments, a set 
of guiding principles and policies, a mission if you will. I would 
like to state that once again. We believe the role of the 
Department of Industry is to establish and maintain a culture 
which rewards entrepreneurship, innovation and research, and 
ensures a level, competitive and honest marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	To achieve that means to decentralize, not to centralize 
control. We need to emphasize the reduction of the ability to 
interfere in the marketplace, and this bill does exactly the 
opposite. What this bill does is allow the minister and the 
cabinet in particular to interfere in the marketplace. There must 
be an emphasis on improving the ability of the marketplace to 
self-regulate, as was so clearly demonstrated by my colleague. 
Serious intervention by the government and by the minister in 
particular should be in emergency cases only.
<P>
	The national interest must be clearly defined by the people of 
Canada through Parliament, and in extraordinary circumstances 
by a national referendum, and not be left in the hands of the 
cabinet as this bill does.
<P>
	Regional development is in particular the focus of our 
amendment. Many fundamental problems that exist in the 
marketplace today arise not because of the fact that the 
marketplace was allowed to operate but because there was 
intervention in the marketplace. Many scholars and former 
senior mandarins of this and related departments have noted that 
a national industrial strategy and regional development 
strategies are mutually incompatible. They fight against one 
another. We heard my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6792"> 6792 </A></B>
<P>
colleague mention that with regard to subsidies and grants in 
particular.
<P>
	The federal government should treat all regions of Canada 
equally and provide a level field so that people can compete on 
an equal footing. Fair treatment would eliminate the need for a 
minister to decide between the national interest on the one hand 
and the regional interest on the other.
<P>
	Regional political patronage and, just as important, the 
temptation to engage in it would be removed to a great extent if 
the instrument of regional development were done away with. 
Better efficiency within the department should be realized.
<P>
	The history of the department coupled with this proposed 
reorganization shows that this minister has chosen not to 
exercise leadership, but rather to accept as a fait accompli what 
was there with the previous government which was a 
Progressive Conservative government. This government in this 
bill is perpetuating the confusion and lack of solid direction that 
existed before.
<P>
	I want to draw particular attention to some of the things that 
have happened with regional development. They are an excuse 
very often for the pork barrelling patronage that goes on. They 
have represented slush funds in the history of Canada.
<P>
	Let us talk in particular about Shawinigan for a moment. 
Shawinigan turned into a canoe specialist area, with the federal 
government's infrastructure contribution to the canoe hall of 
fame this year. The canoe hall of fame may be portrayed as 
regional development but it is certainly not an infrastructure 
program as Canadians understand it.
<P>
	When Canadians voted this government in last fall they 
expected two things from the red book: integrity in government 
and sound fiscal management. I contend that the record thus far 
has shown they did not get either.
<P>
	Projects across this country similar to the Shawinigan one 
may be noted and we need to look at some of the ways that 
money has been spent. It does not matter whether the projects 
are under the infrastructure program or the regional 
development agencies, it is a pork barrel at its worst.
<P>
	Let me give a few examples. The list is long but I will refrain 
from going through the whole list.
<P>
	Twenty thousand dollars was given to a Quebec fashion 
industry gala at Montreal's Olympic Stadium; $500,000 for the 
Upper Humber Golf Club in Deer Lake, Newfoundland; $89,434 
for an Acadian wax museum in Caraquet, New Brunswick; 
$150,000 to develop a program to educate teachers in Cape 
Breton about economic development; over $500,000 for boccie 
courts in Toronto; $5 million to help Peter Pocklington improve 
Northlands Coliseum and Ducey Park in Edmonton; $25,000 to 
study the possibility of hosting the International Pan-Celtic 
Festival; and $224,000 for Rita McNeil's tea room and gift shop. 
It is all too sad that these types of projects are the norm and not 
the exception. There are some noted good projects as well,  but 
these are the kinds of examples that should not exist at all.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	A new parity is needed, one where the free market is allowed 
to operate freely with competition and let the best one win, not 
the government deciding who wins and who loses.
<P>
	I conclude with these words. We should establish a 
marketplace, an industry department that establishes and 
maintains a culture and rewards entrepreneurship, innovation 
and research and ensures a level, competitive and honest 
marketplace. Hand in hand with this approach are government 
policies encouraging free markets, enhancing competition and 
treating all individuals and groups equally. They are the kinds of 
policies that will make Canada strong and prosperous in the 21st 
century. These are the kinds of policies we support.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to participate in the 
debate on this bill to establish the new Department of Industry.
<P>
	As you know, the department is given wide powers including 
not only functions previously assigned to the former 
Department of Industry, Science and Technology, but also 
certain functions of the Department of Communications and the 
former Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
<P>
	The Department of Industry is responsible for the 
administration of government programs in support of the 
industry, including small businesses, tourism, science and 
technology. All government activities relating to science and 
technology come under the Department of Industry, including 
those carried out by agencies like the National Research 
Council, the Canadian Space Agency and the Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council, just to name a few.
<P>
	Telecommunications policy, consumer protection and 
corporate affairs in Canada come under the Department of 
Industry. This is a very wide mandate.
<P>
	Naturally, this bill deals with government organization. And 
while organization is important, it is the policy set forth by the 
department that is the essential factor. The department 
objectives are stated in Section 5 of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) strengthen the national economy and promote sustainable development;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) promote the mobility of goods, services and factors of production, [-]and of 
trade and commerce in Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6793"> 6793 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) increase the international competitiveness of Canadian industry, goods and 
services[. . .]</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And the list goes on. My point in quoting these examples is 
that this government's action is in fact based on Chapter 3 of the 
famous red book, the Liberal electoral platform. This chapter is 
entitled ``An Innovative Economy''. I would say that this 
document, the red book, was innovative in that it emphasizes the 
importance of the small- and medium-sized businesses in the 
modern economy.
<P>
	Let me quote briefly from page 47 in Chapter 3 on an 
innovative economy, where we read that a ``Liberal government 
will focus on small- and medium-sized businesses because they 
can and must be the determining factor in turning around what 
has so far been a jobless recovery''. Small- and medium-sized 
businesses employ 36.7 percent-almost 37 percent-of the 
labour force and account for roughly 40 percent of our gross 
domestic product. They have recently-in the 1980s-been 
responsible for up to 85 percent of new job creation in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In its electoral platform, the government undertook to 
improve access to capital for small- and medium-sized 
businesses. The industry committee has spent the past six or 
seven months reviewing this issue and will be tabling its report 
tomorrow. The government also promised to establish a 
Canada-wide technology network. Plans to that effect have 
already been announced. Here is another example. The 
government promised to promote technology partnerships 
between universities, research institutions and businesses, with 
a view to focussing on commercial applications of research and 
development.
<P>
	Since coming to power, the government has embarked upon 
widespread consultations on the expansion of science and 
technology. Such consultations are carried out under the 
direction of the Minister of Industry, Mr. Manley, and the 
Secretary of State to Science, Research and Development, Mr. 
Gerrard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not think members would find it surprising for me to say 
that I believe the industry committee has a particularly 
important role to play in policy development. Being the 
chairman of the committee, I suppose it is only normal that I 
would say that. Committee work may not always appear to be 
glamorous but it is in committees that the nuts and bolts of 
government policy become reality.
<P>
	Tomorrow we will table our report on small business 
financing. The report deals with financing but it also tries to 
provide a context. We try to address the significance of small- 
and medium sized businesses in today's economy.
<P>
	I referred earlier to the off-sided statistic that small- and 
medium sized business accounted for 85 per cent of the jobs that 
were created in the 1980s. Small businesses  are important to job 
creation and community cohesion but there is more to it than 
that.
<P>
	Not all small businesses have the potential to become medium 
sized businesses or big businesses. We need policies that 
address the needs of small businesses with strong growth 
potential. We also need to concern ourselves with the 
interactions between small and large businesses.
<P>
	We need to be conscious of the competitive environment in 
which all Canadian businesses operate. We address these 
questions in the report that we will be tabling tomorrow. I hope 
the report will contribute to the debate and lead to policies that 
respond to the needs of Canadian businesses, small, medium 
sized and large.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, thank you for giving me 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-46, an Act to establish the 
Department of Industry. The year 2000 is drawing near. With 
technology, the global village has become a reality. All sectors 
of activity are interconnected. It has become impossible to work 
in isolation.
<P>
	At the same time, the difficult economic times we are going 
through force us to streamline, to be creative, to do more with 
less. This is exactly what the government is doing. It is 
integrating two key sectors under one department. It recognizes 
the major links that exist between the various sectors, 
particularly between science, research and technology, 
communications and industry. It is streamlining the government 
administration, making it leaner, thus producing substantial 
savings.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This bill puts into action the recovery plan announced by the 
Prime Minister last month in Quebec City, to improve the 
business climate for entrepreneurs, help businesses gain access 
to new technologies, seek expanding markets and promote 
tourism.
<P>
	The Department of Industry is ideally suited as the focal point 
for the efforts put forth by all the economic development 
stakeholders, and this is very important in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Quebec entrepreneurs are dynamic, 
imaginative and competitive. The success of what we call 
``Quebec Inc.'' is envied and copied far beyond the ``belle 
province''. But there is no doubt either that the federal 
government has provided precious and beneficial support to 
many businesses in Quebec.
<P>
	A study by professor Gérald Bernier, of the University of 
Montreal, shows that, between 1970 and 1989, the federal 
government paid $3.9 billion in grants and loans to Quebec 
businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6794"> 6794 </A></B>
<P>
	We will also recall that it is thanks to export credits that 
Bombardier was able to secure the contract to manufacture 
subway cars for the New York subway system. That is how 
Bombardier broke into the international market of 
transportation. A few years later, the aerospace division of 
Bombardier bought Canadair from the government of Canada. 
Of course, you know this company well, Madam Speaker, since 
it is based in your riding. Bombardier took advantage of 
extremely easy conditions for the purchase of Canadair. It was 
also awarded a contract worth over $1 billion to maintain F-18 
fighter aircraft, which is how Bombardier penetrated the 
aerospace market.
<P>
	Same thing for Bell Helicopter. The Canadian government 
invested $165 million to convince the Texas company to settle in 
Quebec. The list of striking examples could go on and on and 
take up hours of this debate. What is most striking is that the 
government helps Quebec businesses in high-tech sectors, in 
sectors with good, permanent, well-paid jobs.
<P>
	It must also be realized that the industry with a capital ``I'' is 
not limited to what it used to mean in the past. It goes beyond 
heavy industry and manufacturing. It represents the sector of 
society which generates wealth and promotes well-being. It 
covers financial aspects such as investments, human aspects 
such as consumers, as well as economic aspects such as the 
small- and medium-sized businesses my colleague eloquently 
talked about earlier.
<P>
	This single name, Department of Industry, includes all the key 
factors that will enable Canada to set an innovative economic 
policy for one purpose only: to promote 
employment-generating growth. That is our goal. Putting 
consumers and businesses under the same departmental roof is 
an innovative idea.
<P>
	Government officials and business people increasingly 
realize that industrial growth is a result of the interaction 
between them. This interaction allows businesses to design 
better products, develop sound corporate strategies and face 
global competition. We reinforce this principle of interaction by 
ensuring that consumers can be heard whenever policies 
affecting Canadian markets are put in place. In an ever changing 
market, it is essential to listen to consumers right from the start 
of the production process. This avoids costly adjustments 
afterwards.
<P>
	The same goes for science and technology, regional 
development, small- and medium-sized businesses, and 
Aboriginal economic development. All these voices will be 
heard when policies are developed, agreements negotiated and 
decisions made. Science and technology will then have the 
impact needed to create an innovative economy. The $6 billion 
injected into this sector will thus yield the highest returns 
possible.
<P>
	In the age of the information highway, adding 
telecommunications to the Department of Industry's 
responsibilities shows the increasingly important role of this 
sector as an engine of the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In addition, small- and medium-sized businesses will remain 
among our priorities because this sector is the best source of 
long-term jobs. Initiatives such as the recent agreement on 
internal trade are another important step toward more open 
markets.
<P>
	By eliminating over 700 barriers to the free movement of 
people, goods, services and investments, we will be more 
efficient and competitive. This is a concrete example of 
federalism in action.
<P>
	We can never say loudly enough or often enough how 
important it is for everyone to co-operate in ensuring our 
economic and industrial development. Each fight, each 
confrontation, even each moment of hesitation, is costing us 
dearly in terms of lost investments and jobs that are not created.
<P>
	That is why I am happy that the Prime Minister of Canada has 
asked the leader of the Quebec government to reconsider his 
decision not to participate in our major trade mission to China in 
two weeks.
<P>
	We all understand that the Premier of Quebec is very busy 
forming his government and preparing for the next 
parliamentary session. This is certainly a very important and 
demanding stage, but it should not exclude everything else. In 
fact, the leader of our government faced exactly the same 
conflict soon after we were elected last year. He even described 
this experience in a letter he sent to the Premier of Quebec last 
week. The Prime Minister wrote this: ``I remember the difficult 
decision I made to participate in the first Asia-Pacific Summit 
in November 1993, only a few days after my government was 
sworn in''.
<P>
	As the old saying goes, when there is a will, there is a way. 
The Quebec premier could concentrate on the most important 
days of the trade mission if his schedule does not allow for any 
more time. The important thing is that Quebec be represented by 
its premier, putting it at the same level as the other provinces.	We want to show our trading partners that we are serious, consistent and well organized. All that is important to help Canadian businesses establish themselves on the new Asian markets.
<P>
	That is why, as the Prime Minister so logically explained, we 
have asked Mr. Parizeau to reconsider his decision and 
participate personally in the Canadian mission to China. 
Quebecers from all regions and of all political stripes will be 
grateful to him.
<P>
	I know that my time is up.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to 
participate in this debate on the bill to reorganize the 
Department of Industry. The red book foreshadowed this bill. 
Like this bill its main focus was on small and medium sized 
businesses as a determining factor in turning around the 
Canadian economy. It acknowledged that the growth of these 
firms is essential to creating jobs for all Canadians.
<P>
	Several initiatives have been announced as part of the small 
and medium enterprise agenda. A new fund has been established 
to help expand existing businesses through the Federal Business 
Development Bank. As well, the Canada Community 
Investment Fund has been announced to ensure equity financing 
for smaller firms.
<P>
	Part of the role of this bill is to focus on the importance of 
tourism to the Canadian economy. It must be recognized that the 
money government puts into tourism we get back within 90 
days. We get this money back not tenfold but many times that 
rate.
<P>
	In 1992 as an example, tourism generated $28 billion in sales 
revenue for Canada. In the same period the federal government 
through Industry Canada had a tourism budget of $23.2 million. 
Every federal dollar spent on tourism contributed $1,201 in 
sales revenue in Canada in 1992.
<P>
	Canada's tourism industry also had a significant impact on 
our current account, contributing $8 billion a year. Tourism 
employs more than half a million Canadians directly and 
generated jobs faster than the economy as a whole over the past 
decade. It is an industry to be recognized. As well, the analysis 
shows that tourism affords solid opportunities for income and 
employment generation in all regions of Canada. Current 
favourable economic conditions offer an excellent opportunity 
to exploit more fully Canada's international competitive 
advantage, its clean, safe, natural environment and support 
industry efforts to attract more international tourists, thus 
increasing revenue for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	It is my belief that the tourism industry affords an opportunity 
to provide entry level work and job experience for young 
Canadians and for groups that traditionally have had more 
difficulty obtaining employment. Almost 40 per cent of the 
people working in tourism are under the age of 25, nearly double 
the proportion of young people in the general labour force.
<P>
	The tourism industry is also an important provider of jobs to 
the unemployed. It is a stepping stone for back to work after 
unemployment, particularly for the young. Sixty per cent of the 
people who get work in tourism get that work after a period of 
not working and are under the age of 25.
<P>
	This government recognizes the importance of this industry 
and we support it accordingly. The support is shown by the 
Prime Minister's initiative and appointment of the Hon. Judd 
Buchanan to work with the government and the private sector to 
make recommendations on how to increase Canadian tourism 
and revenues.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Buchanan to discuss 
tourism concerns in my area of the country and I look forward to 
Mr. Buchanan's recommendations which I understand are to be 
made public soon.
<P>
	In my riding we have the basis for creating an excellent 
tourism industry. Essex county and the city of Windsor have a 
wide degree of tourism oriented businesses. We have such 
historical sites as the Park House, Fort Malden, the North 
American Black Museum and additional historical sites that are 
being developed such as the Gordon House and HMS <I>Detroit</I>. As 
well everyone has heard about the opening of the casino in 
Windsor. It was expected and is bringing hundreds of thousands 
of new visitors to the area so far and will continue to do so we 
hope every year.
<P>
	As well the recent acquisition of Boblo Island by a local 
developer who is interested in working with the community to 
create a year round tourism facility with year round employment 
opportunities should provide excellent opportunities for the 
area. Most important our area is bordered on three sides by 
natural waterways affording numerous recreational 
opportunities including one of Canada's most beautiful national 
parks, Point Pelee.
<P>
	What is needed to create a sustainable tourism industry in our 
area is a strategic plan. The reorganized Department of Industry 
will be well positioned to create such an over-reaching strategic 
plan. I look forward to the announcement of measures in this 
area.
<P>
	It has been my privilege to have the opportunity to participate 
in this debate.

Natural Resources and to amend related acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
representative of the riding of Abitibi, in Quebec. As many 
members know, it is possibly the largest riding in Canada 
outside the Northwest Territories, with an area of 500,000 
square kilometres. In my riding, natural resources are most 
important, be they forests, mines or hydroelectricity. It is my 
duty to support the amendment proposed on September 27 by my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-48, An Act to 
establish the Department of Natural Resources and to amend related Acts, given 
that the principle of the Bill does not provide for empowering the minister to 
compensate Quebec financially if it chooses to exercise its exclusive 
jurisdiction over natural resources itself, pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867 
and the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Senator Gérald Beaudoin, a strong defender of the federal 
system, would surely share this opinion since, in an essay he 
wrote on the sharing of powers and entitled <I>Partage des 
compétences: c'est comme un vêtement sur mesure</I>, he 
recognized the limits of the spending powers of the federal 
government and the right of a province to ``opt out'' with 
financial compensation whenever the federal authority creates a 
new jointly funded, national program, provided the dissident 
province creates a similar program consistent with the national 
interests.
<P>
	This bill brings nothing new, it is solely the creation of a new 
department, as part of a government reorganisation started in 
1993 by the former Conservative prime minister, Ms. Kim 
Campbell. If the sole purpose of this bill was to merge two 
departments into one, with a view to saving money, improving 
efficiency and correcting the shortcomings found in the  two 
previous bills creating the former departments, it would be easy, 
on the face of it, to accept it and even to support it.
<P>
	However, it is rather obvious that with Bill C-48, the federal 
government is assuming powers and rights which are going to 
infringe upon an exclusive area of authority belonging to the 
provinces. It is totally unacceptable. As we, from the Bloc 
Quebecois, have been saying over and over again, this intrusion 
of the federal government leads to wasteful duplication and 
overlapping between the two levels of government, at great 
expense to Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	We doubt that this bill is aimed at reducing this waste since its 
founding principles maintain the status quo and, even though 
departments are merged, they retain their mandate. If you go to 
the trouble of creating a new department, why not make sure at 
the same time that its operations are efficient and harmonized 
with the priorities of the provinces which, I remind you, are the 
leaders in the field and have exclusive jurisdiction over their 
own natural resources. Nothing in this bill gives the provinces 
exclusive jurisdiction over their natural resources, and no 
alternatives are suggested.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	In 1982, during the negotiations on patriating the 
Constitution, and also during the negotiations on the Meech 
Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord, Quebec asked for 
the right to opt out-with compensation-of federal programs 
where it knew it could do a better job. Many of the parties 
concerned agree with this concept, which is even more 
appropriate when we are talking about natural resources, an area 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I am sure many federalists will agree, and as I already pointed 
out, in certain publications Senator Beaudoin has referred to this 
as a beneficial alternative, reducing duplication and overlap.
<P>
	For the time being, the only real change the average Quebec or 
Canadian citizen can see is that, instead of two ministers, we 
will have only one. There is nothing wrong with that <I>per se</I>, but 
the structure has not changed. Operating expenditures remain 
the same. There are no cuts. However, it is time to streamline 
operations for maximum efficiency, since all taxpayers are 
paying for the federal government's poor management.
<P>
	One way to streamline the federal administration and make it 
more efficient would have been to redefine the role of the 
federal government in relation to the provinces, clarify the 
concept of provincial jurisdiction and opportunities for the 
provinces to manage their federal programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6797"> 6797 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government does not abide by its own 
Constitution, and all the provinces have paid dearly and will 
continue to do so for Ottawa's interventionism and centralist 
approach. Hon. members will recall the Trudeau government's 
energy policy that caused oil  companies to be nationalized at an 
exorbitant price, only to be sold off a few years later.
<P>
	The Athabasca tar sands project is anything but a financial 
success. As for Hibernia, it is an even bigger money gobbler. We 
will have to invest another billion dollars or more to support a 
project that was never essential to Canada's energy 
self-sufficiency, and no one knows whether further technical or 
financial problems will add even more to a bill that is already 
astronomical.
<P>
	Western Canadians and my colleagues here in the House may 
wish to tell me later on whether they received as much money to 
search for new oil wells in Western Canada. In any case, Quebec 
never received any subsidies for its hydro dams.
<P>
	The total bill for Hibernia, which will be several billion 
dollars, could have been channelled into research on new energy 
sources like hydrogen, while supporting the economies of the 
Maritimes, since the excuse for Hibernia was to create jobs for 
Eastern Canada. The government could have supported job 
creation in the Maritimes and used this money to give Canada a 
technological edge in this field on international markets instead 
of trying to look for new oil in difficult conditions at the cost of 
human lives, on drilling platforms off-shore-new oil at well 
above the price on world markets.
<P>
	In the light of this unjustified spending, with no regard for the 
priorities of the provinces, one wonders whether the federal 
government knows what it is doing when it decides how to spend 
money in the provinces, especially in areas over which the 
provinces have jurisdiction.
<P>
	Canadians are sometimes surprised to see the Bloc Quebecois 
here in this House. Perhaps today they will start to understand 
our long-standing demands, especially concerning natural 
resources. We are justified in demanding our rights, the rights of 
our province. This is also legitimate for the other provinces.
<P>
	When the Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a 
member, studied clear cutting, the conclusions it came to were 
again to centralize authority for the sake of better performance. 
In opposition, the Bloc Quebecois wanted to show that 
co-operation would have been more effective because the 
initiative for reform must not come from the federal government 
but from the provinces themselves, since as I have said many 
times, they alone have the mandate to manage their resources.
<P>
	The committee report would surely have been the same, but at 
the same time it would respect the provinces' powers.
<P>
	Section 92-A of the Constitution Act, 1867, clearly states that 
mines and forests are exclusively in provincial jurisdiction. Is it 
right that the provinces cannot make their own decisions?
<P>
	Unfortunately, federal intervention is too often to be 
expected.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The federal government starts with good intentions and ends 
up using its co-ordination role to become the one in charge. The 
usual scenario goes something like this: the federal government 
wants to be there to help co-ordinate, which, in itself, is good in 
such a big country, but as it co-ordinates, it decides that it 
should also run things. While it is at it, why not set the direction 
for the program and while it is doing that, why not be in charge?
<P>
	Each time it is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
government comes along with its dollars and sets the mandate.
<P>
	Spending the money of Canadians and Quebecers does not 
give the government the right to meddle in fields of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. A down-to-earth example in natural 
resources is the program to encourage mining exploration 
investment in Quebec. The Mining Association of Canada and 
the Canadian Prospectors Association think that this program is 
excellent. If this bill recognized the provinces' exclusive 
jurisdiction over natural resources and opting out with federal 
compensation to make Quebec's program more effective, this 
incentive program could really grow and create many well-paid 
jobs.
<P>
	This co-operative attitude already existed in the 1980s and 
yielded excellent results. For example, the Aur Resources Mine 
opened near Val-d'Or with an investment of some $300 million, 
creating 150 direct jobs and at least twice as many indirectly.
<P>
	To end my speech in this debate, I would like to quote again 
what Jean Lesage, the former Liberal Premier of Quebec, said in 
an address to the Empire and Canadian Club in Toronto in 1964. 
His words were eloquent: ``Quebec seeks to obtain all the 
powers needed to assert itself economically, socially and 
politically. If the provinces do not pursue the same objective, 
Quebec will necessarily move towards a special status reflecting 
both the particular characteristics of its people and the more 
extensive role that they want to give their government''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to take the 
opportunity afforded by this debate on Bill C-48 to say that this 
is another important step towards streamlining government.
<P>
	As you know, natural resources play a major role in Canada's 
economy. In 1992, net trade in these products amounted to $40.5 
billion. These impressive figures illustrate the impact of the 
natural resources sector on our economy as a whole. However, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6798"> 6798 </A></B>
<P>
we must also consider  the direct impact of this industry on the 
lives of thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	First of all, one in every thirteen members of Canada's 
workforce is employed in the energy sector, at all levels. What 
makes this a very special group is that workers and their families 
are often located in remote areas. I am thinking of the forests 
around Lac-Saint-Jean, the mines in Abitibi or Northern 
Ontario and Alberta's oil fields. Altogether, over 500 
communities across the country depend on natural resource 
activity.
<P>
	The fact that this industry operates in remote areas creates 
some very specific problems. I am thinking of towns built 
around a mine or a factory. If demand for the product declines 
and the factory has to close temporarily, the whole town suffers. 
And as we saw in Schefferville and elsewhere, in some cases the 
factory or the mine closes for good.
<P>
	It then becomes necessary to either find a new focus for the 
town or relocate the community. Neither option is easy to 
implement and both are hard on the community.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It is therefore very important to ensure that the natural 
resources sector remains a vital element of the economy and the 
job market. This can only be done through new technology, as 
the industry and government are fully aware. We are fortunate 
that Canada is a world leader in the development of technology 
to improve the productivity and competitiveness of our mining, 
forestry and energy industries.
<P>
	Only last week, a large European delegation, mostly from 
Germany, visited construction sites in New Brunswick. In 
Quebec, they went to Saint-Félicien, in the riding of the Leader 
of the Opposition. They also went to British Columbia. They 
came to look at our modern forest management methods, and I 
must say they were all very impressed.
<P>
	This is another example of concrete, active federalism. Our 
friends opposite are always quick to claim jurisdiction for 
Quebec. However, when the Government of Canada brings 
investors or journalists to the province, they are reluctant to 
admit that they benefit from Canadian initiatives.
<P>
	Our government agrees that natural resources are a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction. However, we have a duty and a mandate 
to ensure that the sector contributes its fair share to economic 
growth and job creation across the country.
<P>
	Of course, we must do this in co-operation, in a partnership 
with the provinces, and we are doing so without any hesitation 
whatsoever. In fact, streamlining the department provides a 
national perspective on mining, energy and forestry issues and 
provides a leading edge and expertise in research and 
development to help the industry meet current and future 
challenges.
<P>
	One of those challenges is Canada's progress towards 
sustainable development. For many years, the industry seriously 
damaged the environment, not because it was intent on being 
destructive but because people were not aware of the impact 
certain procedures had on our environment.
<P>
	It is essential to reconcile our economic and environmental 
objectives at all resource management levels. We have made a 
lot of progress, but we still have a long way to go.
<P>
	The modernization of the Department of Natural Resources 
goes precisely along these lines. We must commend the 
government for taking this initiative and including at the very 
beginning of Bill C-48, in clause 2, an excellent definition of 
sustainable development.
<P>
	This shows how serious our commitment to sustainable 
development is. This is particularly important in the area of 
natural resources where we must promote rational development 
and the protection of the environment.
<P>
	The new department wants to co-operate with the provinces, 
the industry, the environmental groups, the natives as well as 
other stakeholders so that the natural resources sector can 
continue to grow in the short and medium term.
<P>
	The department will also act increasingly as an intermediary 
between the industry and environmental activists in order to 
reconcile their concerns.
<P>
	The Department of Natural Resources also has an important 
role to play in the area of research and technology. In fact, its 
reputation in this field is excellent. Its scientific and 
technological know-how cover all aspects of the industry 
management. Very often, the department can act as a leader and 
does so. Nevertheless, particularly where the protection of the 
environment is concerned, we need the co-operation of all the 
stakeholders to achieve our goals.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I am thinking among other things of improving energy 
efficiency. It is widely recognized that improving energy 
efficiency is an essential element helping us, in the short term, 
to achieve the goal of sustainable development. Many 
businesses have discovered that energy efficiency pays off. 
Related technologies also contribute to economic development 
and job creation.
<P>
	Each of us can contribute to Canada's energy efficiency, thus 
helping the government meet its greenhouse effect reduction 
goal. Innovative technologies developed in Canada can also be 
exported to the expanding global market. It is forecast that by 
the year 2000, the global pollution control market will reach 
$600 billion US.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6799"> 6799 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada certainly intends to get its share of this global market, 
a large part of which has to do with resource development 
technologies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is an important bill. It is a technical bill because we are 
trying to reorganize the Department of Natural Resources to put 
all the resources of two departments into one so we can have 
more efficient administration of the policies. Almost a year ago 
this government was elected under the auspices of the red book, 
making sure we develop and improve the economy, create jobs 
and also reduce the deficit and be more efficient.
<P>
	With the reorganization on November 4, 1993 the Prime 
Minister presented the new cabinet to all Canadians and the rest 
of the world. We proved we were going in that direction, that we 
intend to keep our promise. That is what we are doing. We are 
putting into law what we promised in the red book and what the 
Prime Minister announced on November 4, 1993.
<P>
	At this stage with this global economy the protection of the 
environment is very important, not only in terms of protection 
but also in terms of developing the technique, the necessary 
technology to protect the environment. Canada has the know 
how and the tools to be a leader in the world in this field. We can 
create thousands of jobs if we put all our resources together. We 
are going in the right direction in organizing the Department of 
Natural Resources in this fashion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada has a very important role to play in 
assuring us that exporting our resources helps us to prosper and 
to create jobs while applying the principles of sustainable 
development. It is the way of the future, the voice of reason, and 
that is why I am pleased today to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the words of the secretary of state and also to the 
previous debater from the Bloc Quebecois. I read Bill C-48 in 
great detail.
<P>
	I am having difficulty understanding the concerns of the 
speaker from the official opposition about the federal 
government infringing on provincial jurisdictions. The 
secretary of state also represents a riding in that province. I am 
wondering whether he could clarify if the federal government is 
infringing on provincial jurisdiction or is the bill truly a bill 
which has as its goal sustainable development in which not only 
Canada will benefit but this entire planet will benefit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague, 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
The bill is very clear and we have been saying all along that we 
recognize and know that natural resources is a provincial 
jurisdiction. What we should do with Bill C-48 is to reorganize 
the department.  We had two departments and now we have one. 
We are being more efficient and we are putting our resources 
together to compete out there.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	It is a global market in which we have to compete. I said in my 
speech that in recognizing the jurisdiction of the provinces, 
recognizing that we have to work together, and we are working 
together, we are trying very hard and working together as a 
province, it is the role of the federal government to make sure in 
every sector that we create jobs because that is what Canadians 
want.
<P>
	Therefore we are not interfering with the jurisdiction 
problem. In every bill that we present to this House, it seems that 
we have a jurisdiction problem. We realize that this is a 
federation. There are provincial matters and there are federal 
matters. Also, there is a spirit of co-operation.
<P>
	In this bill or in natural resources or in industry or in other 
departments, respecting the provincial jurisdiction, respecting 
the federal role of being a leader of economic development, 
there is praise for both the provincial government and the 
federal government.
<P>
	Instead of fighting about who has jurisdiction, if we would 
work together and co-operate we would achieve both results of 
the goal of the provincial government and the goal of the federal 
government.
<P>
	For all citizens who get elected to serve Canadians, our most 
important role is to make sure not only who does what but also to 
make sure that Canadians get the service they need, the jobs they 
want. That is where the objective should be. We should not try to 
fight each other and lose time and energy instead of creating 
jobs which is what people want. This bill creates jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to ask the hon. secretary of state why, with this bill, the 
government did not take the opportunity to clearly spell out the 
fact that provinces have jurisdiction over natural resources and 
did not define major thrusts for optimum co-operation and 
development of natural resources to promote job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-48 is an act which 
legally establishes the new Department of Natural Resources 
created when the new Liberal government was sworn in on 
November 4, 1993.
<P>
	The purpose of this legislation is to create the legal 
framework for a department which already exists and is in 
operation. Just a half hour ago we had a debate on the bill to 
establish the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6800"> 6800 </A></B>
<P>
Department of Industry and now we are discussing the 
Department of Natural Resources. Two weeks ago, other bills 
were being debated, and I imagine that there soon will be other 
redeployments affecting departments. Indeed, we try to create a 
legal framework for the new departments which have been 
established.
<P>
	As regards the government's action plan, I believe that the 
Minister of Natural Resources has already explained that plan 
on various occasions to the committee. Also, negotiations will 
take place with various provinces, including Quebec. All these 
initiatives are in progress and the hon. member should not 
expect an action plan in a piece of legislation such as this one, 
which establishes a department.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of this legislation is to establish a department, it 
is to define its role and to explain the new structure. I believe the 
hon. member said earlier that he agreed with the principle of 
having one minister and one department instead of two 
departments and two ministers as was the case before. So, this 
initiative will improve efficiency, but it will also ensure better 
discussions and better co-operation between the provinces and 
the federal government. We have always maintained that natural 
resources fall under provincial jurisdiction, but the federal 
government must ensure that these natural resources benefit all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In short, this bill is about the structure of a new Department of 
Natural Resources. I am sure that the hon. member will find 
either in the budget or in other policy statements the federal 
government's action plan concerning the development of 
natural resources as well as sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of the principles of Bill C-48, a 
bill to create the Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
	The Reform Party has long supported the downsizing of the 
federal cabinet and the reduction of bureaucracy. This initiative 
makes good sense particularly in the areas of provincial 
jurisdiction such as natural resources.
<P>
	Having said that, however, I am disappointed to see another 
Tory bill brought before the House by the new Liberal 
government that promised to govern differently. There are no 
promises in the red book to finish Kim Campbell's agenda. All 
this bill does is formalize what has long been happening and has 
long been the case. Instead of seizing this opportunity to 
substantially downsize government and duplication, getting this 
government off the backs of Canadians, it takes half measures as 
we have seen in almost every piece of legislation the 
government has introduced into this House.
<P>
	While I believe there is an opportunity in the reorganization 
of this department to realize substantial economic savings, it 
appears from my analysis of this bill that it will effect very little 
economic savings or the downsizing of the bureaucracy.
<P>
	My colleagues who have spoken previously have addressed a 
number of areas of concern we have with this new super 
ministry. I will concentrate on yet another area that we believe 
could have and should have been included in this initiative to 
effect an economic benefit in the streamlining of these 
departments.
<P>
	The area I refer to is the completion of the privatization of 
Petro-Canada. The creation of Petro-Canada with billions of 
dollars of tax money was part of the greatest fraud ever 
perpetrated on the energy producing regions of this country. 
This fraud through government interference and regulation 
deprived the energy producing provinces of billions of dollars 
that should have accrued to them during the oil price shock of 
1973-74 when OPEC cut off the oil to the west during the Yom 
Kippur war, causing a tripling of oil prices within weeks. The 
producing provinces were never allowed to benefit from this oil 
price surge because of the interference and regulation from the 
federal government.
<P>
	Because of this false fear of its future energy security, the 
federal government created with tax dollars a national oil 
company. The mandate of this crown owned oil company was 
through an aggressive acquisition and exploration program to 
provide for Canada's oil self-sufficiency. In spite of the reckless 
spending of the tax dollar to acquire grossly overpriced foreign 
multinational oil company holdings such as Atlantic Richfield 
Pacific Petroleum, Petrofina, British Petroleum and Gulf 
Petroleum, creating one of the largest oil companies in Canada, 
this bureaucratic boondoggle was never able in any substantial 
way to fulfil the mandate.
<P>
	I well recall the early days of Petro-Canada's intrusion into 
the energy field with bureaucrats flying around in private jets 
and helicopters awarding extravagant cost plus contracts like 
the money would never run out. All this was sold to the Canadian 
taxpayer as necessary to reduce our dependency, or was it the 
U.S. dependency, on mid-east oil reserves.
<P>
	We were told in Canada that we had less than 20 years 
recoverable oil reserves and that a high gasoline tax burden was 
justifiable to guarantee our future energy needs and pay for this 
spending binge. Now, 20 years later, we know that it was so 
much Liberal hogwash, a simple money grab and a flagrant 
breach of the principles of Confederation by the federal 
government, a Liberal federal government. We have 20 years 
later proven oil reserves that will supply Canada's energy needs 
for the next several centuries, almost 400 years of recoverable 
reserves in the tar sands of northern Alberta alone.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6801"> 6801 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The past Tory government, knowing the moral dishonesty of 
these policies, moved with much foot dragging and 
procrastination to end this fraud by cutting taxpayer 
subsidization and even moved to partial privatization, turning 
our state owned oil company into a simple commercial 
enterprise no different than any other large oil company 
operating in Canada. I ask the question, why would the Canadian 
taxpayers want to own just another oil company? Is this oil 
company returning some benefit to the taxpayers in return for 
their billions of dollars in the form of lower gasoline prices or 
providing cheap clean burning natural gas to the homes in 
Atlantic Canada? No, it is not.
<P>
	The fact is MPs on both sides of this House have been made 
aware of the unethical tactics of our state owned oil company 
harassing small independent gasoline retailers in an effort to 
remove competition, hardly what we might expect from our own 
taxpayer owned oil company.
<P>
	It is engaged in the same export frenzy as all the other 
multinationals. Is it engaged in an aggressive Canadian frontier 
exploration program? No more so than any other multinational. 
In fact, Petro-Canada is competing with other multinational 
companies in the far flung corners of the globe.
<P>
	Again the Reform Party questions why the Canadian taxpayer 
would want to own a national oil company. Why would this 
government not sell off this national oil company while the 
industry is strong and recoup some of those billions of 
taxpayers' dollars that were used to create this Liberal 
boondoggle? Why not use this opportunity when we are 
supposed to be downsizing and streamlining government to do 
something really significant and use revenue from the sale of 
Petro-Canada to reduce Canada's debt burden?
<P>
	Could it be that we are about to become the victims of yet 
another Liberal fraud. This government, instead of behaving 
like a fresh new government with new innovative ideas that 
would stop this fatal spiral of debt and deficit we find ourselves 
in, continues to bring in this stale, tired Tory initiative that 
destroyed the PC Party, or it reaches back and resurrects the 
obsolete Liberal ideas of the Trudeau era.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I said at the outset, we support the 
amalgamation and reduction of government ministries but let us 
take some new and innovative steps. Let us get government out 
of private enterprise and let private enterprise do what it can do 
better. Let us get government spending under control and reduce 
the necessity of this desperate sell-off of Canada's natural 
resources to support an unsustainable level of government 
spending.
<P>
	Let us create technology to track the movement of profits of 
multinational corporations that move around the world at the 
speed of light and often escape the taxman. At the same time let 
us not tax to the point where we destroy the incentive to reinvest 
those profits  in Canada's resource industries as we did in the 
case of the national energy program, particularly in value added 
manufacturing so we might escape the dependency on the 
exports of raw natural resource products.
<P>
	Simply put, let us not continue on the same policies that in the 
last 25 years have plunged us into the position as one of the most 
indebted nations in the world at the same time that many of our 
natural resources that this country was built upon are in serious 
decline.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member for 
Athabasca as he went through some of the problems we have had 
in the industry and particularly in the natural resources industry.
<P>
	He raised a couple of interesting points on the indebtedness 
that has been caused by the government intrusion into what 
should have been a private market decision on oil reserves and 
on a national policy to get into the oil business. I see in the paper 
that a two cent a gallon tax on this industry is being considered 
again, this time at the pumps apparently to make one industry 
pay for an environmental program that is going to try and fix the 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Would the member comment on the fact that again one 
particular industry and one province is being targeted to pay for 
what in essence is a national problem. I would like his 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, in spite of the fact that this 
government continues to tell us that a carbon tax or a green tax is 
not a consideration, it continues to come up in the news almost 
daily. Therefore, it continues to be of concern to us who come 
from those resource producing regions. Not only do we come 
from the regions that produce the oil and gas, we are also from a 
region of Canada that is very sparsely populated and has great 
distances.
<P>
	This tactic of taxing the resource to force people to use less of 
the resource or to reduce CO2 emissions is the same kind of 
fraud I talked about in my presentation. In fact, Canada only 
produces some 2 per cent of the world's CO2 emissions. If every 
vehicle in Canada was parked and ran no more we would reduce 
CO2 emissions in the world by less than 1 per cent.
<P>
	I say it is a fraud. If we really want to do something about CO2 
emissions, let us look at some of the other countries in the world, 
like China that produces 20 per cent of the CO2 emissions, 
where doing something about it would have some effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not know how much time we have. I was interested in a couple of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6802"> 6802 </A></B>
<P>
the comments the hon. member for Athabasca made. One was 
the question of bringing in and passing a Tory bill.
<P>
	I would like to remind him of the story of Senator Hayakawa 
of the United States who was asked if the government of the 
United States should keep the Panama Canal after its term 
expired. He said: ``Of course we should. We stole it fair and 
square''.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to talk about is fraud. The hon. 
member mentioned that the tar sands contain enough oil 
potential for several hundred years. I think he mentioned 400 
years. What is his information base for that? Is that 400 years of 
Canada remaining at 29 million population or is that 400 years 
of witnessing the exponential curve in population growth and 
subsequent energy demand around the world? Is that 400 years 
of a population decline in Canada? Four hundred years of what? 
When one makes a blanket statement like that, one has to follow 
through with some kind of qualification to make the thing 
legitimate.
<P>
	Since predictions like that were made years ago, the 
population of the world every year has increased at the rate of 
about 95 million people. I do not know whether he wants to keep 
those other people from having any of that energy and if he 
would prefer that, but that is not the way it is going to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, the statistics I presented were 
provided to me by the Alberta Energy National Resource 
Conservation Board. In fact, the figures I quoted were based on 
Canada's current consumption of energy. Certainly they are 
statistically correct today, but 50 years from now who is to say 
what that might be.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	It has more truth to it than the fraud that was perpetrated in the 
creation of Petro-Canada whereby we were running out of 
conventional crude oil and had to move immediately to spend $6 
billion of taxpayers' dollars to create Petro-Canada. Today, 25 
years later, our conventional crude oil production has not even 
begun to decline. Given the technology advancements, who is to 
say that 20 years from now we will not continue to produce the 
same level of conventional crude oil, not even taking into 
consideration the synthetic crude oil production?
<P>
	I think my figures are quite valid and quite honest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, a 
very few minutes ago I was given the honour of addressing this 
bill. I appreciated very much being a member of the natural 
resources committee and watching history being made.
<P>
	One of the significant aspects of this bill is the tying of the 
forestry industry with the rest of the resource industry. In this 
day of information accessibility, the information highway, the 
move toward high tech and all those wonderful things that will 
present miracles to our children and grandchildren in the future, 
our country does and will in the future rely on its natural 
resources providing that we provide a sustainable base for the  
continuing preservation and enhancement of those natural 
resources.
<P>
	The other reason why it is significant is that in the future, 
maybe 400 years in the future if my hon. friend is correct, I think 
with the acceleration in population on a global basis and the 
increasing demand for energy the future for renewable energy 
will be upon us in the twinkling of an eye. Therefore, because 
Canada produces probably more, if you will pardon the $25 
word, biomass than perhaps any other country on the face of the 
earth, it is only natural that the forest industry and the 
production of cellulose and energy become inexorably tied 
under the wing of one ministry.
<P>
	We are not very many years away from when we will be able 
to produce motor fuel from cellulose in a very competitive and 
environmentally sustainable way. I think the connection that has 
been made with the creation of this new ministry is very 
positive.
<P>
	I should point out to my friends in the Bloc who from time to 
time worry about the jurisdiction that there is no change in 
jurisdiction in this bill. In other words, it is recognized that the 
provinces have jurisdiction over those industries.
<P>
	Our nation has a requirement to provide a voice 
internationally, particularly at the present time, to overcome 
some of the negative feedback that we have been getting from 
places like Europe and so on which were prompted to worry 
about the forest practices in Canada.
<P>
	I must go on record, having sat on the committee studying 
forestry practices in this country, as saying that we are perhaps a 
model for the whole world in the advancements that our 
industries have made. Our government must now through 
various mechanisms take those advances and take that standard 
that has been set and point out to our friends who buy our raw 
materials, our resources or processed materials around the 
world that we are indeed doing a good job. Perhaps in the future 
we will be able to share our technology and some of the things 
we have learned with people around the world. We must not 
forget there are countries on this earth today that have virtually 
denuded their lands of forest cover. Is it not Madagascar that is 
sliding into the Indian Ocean? Countries in the Caribbean were 
stripped bare for their logs before the turn of the century. Only 
now some of those countries are very concerned about 
rejuvenating their forests, understanding the value of that kind 
of forest cover.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Canada has taken the lead role and we will continue. 
Admittedly we have an economic challenge. The combining of 
the department of forestry with what was known as energy, 
mines 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6803"> 6803 </A></B>
<P>
and resources has already effected a savings of some $16 million 
we are told. That is only the beginning and it will go on from 
there. It is efficiency at its best. It is the kind of efficiency all 
levels of governments have to introduce and effect in the very  
near future. It is a pleasure to be part of that and bear witness to 
that change.
<P>
	I would also like to mention that my friends in the Reform 
Party are concerned about oil consumption. They seem to think 
that oil consumption is somehow at risk. The member for 
Athabasca made some comment about the 400 years and so on.
<P>
	Let me draw a scenario regarding the consumption of energy. 
One of the main domestic sources of oil for the United States is 
now in decline. That is Prudhoe Bay, which has been supplying 
about 25 per cent of the domestic requirement of the United 
States. The rest of the oil patch in the United States has been in 
decline for many years.
<P>
	The Americans have a few choices. One of the choices of 
course is to buy more Canadian natural gas, another 
non-renewable resource and take it in increased quantities. 
Another choice of course is to effect more conservation through 
one means or another. The cheapest barrel of oil is the barrel of 
oil you do not use. Another is to exploit as much renewable 
energy as is possible which the United States is presently doing 
with quite large efforts. Of course the other option is to buy more 
offshore oil.
<P>
	If anyone imagines for one minute that Canada can somehow 
put a fence around itself and say that we have enough for all 
these years and we are going to save it and keep it for ourselves, 
I have news for them. The world is not like that.
<P>
	China presently has the largest growing economy on earth. It 
is double digit growth. By and large they still are riding bicycles 
in China but with increased communication and witnessing 
lifestyles based on energy consumption in other parts of the 
world, it will not be long before that nation will require more 
and more oil. They will be off their bicycles and into 
automobiles before we know it. If petroleum is the only option, 
imagine the demand if China were to expect half of the 
consumption that North America presently consumes per capita. 
The bravado about the long term availability of petroleum is 
rather questionable to say the least.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Another thing that should be said is that in 1979 Sheik Yamani 
who was the Saudi Arabian oil minister went on Canadian 
television and said that oil was too precious a resource to simply 
combust. That was a prophetic statement if ever there was one. 
If we look at the amount of petroleum that is now used as a 
feedstock in the petrochemical industry for polymers and so on, 
we can easily see where that precious commodity may 
ultimately belong.
<P>
	We are now bearing witness to the very beginnings of a move 
from non-renewable energy consumption, which has been kind 
of a blip in recent history as we did not have this before coal was 
discovered, and it will ultimately be used up. We do not know 
how much is in the barrel, whether it is two-thirds empty, 
one-third empty, or whatever. However we do know there are 
some compelling reasons why we should be making this move.
<P>
	It is only fitting and rather prophetic that energy and these 
other forms of resources are now tied together. Hopefully the 
development of renewables can now go on with less hindrance 
than there has been in the past. Perhaps instead of two ministries 
not communicating with each other as well as they should have, 
now we will have one ministry that can communicate within 
itself.
<P>
	I am very pleased to support this bill. It is a new era for 
Canada. As I said initially, it will be more efficient for the 
process of governing but it will also bring together some of 
those factors we have outlined and will set a new pathway for the 
future of energy and the other resources in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments. I would like 
him to clarify a couple of things he mentioned.
<P>
	One was the jurisdiction of natural resources being primarily 
a provincial concern. That is a constitutional matter I am much 
in favour of. I am trying to get at the direction in which the 
Liberal government is heading.
<P>
	The other is another leaked report from this government that 
has found its way into the media. This time it is the 
consideration of a two cent a litre tax on gasoline to pay for the 
stabilization of greenhouse gases. The minister herself admits 
that is one of the proposals so this is not an obscure report. This 
report exists and it just happens that it was leaked to the media 
six months in advance.
<P>
	Also, I was at the United Nations a little while ago and we 
were discussing proposals for UN reform. This report should be 
very interesting to the Liberals who can read. If members look 
halfway through the booklet on Canadian proposals for UN 
reform, it says that Canada proposes a tax on hydrocarbons to 
pay for the United Nations.
<P>
	I am not sure how many members have read that report but I 
urge them to dig it up. They should especially have regard to the 
constitutionality of who should control the taxation on 
hydrocarbons, what should be the priorities of the federal 
government and what the plans are. This is not pie in the sky 
theory or scare tactics but it is in a little book, this time a blue 
one, supported by the Liberal Party proposing a hydrocarbon tax 
to support the UN this time. Last time it was another crisis.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6804"> 6804 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to have the member's thoughts on exactly whose 
jurisdiction this is and what he thinks of hydrocarbon taxes 
specifically to fund everything, in this case from the United 
Nations to greenhouse gases. Which jurisdiction should that fall 
under? Who should we send this warning flag to, the provinces 
or the oil companies?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from the 
hon. member. I should point out to him that in any function of 
government when questions are being asked as to how we tackle 
a situation and what areas we consider in a situation, all sorts of 
proposals are made. Whether they are adopted or rejected is yet 
another thing.
<P>
	At this stage I certainly do not know that any consideration 
would be given to such a tax. However I think it is valid to 
debate the subject and to look at it as being on the table and 
worthy of debate, not in a dissimilar way to what the minister of 
finance tried to initiate before the budget last February. 
Remember, we all participated in a prebudget debate. There was 
consultation, albeit too brief at that time, to try and bring in the 
business and corporate sector.
<P>
	Public consultation is something that has not been generally 
practised in this country in the past. More is the pity because 
now when we enter into public consultation and try to glean 
from it ideas and concepts that will guide us, cynics say that it is 
a bit of window dressing and the government will go on and do 
whatever it wants anyway.
<P>
	As the member knows, the gun control issue was another one 
where public consultation was undertaken by the ministry. 
People travelled across Canada all summer long and talked to 
Canadians. I point out that in the previous firearms acquisition 
bill the former minister would not even entertain a written brief, 
not one written brief.
<P>
	This is a new exercise for Canadians. If the government treats 
this process with respect, then we all gain.
<P>
	The member talks about a two cents a litre tax. I also read the 
newspaper article and I have no knowledge that any such thing is 
contemplated, but I certainly would welcome a debate on it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member, who is also a member of the 
Natural Resources Committee, a question further to his speech 
on ecology. My question is quite specific. Do you not think that 
we could have put all the billions of dollars that are going to be 
invested in the Hibernia project into projects other than 
petroleum projects, into renewable energy projects such as 
hydrogen, for example? What the Bloc quebecois is saying is 
that the federal government's interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction is not merely  constitutional in nature, but involves 
amounts of money that Canadians, and therefore Quebecers, are 
paying for projects that are not viable financially or 
ecologically. Do you not think that better choices could have 
been made?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for that 
question.
<P>
	I can remember sitting on the Ontario Hydro select committee 
during 1976 to 1980 when the debate raged over the construction 
of the Darlington nuclear plant. I remember that from our 
perspective Darlington was too expensive to contemplate. After 
the debate we realized that the utility had gone ahead and 
committed something like $500 million toward Darlington, a 
facility that has now cost about $15 billion, which is absolutely 
ludicrous.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I remember being quoted in the paper as saying that 
sometimes when we get so far into something it is very hard to 
get out. I expect that one could say something similar. We 
inherited the Hibernia project. We did get out of the 
Lloydminster heavy oil issue. We were able to extract ourselves 
from it. We are living with what is reality at the present time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I used to 
sound like the hon. member through the seventies and early 
eighties when I believed the lies we had at that time about 
consumption and about available resources.
<P>
	I come from a place where we have world scale petrochemical 
programs that we were told would only last another five years. 
We have now extended them for twenty years and there is no 
foreseeable end to our ability to produce.
<P>
	The member referred to China. What about the alternate 
energy that will in fact come about such as coal gasification? 
China has huge resources of coal. What about some of the 
alternate energy forms that are there just waiting to be taken 
over? What about all those?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Madam Speaker, China is a very interesting 
country. The last time I checked it was installing hydro units at 
the rate of 15,000 a year. China is the world's largest producer of 
hydraulic turbines. It builds good stuff, incidentally.
<P>
	There is a pent up demand for energy in countries like China 
that far exceeds our ability to comprehend. We should be able to 
turn it to our advantage. Whether it is petroleum export or 
whatever, I do not see forms of energy competing against one 
another per se. As a matter of fact I see them complementing one 
another.
<P>
	In terms of petroleum I would suggest that Sheikh Yamani 
was right. The commodity itself is probably too precious to 
combust. We can look at the clean air targets. The business of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6805"> 6805 </A></B>
<P>
coal combustion, for instance, is something we are probably 
shying away from because it is a direct contributor to 
greenhouse gas.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(5)(<I>a</I>) I have been requested by the chief government 
whip to defer the division until a later time.
<P>
	Accordingly, pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(<I>a</I>), the

<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFPUBLICWORKSANDGOVERNMENTSERVICESACT">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 5 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is certainly my pleasure to rise in the House to speak on Bill 
C-52, a bill to consolidate the government services department.
<P>
	Over the last number of years we note there have been 
paradigm shifts in terms of how business is done. When we on 
this side of the House were elected the Prime Minister decided 
that we were to operate with fewer cabinet ministers. We were to 
work in every department to make sure, if there were any 
savings to be made, savings would be made for the Canadian 
people. We were to deploy our manpower to make sure it worked 
in the most efficient manner possible to get the best bang for the 
dollar.
<P>
	Recently scientists watched a set of Canada geese flying and 
they found out that they flew in a particular <I>v</I> formation. When 
they studied it they found that one wing was slightly longer than 
the other. They also found out that if the one bird in front led for 
quite a while it created a vacuum which made it easier for the 
following birds to fly. As that bird got tired it would pull back 
and another bird would take its place. As a result the birds could 
travel 70 per cent farther than they otherwise could.
<P>
	I hope all members of the House try to stretch the dollar that 
much further so that Canadians could get the best possible dollar 
value from us. It is up to all members to look for ways to save. I 
do not think it is incumbent on us always to be critical. We need 
to make sure that people working for governments know they are 
working for people who work very hard and honestly to get their 
salaries. They in turn expect a fair return on their dollar.
<P>
	I am really pleased today to speak on behalf of the 
consolidation of the department. Since we started debating Bill 
C-52 my Bloc colleagues have repeatedly asked that the 
government produce regular statements, monthly reports, and 
open up the federal government contracting process. According 
to them the purpose of the monthly reports would be threefold: 
to keep taxpayers informed, to stimulate competitiveness, and 
to ensure that government decisions are open and transparent. 
There is no doubt that these are worthy goals.
<P>
	However I assure the Bloc members and the House that the 
government has already taken many steps to do just that. From 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6806"> 6806 </A></B>
<P>
the very onset of its mandate the government has been 
committed to fairness and openness in government contracting.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services is Canada's largest 
purchasing organization. As the principal purchasing agency for 
the federal government it has responsibility for approximately 
65 per cent of total government purchasing. The rest is spread 
over about 100 other federal organizations. The department 
buys some $10 billion worth of products and services each year.
<P>
	Taking into account the procurement activities of the agencies 
under its purview, Public Works and Government Services 
issues approximately 1,000 contract transactions each day. It 
goes without saying that administering such a large volume of 
transactions is a huge undertaking. However there are cost 
effective systems in place at Public Works and Government 
Services Canada which allow the Canadian public to be 
effectively and fairly served while having unfettered access to 
information about government contracting.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	There is no need to waste time, energy and taxpayers' money 
tabling reports on contracting activity, given the fact that the 
information is readily available and accessible to the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	The issues raised by the Bloc members, namely access to 
contracting information, competitiveness and the integrity of 
the procurement process, have been and continue to be priorities 
of the government.
<P>
	We did as promised in the red book and have taken a series of 
initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of 
government. As one of Canada's largest buyers of goods and 
services and a major real property manager, the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services is committed to 
providing the nuts and bolts information which helps all 
companies across Canada to do business with the federal 
government.
<P>
	One tool is the open bidding service. It is also known as OBS. 
It is an electronic bulletin board that gives fast and equal access 
to opportunities to bid for government contracts. It provides 
information about upcoming requirements and the documents 
companies need to bid on them. It provides equal access to 
public works and government services, opportunities valued at 
$60,000 or more for construction and maintenance services and 
$25,000 or more for other types of government procurement. 
With OBS anyone anywhere in Canada has access to the same 
information at the same time.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services 
also produces the government business opportunities or GBO 
publication. It lists the same opportunities as OBS. It is printed 
three times a week and provides very timely information. In 
addition to advertising contract opportunities with the federal 
government, the OBS gives notices of contracts the government 
intends to award on a sole source basis. In this way companies 
have the opportunity to challenge the government's rationale for 
single tendering.
<P>
	If in response to a sole source notice another supplier can 
demonstrate that it can meet the government's requirements for 
a particular contract, a competition will be held. It is another 
way by which the government stimulates competitiveness.
<P>
	Not only does the government already make information 
available on proposed business opportunities to all Canadians, 
but it also provides information on contracts that have been 
awarded. The information is posted regularly on the OBS as well 
as published in the GBO. A contract history data base is 
available on OBS which provides information on any contract 
awarded on open bidding service since 1989. It allows anyone 
anywhere in Canada to see which companies have been awarded 
open bidding contracts, for what goods or services and for what 
value.
<P>
	The open bidding system is designed to allow easy and 
equitable access to information on government procurement 
opportunities both in process and historical. The system 
effectively addresses access, competition and accountability.
<P>
	All MPs have been invited to subscribe to the OBS. By getting 
onboard they would certainly have access to all the information 
they need on contracts being awarded in their ridings. Easy 
access to information on contract opportunities is the key to 
ensuring fairness and openness to suppliers.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	However, this government also believes in independent 
redress for suppliers who may believe that the government's 
actions have not met their commitment to openness and fairness, 
and suppliers who believe that they have not been treated 
equitably are able to appeal to the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal. It is an independent board to which suppliers can seek 
quick and inexpensive redress for procurement subject to the 
NAFTA.
<P>
	If successful, the supplier may be awarded payment of 
compensation or recompetition of the procurement. This is yet 
another mechanism through which the integrity of the 
procurement process is maintained.
<P>
	More generally, each department is accountable to 
Parliament, suppliers, and therefore every Canadian for its 
activities including procurement through the annual tabling of 
the <I>Main Estimates</I> and the report of the Auditor General.
<P>
	The public sector is under intense scrutiny today. Canadians 
are demanding that the government not only control the costs of 
services and administration but also that it acts in a fair and open 
fashion. Clearly, with all these mechanisms currently in place, 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
providing equal access to the federal market, fairness in 
awarding contracts and ensuring that the information on 
contracts to

<P>
be awarded or that have been awarded is available and 
accessible to all Canadians.
<P>
	There are policies and systems in place to ensure that the 
government procurement is open, fair and transparent, and that 
means no political influence. All contracts are subject to the 
requirements of the Treasury Board contracting policy whose 
principles and procedures I again emphasize ensure an open, 
transparent and competitive contracting process.
<P>
	Up to date information on contracts awarded is currently 
available every day to any Canadian anywhere across Canada on 
the OBS. This information is very time sensitive to suppliers. 
With the information currently available and accessible 
suppliers know right away about the approach, for example, for 
subcontracting activity. A monthly report is not only a 
duplication of the information already available, but of very 
limited benefit to suppliers as it is only an historic record.
<P>
	The OBS makes the system better and fairer for the 
government, for Canadian business and, most important, for the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Several other federal departments and crown corporations as 
well as the provincial governments of Alberta and Ontario have 
chosen to use the OBS to advertise their procurement needs, 
giving potential suppliers a window on a multi-billion dollar 
market. It also saves the government money, some $3.5 million 
annually, in document printing and advertising costs.
<P>
	The tabling of monthly reports of contracts awarded is a 
duplication of effort. The Bloc members have condemned that 
kind of attitude in this House: ``Nobody in this House can 
support ridiculous or useless spending''. That was the member 
for Laurentides, February 10, 1994.
<P>
	With their demands Bloc members are asking this government 
to do just that, more ridiculous and useless spending.
<P>
	As the member for Laurentides has said in this House, we 
must try to eliminate duplication in order to reduce costs, to save 
money, to become more efficient.
<P>
	This government is streamlining and eliminating waste. It is 
not the intention of this government to spend taxpayers' dollars 
producing reports that no one will read when there are effective 
and proven means of accessing the same information.
<P>
	As a member of this government, I strongly believe that there 
is a compelling need, especially in these days of strict fiscal 
restraint, to ensure that each dollar spent by this government is a 
necessary expense and that it represents the best value that can 
be achieved in the use of that scarce resource; every dollar 
counts.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	This government's commitment to the integrity if the 
procurement process has been made very clear with the 
increased use of OBS and the recent release of the new 
guidelines for public opinion research and advertising contracts.
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works and Government Services has 
also introduced a new clause aimed at eliminating contingency 
fees. Bidders are now required to certify that they have not hired 
a lobbyist to solicit award of a contract where any part of the 
payment to the lobbyist depends on the client obtaining that 
contract.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will once again state that Canadians already 
have access to up to date information anywhere in Canada on the 
government's procurement activities. That is the key to a truly 
competitive process.
<P>
	This government believes strongly in the importance and the 
integrity of the procurement process. Canadians have a right to 
know that their government does business in an honest and open 
way and who it does business with. They also require that their 
government not waste money by duplicating its efforts.
<P>
	This government will continue to serve the Canadian public 
by ensuring that an open and fair procurement process is 
maintained in the most cost effective way possible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is appropriate following my colleague's speech on 
the importance of our fiscal resources and using them well that I 
speak about those other resources which are perhaps even more 
important in delivering services to Canadians and ensuring good 
government for Canada and those are the people who are also a 
valuable resource.
<P>
	Bill C-52 will give legislative force to the amalgamation of 
the former departments of public works and supply and services 
as well as the translation bureau and the government 
telecommunications agency. This is clearly in line with our 
government's commitment to make federal government 
operations more efficient and less costly to the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I will inform you and the House that I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, in this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This merger will significantly reduce the administrative and 
other costs involved in providing most of the central services 
required by federal agencies and departments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The overall staff requirement will be reduced by more than 20 
per cent from 18,000 at the time of amalgamation to about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6808"> 6808 </A></B>
<P>
14,000 by 1998. Clearly such a reduction will substantially 
reduce the salary budget of the department-by more than $1 
billion over the next decade.
<P>
	Our government also recognizes that there is a very important 
human dimension to this downsizing, necessary though it may 
be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We realize that the savings which we intend to achieve will 
inevitably affect the lives and careers of many public servants. 
That is why we are now taking all necessary measures to make 
this transition the least disruptive possible for those directly 
concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The need to streamline operations and reduce the cost of 
government is by no means unique to Canada. It is a problem 
being faced by the provinces, by our municipalities, in the 
United States, in Europe and throughout the industrialized 
world.
<P>
	I believe that the program of support and assistance being 
introduced by our government is one of the most enlightened of 
its kind and is recognized as a leader in the field. Unlike the 
previous government which regrettably was inclined to 
downgrade the public service and treat it as a scapegoat for its 
own failures, our government recognizes that the quality of our 
people is our most important strength.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	We will work closely with our public servants and the unions 
that represent them to minimize the impact of these difficult but 
necessary staff reductions. The broad strategy will be to retain to 
the greatest degree possible the skills, the experience and the 
loyalties of the affected employees within the public service and 
to give the greatest possible assistance to those who cannot be 
retained in finding suitable employment elsewhere.
<P>
	Specifically, each affected employee will be assigned a 
workforce adjustment adviser to provide job search, marketing 
assistance and other services on a regular basis.
<P>
	All surplus employees will be offered a one-week course 
developed with union participation dealing with such issues as 
stress management, financial counselling and job search 
techniques. Surplus employees will be provided with links to 
specialized services as required, such as the employee 
assistance program, because we recognize that not only are 
people going through a career change but they are going through 
a significant life change.
<P>
	Extensive training, advice and support will be provided to 
managers in planning and implementing reductions with special 
emphasis on communication with all employees. We recognize 
that the manager has a key role to play in ensuring that 
downsizing is implemented fairly and with maximum 
consideration for our employees.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will fully apply the directive on reassignment for 
employees declared surplus.
<P>
	Among other things, this means a guaranteed position in the 
federal Public Service to the extent that the employee can be 
retrained or is ready to consider relocation. It also means that 
employees will receive six months' notice if they are declared 
surplus and will be entitled to retraining courses for up to two 
years.
<P>
	Under the work force adjustment directive, surplus 
employees will be entitled to salary protection if they are 
appointed to a lower position. If they wish to resign, they will be 
entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to six months of salary. 
Also, employees who are over 50 years old and have more than 
five years of service will receive up to 15 weeks of salary as 
severance pay as well.
<P>
	Our government intends to work as closely as possible with 
the various public service unions in implementing these 
changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The unions and employees are understandably not entirely 
happy with the reductions in government staffing levels that are 
taking place throughout the country but they recognize the 
reality of the times and they know that we want to work with 
them to co-operate in ensuring that these lay-offs are conducted 
fairly and in accordance with government policy and directives.
<P>
	In this regard, workforce adjustment committees are already 
in place at the national and regional levels of the former 
departments. The government is continuing to discuss and 
examine with the unions the most effective way to consult and 
co-operate on the reshaping of the new department.
<P>
	In this exercise departmental managers are being encouraged 
to consider innovative strategies and the voluntary use of 
flexible work arrangements such as part time work and job 
sharing as a means of minimizing the impact of these changes.
<P>
	The process of downsizing has already begun and there are 
currently some 250 surplus employees in the inventory of the 
department. It is encouraging to note that to date the majority of 
surplus employees have been dealt with through retraining and 
redeployment with very few involuntary lay-offs.
<P>
	The components of this department in particular have an 
excellent record in treating their employees fairly.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I think hon. members will agree that our government has gone 
to extraordinary lengths to try to minimize the negative effects 
of departmental restructuring on the workforce. This is a clear 
demonstration of our commitment to build a new and stronger 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6809"> 6809 </A></B>
<P>
relationship with the public service and to demonstrate that we 
both respect it and value its work.
<P>
	The morale in the federal public service took a rather severe 
battering during the Tory years in power. We are determined to 
re-establish a new and better relationship based on mutual trust 
and mutual respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I address the House this 
afternoon. As a matter of fact, this is the first time I get to 
participate in a debate since the Prime Minister appointed me 
Chief Government Whip.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister publicly, in 
front of my constituents, for appointing me and to tell all my 
hon. colleagues in this House that I will do my very best not to 
disappoint them. I will try to carry out my duties as whip in such 
a way as to keep the caucus united under the excellent direction 
of the Right Hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	Perhaps there is a symbolism in the fact that my first speech 
following my appointment is a speech on the contract award 
process. Why? Because this whole issue of contracting is one 
that I, as the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
consider very important.
<P>
	We have before us today a bill introduced by the Hon. 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, with an 
amendment moved by a Bloc Quebecois member, namely the 
hon. member for Québec-Est, seconded by the hon. member for 
Charlevoix.
<P>
	Listen carefully to what the Bloc Quebecois member is 
proposing. His amendment reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[That] this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-52-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Listen to this. He would have us decline to give second 
reading to a bill to amalgamate federal departments. What is the 
purpose of this bill? To prevent duplication. Where have we 
heard this before: to prevent duplication? Who has been 
advocating such action in this House? Madam Speaker, our 
colleagues opposite.
<P>
	I can see the hon. member for Drummond smiling. She knows 
full well that her party claimed to be the champion of the use of 
government funds by stating that duplication must be prevented. 
With all due respect to their sovereignty, I must tell the hon. 
members opposite that today, a Bloc Quebecois member has 
actually asked this House to refuse to pass this bill to prevent 
duplication.
<P>
	The reasons the Bloc Quebecois member does not want 
consent to be given are known. They are stated on page 6529 of 
<I>Hansard </I>for Tuesday, October 4, 1994. Let me read them to you, 
Madam Speaker. As a fair, non partisan member of this House, 
you can see clearly how the hon. member is mistaken. He says, 
and I quote the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-52 should have more teeth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He is asking that consent be refused because he would want 
the bill to have more teeth. He may have some trouble with these 
subtleties but, not to worry, it will all become very clear, I think, 
when you hear what the member of the Bloc Quebecois said, and 
I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the Bloc Quebecois's proposal: We ask that a public review board be 
created under the bill to scrutinize contracts awarded by the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services and to ensure openness.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is the Comptroller General of Canada. Then, after 
public funds have been spent, there is also the Auditor General 
of Canada, at the risk of surprising the members opposite.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	There are audit mechanisms in place before and after 
contracts are awarded. So the Bloc's first proposal does not hold 
up.
<P>
	Second, said the member for Charlevoix, we ask that a 
contracting-out code be clearly defined in this bill. Again, at the 
risk of surprising the hon. member, there is a mechanism in 
place for all contracts awarded by the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services. I must say that I handled such 
matters in the past. Suppliers must fill out statutory declarations 
assuring the government that subcontractors have been paid 
before they can receive benefits from the government. This 
practice is now in effect. So the Bloc's second request does not 
hold up either.
<P>
	Now listen closely, Madam Speaker, to the Bloc Quebecois 
member's third request: ``Third, we demand that members of 
Parliament of all political stripes be consulted about and kept 
informed of the government contract awarding process 
involving the ridings they represent.'' Well, well, well! This 
sounds a lot like patronage. Is it because the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois used to belong to a political party that was partial to 
patronage? Is that the reason? Is it a leftover from the Tory era? 
Probably not. It is probably just a coincidence.
<P>
	Another funny coincidence, if I remember correctly, is that 
the former leader of the Conservative Party used to represent the 
riding of Charlevoix, did he not? The current member for 
Charlevoix was on the executive of his association, before he 
switched parties, of course. I am not referring to the days before 
the Bloc Quebecois leader switched parties: I am referring to the 
days before the member for Charlevoix switched parties. 
Indeed, as you know, these people have had a tendency to switch 
parties. During his career, the Bloc Quebecois leader switched 
parties five times; he will likely do it two or three more times 
again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> It will not be long!
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6810"> 6810 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> ``It will not be long'', says the hon. member for 
Nickel Belt. I congratulate him for being so eloquent, as he 
usually is, and also for being so perceptive.
<P>
	My colleagues from the Liberal Party do not see the use of 
setting up a patronage system as demanded today by the Bloc 
Quebecois. No, Madam Speaker. We, Liberal Party members, do 
not agree at all with that suggestion.
<P>
	I was just referring to politicians who have switched parties 
and I see that the member for Richelieu just came into this 
House. I am convinced that he is interested in this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Richelieu, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, my grandfather used to say 
that only fools do not change opinion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but this is not 
a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, it all depends on how foolish 
the original idea is.
<P>
	So, these are the proposals made by Bloc Quebecois members 
today. They are saying that we should not go ahead with Bill 
C-52.
<P>
	The Liberal Party dealt with this issue in a document called 
the red book-and members opposite must surely have heard 
about it-and I would like to quote excerpts from the part of that 
document on how to put an end to waste.
<P>
	Billions of dollars are spent indiscriminately on useless 
programs. It is time the government spent public money as 
carefully as Canadians do with their own money. A Liberal 
government will review government spending and cancel the 
extravagant helicopter contract approved by Kim Campbell. The 
document then lists the rest of the useless expenditures.
<P>
	Those are the priorities established by our party during the 
election campaign, and we remain committed to fulfilling our 
election promises. We still intend to serve Canadians well.
<P>
	Finally, I want to refer to a document on ethics and morals in 
the public sector, which was released by the Liberal Party when 
we formed the opposition and when I was the critic on 
government administration. Recommendation No. 4 in this 
document states that the Liberal Party wants to merge the 
Department of Supply and Services and the Department of 
Public Works into a single department, the Department of 
Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	There you are, Madam Speaker. In 1992, we consulted 
Canadians and defined our program. In 1993, we presented that 
program to Canadians in the red book. And in 1994, we are 
fulfilling our commitments. That is the difference between the 
Liberals and the members opposite. We have said the same thing 
before, during and after the election campaign, and we will 
continue to  provide a good government to Canadians, in spite of 
the efforts of some members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not think the hon. member's appointment has made him any 
smarter. His speeches have not changed.
<P>
	In fact, I did not move this amendment, I merely seconded it, 
because you will recall, if the hon. member would read the text 
of the motion, that the amendment was moved by the hon. 
member for Québec-Est, Jean-Paul Marchand, and seconded by 
the hon. member for Charlevoix.
<P>
	The bill amalgamates the departments of Public Works, 
Supply and Services, Procurement and Communications and 
Translation. We wanted the government to use this bill to 
provide some transparency in government procedures. People 
often say it is time the government stopped wasting money.
<P>
	If we consider contracting out alone, between 1984-85 and 
1992-93 there was a 56 per cent increase in this area at Public 
Works. There was an increase of 114.2 per cent in National 
Defence. There was an increase of 207 per cent at Health and 
Welfare. There was an increase of 247 per cent at Supply and 
Services. There was an increase of 628 per cent at Customs and 
Excise.
<P>
	Although the Auditor General does a very good job, in his 
report he said he had been unable to assess whether the 
government had received its money's worth for the amounts 
spent on contracting out. How many people in the Public Service 
have been put on the shelf, while the government decides to have 
their work done on contract? What we want is a monitoring 
committee, consisting of public servants, elected 
representatives and people working for the Auditor General.
<P>
	It also says in our amendment that members from each riding 
should be consulted, and I would like to explain that this was put 
in because of a statement by a Liberal member on the 
committee, who I think deserves all the credit. He said that he 
read a public notice in his riding that the government was 
preparing to make some changes in the post office there. He 
saved the government a million dollars. We moved the 
amendment simply in the interests of transparency.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Chief Whip. Does he agree that 
the government should include elements in its bills that would 
reflect great transparency?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry, but I thought the 
hon. member was making a speech, because he had been going 
on for quite a while. The hon. member wants to know whether 
we favour more openness. I am sorely tempted to answer with 
the following question: How could the creation of a structure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6811"> 6811 </A></B>
<P>
which could increase patronage be an instrument of greater 
openness?
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The member opposite totally missed the boat regarding this 
bill. We have the tools to ensure  transparency. The member said 
that it takes a committee to go along with the Auditor General. 
We already have one, it is called the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts. Once the Auditor General's report is tabled in 
the House, it is automatically referred to the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts without even a motion from this 
House.
<P>
	Under the present Standing Orders, it is automatic. All 
government contracts the Auditor General wants to comment on 
are included in his report if he believes that it is in the interest of 
this House; consequently, they are automatically referred to this 
parliamentary committee. Therefore, once again, the member's 
arguments are flawed. Yes, we need greater transparency, more 
accountability, and yes, all parliamentarians agree that we need 
to cut costs. This bill is going to accomplish all that and we 
already have all the other necessary structures.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on second 
reading of Bill C-52, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services Act.
<P>
	I have listened to the debate on this bill with great interest and 
have noticed once again how the members of the opposite side 
will stretch logic to the breaking point in order to turn 
discussion to their pet subjects.
<P>
	I have also noticed that no argument, no matter how sound, 
will steer them away from these pet subjects with the result that 
we who support the passage of Bill C-50 must repeat dozens of 
variations on the same factual themes. They are indeed factual 
themes which no amount of political rhetoric can dismiss.
<P>
	Bill C-52 is a clear instance of sound legislation to improve 
the efficiency and the effectiveness of government. It eliminates 
overlap and duplication. It provides for consolidation and 
coherence in government purchasing and contracting. It 
generates vast savings and taxpayers' dollars thus contributing 
to deficit reduction and helping restore public faith in 
government.
<P>
	It eliminates antiquated, redundant legislation and regulation, 
bringing administrative practices into the electronic age. It 
permits single window access to information for clients, 
suppliers and taxpayers. Despite the declarations of members of 
the opposite side, there has been a great deal of talk about 
transparency.
<P>
	Despite that fact, it has been clear from the outset that this 
government is committed to fairness and openness in 
government contracting. This government is determined to 
ensure that all contracting is undertaken in a manner that keeps 
the Canadian taxpayers informed, stimulates competitiveness 
and ensures that the process is open and fair.
<P>
	Treasury Board promulgates policies that are aimed 
specifically at these objectives. It clearly bears repeating that 
the information on the magnitude of the government contracting 
already exists and this government is making improvements to 
ensure even greater openness.
<P>
	In the meantime, the government encourages all suppliers and 
all members of Parliament to use the open bidding service that 
advertises upcoming opportunities to supply goods and 
services.
<P>
	With this system, information on current as well as past 
purchases is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to 
anyone and everyone who is interested. Suppliers no longer need 
to be included on a government source list. They no longer have 
to await an invitation to bid. They can review available 
opportunities in their product or service areas and order the 
required bid documents for those that they are interested in. 
Documents are forwarded immediately by fax, mail or courier.
<P>
	At the same time as we take measures to ensure open access to 
contracting information, every practical means must be brought 
to bear to reduce expenditures and ensure maximum value for 
each dollar spent. Members on both sides of the House have 
acknowledged the magnitude of the task of government 
purchasing. The federal government is Canada's largest user of 
private sector suppliers with more than 200,000 transactions per 
year. It buys everything from stationery to military equipment.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Members should bear in mind that by relying on program 
experts in the various departments the number of contracts that 
require the review of ministers is very small, consisting of large, 
risky or sensitive purchases. It is the task of Public Works and 
Government Services Canada to make many of these purchases 
on behalf of other departments. Nonetheless, close to half of all 
the contracts are awarded under the authority of individual 
departments.
<P>
	Yet despite this diversity of sources and despite the massive 
information already or shortly to be in the public domain, 
members opposite insist that the government should compile 
and publish separate detailed information. The additional cost 
of gathering and publishing such information would be a glaring 
extravagance that flies in the face of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	One hon. member has said that if research is necessary to 
compile the information, and I quote directly: ``Goodness, 
gracious, hire some researchers to do the job''. Another member 
has argued that since the cost would be such a small percentage 
of the total cost of government purchasing, it is reallynegligible.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6812"> 6812 </A></B>
<P>
	Is that responsible opposition and criticism? I do not think so. 
Is that legitimate concern for sound administration of public 
funds? Or is it perhaps the very kind of thinking, the very lack of 
respect for taxpayers' money that got us into our deficit 
difficulties in the first place?
<P>
	A good example of an inaccurate picture is the case of Saint 
John Shipbuilding and the patrol frigate program. A listing of 
contracts by constituency would show that contract in a New 
Brunswick riding but no less than $1.2 billion of the work will 
actually go to Quebec suppliers.
<P>
	An excellent example of misleading information is the case of 
the petroleum companies which bill all their government sales 
through their Ottawa offices. It represents hundreds of millions 
of dollars of business per year, none of which is supplied by 
Ottawa.
<P>
	In the end the government has to serve its clients and the 
public purse in the most effective and least expensive manner. 
Members on both sides of the House quite rightly insist that 
wherever feasible contracts should be competitive and should 
go to the lowest quality bidder.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(5)(a), I have been requested by the deputy government 
whip to defer the division until a later time. Accordingly, 
pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a) the division on the question

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have asked a question of the Minister of Transport, in 
fact the entire side, a number of times. I have asked the minister, 
I have asked the parliamentary secretary, I have even asked the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport. My question 
has been regarding the Pearson airport contract. If they think 
this is a bad deal we wanted to know what they thought was a 
good deal.
<P>
	In spite of asking all these different people, I have never 
received an answer. What I want to do for a moment is take a 
look at what is good and what is bad about this deal; first what is 
good, from my perspective, of course.
<P>
	It would have involved $740 million of private enterprise 
money going into the rebuilding of terminals 1 and 2 without 
any cost to the taxpayer. It would have created world class 
terminals at competitive and comparable rents for airlines. It 
would have had blended use of terminal 3 during the 
construction period, minimizing public disruption. There would 
have been a tremendous advantage to Air Canada and perhaps 
even Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	It would have created a new world class air terminal and 
would have provided enhanced economic and tourism benefits 
for central Canada without cost to the air industry in other parts 
of the country or the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Then there is the matter of jobs, jobs, jobs-the Liberal Party 
election cry. The Pearson development contract would have 
created 14,000 person years of construction employment and 
another 1,200 permanent new jobs in the new facilities.
<P>
	What is bad about this contract? According to the Liberals, 
this contract had no cancellation clause. What is interesting is 
that there was no cancellation clause for Terminal 3, for Vista

cargo terminals or for the Vancouver local airport authority. 
They claimed that it had limited bidding. The reality is that 
hundreds of contracts or requests for proposals were printed, 
dozens were picked up, and the fact that only a few were 
qualified to bid on it can hardly be deemed the responsibility or 
problem of the Pearson consortium.
<P>
	They claimed that the rate of return on investment was too 
high; the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce did not think so. 
It was one of the original investors but they dropped out because 
the rate of return dropped to less than 14 per cent, which they 
thought was too low for the degree of risk involved.
<P>
	They complained that the contract was signed during the 
election campaign. Most legal opinions agree that the actual 
binding date of the deal was August of 1993, before the election 
was called.
<P>
	A very selective censored review of terminals 1 and 2 
provided to Robert Nixon by the associate deputy minister and 
classified as secret, indicates the following: rate of return too 
high? The Pearson Development Corporation return on 
investment was endorsed as reasonable by both the Department 
of Finance and a government hired independent consultant. 
They claimed the crown was not getting a good return but the 
reality is this report said the crown's rate of return was 
considerably better than a crown construction option.
<P>
	I have to provide at this provide an apology because in my 
letter to the minister which I sent a week ago I claimed that his 
action was unprecedented. In actual fact, the War Measures Act 
in 1942 which saw the Japanese stripped of all their property, 
legislated payment and denied the right of appeal, sounds rather 
familiar.
<P>
	They claim that $445 million is the compensation sought. 
Court documents show no amount has been claimed, only the 
right to an arbitration tribunal.
<P>
	So far this is all my side. Is there a Liberal side? We do not 
know. We keep asking the question and they keep refusing to 
answer it. The question is, and I will ask it again for the fourth 
time, if this is a bad deal, what is a good deal, what are your 
alternatives?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure that is the 
question we are supposed to be debating tonight. I will try in my 
short two minutes to respond to the member's addendum to his 
question.
<P>
	First, the Liberal government's position is pretty clear. We 
cancelled the deal. Canadians obviously thought we made the 
right decision because they elected us in majority numbers; in 
fact 98 out of 99 Ontario seats, for the member's recollection.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister had given ample notice during the 
election that he wanted to review the deal to see where the public 
interest was. Once we were elected we put the public interest 
first and that was to cancel the deal as we had promised to do 
before the election. There is no question where the Liberal 
government stands. We think the deal was a bad deal for 
Canadians. We cancelled the deal.
<P>
	I find it incredible that the Reform Party is actually 
supporting the deal. The member knows because he is the 
transport critic that the standing committee held hearings on 
Bill C-22 and brought forth witnesses to discuss the pros and 
cons of the bill and the deal.
<P>
	It is unquestionable that the highest court in the land, 
Parliament, which is to determine public interest, has 
determined this was a bad deal. Courts may decide on the value 
of a contract cancelled or not; but the highest court in the land, 
Parliament of which the Reform Party speaks so highly each and 
every day, has the right to determine pubic interest.
<P>
	We are not standing still. We are moving through our national 
airports policy to make sure that Pearson is the flagship of our 
Canadian Airport Authority. The municipalities have named 
their representatives. The minister has announced the 
completion of the north-south runway to be used for safety 
reasons in inclement weather, not on a daily basis. We have been 
waiting for the appointments of the other members of the CAA 
so we can get on with building Pearson, spending the $740 
million, creating jobs and making sure that Pearson remains the 
world class facility it was supposed to be.
<P>
	We are committed not to waiting until 1998 as the member 
suggested in his original question but to getting on with building 
Pearson in the public interest as a non-profit organization called 
the Canadian Airport Authority. We would welcome the Reform 
Party's support of Bill C-22 and not it being allies with 
Conservative senators, which is also incredible.
<P>
	We hope to get on with building Pearson and have the support 
of the Reform Party in that regard.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
